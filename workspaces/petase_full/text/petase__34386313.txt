A cutinase-like enzyme from Saccharomonospora
viridis AHK190, Cut190, can depolymerize polyethylene
terephthalate (PET). As high activity at approximately
70°C is required for PET depolymerization, structure-
based protein engineering of Cut190 was carried out.
Crystal structure information of the Cut190 mutants
was used for protein engineering and for evaluating
the molecular basis of activity and thermal stability. A
variety of biophysical methods were employed to unveil
the mechanisms underlying the unique features of
Cut190, which included the regulation of its activity and
thermal stability by Ca 2+. Ca2+ association and dissocia‐
tion can change the enzyme conformation to regulate
catalytic activity. Weak metal-ion binding would be
required for the naïve conformational change of
Cut190, while maintaining its fluctuation,  to “switch”
the enzyme on and off.  The  activity of Cut190 is regu‐

while thermal stability is mainly regulated by binding to
another Site 2, where a disulfide  bond could be intro‐

Introduction
Cutinases belong to the lipase superfamily; these
enzymes can hydrolyze complex plant biopolymers in the
cutin (the cuticle layer of leaves) and various substrates,
such as lipids, waxes, and synthetic esters [1]. Owing to the
catalytic ability of ester bond hydrolysis, cutinases could be
used as biocatalysts for the bioconversion of chemical
compounds and degradation of polyethylene terephthalate
(PET) into its two environmentally benign monomers:
terephthalic acid and ethylene glycol [ 2]. PET has been
extensively used worldwide, and waste PET has caused
severe environmental problems. Chemical recycling of PET
is important for sustainable development goals (SDGs).
Enzymatic PET depolymerization is one of the most
attractive methods due to its low energy consumption
Enzymatic depolymerization of polyethylene terephthalate (PET) followed by recycling is an attractive method for solving severe environmental
problems worldwide. A cutinase-like enzyme, Cut190, is one such candidate enzymes, and engineered Cut190 mutants could catalyze substrates
around the PET glass transition temperature. Crystal structure analysis of the Cut190 mutants in the absence or presence of Ca 2+ and substrates
revealed the presence of “open, closed, engaged, and ejecting ” forms, which correspond to the respective conformations in the stages of
catalysis. This review focuses on the Ca2+-regulated structure-activity relationship of Cut190 and its applications.

compared to conventional processes using supercritical
fluids.  High thermal stability is required for enzymatic PET
depolymerization as the inner block of PET can only
access the enzyme above the glass transition temperature
(Tg) of approximately 70°C [ 3]. To our knowledge, at
present, only four cutinases are categorized as PET
hydrolases that significantly  degrade the main body
of PET into bis(hydroxyethyl)terephthalate (BHET),
mono(hydroxyethyl) terephthalate, (MHET) or terephthalic
acid [4].
A putative cutinase gene was cloned from the
thermophile Saccharomonospora viridis  AHK190, and its
protein, Cut190, which is comprised of the residues Gln45-
Asn307 (Fig. 1), was expressed in Escherichia coli  [5].
The  catalytic triad of Cut190, conserved in the lipase
superfamily, was identified  to include the residues Ser176,
Asp222 and His254. One of the unique features of Cut190
is that its catalytic function and thermal stability are
increased upon Ca 2+ binding. The  molecular mechanism of
Cut190 regulation by Ca2+ binding has been analyzed using
biophysical methods, including crystal structure and
thermodynamic analyses. Using protein engineering based
on structural information, such as “structure-based design”,
the thermal stability of Cut190 could be improved, in
addition to the increase of the catalytic activity, making it
possible to efficiently  depolymerize PET above 70°C.
Cut190 mutants
In the course of amino acid substitution on Cut190 to
increase its activity and stability, S226P and R228S
mutations were first  introduced [ 5]. The  Pro residue
corresponding to Ser226 in Cut190 is well conserved in
homologous sequences of cutinases, and this mutation in
Cut190 resulted in increased activity and thermal stability.
Based on the crystal structure of Cut190S226P mutant
described below, the mutation might break the hydrogen
bond of Ser226 with Thr221,  affecting  the activity and
thermal stability. As Arg228 in Cut190 is considered to
form a salt-bridge with acidic residues, which could
influence  the activity, a neutral amino acid substitution,
such as R228S mutation, was introduced. The  catalytic
activity of S226P/R228S mutant was 1.5-fold higher than
that of S226P mutant. Therefore,  the mutant S226P/R228S
designated as Cut190* was used as a template to introduce
further mutations to increase its activity and thermal
stability (Table 1) [ 6–8]. Upon the S176A mutation on
Cut190*, no activity was observed even at a concentration
20-fold higher than that of Cut190*. Ser176 was
determined to be the catalytic residue, as expected from the
catalytic triad described above.
Because the crystal structures of Cut190 S226P and
Cut190* mutants have been determined, they could be used
as templates to generate Cut190 mutants with a “structure-
based design”. Mutation studies were carried out not only
to increase activity and thermal stability, but also to
determine the role of each residue. Using the crystal
structures of Cut190 S226P in Ca 2+-bound and -unbound
states, the model structures in complex with PET-like
substrates were built, and the residues were selected to
analyze their effects  on catalytic activity and thermal
stability [ 9]. In this strategy, the mutation sites were
classified  into three groups: (i) vicinity of the oxyanion
hole, resulting in a decrease in the activation energy needed
for catalysis, (ii) vicinity of the catalytic triad, and (iii)
amino acids presumably interacting with the Ca 2+-bound
form, but not with the Ca 2+-unbound form. For example,
the F106A mutation in group (i) decreased the activity,
while the F106Y mutation retained its activity, indicating
that the aromatic residue at 106 is indispensable for
hydrophobic interactions with the substrate. We found that
mutation at Gln138 had strong effects;  Q138A mutation
contributed to increased enzymatic activity, while Q138L

straight lines, respectively.

mutation caused loss of activity, which could be a
consequence of the additional space for the substrate
generated by the mutation. The  Q138A mutation resulted
in decreased Km and increased kcat toward the aliphatic
substrate, poly(butylene succinate-co-adipate) (PBSA),
resulting in an approximately 4-fold increase in kcat/Km
[10]. The  activity was spectrophotometrically measured by
monitoring the decrease in the turbidity of PBSA incubated
with the enzyme at 37°C for 30 min. More precise analysis
using HPLC showed that the main product of BHET
catalyzed by Cut190* was MHET, possibly due to the low
binding affinity  of MHET [11].
Because Asn and Gln are prone to deamidation, leading
to protein instability [ 12], surface Asn and Gln of Cut190*
were mutated to other amino acids [ 10]. Among them, the
most significant  effect  was observed in the N202H
mutation; the Tm of Cut190*N202H was 6.5°C higher than
that of Cut190*. Based on the crystal structures of Cut190*
mutants described below, the salt bridge of His202 with
Glu184 would contribute to the increased thermal stability.
It should also be noted in Cut190*Q123H that the activity,
kcat/Km, was increased by approximately 1.5-fold with an
increased Tm of 2.7°C. Both Gln123 and Asn202 are
replaced with histidine in other homologous cutinases [10].
It is well known that disulfide  bonds could contribute
to increased protein stability [ 13]. However, increasing
stability by mutations could result in significantly 
decreased activity in many cases, mainly because the naïve
conformational change, including fluctuation,  would be
critical for activity [14]. In Cut190, Asp250 and Glu296 are
located close to each other, and the Cys substitutions form a
disulfide  bond, which was confirmed  by crystal structure
analysis [ 6]. Upon mutation, Tm increased by 23°C [ 10].
Notably, the catalytic activity toward PBSA at 37°C upon
the D250C/E296C mutation was almost unchanged.
Altogether with other mutations that contribute to the
increased activity and thermal stability, the mutant Q138A/
D250C-E296C/Q123H/N202H/S226P/R228S, designated
as Cut190*SS, was generated (Fig. 1), showing that Tm was
30°C higher than that of Cut190* (Table 1). Although the
activity of Cut190*SS toward PBSA at 37°C was similar to
that of Cut190*, the residual activity after incubating the

enzyme at 70°C was significantly  enhanced [ 6,10]. The 
residual activities of Cut190* and Cut190*SS after
incubation at 70°C for 2 h were approximately 10% and
95% relative to the activity without incubation, respectively
[6]. These  results strongly indicate that Cut190*SS is a
promising candidate for PET degradation.
Crystal structure
In the series of structural analysis of Cut190 and its
mutants, the crystal structures of the Cut190S226P mutant
in the absence or presence of Ca 2+ were first  determined
to 1.45 Å and 1.75 Å resolutions, respectively [PDB ID:
4WFI], [PDB ID: 4WFJ], [PDB ID: 4WFK] [ 15]. The 
enzyme was found to adopt a classical α/β hydrolase
fold, which was comprised of a central twisted β-sheet of
nine β-strands ( β1-β9) and six α-helices (α2, α3, α5-α 8),
together with additional short helices, two α-helices ( α1
and α4) and two 3 10-helices ( η1 and η2) (Fig. 2A). Three 
catalytic residues, Ser176, Asp222, and His254, were
located on the β5-α5, β7-α6, and β8-α7 loops, respectively.
In the presence of Ca 2+, only one Ca 2+ ion was observed in
the β1-β2 loop. Upon Ca 2+ binding, a large conformational
change was observed in the three loops: β1-β2, β3-α2,
and β4-α3 (Figs. 2B and 2C). Phe106 in the β3-α2 loop
maintained the open conformation and formed an oxyanion
hole. Ca2+ binding created an open space in the substrate-
binding groove, which allowed the substrate to bind easily.
Overall, Ca2+ binding could change the enzyme conforma‐
tion from the “closed form” to the “open form”.
To determine the complex structure with a substrate,
an inactive mutant of Cut190*, Cut190*S176A, was
crystallized [ 16]. Complexes with either monoethyl
succinate or monoethyl adipate were successfully prepared
by employing soaking methods, and the crystal structures
were determined to 1.34 Å and 1.40 Å resolutions,
respectively [PDB ID: 5ZRR], [PDB ID: 5ZRS]. Without
substrates, the crystal structures complexed with metal-
ions, only Ca 2+ and a mixture of Ca 2+ and Zn 2+, were also
determined to 1.60 Å and 1.12 Å resolutions, respectively
[PDB ID: 5ZNO], [PDB ID: 5ZRQ]. In contrast to the
crystal structures of Cut190S226P [ 15], multiple metal-ion
binding sites were observed. Together with the results of
native mass spectrometry analysis for Ca 2+ binding to
Cut190*S176A in solution, three Ca 2+ binding sites, Sites
1-3, were confirmed.  At Site 1, Ca2+ was coordinated by the
main chain carbonyls of Ser76, Ala78, and Phe81, and
three water molecules, as observed in the structure of
Cut190S226P [15]. At Site 2, Ca 2+ was coordinated by the
side chain carbonyls of Glu220, Asp250, and Glu296. At
Site 3, Ca 2+ was coordinated by the side chains of Asp204
and Thr206  and the main chain carbonyl of Thr206.  In some
crystal structures, Zn2+ ions were observed at Sites 2 and 3,
possibly because Zn 2+ was included in the crystallizing
solution and its binding affinity  to the enzyme was higher
than that of Ca 2+, as described below. In the absence of
substrates, the crystal structure of Cut190*S176A with
Ca2+ and Zn2+ adopted an “open form ”, similar to that of
Cut190S226P. The  crystal structure in complex with

monoethyl succinate demonstrated that the ester group of
the substrate was located adjacent to Ala176, which was
mutated from Ser176, the catalytic residue in the wild-type,
and the carbonyl group of the ester was placed at the
oxyanion hole contributed by the main chains of Phe106
and Met177 (Fig. 2B). Conformational changes were
observed in the β3-α2 and β4-α3 loops (Fig. 2B). In the
β3-α2 loop, Thr107  moved to the vicinity of the ester
group and formed a hydrogen bond to stabilize the bound
substrate. The  results indicated that the structure
corresponded to the pre-reaction state of the enzyme. The 
structure was different  from either the “closed form” or the
“open form ”, and was designated as the “engaged form ”.
Notably, no metal-ions, neither Ca2+ or Zn2+, were observed
at Site 1, while Zn 2+ ions were observed at Sites 2 and 3,
indicating that substrate binding causes the release of
Ca2+ at Site 1. The  conformation of the β1-β2 loop in the
engaged form was similar to that in the closed form, and
the conformational changes in the β3-α2 and β4-α3 loops
would be sufficient  to accommodate and hydrolyze the
substrate. In contrast, the crystal structure in complex with
monoethyl adipate showed that the ester group of the
substrate was located on the opposite side of the active site,
and the oxygen atoms of the carboxyl group were located at
the oxyanion hole and with His254 in a hydrogen bond,
respectively. The  results indicated that the structure
corresponded to the post-reaction state of the enzyme. The 
structure was similar to the open form, and Ca 2+ was
observed to bind at Site 1.
In addition to the closed, open, and engaged forms,
an “ejecting form ” was observed in the crystal structure
of Cut190**S176A, in which C-terminal 3 residues of
Cut190*S176A were deleted (Fig. 1), in complex with
Ca2+, determined to a resolution of 1.09 Å [PDB ID: 7CEH]
[17]. Ca2+ ions were observed at Sites 2 and 3, but not at
Site 1. In the open form (Ca2+ at Site 1), Phe81 in the β1-β2
loop showed an inward conformation. In the closed and
engaged forms (no Ca 2+ at Site 1), Phe81 showed an
outward conformation and Phe77 showed an inward
conformation instead of Phe81 (Fig. 2C). The  structure in
ejecting form (no Ca 2+ at Site 1) exhibited the inward
conformation of Phe81. Because the ejecting form is
similar to the closed form at the active site, substrate
incompatible conformation, and like the open form at Site
1, the structure would be an intermediate during the
turnover from the product release to re-activate for the next
round of the reaction cycle.
The  four observed structures are snapshot structures of
Cut190 in solution, indicating the enzyme undergoes
structural changes upon binding of Ca 2+ and the substrate
and the subsequent catalysis. This  motion was supported
by analyses using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations
[16]. The  closed and open forms were also observed in
the crystal structures of Cut190**, Cut190*SS, and
Cut190*SS_S176A, determined to 1.60 Å, 1.20 Å, and
1.10 Å resolutions, respectively [PDB ID: 7CEF], [ PDB
ID: 7CTR], [PDB ID: 7CTS] [ 6,17]. In Cut190**, the
asymmetric unit contained two molecules, and, surprisingly,
one showed an open form, whereas the other showed a
closed form. Zn 2+ ions contained in the crystallization
conditions were observed at Sites 2 and 3 in both
molecules, while Ca 2+ was only observed at Site 1 in the
open form. The  enzyme would fluctuate  in solution,
changing its form and possibly changing the population of
the respective forms upon the association and dissociation
of Ca 2+. The  crystal structure may correspond to the most
populated structure in solution. The  supplementary movie
shows the enzymatic reaction process via the obtained
coarse snapshots (Supplementary Movie S1).
Metal-ion binding
As described above, the catalytic activity and thermal
stability of Cut190 and its mutants increased upon Ca 2+
binding. Analysis of the crystal structures strongly
indicated that Ca 2+ bound to multiple sites of Cut190 and
induced a conformational change. In addition to the
binding, Ca2+ dissociation from the enzyme could regulate
the cycling of its catalytic function [ 16]. Moreover, other
metal ions can bind to Cut190 and increase its activity and
thermal stability. Metal-binding analysis using isothermal
titration calorimetry (ITC) revealed endothermic heats
for Zn 2+, Mn2+, and Mg 2+ binding (Fig. 3). The  binding
affinities  of Zn2+ and Mn2+ were approximately one order of
magnitude higher than that of Mg 2+ [7]. In contrast, little
heat upon Ca 2+ binding was observed (Fig. 3D), possibly
due to the weak binding affinity  with a small binding
enthalpy change. Notably, the binding stoichiometry of
Zn2+ was approximately 3, while that of Mn2+ and Mg2+ was
approximately 1. As determined by the crystal structure and
native mass spectrometry analyses, three binding sites,
Sites 1–3, existed, which was in good agreement with the
stoichiometry of Zn 2+. 3D Reference Interaction Site
Model (RISM) calculations also supported the multivalent
metal-ion binding sites and further indicated the order of
binding affinity  at each site: Site 2>Site 3>Site 1 [ 16]. The 
occupancy values in RISM calculations also indicated that
the binding affinities  of Mn 2+ and Zn 2+ were higher than
that of Ca2+ [7]. Altogether, Mn2+ and Mg2+ might be able to
bind to Site 2 with high affinity ,  enabling the heat
observable in ITC, and bind to other sites with low affinity . 
The  catalytic activity of Cut190 would largely depend on
the metal-ion binding affinity ,  especially at Site 1. The 
activities of Cut190* toward PBSA in the presence of
0.25 mM Mn2+ and 2.5 mM Mg 2+ were approximately 90%
and 40% of that in the presence of 2.5 mM Ca 2+,
respectively, whereas that in the presence of Zn 2+ was
markedly lower [ 7]. The  results indicated that the order
172 Biophysics and Physicobiology V ol. 18
of binding affinity  at Site 1 was Ca2+<Mg2+<Mn2+<Zn2+.
ITC experiments revealed no binding heats of metal
ions, even Zn2+, for Cut190*SS and Cut190*SS_S176A, in
which disulfide  bonds were introduced at residues 250 and
296, close to Site 2 [ 6]. Upon mutation, not only Site 2,
but also other metal-binding sites would be perturbed for
metal binding. The  crystal structures of Cut190*SS and
Cut190*SS_S176A showed no metal ions at Sites 2 and 3.
Similar to Cut190*, the catalytic activity of Cut190*SS was
observed in the presence of metal ions, indicating that the
weak metal-ion binding at Site 1 was preserved. This  is also
supported by the crystal structure of Cut190*SS_S176A
(open form), in which Ca 2+ binding was only observed at
Site 1. The  activity gradually increased, depending on the
Ca2+ concentration, and was the highest under 5 mM Ca 2+,
which was markedly higher than that in the presence of
Zn2+ or Mn2+ [6].
The  importance of weak metal-ion binding for enzyme
function was also reported in the case of ribonuclease H
[18], and the Mg 2+ binding sites on ribonuclease H remain
controversial [ 19]. Similar to the case of Ca 2+ binding to
Cut190, ribonuclease H of human immunodeficiency  virus
binds to Mg 2+ weakly, much weaker than Mn 2+ and Zn 2+.
Zn2+ at low concentration catalyzes the activity of
ribonuclease H similar to Mg 2+, while Zn 2+ at high
concentration inhibits the activity [ 20]. The  weak binders
would be advantageous to regulate enzyme activity; meal
ions could associate and dissociate from enzyme to
“switch” the activity on and off.  Further, the enzyme
conformation could gradually change while maintaining
proper fluctuation.  More precise and innovative analyses,
such as single-molecule analysis, will provide more details
on the enzyme structure-activity relationship and the role of
weak metal-ion binding.
Folding thermodynamics
Thermal  stability was determined using circular
dichroism (CD) and differential  scanning calorimetry
(DSC) experiments, which detect changes in the secondary
structure and heat capacity upon the transition, respectively.
Although the thermal transition of Cut190 and its mutants
was irreversible, the folding thermodynamics were
determined using a fitting  procedure, assuming a two-state
transition between folded and unfolded states. The  thermal
stability of Cut190*S176A increased as Ca 2+ concentration
increased (Table 1), mainly due to the more favorable
enthalpy change [8]. The  MD simulations of both the Ca 2+-
unbound and Ca 2+-bound structures supported the notion
that Ca 2+ binding to Cut190*S176A increased the thermal
stability by increasing enthalpy change and decreasing
entropy change, which might be due to the increase in
intramolecular interactions and the decrease in structural
flexibility .  In the presence of other metal ions, Zn 2+, Mn2+,
and Mg2+, the thermal stability of Cut190*S176A increased
in the concentration range lower than Ca 2+ (Table 1). The 
respective thermal stabilities in the presence of 0.25 mM
metal ions were ordered as Mg 2+<Ca2+<Mn2+<Zn2+, while
those in the presence of 25 mM metals were ordered as
Mg2+<Mn2+<Ca2+. In the presence of 25 mM Zn 2+,

Cut190*S176A became aggregated. Taken together with
the results of the metal-binding affinity  assay described
above, a strong binder would increase the intramolecular
interactions at low concentrations, resulting in increased
thermal stability, and would increase them too much at high
concentrations, resulting in aggregation.
Upon deletion of the C-terminal 3 residues of
Cut190*S176A, the thermal stability increased, mainly
because of the favorable entropy change [ 17]. One possible
explanation for this is the decreased fluctuation  in the
unfolded state. Another explanation is the multiple states
that exist in the folded state. This  might align with the
observation that the asymmetric unit in the crystal structure
of Cut190** contained two molecules, one in an open form
and the other in a closed form, as described above. The 
thermal stability of Cut190**S176A was higher than that of
Cut190**, similar to the case of Cut190*SS_S176A and
Cut190*SS [6]. This  would be mainly due to the salt bridge
between Ser176 and His254 in the catalytic triad. Among
the mutants analyzed so far, Cut190*SS, whose Tm in the
absence of metal ion was 82°C and increased up to 85°C in
the presence of 25 mM Ca 2+, was the most stable. This 
Ca2+-dependent increase in thermal stability supported the
notion that Ca 2+ could bind to Cut190*SS and regulate its
function, despite no metal-ion binding being observed in
ITC. 3D-RISM calculations indicated that the binding
affinity  at Site 1 was almost unchanged, while those at Sites
2 and 3 were reduced due to the mutations directly made to
Site 2 (D250C and E296C) and the mutation of a residue
near Site 3 (N202H). The  disulfide-bond  introduction
between the residues at 250 and 296 would largely
contribute to increased thermal stability, possibly similar to
the effects  of metal-ion binding at Site 2 of the enzyme
without the disulfide  bond. The  introduction of disulfide 
bonds to the corresponding site was also reported in
mutants of the related enzyme, leaf-branch compost
cutinase (LCC) [21].
Application
PET depolymerization by enzymes and their subsequent
recycling have been investigated worldwide for SDGs and
severe environmental problems. Tournier et al.  reported
that LCC mutants could be used to recycle all types of PET
waste [21]. LCC was first  cloned from a fosmid library of a
leaf-branch compost metagenome by Kanaya ’s group [ 22],
and the crystal structure was subsequently determined [ 23].
The  Tm value of LCC wild-type was 85°C, and that of the
mutant with the disulfide-bond  introduction increased to
94°C. The  overall crystal structures of LCC mutants were
similar to those of Cut190 mutants [PDB ID: 6THT ],
[PDB ID: 6THS ] (Fig. 4). In the β1-β2 loop region at
Site 1, the enzymes related to LCC were found to be one
residue longer than Cut190. The  insertion of Ser into
Cut190* at this site resulted in expressing the activity
even in the absence of Ca 2+ [10]. Tournier et al.  showed
that LCC mutant Y127G/D238C/F243W/S283C ultimately
achieved a Tm of 98°C and 90% PET depolymerization
into monomers over a 10 h reaction [ 21]. Because the
corresponding residues in Cut190* are Q138A/D250C/
F255/E296C, the mutations of Q138G and F255W in
Cut190*SS might increase the activity and thermal
stability. They  also showed that the reaction temperature
could be increased to 72°C to maximize kinetic turnover,
because PET was largely recrystallized above 75°C. The 
low crystallinity of PET is also critical for efficient  PET
depolymerization. Miyamoto ’s group reported that the
addition of anionic surfactants was effective  at inducing
efficient  PET depolymerization by a cationic PET hydrolase
identified  from Ideonella sakaiensis  [24,25]. The  reaction
was also effective  under high pressure [11].
The  economics of enzymatic processing is of the utmost
importance when considering the industrial applications
of PET recycling. Although engineered proteins have
been considered inappropriate as pharmaceuticals, mainly
because of costs, numerous protein pharmaceuticals, such
as antibody drugs, have been used recently. Challenging the
goal of PET recycling using enzymes is important and
contributes to basic science in a wide range of fields,  such
as protein chemistry and polymer chemistry.
