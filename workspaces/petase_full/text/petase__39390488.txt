production of a polyethylene terephthalate 
degrading cutinase by Corynebacterium 
glutamicum and leaky Escherichia coli in batch 
and fed-batch processes

Abstract 
Background With a growing global population, the generation of plastic waste and the depletion of fossil resources 
are major concerns that need to be addressed by developing sustainable and efficient plastic recycling methods. Bio-
catalytic recycling is emerging as a promising ecological alternative to conventional processes, particularly in the recy-
cling of polyethylene terephthalate (PET). However, cost-effective production of the involved biocatalyst is essential 
for the transition of enzymatic PET recycling to a widely used industrial technology. Extracellular enzyme production 
using established organisms such as Escherichia coli or Corynebacterium glutamicum offers a promising way to reduce 
downstream processing costs.
Results In this study, we compared extracellular recombinant protein production by classical secretion in C. glu-
tamicum and by membrane leakage in E. coli. A superior extracellular release of the cutinase ICCG DAQI was observed 
with E. coli in batch and fed-batch processes on a litre-scale. This phenomenon in E. coli, in the absence of a signal 
peptide, might be associated with membrane-destabilizing catalytic properties of the expressed cutinase. Optimi-
sations regarding induction, expression temperature and duration as well as carbon source significantly enhanced 
extracellular cutinase activity. In particular, in fed-batch cultivation of E. coli at 30 °C with lactose as carbon source 
and inducer, a remarkable extracellular activity (137 U  mL−1) and cutinase titre (660 mg  L−1) were achieved after 48 h. 
Literature values obtained with other secretory organisms, such as Bacillus subtilis or Komagataella phaffii were 
clearly outperformed. The extracellular ICCG DAQI produced showed high efficacy in the hydrolysis of PET textile 
fibres, either chromatographically purified or unpurified as culture supernatant. In less than 18 h, 10 g  L−1 substrate 
was hydrolysed using supernatant containing 3 mg cutinase ICCG DAQI at 70 °C, pH 9 with terephthalic acid yields 
of up to 97.8%.
Conclusion Extracellular production can reduce the cost of recombinant proteins by simplifying downstream 
processing. In the case of the PET-hydrolysing cutinase ICCG DAQI, it was even possible to avoid chromatographic 
purification and still achieve efficient PET hydrolysis. With such production approaches and their further optimisation,

Background
In today’s world, the widespread use of plastics such as 
polyethylene terephthalate (PET) is a symbol of both 
human innovation and convenience. Unfortunately, this 
convenience comes at a substantial environmental cost, 
as PET’s exceptional durability leads to persistent accu -
mulation in the environment, threatening global ecosys -
tems [1, 2]. However, it is precisely this high chemical, 
physical and biological resistance, along with properties 
such as excellent strength-to-weight ratio, transparency 
and low production costs, that has led to the widespread 
use of PET, including disposable packaging and durable 
textile materials [3, 4]. Fortunately, enzymatic PET recy -
cling emerged as a biotechnological answer to the search 
for a degradation process from PET to the recyclable 
monomers—terephthalic acid and ethylene glycol. Now -
adays, a variety of PET-hydrolysing enzymes are known 
from a large number of organisms that already have 
naturally good or engineered properties in terms of cata -
lytic activity and stability [5–9]. This, together with the 
optimisation of reaction conditions, now enables com -
plete hydrolysis of post-industrial or post-consumer PET 
materials in less than 24 h, and efforts are underway for 
large-scale industrial applications [9, 10]. However, chal-
lenges remain in the efficient production of the involved 
biocatalysts, with downstream processing being a signifi -
cant limitation, accounting for 50–70% of the total costs 
of most large-scale bioprocesses [11–13]. Therefore, 
the development of cost-effective expression systems is 
essential to meet the growing demand for PET degrad -
ing enzymes and to enable competitiveness with other 
plastics recycling methods. For instance, the use of pro -
tein secreting organisms can be a promising approach to 
minimise the costs and losses associated with cell disrup -
tion and subsequent processing. Certain organisms, such 
as Ideonella sakaiensis producing PETase and MHETase, 
naturally secrete PET degrading enzymes, though at low 
levels [14, 15]. So far, extracellular recombinant expres -
sion of cutinases has been successfully demonstrated 
in various expression systems. In Bacillus subtilis and 
Komagataella phaffii, secretion systems using differ -
ent signal peptides have been effectively used to secrete 
cutinases to the extracellular environment [16, 17]. Also 
C. glutamicum is commonly used in combination with a 
variety of possible signal peptides to secrete recombinant 
cutinases via the Sec or Tat secretion pathway [18–20]. 
In Escherichia coli, extracellular release of cutinases has 
been observed both with and without the use of signal 
peptides without a targeted secretion pathway, presum -
ably caused by a destabilization of membrane integrity 
[21–23]. In addition, whole-cell biocatalysis approaches 
have been developed that combine cell growth, extracel -
lular production of cutinases and PET degradation into a 
single process [24]. However, a cost-effective extracellular 
production process for PET-degrading cutinase requires 
a high amount of the enzyme being released into the 
culture supernatant. In earlier studies, Su  et  al. showed 
a significant improvement in cell growth and especially 
in the extracellular production of a T.  fusca cutinase in 
E.  coli by optimising the cultivation conditions and the 
induction strategy [25]. Consequently, this work focused 
on the optimisation of the extracellular recombinant pro-
duction of a leaf branch compost cutinase (LCC) [26]-
based variant in E. coli and C. glutamicum. The selected 
cutinase variant, ICCG DAQI, evolved from the thermosta-
bilized ICCG variant [27], has shown improved efficiency 
in the degradation of polyester fibres [10]. For expression 
in C.  glutamicum, ICCG DAQI was combined with dif -
ferent signal peptides from B.  subtilis [20], whereas no 
signal peptide was used for expression in E.  coli. Extra -
cellular release was assessed by esterase activity using 
different nitrophenolic substrates to ensure comparabil -
ity with other studies, and was compared between the 
two expression organisms. By optimising the cultivation 
conditions, including temperature and cultivation mode 
in the bioreactor, the bacterial growth of E.  coli and 
thus the recombinant expression of the cutinase should 
be improved. Subsequently, the need for purification of 
extracellular cutinase was investigated by evaluating the 
suitability of ICCG DAQI-containing culture supernatants 
for direct hydrolysis of textile PET materials.
Materials and methods
Materials
Analytical grade salts, titrants and components for 
bacterial cell culture were obtained from Carl Roth 
GmbH (Karlsruhe, Germany). The casein enzymatic 
hydrolysate N-Z-Amine ® was purchased from Merck 
Millipore (Billerica, MA). Enzymes used for molecu -
lar cloning were from New England Biolabs (Ipswich, 
MA). The chromogenic substrate p-nitrophenyl acetate 
(pNPA) was purchased from Thermo Fisher Scientific 
enzymatic recycling of PET can contribute to a more efficient and environmentally friendly solution to the industrial 
recycling of plastics in the future.

(Waltham, MA), while p-nitrophenol butyrate (pNPB) 
and p-nitrophenyl palmitate (pNPP) were acquired 
from Sigma Aldrich (St.  Louis, MO). Post-industrial 
PET fibres (glass transition temperature = 74.2 °C, crys -
tallinity = 9%, specific surface area = 0.21   m2  g−1) were 
provided by Gneuss Kunststofftechnik (Bad Oeyn -
hausen, Germany) [10].
Plasmids and bacterial strains
For expression in C.  glutamicum (DSM  20300, Leibniz 
Institute DSMZ-German Collection of Microorganisms 
and Cell Cultures GmbH) [28] the gene sequence of the 
cutinase variant (ICCG DAQI) [10] used in this work was 
cloned into the pEKEx2 vector using E. coli DH5α MCR 
cells [29]. The genes encoding several signal peptides 
(AmyE, AprE, LipA, LipB, NprE, YpjP , YwmC) originally 
from B.  subtilis were cloned N-terminally for secretion 
[19, 20, 30]. For expression in E. coli, the pET26b-ICCG 
DAQI construct, cloned via the NdeI and XhoI restriction 
sites, was transformed into BL21 (DE3) cells.
Cultivation media
Corynebacterium  glutamicum was cultivated in tryptic 
soy broth (TSB) medium (DSM  545, Leibniz Institute 
DSMZ-German Collection of Microorganisms and Cell 
Cultures GmbH), while general cultivation of E. coli was 
carried out in lysogeny broth (LB) medium (Table  S1). 
For cultivation on plates, 15 g   L−1 agar was added to the 
medium. For protein expression, either the respective 
medium with isopropyl-β-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside 
(IPTG) induction (C. glutamicum, E. coli) or autoinduc -
tion medium (E.  coli) was used. For autoinduction, dif -
ferent types of autoinduction medium based on Studier 
(2005) [31] were used (Table S1).
Cultivation in shake flasks
For seed cultures, 20 mL LB (E. coli) or TSB (C. glutami -
cum) medium with 50  µg   mL−1 kanamycin was inocu -
lated with a colony from a freshly streaked agar plate. 
This seed culture was incubated for approx. 14  h at 
30 °C (C. glutamicum) or 37 °C (E. coli) with shaking at 
180 rpm. The seed culture was used to inoculate 100 mL 
medium in 500 mL baffled shake flasks to an optical den -
sity at 600  nm  (OD600) of 0.1. When protein expression 
was induced with IPTG in E.  coli and C.  glutamicum, 
100 µM IPTG was added when an  OD600 of 0.6–0.8 was 
reached. The cultures were grown for 24  h at 120  rpm 
(50 mm shaking throw, Infors-HT, Bottmingen, Switzer -
land) at an expression temperature of 20 °C for E. coli and 
30 °C for C. glutamicum.
Batch and fed‑batch cultivation of E. coli in stirred‑tank 
bioreactors
Cultivation of E. coli for expression of the target protein 
was performed in 2 L stirred-tank reactors (Getinge AB, 
Göteborg, Sweden) equipped with two 6-bladed Rushton 
turbine impellers. The basic components of LB or auto -
induction medium were autoclaved together with the 
reactor periphery. Additives were added to the medium 
under sterile conditions after autoclaving (Table  S1). 
For precultures 20  mL LB medium in a 100  mL flask 
was inoculated with a colony from a freshly streaked 
agar plate. This seed culture was incubated for approx. 
14  h at 37  °C and shaken at 180  rpm and then used to 
inoculate 1  L of medium to an  OD600 of 0.01. The pH 
was maintained constant at 6.9 by automatic addition of 
2 M HCl and 2 M NaOH. Antifoam B emulsion (Sigma 
Aldrich, St.  Louis, MO) was automatically added when 
foam came into contact with the foam sensor. Dissolved 
oxygen was maintained above a minimum of 20% satu -
ration during the batch phase and 60% saturation during 
the feed phase, with the stirrer speed automatically con -
trolled between 300 and 1000  rpm to ensure sufficient 
oxygen input (compressed air, 4  L   min−1). After an ini -
tial growth phase at 37  °C, the expression temperatures 
were set to 20 or 30  °C. When protein expression was 
induced with IPTG, 100  µM IPTG was added when an 
 OD600 of 0.6–0.8 (early induction) or 3 (late induction) 
was reached and the temperature was lowered to the 
corresponding expression temperature. For autoinduc -
tion, the temperature was set to the target value when an 
 OD600 of 1 was reached. Samples were taken periodically 
during cultivation for analysis of biomass growth and 
sugars and determination of extracellular cutinase activ -
ity. In pulsed batch mode, sterile solutions of glycerol 
(20 mL, 250 g   L−1) and lactose (20 mL, 100 g   L−1) were 
added twice during the exponential growth phase, while 
during stationary growth lactose (20 mL, 100 g   L−1) was 
added repeatedly. In fed-batch cultivations, sterile fil -
tered lactose solution at a concentration of 100 g  L−1 sup-
plemented with 200 µg   mL−1 kanamycin served as feed. 
A specific growth rate (μ) of 0.1   h−1 and yield coefficient 
 (YX/S) of 0.45   gCDW  gglucose
−1 were used to determine the 
exponential feeding rate [32, 33]. Feeding started when 
the  OD600 was 3, with exponential feeding sustained for 
20  h. The feeding rate reached at 20  h was then main -
tained for further 20 h.
Batch cultivation of C. glutamicum in stirred‑tank 
bioreactors
The cultivation of C.  glutamicum in stirred-tank bio -
reactors was carried out similarly to the batch mode 
for E.  coli. TSB medium was autoclaved along with the 
Page 4 of 16Fritzsche et al. Microbial Cell Factories          (2024) 23:274 
reactor periphery, with additives added under sterile 
conditions prior to the start of cultivation. For the seed 
culture, 20 mL TSB medium in a 100 mL flask was inocu-
lated with a colony and incubated at 30 °C for 24 h. The 
seed culture was then used to inoculate the medium in 
the reactor with a starting  OD600 of 0.05. The cultiva -
tion temperature was kept constant at 30 °C. For protein 
expression, 100 µM IPTG was added when an  OD600 of 
0.6–0.8 was reached.
Bis–Tris polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis
For polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) discon -
tinuous Bis–Tris gels with a 4% (w/v) stacking gel and 
a 15% (w/v) separating gel were used [34]. Prior to use, 
samples were diluted in 4 × NuPAGE LDS sample buffer 
(Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) and denatured 
at 95  °C for 15  min. Gel electrophoresis was performed 
under reducing, denaturing conditions at 35 mA per gel 
using 2-(N-morpholino)ethanesulfonic acid (MES) buffer 
(1x) supplemented with 500 µL 1 M sodium bisulfite as 
reducing agent. Protein size was determined using the 
Precision Plus Protein Standard Dual Colour (Bio-Rad, 
Hercules, CA). For Coomassie Blue staining the gels were 
microwaved with Coomassie R250 (0.04% (w/v), 10% 
methanol, 10% acetic acid) and incubated 15 min at room 
temperature. Destaining was done overnight for approx. 
16 h with 10% acetic acid. Gels were documented using 
a gel documentation system (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA). 
The molecular weight of the target protein was calculated 
using ImageJ and compared with the theoretical molecu -
lar weight obtained from ProtParam (ExPASy) [35, 36]. 
Densitometric analysis using ImageJ was used to deter -
mine protein purity [35].
Optical density and cell dry weight
To determine the  OD600, the bacterial suspension was 
diluted in triplicate with 0.9% (w/v) NaCl to match the 
linear range of the photometer and transferred to 10 mm 
polystyrene cuvettes. The absorbance was then meas -
ured using a photometer (Implen, Munich, Germany) at 
a wavelength of 600 nm.
As various factors can affect the measured optical den -
sity when cultivating E.  coli, especially when expressing 
recombinant proteins, the cell dry weight (CDW) was 
also determined. CDW was determined gravimetrically 
by drying 2 mL reaction tubes (Eppendorf) at 60 °C for 
at least 24  h. The preweighed reaction tubes were filled 
with 2 mL cell suspension and centrifuged at 10,000 g for 
10 min. The supernatant was discarded and the cell pel -
lets were dried at 60 °C for at least 24 h. The tubes were 
weighed again and the CDW in g   L−1 was calculated 
from the difference in weight between the initial and final 
values.
Colony forming units and plasmid stability
For the determination of colony forming units (CFU), 
samples were diluted with sterile 0.9% (w/v) NaCl. 100 µL 
were then plated on agar plates and incubated overnight 
at the appropriate temperature. The number of colonies 
per plate was counted and the CFU per mL calculated.
To analyse plasmid stability, samples were diluted to 
obtain between 10 and 200 colonies per plate and 100 µL 
were plated on agar plates with kanamycin (50 µg   mL−1) 
and without. After overnight incubation, the colonies 
were counted and the fraction of plasmid-bearing cells 
was determined from the ratio of CFU on the kanamycin 
and non-kanamycin containing plates.
Membrane integrity assay
The determination of membrane integrity using the fluo -
rescent dyes 4′,6-diamidin-2-phenylindol (DAPI) and 
propidium iodide (PI) is described in detail in the supple-
mentary information.
Chromatographic analysis of sugars
High performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) 
measurements were performed using an Aminex HPX-
87H column (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) in a Shimadzu 
HPLC system (Kyoto, Japan). The flow rate was set to 
0.6  mL   min−1 at 65  °C using 5  mM  H2SO4 as mobile 
phase. 20 µL of homogenized and filtered (PTFE) samples 
were injected for analysis. Identification and quantifica -
tion of glucose, lactose and glycerol by a refractive index 
detector (RID) were performed by corresponding stand -
ard curves. The retention times for lactose, glucose and 
glycerol were 7.5 min, 8.9 min, and 13.1 min, respectively.
Cutinase activity assay
Various nitrophenol substrates—pNPA, pNPB and 
pNPP—were used for the spectrophotometric deter -
mination of the extracellular esterase activity to ensure 
comparability with the literature where different sub -
strates are commonly reported. Substrate stock solutions 
of pNPA, pNPB and pNPP were prepared in acetonitrile 
(pNPA) or isopropanol (pNPB and pNPP), respectively. 
The appropriately diluted culture supernatant was pre-
incubated in the required volume of the suitable buffer 
in a 96-well microtiter plate at 37  °C according to the 
assay procedures already described in the literature [17, 
19, 37]. Depending on the substrate, either 20 mM Tris, 
10  mM NaCl, pH  8 (pNPA, pNPB) or 50  mM phos -
phate buffer, pH  8 containing sodium desoxycholate 
and gum arabic (pNPP) was used as reaction buffer [17, 
19, 37]. After addition of the substrate, the release of 
p-nitrophenol was monitored immediately by measuring 
the absorbance at 405 nm for 10 min at 37 °C in a plate 
reader (Infinite M Nano + , Tecan Group AG, Männedorf, 
Page 5 of 16
Fritzsche et al. Microbial Cell Factories          (2024) 23:274 
 
Switzerland) [37]. The absorbance of a blank (non-enzy -
matic sample), to which only the assay buffer was added 
instead of the supernatant, was also measured and sub -
tracted when calculating the activities of the supernatant-
containing samples. For each activity measurement, a 
control was also analysed using the supernatant from the 
cultivation of cells containing the empty vector pEKEx2 
(C.  glutamicum) or pET26b (E.  coli). The p-nitrophenol 
concentration could be quantified using the p-nitrophe -
nol extinction coefficient (17.4   mM−1  cm−1) determined 
under reaction conditions [10]. Finally, the linear slope 
obtained was used to calculate the esterase activity per 
mL of culture supernatant, where one unit of esterase 
activity was defined as the release of 1 μmol p-nitrophe -
nol per minute.
Protein purification
The protein of interest was purified from either extracel -
lular or intracellular sources. After harvesting (4500  g, 
15 min, 4 °C), the cell pellet was resuspended in immo -
bilized metal affinity chromatography (IMAC) binding 
buffer (20  mM Tris, 300  mM NaCl, 10  mM imidazole, 
pH  8) or the corresponding culture supernatant was 
used. For intracellular protein isolation, cells were first 
disrupted on ice using ultrasound (Bandelin MS 73, Ber -
lin, Germany; 60% amplitude, 3 × 5  min). After a heat 
shock at 60  °C for 20  min, the cell lysate centrifuged 
(15,000  g, 45  min, 4  °C) to pellet the cell debris at, fol -
lowed by filtration (0.45 μm). In contrast, the cell culture 
supernatant was pre-treated only by heat shock (60  °C, 
20  min) and filtration (0.45  μm). In both cases, the fil -
trates were applied to an equilibrated HisTrap FF crude 
column (Cytiva, Chicago, IL). Unbound proteins were 
washed out with binding buffer over 10 column volumes 
(CV) and the target protein was then eluted with elution 
buffer (20 mM Tris, 300 mM NaCl, 500 mM imidazole, 
pH 8) over 5 CV. After elution, the protein solution was 
rebuffered in storage buffer (20 mM Tris, 300 mM NaCl, 
pH  8) through PD-10 desalting columns (Cytiva, Chi -
cago, IL). The resulting purified protein solution was ali -
quoted and stored at −  80  °C until further use. Protein 
purity was determined by PAGE with Coomassie stain -
ing, while quantitative determination of protein concen -
tration was performed using a Pierce BCA Protein Assay 
Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) according 
to the manufacturer’s instructions.
PET hydrolysis
A Labfors 3 system (Infors HT, Bottmingen, Switzerland) 
with a working volume of 1 L and a 6-bladed Rushton tur-
bine impeller was used for PET hydrolysis. The tempera -
ture of the buffer was maintained at 70 °C by an internal 
heating element and an external circulator thermostat 
(Julabo, Seelbach, Germany). Hydrolysis studies were 
performed in 100  mM potassium phosphate buffer at 
pH 9 using 10 g   L−1 PET fibres and stirring of 300 rpm. 
Enzymatic hydrolysis was initiated by the addition of 
either IMAC purified enzyme or unpurified cultivation 
supernatant. pH control was achieved by the automatic 
addition of 1  M  NaOH. Samples were taken periodi -
cally through the sampling port and stored at −  20  °C 
until the analysis of the hydrolysis products terephthalic 
acid, ethylene glycol, mono-(2-hydroxyethyl)terephthalic 
acid (MHET) and bis-(2-hydroxyethyl)terephthalic acid 
(BHET) by HPLC as previously described [10].
Statistical analysis
A two-sided t-test for independent samples (Excel) was 
used to determine whether the differences between indi -
vidual results were statistically significant.
Results
Comparison of expression hosts
In this study, the secretion efficiency of the LCC variant 
ICCG DAQI [10] in the host organism C. glutamicum was 
evaluated using seven signal peptides originally obtained 
from B.  subtilis (AmyE, AprE, LipA, LipB, NprE, YpjP 
and YwmC). These peptides have been shown in previ -
ous research to be effective in enhancing cutinase secre -
tion in C. glutamicum [20, 30]. When the signal peptides 
were combined with the cutinase variant ICCG DAQI, all 
peptides consistently resulted in substantial extracellu -
lar activity, confirming successful secretion of the target 
protein into the culture medium. However, different lev -
els of extracellular activity could be assessed, which sug -
gests a diverse suitability of the different signal peptides 
for cutinase secretion as shown before [30]. Notably, 
the signal peptides AmyE, LipB, and YpjP showed supe -
rior extracellular activities in preliminary tests in baffled 
shake flasks (Figure S1). These three signal peptides were 
then further used for the expression in C. glutamicum in 
stirred-tank reactors and compared with the extracellular 
release when using E. coli (Fig. 1).
In the stirred-tank reactor maximal secretion results 
(0.8 ± 0.01 U  mL−1) were seen for C. glutamicum cultiva -
tion with the signal peptide AmyE. We could also meas -
ure an extracellular cutinase activity for E.  coli cultures 
in stirred-tank reactors, regardless of whether protein 
expression was induced by the induction agent IPTG 
or by autoinduction. Using IPTG induction, the activity 
observed was similar to that of C.  glutamicum with the 
signal peptide AmyE. When cutinase production was 
induced by autoinduction, the overall maximum activ -
ity of 1.2 ± 0.1  U   mL−1 was measurable, which was sig -
nificantly (p ≤ 0.01) higher than the best results obtained 
with C. glutamicum. When we compared the extracellular 
Page 6 of 16Fritzsche et al. Microbial Cell Factories          (2024) 23:274 
activity versus the amount of substrate used, the high -
est yields were also achieved for E.  coli using the auto-
induction medium (Figure S2). When cells containing the 
empty vector were cultivated under the same conditions 
and therefore no cutinase was expressed, the measurable 
extracellular activity of the control was ≤ 0.01  U   mL−1 
(Fig. 1).
Characterisation of E. coli membrane integrity
The release of cutinase by E.  coli, in contrast to the 
expected intracellular accumulation under these condi -
tions, suggested a destabilization of membrane integrity, 
as targeted release via a secretory pathway was estimated 
to be very unlikely or even not possible [38]. To study 
this process in more detail, several tests on membrane 
integrity were carried out. On the one hand, the integ -
rity of a cell can be determined by its vitality and thus 
its ability to divide when determining CFU. Compared 
to the control culture (no induction), the number of 
CFU with autoinduced protein expression was reduced 
to 28%. On the other hand, a membrane integrity assay 
was also used for further analysis using DNA-interca -
lating fluorescent dyes, specifically PI and DAPI. While 
DAPI is membrane-permeable, PI can only penetrate a 
perforated membrane, but not intact cell membranes. 
The combined use of both dyes allowed an assessment of 
the amount of cells with intact membranes [39, 40]. By 
calibrating different ratios of intact to non-intact cells, 
we could determine a relative membrane integrity value 
for the autoinduced E.  coli culture of 32.3 ± 11.7%, and 
96.6 ± 32.3% for the control (E. coli pET26b-ICCG DAQI in 
LB medium without induction) (Figure S3). Even though 
the standard deviations of the respective values were 
relatively high, there was a significant difference between 
the membrane integrity values of the induced and non-
induced culture (p ≤ 0.05). Therefore, although accurate 
determination of membrane integrity is challenging, the 
combined evidence from CFU and the fluorescence assay 
strongly suggested a substantial amount of induced cells 
showed impaired membranes, facilitating the release of 
the target protein.
Optimisation of cultivation conditions in batch 
and fed‑batch stirred‑tank reactors
Without prior optimisation for extracellular expression, 
we observed an increased release of the cutinase ICCG 
DAQI in the culture supernatant with E. coli compared to 
C. glutamicum. Because of these promising initial results, 
the cell densities and corresponding recombinant cuti -
nase titres should be further improved for E. coli. Conse -
quently, the following sections will focus on the specific 
aspects that have been identified for further analysis and 
modification: medium composition, induction mecha -
nism, expression temperature and carbon source.
Medium composition
To improve bacterial growth and the cutinase produc -
tion, the autoinduction medium used for preliminary 
cultivation was supplemented with magnesium, ammo -
nium, sulphur, free amino acids, lactose and trace ele -
ments  (Autoinductionsupplemented) (Table 1). This resulted 
in a better growth  (OD600 = 18.5, CDW = 6.0  g   L−1), 
corresponding to an increase of 52% and 60% respec -
tively compared to preliminary tests. A similar trend 
was generally observed in the  OD600 and CDW meas -
urements. After 48 h, the final extracellular activity was 
37.8 ± 2.8  U  mL−1 (Table  1). Focusing only on the first 
24 h of cultivation, as in Fig.  1, the extracellular activity 
was comparatively increased by a factor of 5. However, if 
we analysed the extended cultivation period of 48 h, the 
measured maximum showed an absolute increase by a 
factor of 32 compared to the preliminary experiments.
Induction mechanism
The casein hydrolysate N-Z-Amine ®, magnesium sul -
phate, trace elements and 10  g   L−1 glucose as a carbon 
source were added to the LB medium  (LBsupplemented) to 
test whether these additives also had a positive effect 
on IPTG induction as in the supplemented autoinduc -
tion medium. Even though a substantial improvement in 
extracellular activity was observed compared to the ini -
tial results using the basic LB medium, this resulted in 
lower measurable extracellular activities compared to the 
Fig. 1 Extracellular activities determined by enzymatic hydrolysis 
of pNPB using E. coli and C. glutamicum cultures in stirred-tank 
reactors after 24 h. Different signal peptides were used 
for the secretion of the target protein in C. glutamicum cultures. 
For E. coli, induction by autoinduction and IPTG was compared. 
As controls, C. glutamicum was cultivated with only the vector 
pEKEx2 and E. coli with the vector pET26b. Each bar represents 
the mean ± standard deviation of three hydrolysis measurements

results obtained with autoinduction medium (Table  1). 
PAGE analysis also showed reduced accumulation of 
extracellular proteins compared to the autoinduction 
approach (Figure  S4  A). We also found that induction 
at a higher cell density  (OD600 = 3, IPTG concentra -
tion = 500  µM), intended to enhance biomass before 
inducing expression, did not yield in a higher extracel -
lular protein release compared autoinduction cultures 
(Table S2). As autoinduction medium uses a higher con -
centration of kanamycin due to increased phosphate salt 
concentrations, it was necessary to test whether this had 
an effect on plasmid stability and consequently on pro -
tein expression. However, when comparing cultures with 
different kanamycin concentrations (50 and 200 µg  mL−1) 
under otherwise identical conditions, no substantial dif -
ference in plasmid stability was observed (Table S2).
Cultivation temperature
For the target cutinase of this work, a low expression 
temperature—usually between 16 and 21  °C —is widely 
favoured in the literature [27, 41–43]. Therefore, in this 
work we analysed the extracellular accumulation of the 
cutinase ICCG DAQI at the usual expression temperature 
of around 20  °C as well as at 30  °C. Figure  2 shows the 
corresponding extracellular activities of the two bioreac -
tor cultivations with total substrate consumption after 
48 h for both cultivations.
For the E. coli culture 30 °C the maximum growth rate 
was found to be twofold higher compared to growth 
at 20  °C (Table  1). Similarly, the maximum cutinase 
release rate was significantly (p ≤ 0.01) increased by 
1.9-fold at 30  °C, reaching 3.5 ± 0.1  U   mL−1  h−1 com -
pared with 1.9 ± 0.2 U   mL−1  h−1 at 20 °C. This accelera -
tion, together with the earlier start of cutinase release, 
resulted in a 2.3-fold increase in absolute extracellular 
activity values at the end of cultivation (84.7 ± 2.7 U  mL−1 
for 30  °C vs. 37.8 ± 2.8  U  mL−1 for 20  °C), with similar 
substrate consumption observed in both conditions 
(Fig.  2, Table  1). The final yields related to the biomass 
were 6.7 U   mgCDW
−1 and 13.0 U   mgCDW
−1, respectively, 
for expression temperatures of 20 °C and 30 °C. An ear -
lier release after the start of cultivation and a stronger 
extracellular accumulation of the protein of interest was 
also evident from the bands corresponding to the protein 
of interest on PAGE (Figure S4 B and C).
Carbon source feeding
Batch cultivation at 30 °C yielded a biomass of 6.5 g   L−1, 
with a noticeable stagnation in growth after the first 10 h 
of exponential growth (Figure S5 A). As this was tempo -
rally related to the strongly decreasing concentrations 
of the carbon sources glucose, lactose and glycerol, in a

further batch cultivation we analysed the pulsed addi -
tion of the carbon sources glycerol and lactose, with lac -
tose being also the inducing agent (Figure S6). With this 
improved carbon source supply by periodic manual addi -
tion of glycerol and lactose, a significantly higher  OD600, 
CDW and extracellular activity of 118.7 ± 2.4  U   mL−1 
were achieved after 48  h of cultivation (Table  1, Figure 
S6). This corresponds to an increase of 38, 44 and 40%, 
respectively, in comparison to a batch process without 
lactose pulses as described before. In view of the poten -
tial irregularities associated with pulsing, we incorpo -
rated a substrate feed. Fed-batch processes offer several 
advantages over batch processes in bioprocess engineer -
ing, particularly in terms of nutrient control, optimised 
resource utilisation and thus an efficient recombinant 
protein production. Therefore, optimal biomass produc -
tion was achieved by adding lactose at an exponential 
feed from 8 to 28 h, followed by a constant feed rate of 
20 mL   h−1 for further 20 h (Fig.  3 B). This was found to 
increase  OD600 and CDW, as well as cutinase expres -
sion and extracellular accumulation of esterase activ -
ity over the cultivation time (Table  1, Fig.  3  A and C). 
In particular, extracellular activity peaked at values of 
5.7 ± 0.4 U  mL−1 (pNPA assay), 136.6 ± 8.2 U  mL−1 (pNPB 
assay) and 120.3 ± 7.2 U  mL−1 (pNPP-Assay) towards the 
end of the cultivation period. The activity measurements 
with the different substrates pNPA, pNPB and pNPP cor-
related well in each case. However, they are not shown 
in the graphs for reasons of clarity, but are listed here for 
comparison with the literature. To include the diluting 
effect of the feed during fed-batch cultivation, the total 
activity was calculated in addition to the concentration 
of extracellular activity, resulting in a total activity of 206 
kU at the end of cultivation. Protein accumulation data 
from PAGE (Fig.  4) showed a steady increase in band 
intensity starting at 16 h, which continued until approxi -
mately 28 h, after which the intensity reached a plateau. 
This correlated optically and densitometrically with the 
increase in activity (Fig.  3 C). From the 20 h point to the 
final measurement, the extracellular activity concentra -
tions increased twofold, closely correlating with the den -
sitometric evaluation which showed a 1.9 fold increase. 
Compared to the pulsed batch growth and extracellular 
protein production were further improved, especially 
considering absolute biomass and activity results, dem -
onstrating the advantage of the lactose-fed approach.
Purification of target protein from intra‑ and extracellular 
origin
The results of this work so far demonstrated that during 
the expression of recombinant cutinase in E. coli, a sub -
stantial amount of the cutinase ICCG DAQI was found in 
the extracellular space, i.e., in the cultivation supernatant.

Also, the PAGE analysis clearly showed an excess of the 
target protein in the cultivation supernatant compared 
to the intracellular space (Figure  S7). Because cell dis -
ruption can lead to protein losses, due to incomplete 
disruption or protein damage by heat or cavitation, we 
compared the protein yields from intra- and extracel -
lular origin to analyse the optimal source for protein 
isolation [44, 45]. After 48  h of fed-batch autoinduced 
expression at 30  °C, the culture was centrifuged, result -
ing in a cell pellet and supernatant fraction. While the 
culture supernatant was only treated by heat shock at 
60  °C, the pellet had to be resuspended, disrupted by 
sonication in repeated cycles, heat shocked, centrifuged 
and filtered before being applied to the IMAC column. 
After a washing step, the target cutinase was eluted with 
imidazole under the same conditions. The chromato -
grams (Figure  S8) clearly showed a substantial increase 
in the UV signal peak by a factor of 3 when the super -
natant sample was eluted compared to the protein elu -
tion from the pellet sample. This observation aligns well 
with the calculated titre of 660  mg   L−1 for the cutinase 
ICCG DAQI in the supernatant and 175 mg   L−1 for ICCG 
DAQI in the equivalent amount of the disrupted cell pellet, 
corresponding to a factor of 3.8 (Fig.  5). Thus, approxi -
mately 80% of the total amount of the cutinase was found 
extracellularly. With a total protein titre of 5.7  g   L−1 in 
the supernatant, the relative amount of target cutinase 
was 11.6%. In the disrupted cell pellet, 7.0% of the total 
soluble protein was the target cutinase ICCG DAQI. A fur-
ther increase towards complete release could be achieved 
by thermal or chemical treatment, as incubation at 60 °C 
could increase the extracellular cutinase activity further. 
After 20  min the extracellular activity was increased by 
16  U  mL−1 to 154 ± 3.5  U  mL−1 (Figure  S9). Such ther -
molysis approaches for E. coli were also found to be effi -
cient for thermostable enzymes in the literature [46]. 
The PAGE analysis showed a purification result from the 
supernatant with a purity of 96.6%, which is comparable 
to the results obtained with the established protocol for 
Fig. 4 PAGE analysis of fed-batch E. coli cultivation supernatants (1:4 
diluted) over time when using autoinduction and lactose as a feed. 
The temperature for protein expression was set to 30 °C. The bands 
with a calculated molecular weight of about 28.3 kDa [35] correspond 
to the protein of interest with a theoretical molecular weight 
of 28.9 kDa [36]. As a control (CTRL) a sample (1:4 diluted, 48 h) 
from a fed-batch E. coli cultivation with the empty vector was used

the purification of the target protein from intracellular 
origin (Fig. 5).
Verification of hydrolytic activity in PET degradation
To avoid the purification of the protein altogether and 
thus achieve a much more cost-effective hydrolysis, the 
impact of using untreated culture supernatant on hydrol-
ysis was investigated (Fig.  6). In addition to the IMAC-
purified culture supernatant (see previous chapter), 5% 
untreated culture supernatant was used to hydrolyse 10 g 
of polyester fibres at 70 °C on the 1-L scale.
Compared to the use of purified protein, a slightly 
slower hydrolysis of the solid substrate was observed. 
The product release, shown by HPLC measurements 
and the corresponding NaOH addition curve, stagnated 
after 18  h compared to 12  h for the purified enzyme. 
Notably, the culture supernatant used in this experiment 
contained 3  mg of the cutinase ICCG DAQI per  gramPET, 
yet the hydrolysis rate was lower than that observed with 
1   mgpurified  cutinase  gPET
−1. The presence of other compo -
nents in the culture supernatant might have contributed 
to the reduced efficiency of the enzyme. Nevertheless, 
both hydrolysis approaches showed almost complete 
PET conversion. In the case of the crude supernatant, 
this resulted in 97.8% and 98.6% yields of the hydrolysis 
products terephthalic acid and ethylene glycol after 20 h. 
For the purified protein, the yields were 96.4% and 98.8% 
for terephthalic acid and ethylene glycol, respectively. 
However, with respect to the effective enzymatic activity 
used, the crude supernatant performed well highlighting 
options for purification free application. The hydrolysis 
main product terephthalic acid could be effectively pre -
cipitated and recovered by acidification. At pH values 
below 4, recoveries of over 95% were possible. At a pH 
of 2.5, which is often used in the literature [47], recovery 
rates of up to 99.2% were possible in this work. Nuclear 
magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopic analysis of 
the recovered terephthalic acid showed that neither the 
hydrolysis products using the purified enzyme nor the 
unpurified culture supernatant contained impurities 
other than minor traces of water, compared to commer -
cial terephthalic acid of > 99% purity (Figure S10).
Discussion
In the literature, C.  glutamicum is described as an effi -
cient secretory organism that can express different cuti -
nases extracellularly using various signal peptides [30, 
48, 49]. For the ICCG variant, Helleckes et  al. showed 
an extracellular activity of 0.8 U   mL−1 (pNPP) for C. glu-
tamicum using the signal peptide LipB on the 1-L biore -
actor scale [19]. This activity is in the same range as in 
this work, where AmyE as the best signal peptide showed 
an activity of 0.8  U   mL−1 (pNPP assay), whereas LipB 
showed a lower activity of 0.2 U   mL−1 in our study. Dif -
ferences in these values may be due to variations in media 
composition, such as minimal versus full medium, affect -
ing chaperone synthesis, differences in cultivation condi -
tions and slight modifications of the enzyme variant used 
in our study. The use of alternative vectors with tighter 
control may improve protein production, as the observed 
reduction in yield may be linked to leaky expression of 
the pEKEx2 vector [50]. However, as we observed extra -
cellular expression of the cutinase ICCG DAQI not only in 
C. glutamicum, but also in E. coli, extracellular cutinase 
formation is not restricted to secretory organisms, but 
also occurs in E. coli even without a signal peptide. This 
effect might be due to the expressed protein itself. As a 
gram-negative bacterium, E. coli has a three-layered cell 
wall consisting of an inner or cytoplasmic membrane, a 
peptidoglycan layer and an outer membrane [51]. The

constant at a value of 9, whose curve (dashed line) also corresponds 
to PET hydrolysis. The terephthalic acid concentration corresponding 
to a yield of 100% is indicated by the blue dashed line

peptidoglycan layer of E. coli is remarkably thin, meas -
uring less than 10  nm, whereas gram-positive bacteria 
have a much thicker, multi-layered peptidoglycan layer 
of 30 to 100 nm. The inner and outer membranes consist 
of (phospho)lipid layers, each no more than 7  nm thick 
[51, 52]. While the peptidoglycan layer allows the per -
meation of molecules below 50 kDa, the outer membrane 
acts as an efficient selective permeation barrier [53, 54]. 
The protein of interest, a catalytically highly active cuti -
nase, is an ester hydrolysing enzyme with the theoretical 
ability to hydrolyse ester bonds within the lipid bilayer, 
disrupting its integrity. Phospholipase activity has been 
demonstrated in the past for some cutinases, e.g. from 
Thermobifida fusca [23]. If the induction process leads 
to a gradual intracellular accumulation of cutinase, it is 
conceivable that the ester bonds could be affected, lead -
ing to permeabilisation of the cellular lipid bilayer. As a 
result of this damage to the primary protective barrier 
of E.  coli, the natural existing permeability of the thin 
peptidoglycan layer in E.  coli can lead to the release of 
the intracellularly accumulated 29  kDa protein, which 
would provide a plausible mechanism for the observed 
membrane damage and subsequent release of the target 
protein. Evidence for this assumption can also be found 
in the literature. When a cutinase from T.   fusca was 
expressed in E. coli BL21 (DE3), significantly higher per -
meabilities of the inner and outer membranes were found 
[23, 25]. However, β-galactosidase as a reference protein 
with a high molecular weight of 467 kDa (tetramer) [55], 
was released to a substantially lower extent than the cuti -
nase, so that a complete lysis of the cell was not assumed 
[23]. In contrast, when a genetically inactivated cutinase 
variant was expressed, no membrane damage occurred, 
resulting in no release into the medium [23, 25]. When 
E. coli with the empty vector was cultured in shake flasks, 
only minimal amounts of certain proteins were detected 
in the culture supernatant under these conditions (Fig -
ure S11). Fed-batch cultivation of E. coli with the empty 
vector in a stirred tank reactor at 30  °C resulted in a 
slightly increased release of these proteins into the extra -
cellular space. Additional proteins were released in the 
later stages of fed-batch cultivation (> 36 h), probably as a 
result of cell damage due to nutrient depletion, metabolic 
stress and cell death (Figure S12). However, the extent of 
protein release observed under both cultivation condi -
tions was significantly lower than that observed during 
cutinase expression. This indicates that the disruption of 
membrane integrity when expressing the cutinase ICCG 
DAQI is not due to mechanical stress on the cells during 
cultivation. Even when LCC was first described, small 
amounts were already reported in the culture medium of 
E.  coli at 37  °C in the case of overproduction (Table  2). 
However, in this case the enzyme was tagged with the 
pelB leader sequence, which may have contributed to the 
release [26, 56]. In this work, we have clearly seen a sub -
stantial increase in the target cutinase in the supernatant 
over the duration of cultivation, but also an increase in 
the release of other proteins in the supernatant. Com -
bined with the CFU results, this suggests that the mem -
brane appears to become damaged, which seems to go 
beyond a selective release of the target cutinase. Instead, 
it is more plausible that some sort of release effect is 
occurring where membrane integrity is compromised 
to such an extent that intracellular proteins are released 
undifferentiated into the culture medium. Flow cytom -
etry may be used to investigate the exact relationship 
between protein production and cell membrane integrity 
in more detailed research.
In this work, we found autoinduction to be more suit -
able for the extracellular expression of the cutinase vari -
ant under study than conventional induction with IPTG. 
Also, literature generally indicates that autoinduction

outperforms classical IPTG induction, especially when 
dealing with toxic or challenging recombinant proteins, 
by reducing metabolic stress and increasing target pro -
tein yields. This advantage is due to the gradual induc -
tion process and the ability to fine-tune the timing of 
induction with lactose, resulting in higher cell yields and 
expression efficiencies [31]. In this case, metabolic stress 
or cell damage by the cutinase, along with the highly con-
centration-dependent nature of expression, which can 
vary depending on the target protein and organism, are 
possible reasons for the lower expression with IPTG [57]. 
Potential cell damage during IPTG induction caused by 
sudden high intracellular enzyme concentrations may be 
reduced by autoinduction, which allows a milder induc -
tion and balances enzyme production and release across 
a partially permeable membrane. Higher IPTG concen -
trations are toxic to cells, leading to reduced growth and 
accumulation of insoluble proteins, while low concentra -
tions may result in insufficient expression, as observed 
in this case. In principle, an IPTG range between 0.05 
and 2  mM is recommended, with the previously in 
shake flasks determined optimal IPTG concentration of 
0.1  mM falling within this recommended range (Figure 
S13). Also, in the literature for E.  coli and C.  glutami -
cum, values in the range of 100–250 µM are reported to 
be optimal for the secretion of cutinases [50, 58]. How-
ever, the transition to bioreactor cultivation and changes 
in the culture medium may require a reassessment of the 
optimal IPTG induction and timing. Nevertheless, as 
autoinduction proved to be better in our case and is rec -
ommended in the literature as a softer induction method, 
no further studies were carried out with IPTG [31]. The 
use of the carbon source lactose as inducer is also an 
option for future up-scaling, as IPTG is considered too 
expensive for the production of low-cost recombinant 
proteins, especially on an industrial scale [59]. The posi -
tive effect of lactose as an inexpensive feed shown in this 
work is also confirmed in the relevant literature, some -
times in combination with IPTG as an additional inducer 
or glycerol as an alternative carbon source [60–62].
In this work in particular the media components 
showed a substantial influence on bacterial growth and 
cutinase production, as a clear increase in both param -
eters was observed in the supplemented version of the 
autoinduction medium (Table  S1). This may be due to 
the increased concentrations of salts such as magne -
sium, ammonium, sulphur and trace elements, which 
are known to be key factors in increasing saturation 
cell density [31, 63]. The addition of trace elements was 
also found to be essential for robust growth and expres -
sion [31]. This, combined with other factors such as the 
potential increased availability of free amino acids from 
N-Z-Amine® and lactose addition, presumably led to 
higher cutinase yields over the extended cultivation 
period. As shown above, also the temperature chosen 
for expression affected the extracellular release of cuti -
nase, as production at 30  °C benefited from accelerated 
cutinase formation and increased catalytic esterase reac -
tion rates at higher temperatures, leading to enhanced 
membrane permeabilisation [56, 57]. This effect may 
have been enhanced by the general increase in mem -
brane fluidity at higher temperatures, facilitating mem -
brane diffusion processes [64, 65]. Membrane integrity 
issues, particularly at 30  °C and during prolonged culti -
vation, can alter  OD600 measurements due to reduced 
light scattering from compromised cells, requiring con -
sideration of CDW [66]. Further optimisation of the 
feeding strategy could potentially increase activity yields 
relative to the carbon source used. However, in addition 
to the volume-based activities, the absolute activity val -
ues achieved in the fed-batch cultivation are particularly 
promising, with a total extracellular activity of 205  kU 
compared to 119 kU in the pulsed batch, demonstrating 
the potential of a fed-batch approach.
We have demonstrated that extracellularly accumu -
lated cutinase can also be used to hydrolyse PET fibres. 
Indeed, other studies have shown that extracellularly 
expressed cutinases have the same properties as intra -
cellularly expressed ones, such as temperature and pH 
optima and stability, as well as catalytic properties [21, 
23]. Furthermore, we found that PET hydrolysis worked 
well under standard conditions even when only 5% unpu-
rified culture supernatant containing 3 mg cutinase was 
used, indicating that purification of the expressed cuti -
nase by IMAC may not be necessary. The slight decelera -
tion in hydrolysis may be attributed to proteolytic activity 
in the unpurified culture supernatant, indicating poten -
tial protease interference with the hydrolytically active 
target protein and resulting in a lower effective enzyme 
concentration [67, 68]. The presence of culture superna -
tant might also affect the overall catalytic activity. Future 
possibilities include further separation of proteolytically 
active enzymes, potentially achieving hydrolysis speeds 
comparable to those with purified protein. Moreover, effi-
cient use of the cutinase can be achieved by using the cul-
tivation supernatant directly for various immobilisation 
approaches like magnetic nanoparticles, responsive poly -
mers and cross-linked enzyme aggregates [69–71]. Such 
enzyme immobilisation strategies from the supernatant 
would also minimise the risk of introducing impurities 
or colour-altering substances from the cultivation media 
into the monomers utilised for circular plastic produc -
tion. Using the cutinase from the culture supernatant and 
avoiding cell disruption, even when efficient methods 
such as ultrasonic disruption with four 1 min sonication 
cycles are available [72], offers significant advantages for

extracellular protein expression. This approach not only 
eliminates potentially damaging steps such as heat gener-
ation and cavitation that can occur during disruption, but 
also reduces the need for multiple centrifugation cycles. 
These benefits are particularly valuable when processing 
larger volumes, where extracellular expression can sim -
plify the production process [73, 74].
With a better understanding of the factors involved 
in expression in E.  coli, a comparative analysis of extra -
cellular production in different organisms is crucial to 
assess the overall suitability. The choice of expression 
system and release route ultimately depends on the spe -
cific objectives and expectations. In this study, E.  coli 
with leaky release of intracellularly produced cutinase 
ICCG DAQI showed higher titres compared to the secret -
ing organism C. glutamicum. Especially for heterologous 
protein production secretion yields can be relatively low 
[75]. The faster growth rate of E.  coli and cultivation 
using autoinduction medium provided additional advan -
tages over the secretion system in C.  glutamicum [31]. 
However, the membrane disintegration in E.  coli limits 
continuous cultivation, when in contrast, C. glutamicum 
offers the potential for continuous production where the 
cutinase could be consistently harvested from the super -
natant, possibly having positive effects on the space time 
yield. There is also potential for optimising extracellular 
titres in C. glutamicum, for example by varying the signal 
peptides, one of the most important factors for efficient 
recombinant protein secretion [20, 76]. On the other 
hand, the ability of E.  coli to release proteins indepen -
dently of signal peptides could be a significant advantage. 
While the secretion process in C.  glutamicum is more 
targeted, the co-release of other proteins in E.  coli is a 
potential limitation, as it may lead to interference with 
catalytic activity due to impurities or proteolytic degra -
dation [75, 77]. However, this co-release could also be 
used as an opportunity, for example in the co-expression 
of other enzymes such as bacterial cellulases for use in 
a multi-enzyme system [78]. In conclusion, our results 
indicate that leaky release of intracellularly expressed 
cutinase was more effective in E.  coli than secretory 
release in C.  glutamicum, mainly due to the higher 
released cutinase titre and the ease of optimising culti -
vation conditions with autoinduction medium in E. coli. 
Nevertheless, the potential for continuous production 
and targeted secretion in C.  glutamicum highlights its 
strengths for specific applications, particularly where 
more controlled and purer enzyme production is needed.
In addition to E.  coli and C.  glutamicum, also other 
organisms have been reported in the literature to be 
suitable for the extracellular production of ICCG vari -
ants (Table  2). Compared to other studies that have 
investigated the extracellular accumulation of ICCG 
variants using E. coli, we found a larger amount extra -
cellularly in our work (80% compared to approximately 
30%) [21]. Several variations in growth conditions may 
have contributed to the higher protein titres observed 
in our study, as we used a higher temperature during 
the protein production phase (30 °C) combined with a 
longer cultivation time. In addition, the use of lactose 
as both carbon source and inducer, as opposed to glu -
cose with IPTG induction, may have contributed to the 
enhanced protein expression. By using autoinduction 
with lactose, we may have achieved a milder induction 
leading to more stable protein expression as described 
above [31, 57]. In contrast to the secreting organisms 
C.  glutamicum and B.  subtilis, our results with E.  coli  
outperformed them in terms of extracellular cutinase 
titre and secretion efficiency as indicated by activ -
ity assays [17, 19]. In the case of B.  subtilis, the final 
results of bioreactor cultivation on a 2-L scale were 
exceeded by a factor of 9 for the cutinase titre and 8 for 
the extracellular activity [17]. The space–time yield was 
3.5 mg   L−1  h−1 for B. subtilis [ 17] and 13.8 mg   L−1  h−1 
for E. coli (this work), although it should be noted that 
the B. subtilis results were obtained in a batch process. 
Further optimisation towards a fed-batch process and 
optimised carbon source supply would be expected 
to further increase biomass and protein production 
in B.  subtilis [ 79–81]. Notably, our results also show 
that E.  coli outperforms K.  phaffii, known for its high 
yields and protein secretion capabilities, in extracellu -
lar cutinase production compared to previous literature 
[16, 82]. However, the lower cutinase yield observed 
in K.  phaffii was probably due to different cultivation 
conditions and the use of shake flasks instead of a bio -
reactor environment [16]. This further highlights the 
significant potential and critical importance of optimis -
ing cultivation conditions to enhance extracellular cuti -
nase production. While whole-cell approaches, such 
as those combining cell growth and protein expression 
with simultaneous hydrolysis in C. thermocellum, have 
shown highly promising results, their activities do not 
yet reach the levels achieved by isolated protein expres -
sion [24]. Overall, this shows that E.  coli is able to 
keep up with or even outperform secreting organisms, 
mainly due to higher growth rates, protein expression 
by autoinduction and optimal nutrient supply through 
fed-batch cultivation [31, 83, 84]. The choice of organ -
ism and cultivation strategy regarding conditions and 
nutrient supply will certainly depend on the objectives 
to be pursued. However, it is clear that the release of 
cutinase into the cell culture medium opens up new 
possibilities for efficient downstream processing or 
direct use as a biocatalyst.

Conclusion
Extracellular expression of cutinases has been dem -
onstrated in a variety of secreting organisms. In this 
study, E.  coli was found to be superior to C.  glutami -
cum in both ICCG DAQI titre and extracellular activity, 
as demonstrated by direct experimental comparison. In 
particular, autoinduction, an expression temperature 
of 30 °C and a fed-batch process for improved carbon 
supply were factors efficiently improving extracellular 
cutinase production in E.  coli. Successful purification 
of the cutinase ICCG DAQI from the culture superna -
tant was achieved, with high purities of 96.6% and final 
cutinase yields of 660 mg   L−1. The use of culture super -
natant with extracellular cutinase without IMAC puri -
fication enabled complete hydrolysis of post-industrial 
PET waste in less than 24  h, resulting in terephthalic 
acid yields comparable to those obtained with purified 
enzyme. In closing, extracellular expression in E.  coli  
offers the possibility of reducing the cost of enzyme 
production for biotechnological recycling of PET prod -
ucts. Such new opportunities for optimising time, 
material and cost resources are crucial to addressing 
the growing challenge of PET waste from single-use 
packaging and textile products.
