The pervasive presence of plastic in the environment has reached a concerning scale, being identiﬁed in many 
ecosystems. Bioremediation is the cheapest and most eco-friendly alternative to remove this polymer from 
aﬀected areas. Recent work described that a novel cold-active esterase enzyme extracted from the bacteria 
Kaistella jeonii could promiscuously degrade PET. Compared to the well-known PETase from Ideonella sakaiensis, 
this novel esterase presents a low sequence identity yet has a remarkably similar folding. However, enzymatic 
assays demonstrated a lower catalytic eﬃciency. In this work, we employed a strict computational approach 
to investigate the binding mechanism between the esterase and PET. Understanding the underlying mechanism 
of binding can shed light on the evolutive mechanism of how enzymes have been evolving to degrade these 
artiﬁcial molecules and help develop rational engineering approaches to improve PETase-like enzymes. Our 
results indicate that this esterase misses a disulﬁde bridge, keeping the catalytic residues closer and possibly 
inﬂuencing its catalytic eﬃciency. Moreover, we describe the structural response to the interaction between 
enzyme and PET, indicating local and global eﬀects. Our results aid in deepening the knowledge behind the 
mechanism of biological catalysis of PET degradation and as a base for the engineering of novel PETases.
1. Introduction
Plastic pollution is not only an emergent threat to human health 
and biodiversity but is nearing an irreversible point (MacLeod et al., 
2021). Plastic residues are found globally in food, water, and in almost 
every ecosystem (Carr et al., 2016; Revel et al., 2018; Allouzi et al., 
2021; MacLeod et al., 2021; Howard and McCarthy, 2023). Remark-
ably, poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET)-based plastics are one of the 
most used in packaging industries because of their durability (Maurya 
et al., 2020). Amidst the mass-produced plastic, recycling only takes 
place for a diminutive share (Howard and McCarthy, 2023). The re-
maining plastic reaches the environment and negatively impacts its 
surroundings and diverse life forms (Maurya et al., 2020). In response 
to the challenges of plastic pollution, cost-eﬀective and eco-friendly 
bioremediation is gaining prominence (Sharma et al., 2018). Ongoing

advancements in microbial enzymes, genetic engineering, and enzyme 
immobilization emphasize the potential of enzymatic remediation in 
this ﬁeld (Sharma et al., 2018). Currently, cutinases are the main en-
zymes used for plastic degradation (Egmond and de Vlieg, 2000; Mau-
rya et al., 2020).
In 2016, Yoshida et al. (2016) described that Ideonella sakaiensis
could degrade PET. The characterization of the enzyme IsPETase en-
abled several studies for protein engineering (Son et al., 2019; Cui et 
al., 2021) and, until now, is one of the most eﬀective enzymes for PET 
degradation. Simulations using Molecular Dynamics (MD) were con-
ducted to understand and optimize the IsPETase activity (Fecker et al., 
2018; Chen et al., 2021), giving more information about enzyme charac-
teristics crucial for protein engineering. MD gives atomistic information 
about the dynamic molecular mechanism that determines the protein 
stability, function, and protein-ligand interaction and is a reliable strat-

egy to access a protein’s molecular behavior (Childers and Daggett, 
2017). Therefore, using MD can provide substantial data for enzyme 
management in bioremediation.
In 2022, a new esterase was described from Kaistella jeonii (PET30) 
that showed PET degradation activity (Zhang et al., 2022). PET30
Fig. 1A, classiﬁed as an esterase (serine protease) with EC 3.1 designa-
tion, represents a hydrolase acting speciﬁcally on ester bonds. Enzymes 
denoted as “PETases” can degrade PET by cleaving the ester bonds 
of the polymer into Mono-2-hydroxyethyl terephthalate (MHET) and 
Bis(2-hydroxyethyl) terephthalate (BHET) Fig. 1B. In alignment with 
this enzymatic function, PET30 likely falls under the EC sub-subtype 1 
(EC 3.1.1), akin to cutinases, lipases, and carboxylesterases known for 
their PETase activity. Positioned within the 𝛼/𝛽 hydrolase superfamily, 
alongside enzymes like lipases and esterases, PET30 features a distinc-
tive Gly – x1 – Ser – x2 – Gly motif (Gly151 – Trp152 – Ser153 – Met154 
– Gly155) at its active site. Strikingly, this motif mirrors the identi-
cal sequence found in IsPETase (Gly158 – Trp159 – Ser160 – Met161 
– Gly162), further underlining the structural similarity between these 
PET-degrading enzymes (Joo et al., 2018).
A notable feature of PET30 is its catalytic triad, a deﬁning charac-
teristic of 𝛼/𝛽 hydrolases. Comprising the residues Asp-His-SerFig. 1C, 
this triad underscores PET30’s enzymatic functionality. When aligned 
with IsPETase structure, PET30 reveals a less hydrophobic environ-
ment surrounding its catalytic pocket, providing an initial distinction 
between these structurally akin enzymes.
Despite a relatively low sequence identity of 34% with IsPETase, 
PET30’s tertiary structure mirrors its PET-degrading counterpart. Dis-
playing a canonical 𝛼/𝛽-fold, PET30 features a central twisted 𝛽-sheet 
comprising ten 𝛽-strands, ﬂanked by seven 𝛼-helices on either side -a  
structural arrangement similar to IsPETase (Zhang et al., 2022).
In this work, noting the performance of PET degradation and some 
common characteristics with IsPETase, we observe the potential use of 
this new esterase on the bioremediation of PET. Furthermore, the report 
of the enzyme’s molecular mechanism could give more information on 
cutinase’s evolutionary pathway toward PET degradation. Therefore, 
we use a classic MD to understand and compare the protein’s molecular 
behavior with the IsPETase literature available.
2. Methodology
2.1. Protein structure, modeling, and validation
We retrieved the initial structure of PET30 from the Protein Data 
Bank (PDB) under the identiﬁer 7PZJ(Berman et al., 2000). Due to the 
absence of the initial segment (residues 1-27), a comparative modeling 
approach was employed. The structure was subjected to the Robetta 
server (Kim et al., 2004) for structure modeling and reﬁnement. The 
resultant model comprises residues 1 to 299, integrating the recon-
structed N-terminal segment. The accuracy and reliability of the gen-
erated model were assessed through various validation tools (Bowie et 
al., 1991; Lüthy et al., 1992; Colovos and Yeates, 1993; Laskowski et 
al., 1993; Hooft et al., 1996; Pontius et al., 1996; Williams et al., 2018) 
to ensure its suitability for subsequent analyses.
2.2. Ensemble docking and initial simulation
The molecular structure of PET was modeled using Marvin JS (Csiz-
madia, 1999) in a trimer format. Next, we submitted the structure to 
the LigParGen server (Jorgensen and Tirado-Rives, 2005; Dodda et al., 
2017a,b), which generates parameters for bonds, angles, dihedrals, and 
Lennard-Jones interactions for the selected forceﬁeld (FF). We use the 
1.14*CM1A option for partial charge parameters. The server also pro-
vided topology ﬁles compatible with GROMACS for further simulations.
We employed AutoDock Tools 1.5.7 (Sanner et al., 1999) and 
AutoDock Vina 1.2.3 (Trott and Olson, 2010; Eberhardt et al., 2021) 
software for molecular docking of the PET molecule into the esterase 
structure. A grid box was strategically positioned at the central coor-
dinates of the catalytic residues, namely Ser153, Asp198, and His230.

To mimic the native state of the residues, we protonated the nitrogen 𝛿
of His230 while concurrently deprotonating the nitrogen 𝜖. The dimen-
sions of the grid box were set to encompass the entire active enzyme 
center, with a grid size of 26 Å on the x-axis, 21.5 Å on the y-axis, 
and 16.3 Å on the z-axis. Subsequently, we imported the ligand into 
AutoDock Vina, which generated ten diﬀerent poses. The resultant con-
formation of the ligand, as generated by AutoDock Vina, was employed 
in subsequent molecular dynamics simulations.
We conducted Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations using the 
GROMACS package version 2021.5 (Lindahl et al., 2022). The system 
was positioned within a cubic simulation box, and a disulﬁde bridge 
formation between CYS 262 and CYS 285 was conﬁgured. The force 
ﬁeld employed for these simulations was OPLS-AA/M (Robertson et al., 
2015). We opted to perform serial minimization steps to ensure an op-
timal starting conﬁguration. The ﬁrstminimization step was a vacuum 
minimization utilizing the Steepest Descent (SD) algorithm, followed by 
a series of minimization steps in water. The solvation process employed 
the TIP3P water model and Na+ and Cl− ions in a concentration of 0.15 
M. The second minimization step occurredtreating the non-bonded in-
teractions with a Cut-oﬀ and the SD algorithm; the third minimization 
step used Particle Mesh Ewald (PME) for long-range interactions and; 
the ﬁnal minimization step employed PME in combination with the 
Conjugate Gradient algorithm.
We use the 100 resulting frames from the 100ns simulation to select 
the best protein-ligand interaction. Performing catalytic center RMSD, 
we select the most divergent structures. We use 𝜋-stacking and distance 
analysis to decide the best catalytic triad (Ser153-His230-Asp-198) co-
ordination with PET. With the elected structure, we performed a new 
Docking following the conditions above. This process created a protein-
ligand complex, forming the foundation for subsequent MD simulations.
We ran a 100 ns simulation for the ensemble docking and ex-
tracted one structure per nanosecond. Next, we calculated the Root 
Mean Square Deviation (RMSD) of the catalytic center, including all the 
residues described as relevant for the substrate accommodation, and se-
lected the ones presenting the higher values of RMSD. We submitted 
each structure for molecular docking and ﬁltered them by the number 
and types of interactions, proximity to the catalytic residues, and the 
ﬁnal conﬁguration pose of PET, based on the IsPETase literature. The 
selected structure was used to generate the protein-ligand complex for 
the starting point of subsequent Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations.
2.3. Molecular dynamics simulations
In this phase, we assembled the simulations in two distinct systems: 
one dedicated to elucidating the behavior of the free esterase, denoted 
as PET30𝐹, and the other involving the PET trimer bound at the binding 
pocket, referred to as PET30𝐵.
We selected the OPLS-AA/M FF and used the water molecules TIP4P 
model. We added Na+ and Cl− ions to maintain a neutralized system, 
mimicking a physiological condition of 0.15 M. An additional energy 
minimization step was executed, employing the Steepest Descent al-
gorithm. The LINCS (Linear Constraint Solver) algorithm was utilized 
to constrain covalent bond lengths during the equilibration phase. In 
the NVT ensemble, the V-rescale thermostat heated the system to 300 
K over 1 ns. Subsequently, in the NPT ensemble equilibration, the 
Parrinello-Rahman barostat maintained a pressure of 1 bar over 1 ns. 
Finally, the production step was performed for 1μ s simulation. Each 
system underwent ﬁve replicas of simulations, giving a total of 10 μs. 
Essential analyses were conducted, such as RMSD, Root Mean Square 
Fluctuation (RMSF), Radius of Gyration (R𝑔), Solvent Accessible Sur-
face Areas (SASA), hydrogen bond analysis (HB), and Dictionary of 
Secondary Structure of the Protein (DSSP). The Supplementary Material 
contains information regarding the details of general trajectory analy-
ses.
2.4. Principal component analysis and free energy proﬁle
A multi-step process was executed to conduct Principal Component 
Analysis (PCA). We used the trajectories of the ﬁve replicas of each 
system separately, removing rotational and translational motions from 
the trajectories. Employing theCovar module in Gromacs, a covariance 
matrix was systematically generated based on the Cartesian coordinates 
of the protein backbone atoms over the trajectory. The obtained co-
variance matrix was then subjected to eigenvalue-eigenvector analysis 
using the Anaeig module. This analytical step identiﬁes the principal 
components (PCs) of motion inherent in the system. We projected the 
entire simulation trajectory onto the identiﬁed principal components 
using the trajectory and the calculated eigenvectors. To construct the 
Free Energy Proﬁle, we used the MD-Davis Python library (Maity and 
Pal, 2022) with PC1 and PC2 as input.
3. Results and discussion
The decision to model the initial 27 residues segment was driven by 
the acknowledgment of the limitations in available structural informa-
tion, the potential impact of the missing segment on overall dynamics, 
and the pragmatic choice to adhere to evolutionarily selected sequences 
for a comprehensive exploration of PET30’s behavior in MD simula-
tions. This strategy was critical for a more nuanced understanding of 
the protein’s structural dynamics and functional implications.
Both systems, PET30𝐹, and PET30𝐵, were simulated in quintupli-
cate to avoid drawing conclusions based on low-probability events due 
to speciﬁc local minima captured by one single trajectory (Knapp et al., 
2018). Each replica composing the energy landscape associated with 
the global movement of PET30 systems can be considered equally rele-
vant. However, each one depicts a diﬀerent ensemble of local minima. 
This way, we must be careful when drawing conclusions based on the 
average of the ﬁve replicas or if the analysis requires consideration 
of speciﬁc energy minima, i.e., analyzing the event occurring in each 
replica separately.
Moreover, we take into consideration the eﬀect of the molecular 
docking method. Docking estimates the binding pose between the pro-
tein and the ligand. However, the protein remains rigid during the 
docking process. Since there is no structure of PET30 co-crystallized 
with PET, we know that our initial PET30𝐵 system is an approximation. 
Employing molecular docking to generate an initial protein-ligand com-
plex structure for MD simulations justiﬁes the diﬃculty of the system 
achieving an optimal conformation of interaction. Thus, we observe dif-
ferent PET30𝐵 replicas exploring distinct levels of interaction with PET. 
Replica 1 shows the PET ligand leaving the binding pocket but even-
tually returning; replicas 2 and 5 show the ligand eventually leaving 
and staying out, interacting with a diﬀerent portion of the protein and; 
replicas 3 and 4 keep the ligand tightly bound at the binding pocket 
throughout the whole simulationSFig.13,20-22.
3.1. Structural proﬁling of PET30: insights and comparison with IsPETase
The whole structure of PET30 comprises 366 residues in total. How-
ever, PDB 7PZJ missed the initial 27 residues and the C-terminal 300-
366; thus, we performed a modeling step. Zhang et al. (Zhang et al., 
2022) demonstrated at a web lab that PET30 keeps its catalytic activity 
unaltered even after removing residues 300 to 366 (called PET30ΔPorC 
in their work); thus, we removed the ﬁnal modeled segment and kept 
the ﬁrst 27 residues (validation results found in SFig.1-4). Comparing 
the structure of our model with IsPETase (PDB 6EQE (Austin et al., 
2018)), the superposition is notable, and the structure’s alignment re-
sults in a 0.735 RMSD valueFig. 2A.
IsPETase has a core 𝛽-sheet composed of 9 𝛽-strands (𝛽1-𝛽9), sur-
rounded by 7 distinct 𝛼-helix (𝛼1-𝛼7) and loops connecting each sec-
ondary structure element. PET30’s 𝛽-sheet core exhibits an extra 𝛽-
strand close to the C-terminal end, labeled as 𝛽10 Fig. 2B. Two addi-
tional helices appeared after we modeled the initial segment of PET30,

which we called 𝛼1’ and 𝛼2”. This naming choice is based on two con-
siderations. First, considering these helices come before the canonical 
ones, we wanted to keep the original numbering of 𝛼1 to 𝛼7. Addi-
tionally, MD results demonstrate that these helices are not stable. DSSP 
analysis shows that 𝛼1’, composed of residues 2-13, quickly turns into 
coil structure; 𝛼1”, comprising residues 15-27, reduces its helix struc-
ture size, with residues 15-18 and 25-27 presenting as a coil for 85% of 
the time; whereas residues 19-24 keeps it helical structure for over 60% 
of the time.
Furthermore, a comparison between PET30 and IsPETase structures 
reveals key distinguished features. First, IsPETase exhibits two disulﬁde 
bridges (Han et al., 2017), while PET30 is described only with one. The 
extra bridge of IsPETase connects two loops that harbor the catalytic 
residues Asp and His, guaranteeing that they do not get too far apart. 
In the position where the analogous Cys residues should be, we ﬁnd a 
Gly and a Val instead. In this sense, we measured the distance between 
Gly195 and Val232 over time. Disulﬁde bonds typically have a length 
of 2.05 Å, with 3.0 Å being used as the PDB database’s cutoﬀ for disul-
ﬁdes (Sun et al., 2017). From our simulations, we observed that the 
PET30𝐹 Gly195-Val232 distance starts at 3.0 Å apart, but this distance 
varies, sometimes increasing until 5.0 Å. For PET30𝐵, the distance is 
even more prominent, starting at 3.0 Å and reaching 6.0 Å around 300 
ns, staying at this distance for almost all the simulationFig. 3D. From 
these insights, it can be inferred that the absence of the expected disul-
ﬁde bridge in PET30 introduces greater ﬂexibility and variability in the 
Gly195-Val232 distance, potentially inﬂuencing the enzyme’s catalytic 
eﬃciency in PET degradation. Since the presence of the PET molecule 
further increases the distance between the residues, it is reasonable to 
assume that the amount of stress over the loop by the presence of the 
ligand aﬀects the PET30 catalytic process. This structural distinction 
oﬀers a plausible explanation for the observed diﬀerences in catalytic 
performance between PET30 and IsPETase. It indicates the importance 
of the disulﬁde bridge in modulating enzymatic activity in the context 
of PET degradation.
One notable structural feature is a conserved string of four Gly 
residues composing the initial segment of the helix 𝛼4 (Gly155-Gly156-
Gly157-Gly158), also present in the IsPETase. Furthermore, PET30 has 
an additional four Gly-residues motif at the initial segment of the he-
lix 𝛼6 (Gly238-Gly239-Gly240-Gly241). Given that Gly residues’ lack 
of side-chain provides them with increased ﬂexibility, they tend to de-
crease helix stability. This decrease in helix stability occurs because 
Gly residues are, in fact, so ﬂexible that the entropy eﬀect accentuates 
enough to drive the structural change from a deﬁned secondary struc-
ture to a loop (Imai and Mitaku, 2005). Surprisingly, DSSP analysis 
reveals that (Gly)4𝛼4 stays as a helix 100% of the time. Diversely, three 
out of 4 Gly residues in the helix 𝛼6 remain as helix for about 35% of 
the time, and the rest show coil behavior.
Another divergence arises when comparing the binding site of 
PET30 and IsPETase. While IsPETase’s binding motif involves Tyr87-
Met161-Trp185 (Tyr-Met-Trp), PET30 substitutes two residues, adopt-
ing Phe80-Met154-Tyr178 (Phe-Met-Tyr) as its auxiliary residues. In-
triguingly, a mutational study of PET30 has illuminated the critical role 
of speciﬁc residues in its catalytic function. Mutants PET30(Phe80Tyr) 
and PET30(Tyr178Trp), as well as a variant featuring both mutations, 
exhibited a loss of activity in degrading PET. These ﬁndings highlight 
the delicate interplay between the binding motif and catalytic activity

in PET-degrading enzymes, emphasizing the intricate relationship be-
tween sequence, structure, and function in these signiﬁcant proteins. 
The role of the auxiliary residues in PET30 will be discussed in more 
depth later.
3.2. The halting of the catalytic triad: when it is time to hold their ground
As shown in Fig. 1C, the enzyme-substrate complex should have a 
speciﬁc residue coordination. The hydrogen from N𝛿 of His230 pairs 
with the oxygen from the Asp198 residue; the hydrogen belonging to 
the hydroxyl group of Ser153 aligns with the N𝜖 of His230 and; the 
oxygen from the hydroxyl group of Ser153 interacts with a carbon from 
the ester group of the substrate molecule. In this sense, we assessed the 
distance among these groups throughout the simulations.
In the presence of the PET molecule, there is a notable reduction in 
the distance between the hydrogen bonded to the nitrogen delta (N𝛿) of 
His230 and the oxygens from Asp198, suggesting a coordinated inter-
actionFig. 3A,C. Additionally, the hydrogen from the Ser153 hydroxyl 
group consistently maintains closer proximity to the nitrogen epsilon 
(N𝜖) of His230 in PET30𝐵 compared to PET30𝐹, providing further ev-
idence of coordination among catalytic residues Fig. 3B. Although the 
distance between Ser153 and the PET molecule remains relatively con-
stant across replicas 3 and 4, their distances vary from the PET center 
of mass SFig.27. Examination of the dihedral distribution of Ser153
SFig.23 reveals a ﬂipping behavior concurrent with shifts of the PET 
molecule within the binding pocket.
Furthermore, RMSD (Fig. 4A) and RMSF (Fig. 4E) demonstrate a 
slightly increased overall backbone position variation relative to the ini-
tial structure and ﬂexibility for PET30𝐵. However, the catalytic residues 
situated in speciﬁc regions of the protein either do not change their de-
gree of ﬂexibility compared to PET30𝐹 or even become less ﬂexible 
in the presence of PET. Moreover, we measured the distance between 
the catalytic residues. This result is consistent with previous observa-
tions from IsPETase. Studies of IsPETase demonstrate the importance of 
certain regions becoming more ﬂexible while retaining the rigidity of 
other regions to maintain catalytic eﬃciency, such as the ﬂexibility of 
Ser214 and Trp185, demonstrated by Liu et al. (2022). They showed 
that Ser214 provides a minor steric hindrance, giving more ﬂexibility 
at the Trp185 site of isPETase, which is beneﬁcial to the wobbling of 
the Trp185 site and stable binding to the PET aromatic ring. For PET30, 
the analogous residues by alignment are His206, respective to Ser214, 
and Tyr178, respective to Trp185. Zhang et al. (2022)tested the muta-
tion Ser214His and observed that while it improved thermostability, it 
also decreased the catalytic eﬃciency, suggesting that this could be a 
potential mutation to improve PET30 eﬃciency. The implication of the 
interaction with Tyr178, one of the auxiliary residues, will be discussed 
next.
3.3. The role of the auxiliary residues: the sidekicks step into the spotlight
Our simulation reveals a signiﬁcant feature of the auxiliary residues 
during the interaction between PET30 and PET. ΔRMSF (Fig. 4E) re-
veals that the catalytic triad residues lessen their ﬂexibility, and the 
three auxiliary residues become more rigid -o r at least keep the same 
level of ﬂexibility of PET30𝐹 -despite the slight overall shifting of RMSF 
towards higher ﬂexibility. This observation suggests that these residues 
attain some level of coordination. To investigate this mechanism fur-
ther, we observed the distances of Phe80-Met154, Phe80-Tyr178, and 
Met154-Tyr178 and their distance to the PET molecule.
Distinct diﬀerences between PET30𝐹 and PET30𝐵 emerge when 
considering simulations where the PET molecule remains tightly bound 
to the binding pocket and those where it detaches. In PET30𝐹 replicas 
and replicas 1, 2, and 5 of PET30𝐵 (where PET detaches brieﬂy), the dis-
tance between Phe80 and Tyr178 exhibits considerable variation over 
time. In contrast, replicas 3 and 4 of PET30𝐵 maintain a consistently 
close distance of approximately 6 Å throughout the entire simulation. 
Upon closer examination of PET30𝐵 replicas 3 and 4 and their interac-
tion with each auxiliary residue and PET, it becomes evident that Phe80 
and Tyr178 maintain a more stable distance from PET than Met154. 
This observation might be because Phe80 and Tyr174 can interact with 
PET through 𝜋-𝜋 stacking.
Furthermore, DSSP analysisSFig.9 indicates that Phe80 and Tyr178 
remain closely associated in the presence of PET despite adopting a 
coil conformation. This observation indicates the PET molecule’s inﬂu-
ence in coordinating these residues, as evidenced by their distinctive

behavior. Additionally, despite being in a coil conformation, Phe80 and 
Tyr178 tend to hold together when interacting with PET. This observa-
tion further underscores the coordinating eﬀect of the PET molecule on 
these auxiliary residues.
3.4. Taking the wrong avenue: when the PET molecule gets lost around the 
protein
The initially available PET30 structure exhibited a catalytic pocket 
conformation unsuitable for binding, as demonstrated by incongruent 
results from molecular docking compared to literature expectations 
Tournier et al. (2020)( s e e Supplementary Materials). Then, ensem-
ble docking was employed to generate PET30 structures more aligned 
with the anticipated binding conformation. Poses exhibiting character-
istics such as an open pocket and proper alignment of catalytic and 
auxiliary residues were selectively chosen. Comparative analysis of var-
ious docking results utilizing diﬀerent PET30 conformations revealed 
a more suitable outcome than the initial docking attempt with the na-
tive PDB structure. Notably, discrepancies in the alignment of catalytic 
residues, especially coordination of the catalytic residues, in the origi-
nal structure were rectiﬁed in the ﬁnal structure, demonstrating correct 
alignment and optimal distance. The selected docking result was then 
utilized in our MD simulations, exhibiting the PET molecule adopting 
an optimal conformation within the catalytic pocket. These simulations 
conﬁrmed the eﬃcacy of the reﬁned approach in capturing the biolog-
ically relevant enzyme-substrate binding conformation within a short 
timeframe.
Our ﬁrst concern was how long the PET molecule would stay in 
contact with the binding site SFig.27. Since our simulations reach the 
microsecond scale, an unbinding event is expected. Generally, residence 
time varies from picoseconds to milliseconds (Huang and Caﬂisch, 
2011), and the PET30 binding site is entirely external to the protein 
structure, composing a shallow pocket. From our simulations, we ob-
served the unbinding of PET in 2 out of 5 replicas, which we kept to 
calculate the averages of each analysis. Replica 2 shows the unbinding 
occurring around 300 ns, where PET leaves the binding pocket, cir-
cles the protein, and lodges in a pocket close to the N- and C-termini 
junctions. Replica 5 shows the ﬁrst unbinding event occurring around 
270 ns, and the PET molecule relocates a few angstroms away from the 
binding pocket but returns to the binding pocket around 300 ns. Later, 
the PET leaves again, around 400 ns. Here, we note that close to the 
binding pocket, a helix, formed by residues 180-185, and an adjacent 
coil, consisting of residues 205-212, are arranged into a road-like pat-
tern, where the PET molecule starts trailing. Most of these residues are 
polar, and only two are aromatic (His206 and His210); we notice that 
Tyr211 is aromatic, but it is the only residue in the helix that keeps 
interacting with the inside residues of the protein, never ﬂipping to in-
teract with the PET molecule. The PET molecule slowly crawls from 
the binding pocket until it starts interacting with the last residues of 
this sideway avenue. However, around 470 ns, it starts moving back-
ward and stops at a position interacting with the initial residues from 
the road (180-182 from the coils and 205-212 from the helix) (Supple-
mentary Material Movie-PET30B5). Replica 1 also shows an unbinding 
around 50 ns, but the PET molecules return to the binding pocket at 
300 ns and stay there until the end of the simulation. Replicas 3 and 4 
maintain the PET molecule tightly bound close to the catalytic site all 
the time.

3.5. Simulations aftermath: contrasting PET30𝐹 and PET30𝐵 dynamics
Next, we will highlight the main observations distinguishing PET30𝐹
and PET30𝐵. RMSD analysis (Fig. 4A) revealed that PET30𝐵 exhibits a 
slightly higher overall backbone position variation than PET30𝐹, par-
ticularly after 100 ns, reaching a signiﬁcant diﬀerence of 0.5 nm at 
approximately 900 ns. This observation suggests that the presence of 
PET introduces a subtle yet cumulative eﬀect on the structure dynamics 
of PET30.
Moreover, ΔRMSF analysis (Fig. 4E) indicate nuanced diﬀerences 
in the ﬂexibility of PET30𝐹 and PET30𝐵. While the overall ΔRMSF dif-
ference is minimal (approximately 0.1 nm), certain regions crucial for 
the catalytic mechanism exhibited signiﬁcant variations. Notably, the 
catalytic triad residues (Ser153, Asp198, and His230) showed distinct 
ﬂexibility patterns, indicating the inﬂuence of PET binding on their dy-
namics.
In the modeled segment (residues 1 to 27), PET30𝐵 displayed higher 
ﬂexibility, particularly around residue 21, showcasing a signiﬁcant con-
trast of 1.3 nm compared to PET30𝐹. Interestingly, the auxiliary residue 
Phe80 region exhibited a marked decrease in ﬂexibility in PET30𝐵, sug-
gesting a potential role in ligand accommodation. Regions surrounding 
catalytic residues displayed consistent ﬂexibility, emphasizing the intri-
cate interplay between ligand binding and enzymatic function.
DSSP analysis unveils distinct secondary structure variations be-
tween PET30𝐹 and PET30𝐵 systems (see SFig.9). Speciﬁcally, in 𝛽-
strand 3 (residues 219-228), the last four residues (225-228) exhibit 
ﬂuctuating conformations between coil and 𝛽-sheet throughout the sim-
ulation. PET30𝐵 maintains a more prolonged 𝛽-sheet conformation in 
this segment than PET30𝐹. Also, residues 229-233, including the cat-
alytic residue His230, alternate between 𝛼-helix and coil conformations. 
PET30𝐵 consistently favors the 𝛼-helix conformation, which is more 
extended than PET30𝐹 in this region. Furthermore, DSSP analysis re-
veals a structural diﬀerence in residue 288, forming a 𝛽-turn between 
𝛽-strands 𝛽9 and 𝛽10. In the presence of the ligand, this residue adopts 
a coil conformation exclusively, contrasting with PET30𝐹, where it spo-
radically assumes a 𝛽-sheet conformation. This observation aligns with 
the dRMSF results, indicating reduced ﬂexibility in the absence of the 
ligand. Residues 226-228, forming a loop between 𝛽-strand 𝛽8 and he-
lix 𝛼6, exhibit a 𝛽-strand conformation more frequently (25% of the 
time) in the presence of the PET molecule, compared to the free en-
zyme state (15% of the time). The ﬂexibility analysis of residue 152, 
adjacent to the catalytic Ser153, shows a balanced distribution between 
helix, 𝛽-sheet, and coil conformations, consistent across both PET30𝐹
and PET30𝐵. Notably, the helix 𝛼2 (residues 83-96) displays dynamic 
variations over time, with residue 83 evenly splitting between helix 
and coil, residues 84-88 favoring helix (55% of the time), residues 89-
94 consistently adopting a helix conformation, residue 95 displaying a 
75% helix conformation, and residue 96 favoring a coil conformation 
(90% of the time).
Furthermore, PCA revealed substantial distinctions between the 
PET30𝐹 and PET30𝐵 systems Fig. 5A,B. While the initial positions of 
each replica were nearly identical, with minor diﬀerences arising dur-
ing equilibration, a noticeable divergence in energy distribution became 
evident. Each replica portrayed a unique distribution, and our analyses 
depicted two distinct pieces of information: clusters formed by the tra-
jectory of each replica and clusters formed by the density of points.
The PC1 vs PC2 plot for PET30𝐹 displayed a more continuous land-
scape, suggesting that the enzyme ﬂuctuates more freely among energy 
minima when unbound. In contrast, the PC1 vs PC2 plot for PET30𝐵 ex-
hibited a more distinctive cluster, with some clusters entirely isolated 
from others. These ﬁndings indicate that the enzyme adopts speciﬁc 
conformations during interaction with the PET molecule. A compar-
ison of the density plots revealed that PET30𝐵 had a higher density 
at speciﬁc points, while PET30𝐹 exhibited lower density with more 
distributed points. Notably, points from replicas 2 and 5 in PET30𝐵
remained closer to the initial position. Furthermore, looking into the 
movies showing the principal movements captured in PCA of PET30𝐹
and PET30𝐵 (Supplementary material Movie-PCA-PET30𝐹 and Movie-
PET30𝐵), we observe that when the PET molecule is present, the cat-
alytic residues Ser152 and Asp198 hold theirposition close together. At 
the same time, His230 moves, closing its distance to the other catalytic 
residues, indicating increased coordination among them. On the other 
hand, in the absence of PET, the residues Asp198 and His230 ﬂuctuate 
more, suggesting a lower level of coordination compared to PET30𝐵.
In the context of the free energy proﬁle generated from the prob-
ability distributions of PC1 and PC2, a signiﬁcant diﬀerence emerged 
between PET30𝐹 and PET30𝐵. The global minimum energy for PET30𝐹
was -17.1 kJ/mol, whereas PET30𝐵 reached -19.2 kJ/mol, indicat-
ing a diﬀerence of 2.1 kJ/mol. Furthermore, PET30𝐵 exhibited four 
well-separated small clusters, each reaching approximately -15 kJ/mol. 
In contrast, PET30𝐹 displayed a more scattered energy distribution, 
featuring one large cluster at -10 kJ/mol, four clusters within the 
larger one reaching -11 kJ/mol, and three smaller clusters reaching -
14 kJ/mol, where one of them contains the global minimum cluster.
The outcomes obtained from the R𝑔 analysis (Fig. 4C) demonstrate 
a consistent similarity between PET30𝐹 and PET30𝐵, indicating virtu-
ally identical values. Both systems exhibit a slight compaction trend 
throughout the simulation. In the context of hydrogen bond analysis, 
it is observed that both PET30𝐹 and PET30𝐵 maintain a comparable 
number of internal hydrogen bonds (Fig. 4D), with these numbers ex-
hibiting no signiﬁcant variation throughout the simulation. SASA anal-
ysis (Fig. 4B) reveals a marginal increase in the overall surface area of 
the protein when interacting with the PET molecule. Notably, around 
the 800 ns mark, the SASA values for PET30𝐹 and PET30𝐵 converge, 
suggesting a comparable surface area in the simulation. These ﬁnd-
ings collectively suggest that the structural behavior variation between 
PET30𝐹 and PET30𝐵 is nuanced, and importantly, the presence of PET 
does not exert an abrasive impact on this enzyme.
4. Conclusions
PET30, identiﬁed as an esterase, exhibits activity in degrading PET, 
albeit with a lower catalytic eﬃciency than IsPETase. Nevertheless, our 
MD investigation reveals a favorable interaction between PET30 and 
PET. Furthermore, studying an enzyme with reduced catalytic eﬃciency 
provides a unique perspective on the evolution of plastic-degrading en-
zymes, shedding light on the ongoing process of adaptation toward PET 
degradation. The comparatively lower catalytic eﬃciency of PET30 sig-
niﬁes a stage in its evolutionary trajectory, suggesting that this enzyme 
is still ﬁne-tuning its mechanisms for optimal PET degradation. This 
perspective contributes to our understanding of the dynamic nature of 
enzyme evolution in the context of plastic degradation, paving the way 
for future endeavors in designing more robust and eﬃcient biocatalysts 
for addressing environmental challenges posed by synthetic polymers.
In conclusion, our ﬁndings demonstrate the intricate interplay be-
tween PET30 and PET, providing a molecular-level understanding of 
how the enzyme responds to and interacts with its substrate. These in-
sights contribute valuable knowledge for the rational design of enzymes 
with enhanced PET-degrading capabilities, thereby advancing eﬀorts in 
combating plastic pollution.
