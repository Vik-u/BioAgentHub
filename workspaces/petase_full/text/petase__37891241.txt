Evidence for microbial biodegradation of polyethylene terephthalate (PET) has been reported,
but little is known about the PET biodegradation process and molecular mechanism by
marine microorganisms. Here, we show the biodegradation of PET by the membrane-
anchored PET esterase from the marine bacteriumRhodococcus pyridinivorans P23, elucidate
the properties of this enzyme, and propose the PET biodegradation by this strain in bioﬁlm.
We identify the PET-degrading enzyme dubbed PET esterase through activity tracking. In
addition to depolymerizing PET, it hydrolyzes MHET into TPA under acid conditions. We
prove that it is a low and constitutively transcribed, membrane-anchored protein displayed on
the cell surface. Furthermore, we also investigate the microbial groups possessing PET
esterase coupled with the TPA degradation pathway, mainly in the phylaProteobacteria and
Actinobacteriota. Clariﬁcation of the microbial PET biodegradation in the marine environment
will contribute to the understanding of bioremediation of marine PET pollution.

P
lastics are widely produced and used in daily life due to
their light weight,ﬁrmness, easy processing, low price, and
good insulator. According to‘Plastic Europe’(https://www.
plasticseurope.org/en), 390.7 million tons of plastics were pro-
duced worldwide in 2021, and the production of polyethylene
terephthalate (PET) plastics accounted for 6.2% of plastics.
Between 1950 and 2015, a total of 6.3 billion tons of primary and
secondary (recycled) plastic waste was generated, of which
around 9% has been recycled, and 12% incinerated, with the
remaining 79% either being stored in landﬁlls or having been
released directly into the natural environment 1. The oceanic
environment has been recognized as a major sink for anthro-
pogenic plastic waste discharged from land-based sources2.A
particular concern is the occurrence of smaller pieces of plastic
debris in the world’s oceans, including those have dimensions
ranging from a few μm to 500 μm (5 mm), referred to as
‘microplastics’. Particles of microplastics are commonly present
in seawater or sediments from coastal areas to the ocean and even
in the deepest part of the world’s ocean, the Mariana Trench3–7.I t
was estimated that 81.98 to 357.56 trillion particles weighed 1.11
to 4.86 million tons ofﬂoating plastics in the world’s oceans in
20198.
In recent years, concern over plastic pollution of the marine
environment and ecosystem has been raising. Marine ﬂoating
microplastics will be ingested by zooplankton, which are later
egested within their fecal pellets and precipitated into marine
sediments as a food source for marine organisms9. The large
plastic debris dumps accumulated in deep-sea submarine canyons
are unique hot spots for environmental pollution, re ﬂecting
anthropogenic activities and biodiversity hot spots for benthic
organisms10. Marine microorganisms can degrade long-chain
plastic polymers into dissolved organic matter and particulate
organic matter, which will become the food of higher-level
marine plankton, thus affecting the existing state of the whole
marine food web11. A diverse microbial community of hetero-
trophs, autotrophs, predators, and symbionts, referred to as the
“Plastisphere”, was unveiled from plastic marine debris12.
Many plastics are transported into the marine environment
each year, bringing a large amount of carbon source for marine
microorganisms, which will impact their carbon assimilation
pattern and affect the diversity and ecological distribution of the
marine microbial population. Marine microorganismsﬁrst attach
to the plastic surface to form a bioﬁlm, then depolymerize it into
smaller molecules before crossing the cell membrane13. In addi-
tion to the carbon cycle impacted by the assimilation of plastic,
other biogeochemical cycles, including nitrogen, sulfur, iron,
manganese, chromium, phosphorus, calcium, and silicate cycles,
may also be impacted by the presence of plastic at sea 11.
Microplastics in coastal salt marsh sediments alter sediment
microbial community composition and nitrogen cycling
processes14. In another research, the plastisphere in estuaries
exhibits a higher denitrifying activity and N2O production than
surrounding bulk water, suggesting an overlooked N2O source15.
At present, microbial degradation of plastic is a promising eco-
friendly strategy, representing a great opportunity to manage
waste plastics with no adverse impacts. Therefore, plastic-
degrading microorganisms are considered as a tool for the bior-
emediation of plastic contamination in aquatic environments16.
Until now, a large number of microbial strains have been
reported being able to biodegrade PET, including bacteria, fungi,
and microalgae17. A strain Ideonella sakaiensis 201-F6 was iso-
lated from consortium No. 46, isolated from the samples collected
at a PET-bottle recycling site in Japan, as a bacterium that was
mainly involved in the degradation of PET18. In addition, many
marine plastic degrading strains were isolated and proved to be
able to grow using PET as carbon source19–21. PET with ester
bond can be attacked by various extracellular hydrolases of
microorganisms22,23. Cutinases from various microorganisms,
including Thermobiﬁda fusca 24, and Moniliophthora roreri 25
could carry out PET hydrolysis. In 2016, anI. sakaiensisenzyme
dubbed PETase (Is-PETase) was found to efﬁciently depolymerize
PET primarily to mono(2-hydroxyethyl) terephthalic acid
(MHET) units, along with minor quantities of terephthalic acid
(TPA) and bis(2-hydroxyethyl)-TPA (BHET) under mesophilic
conditions18. From then on, scientists worldwide made great
efforts on the crystal structure resolution and improving the
enzyme activity and stability ofIs-PETase26–30. Recently, a PET
hydrolase from Cryptosporangium aurantiacum (CaPETase) was
reported to exhibit high thermostability and remarkable PET
degradation activity at ambient temperatures31. In addition to
terrestrial habitats, PET hydrolases could also originate from
marine environments32. In another research, a candidate PETase-
like gene (SM14est) was identiﬁed in marine-sponge associated
Streptomyces sp. SM14 through in silico screening33. A marine
microbial community was isolated using Poly(butylene adipate-
co-terephthalate) (PBAT) as the sole carbon source, and six
putative PETase-like enzymes and four putative MHETase-like
enzymes were identiﬁed34.
Any surface in the marine environment, including plastic, will
be colonized with micro- and macroorganisms 35. The PET-
colonizing microbial communities ’ assembly on plastics was
driven by conventional marine bioﬁlm processes and differed
signiﬁcantly from free-living communities36. Bacteria and fungi
were shown to form bioﬁlms on plastic surfaces and had some
differences in bioﬁlm formation and maturation according to the
plastic type11,37. The 16S rRNA microbiome proﬁles of microbial
bioﬁlms of ﬂoating plastics and sediment-associated plastics dif-
fered signiﬁcantly from sediments of the same geographic loca-
tion, and the bacterial community composition was plastic nature
dependent38. In addition to plastic type, environmental condi-
tions, including water temperature, salinity, and pH, also play a
role in the formation of a plastic-speciﬁc microbial community39.
In a recent study, the rod-like, ﬁlamentous, and peanut-like
morphologies of the corrosion structures are directly observed in
the marine PE plastic surface, which are well in line with those of
microorganisms, suggesting that they were derived from the
biodegradation of marine microorganisms on them40.
In this study, We identiﬁed a PET esterase from the marine
bacterium Rhodococcus pyridinivorans P23 through BHET
hydrolysis activity tracking and heterologous expression inE. coli
BL21(DE3). We elucidated the characteristics of the PET esterase
through enzyme activity determination, and revealed the PET
biodegradation pathway in this strain through genome sequen-
cing and transcriptome analysis. Further, we proposed the PET
biodegradation process by R. pyridinivorans P23 in marine
environments.
Results
Isolation and identi ﬁcation of a PET-degrading marine
strain P23. Several marine strains were screened from deep-sea
sediment enrichment culture with PET powder as the sole carbon
and energy source for growth. Among these PET-degrading
strains, a gram-positive strain termed P23 (Supplementary Fig. 1)
was selected for further investigation as it grows in a mineral salt
medium with PET ﬁlm and with TPA as the sole carbon
and energy source. The strain P23 (CCTCC accession NO:
CCTCC M2019609) showed the highest 16S rRNA gene
sequence similarity toRhodococcus pyridinivorans DSM44555(T)
(99.93%) in EzbioCloud database. Average Nucleotide Identity
(ANI) value of 95.16% was obtained via ANI Calculator in
EzbioCloud using strain P23 andR. pyridinivoransDSM44555(T)

(GCA_900105195.1) genomes. A phylogenetic tree showed that
strain P23 was more related to type strain Rhodococcus pyr-
idinivorans DSM44555(T) than other type strains ofRhodococcus
species (Supplementary Fig. 2). Therefore, strain P23 was desig-
nated as Rhodococcus pyridinivorans. Cells of Rhodococcus pyr-
idinivorans P23 are Gram stain-positive, non-motile, and rod-
shaped (Fig. 1a). During the cultivation ofR. pyridinivorans P23
on a mineral salt medium agar plate with PETﬁlm covered on the
agar, a visible bioﬁlm on the surface especially the edge of the
PET ﬁlm was formed (Fig.1b). When the bioﬁlm was observed
under a scanning electron microscope (SEM), some appendages
of the cells were observed between the cells and the PETﬁlm;
these might assist in the attachment of cells to the PET ﬁlm
(Fig. 1c).
Biodegradation of PET ﬁlm and determination of biode-
gradation products released byR. pyridinivoransP23. WhenR.
pyridinivorans P23 was cultivated in mineral salt medium with a
piece of PETﬁlm (8.0 cm × 8.0 cm × 0.013 mm) as sole carbon
and energy source in aﬂask for 7 days, an increase in the strain
biomass concentration, i.e., OD600 from 0.08 after inoculation to
0.34 at the end of cultivation was observed (Fig.2a). After 5 weeks
of cultivation of R. pyridinivorans P23, totally 4.03 mg of PET
weight loss accounted for 4.28% was achieved (Fig. 2b). High
performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) was applied to
investigate the products released from the PETﬁlm in theﬂask
cultivation, spectrum showed that TPA (retention time 10.2 min)
and MHET (11.2 min) were the main released products in all the
three samples, 8 h, 30 h and 7 d, while BHET (12.0 min) was only
detected in 8 h with less content as it could be easily transformed
into MHET by R. pyridinivorans P23 cells (Fig. 2c). Only tiny
amount of MHET and TPA could be detected in the 7 d culti-
vation sample of negative control without inoculation ofR. pyr-
idinivorans P23 (Fig. 2c).
Tracking ofR. pyridinivorans P23 PET esterase activity. In the
cultivation of R. pyridinivorans P23 with BHET (0.2 mg/ml) or
MHET (0.5 mg/ml) as the sole carbon and energy source in pH
7.0 for 120 h, the strain biomass concentration, i.e., OD600 were
both slowly increased (Supplementary Fig. 3a, b). In the BHET
cultivation, BHET was degraded into MHET rapidly as soon as
the inoculation ofR. pyridinivoransP23 cells, which was prepared
from 2216 marine broth cultivation in a test tube (Supplementary
Fig. 3a). Obviously, the BHET hydrolase was very likely to be
present in the inoculum. In the MHET cultivation, a gradual
degradation of MHET was observed accompanying the growth of
this strain (Supplementary Fig. 3b). Due to the large molecular
weight of PET, it is difﬁcult to transport through the cell mem-
brane. The PET hydrolase must be either secreted outside the cells
or displayed on the cell membrane facing outside. Commonly,
PET hydrolase also possesses BHET hydrolase activity due to the
similarity of structures of the two substrates. In order to deter-
mine the exact location of PET hydrolase,R. pyridinivorans P23
was ﬁrst cultivated in 2216 marine broth medium for 28 h
(Supplementary Fig. 3c), sampled from 16 to 28 h with 4 h
interval, centrifuged to separate the cells and supernatant and
then subjected to BHET hydrolase activity determination. The
MHET accumulation increased from 0.31 mM to 0.50 mM in 16
to 28 h cultured cells due to the increased number of cells sam-
pled, and no MHET production was detected in the supernatant
sample (Supplementary Fig. 4). Obviously, the BHET hydrolase
(PET hydrolase) on the cell membrane ofR. pyridinivorans P23
exhibited deﬁnite BHET hydrolase activity, while the supernatant
did not.
Genome sequencing of R. pyridinivorans P23 and PET
hydrolase analysis. To explore the PET hydrolase and the bio-
degradation pathway of the PET, the complete genome of strain
R. pyridinivorans P23 was constructed based on co-assembly of
short reads (150 bp × 2) and long reads (average 402,955 bp)
derived from Illumina Hiseq and PacBio sequencing, respectively.
The complete genome ofR. pyridinivoransP23 consists of a circle
chromosome of 5,295,424 bp with 68.20% GC content and four
plasmids of 580,882 bp (plasmid A, 64.00% GC content),
249,161 bp (plasmid B, 63.37% GC content), 177,490 bp (plasmid
C, 65.96% GC content), and 65,561 bp (plasmid D, 64.78% GC
content), respectively (Supplementary Fig. 5). The genome ofR.
pyridinivorans P23 encodes 5,647 proteins, 12 rRNAs, and 55
tRNAs. The complete genome sequence ofR. pyridinivoransP23
has been submitted to GenBank with the accession numbers
CP113798-CP113802. Totally 1,044 proteins with 0 –24 trans-
membrane domains were found through the TMHMM server
V2.0 (http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/TMHMM/). As PET is a
synthetic polymer consisting of ester bond-linked terephthalate
and ethylene glycol, esterases, lipases, cutinases, and alpha/
beta-hydrolases are thought to hydrolyze PET through the
ester bond. In these transmembrane proteins, eight proteins
were found to be designated as esterase (OQN32_06240), cutinase
(OQN32_01115), or alpha/beta-hydrolase (OQN32_03920,
OQN32_04705, OQN32_07550, OQN32_07555, OQN32_15860,
OQN32_18580) displaying outside the cell membrane (Supple-
mentary Table 1, Supplementary Fig. 6).
Heterologous expression, function identiﬁcation, and sequence
analysis of PET esterase OQN32_06240. After removing the
transmembrane domains, the eight gene candidates of PET
hydrolase were commercially synthesized with codon optimization
and cloned into pET-30a vector for expression inEscherichia coli
BL21(DE3) (Sangon, Shanghai, China). Cells ofE. coliBL21 (DE3)
mutant strains harboring these genes were induced by 0.5 mM
IPTG at 20 °C, collected by centrifugation, and disrupted by
sonication. The cell lysates were then subjected to SDS-PAGE
analysis and BHET hydrolysis for activity conﬁrmation. Results
showed that the eight proteins were all successfully synthesized
in soluble form in the supernatant of E. coli lysates, and
only OQN32_06240, an esterase, could hydrolyze BHET (Supple-
mentary Fig. 7). After that, heterologous expression of PET esterase
(OQN32_06240) with 6×His tag was puri ﬁed by Ni-af ﬁnity

chromatography technique. SDS-PAGE electropherogram showed
that it was a homogeneous protein with molecular weight of
34 kDa (Fig.3a). Predicted from TMHMM 2.0 server, PET esterase
(OQN32_06240) harbored a 1–12 amino acid residues domain
inside, a 13–35 amino acid residues transmembrane domain and a
36–340 amino acid residues catalytic domain displayed outside the
cell membrane (Supplementary Fig. 8). The three-dimensional
structure of PET esterase (OQN32_06240) was predicted with
AlphaFold2 and found to be most identical to esterase 2 (EST2)
from Alicyclobacillus acidocaldarius41 (Supplementary Fig. 9). The
amino acid sequences of PET esterase (OQN32_06240) and
esterase 2 (EST2, 1EVQ) were aligned with Mega 6.0. Based on the
study of this thermophilic Esterase41, the amino acid residues
(S155D252H282 in 1EVQ and S 175D277H313 in OQN32_06240)
forming a catalytic triad (shaded in yellow) were identiﬁed (Sup-
plementary Fig. 8). The GXSXG motif conserved in α/β-fold
hydrolases such as esterases and lipases was overlined (Supple-
mentary Fig. 8). Multiple amino acid sequences of PET esterase
(OQN32_06240) and known PET hydrolytic enzymes were aligned
with Mega 6.0, and the guide tree was obtained based on the
neighbor-joining method. From the phylogenetic tree, PET esterase
(OQN32_06240) belonging to the Abhydrolase_3 subfamily was
found to be distinct from MHETase (tannase family), and known
PET hydrolytic enzymes, including Is-PETase (Abhydrolase_5)
(Fig. 3b).
Characterization of PET esterase (OQN32_06240) towards
PET ﬁlm. We tested the enzymatic activity of PET esterase
(OQN32_06240) with substrates BHET and PET ﬁlm, respec-
tively. When PETﬁlm was used as the substrate of PET esterase
(OQN32_06240) at 30 °C, the main products were TPA, MHET
and BHET in pH 3.0–5.0, while only MHET and BHET were
detected in pH 5.5–8.0 (Fig. 4a). PET esterase (OQN32_06240)
showed relatively high enzymatic activity in pH 4.0–5.0 and best
at pH 4.5 with totally 0.92μM products (0.37μM TPA, 0.48μM
MHET and 0.07μM BHET) released (Fig.4a, e). The character-
istic of PET esterase (OQN32_06240) with good activity under
acidic conditions differs from Is-PETase, which is more active
under alkaline conditions18. As PET esterase (OQN32_06240) is a
transmembrane protein displaying on the cell surface ofR. pyr-
idinivorans P23, the strain could be used as whole-cell biocatalyst
towards PET ﬁlm and BHET. When PETﬁlm was used as sub-
strate at 30 °C with whole-cell biocatalyst at OD600 of 1.0, the
enzymatic activity in pH 3.0–4.5 was relatively high with more

than 1.5 μM compounds (TPA and MHET) released, of which
more than 94.0% was TPA (Fig.4b, e). In pH 3.0–5.0 enzymatic
degradation solution, the released compounds were found to be
mainly TPA, while more than 87.2% of MHET was detected in
pH 5.5–8.0 enzymatic degradation solutions (Fig.4b). At pH 4.5
and 30 °C, with the increase of puriﬁed enzyme concentration
from 0.2 to 3.0μM, the totally released compounds also increased
from 0.42 to 1.41 μM (Fig. 4c). The puri ﬁed PET esterase
(OQN32_06240) exhibited relatively high enzymatic activity at
25–30 °C and best at 30 °C (Fig.4d). It could be speculated from
these results that PET esterase (OQN32_06240) ﬁrst degraded
PET into mainly MHET with a small amount of BHET, then
hydrolyzed MHET into TPA in acidic conditions (pH 3.0–5.0).
Characterization of PET esterase (OQN32_06240)
towards BHET . To verify our speculation, PET esterase
(OQN32_06240) from heterologous expression in E. coli and
whole-cell biocatalyst anchoring on the cell surface were both
used to catalyze BHET. We tested the BHET degradation activity
of puriﬁed PET esterase (OQN32_06240) from E. coli with
1.0 mM BHET as substrate in the pH 3.0–8.0 buffers at 30 °C.
Results indicated that it had relatively high enzymatic activity at
pH 3.5–7.5 and best activity at pH 7.0, with 40.7% BHET
transformed to MHET in 48 h (Fig. 5a, g). When cells of R.
pyridinivorans P23 were used as whole-cell biocatalyst (OD
600 of
1.0) towards 1.0 mM BHET at 30 °C in pH 3.0–8.0 buffers,
27.2–56.4% BHET were transformed into MHET in 30 min
(Fig. 5b, g). At this time, as BHET was the main component in the
reaction solution, PET esterase was occupied by BHET, and
MHET could hardly be catalyzed into TPA. As the reaction time
extended to 16 h, almost all BHET were transformed into MHET
and then TPA. TPA in the enzymatic supernatant accounts for
5.25–49.05% in pH 3.0–6.0 buffers, with the highest proportion of
49.05% at pH 4.5 (Fig.5c, g). In contrast, only 0.3–1.4% TPA
could be detected in pH 6.5–8.0 buffers (Fig. 5c). The Kcat/Km
value of puriﬁed PET esterase (OQN32_06240) was determined
to be 1.63 M−1 S−1 towards BHET at pH 4.5, 30 °C (Supple-
mentary Fig. 10a).
PET esterase (OQN32_06240) degrades MHET to TPA in the
acidic environment. We also determined the enzymatic activity
of PET esterase (OQN32_06240) towards MHET. When 1.0 mM
MHET was served as the substrate of 5.0 μM PET esterase
(OQN32_06240) at 30 °C, results indicated that it had relatively
high enzymatic activity in pH 3.5–5.0 with 2.2–3.6% of MHET
degraded and highest enzymatic activity at pH 4.5 with 3.6%
MHET transformed to TPA in 48 h (Fig.5d, h). Besides, less than
1.0% of MHET was degraded into TPA in the pH 3.0 and 5.5–8.0
(Fig. 5d). The same proﬁle was observed when cells ofR. pyr-
idinivorans P23 were used as whole-cell biocatalyst (OD600 1.0)
and 1.0 mM MHET was served as the substrate at 30 °C. When
the reactions were performed for 5 h, 20.0–23.7% of MHET was
transformed into TPA in pH 3.5–5.0, in which conditions were
suitable for PET esterase (OQN32_06240) to degrade MHET
(Fig. 5e, h). R. pyridinivorans P23 cells exhibited relatively high
enzymatic activity at pH 3.0 –5.5 with 16.9–49.3% of MHET
degraded and highest enzymatic activity at pH 4.5 with 49.3%
MHET transformed to TPA in 16 h (Fig.5f, h). Predictably, less
than 5.0% of MHET was degraded into TPA in pH 6.0 –8.0
(Fig. 5f). The difference between the enzymes anchoring on the
cell membrane and the free-moving enzymes is that the
anchoring one can withstand a more acidic environment, and
work in lower pH conditions. TheKcat/Km value of puriﬁed PET
esterase (OQN32_06240) was determined to be 0.102 M−1 S−1
towards MHET at pH 4.5, 30 °C (Supplementary Fig. 10b).
PET degradation pathway inR. pyridinivorans P23. The pro-
cesses of PET degradation, TPA transportation, and degradation
in R. pyridinivorans P23 were illustrated in Fig. 6a. In R. pyr-
idinivorans P23, cell membrane anchoring PET esterase encoded
by a chromosome gene with the locus of OQN32_06240 ﬁrst
hydrolyzes PET to produce MHET (the primary product) and
tiny BHET. Then, PET esterase (OQN32_06240) hydrolyzes
MHET to TPA and EG further, which is more effective under
acidic conditions. InR. pyridinivorans P23, TPA is incorporated
through the TPA transporter (PcaK, OQN32_25295) and cata-
bolized by TPA 1,2-dioxygenase (TPADO, OQN32_25275,
OQN32_25280, OQN32_25290), followed by 1,2-dihydroxy-3,5-
cyclohexadiene-1,4-dicarboxylate dehydrogenase (DCDDH,
OQN32_25285) to produce protocatechuic acid (PCA) (Supple-
mentary Table 2, Supplementary Fig. 11). Theseﬁve genes and
gene OQN32_25270 encoding a regulatory protein PcaR are
clustered on the pA plasmid. The resultant PCA is ring-cleaved
by PCA 3,4-dioxygenase (Pca34, OQN32_09320, OQN32_09325)
and further catabolized by enzymes arranged in another operon
(OQN32_22690-OQN32_22715) located on the chromosome
(Supplementary Table 2, Supplementary Fig. 11).
Differential RNA-seq analysis of TPA/PET degradation path-
way enzymes of cells derived from different culture conditions.
The gene transcription level of PET esterase (OQN32_06240) was
similar under TPA and 2216 marine broth culture conditions but
lower in PET culture condition as the cell growth was relatively
slow under this condition (Supplementary Table 3). These results
indicated that PET esterase (OQN32_06240) was a constructive
expression enzyme and not inducible by PET. The mRNA
abundance of the genes involved in the TPA degradation pathway
(OQN32_25270-OQN32_25295) increased in both TPA and PET
cultured conditions, especially when 5.0 mM of TPA was served
as the substrate, the genes’ transcription level increased more
signiﬁcantly (Supplementary Table 3). For instance, the tran-
scriptional level ofpcaK encoding an MFS transporter, which was
proposed to serve as a TPA transporter inR. pyridinivoransP23,
was up-regulated from RPKM value of 3.94 in 2216 marine broth
culture condition to RPKM values of 15.53 and 16,043.44 in PET
and TPA culture conditions, respectively (Supplementary
Table 3). This indicated that TPA was released from PET into the
culture supernatant to induce high transcription level of TPA
degradation pathway-related genes when R. pyridinivorans P23
was cultured with PET. As we mentioned in Fig.2b, in the PET
ﬁlm cultivation, a total of 4.03 mg weight loss of PET indicated
only 0.14 mM TPA and EG each were released gradually into the
culture medium in the culture period as long as ﬁve weeks.
Besides, the TPA transportation and consumption was accom-
panying its production, which resulted in a low concentration of
TPA in the culture medium during the long culture process. As a
result, the increased fold change of the transcription level of the
genes involved in the TPA degradation pathway was relatively
low in the PET cultured condition, compared with the TPA
culture condition. The transcription level of genes involved in the
PCA degradation pathway was also up-regulated under PET and
TPA culture conditions (Supplementary Table 3).

Discussion
Based on the results, we proposed a model for PET biodegradation
by R. pyridinivoransP23 in the marine environment, in whichR.
pyridinivorans P23 attached to PET surface forming bio ﬁlm
(Fig. 6b). As the PET esterase (OQN32_06240) is anchoring on the
cell surface of R. pyridinivorans P23, free-living marine R. pyr-
idinivorans P23 cells have to attach to the PET surface for the
biodegradation of PET (Fig.6b, step 1). After the attachment ofR.
pyridinivorans P23 to PET, the constitutive expression of PET
esterase (OQN32_06240) hydrolyzed PET, producing mainly
MHET, which would be retained in the bioﬁlm on the PET surface
(Fig. 6b, step 2). With the accumulation of MHET, the micro-
environment between the bioﬁlm and PET surface became acidic
due to the carboxyl group of MHET. The MHET hydrolysis
activity of PET esterase (OQN32_06240) was then activated, which
contributed to the hydrolysis of MHET and the accumulation of
TPA, causing the microenvironment between bioﬁlm and PET
surface to become more acidic (Fig.6b, step 3). Then, the TPA
transporter would be induced to express due to the accumulation
of TPA, which would be transported into cells for complete oxi-
dation to provide energy and carbon source for bioﬁlm propaga-
tion (Fig. 6b step 4). In addition to the TPA transporter, other
genes involved in the TPA degradation pathway would be induced
in bioﬁlm, according to the preliminary RNA-seq results ofﬂask
cultivation ofR. pyridinivoransP23 with PET and TPA (Supple-
mentary Table 3), and contribute to the utilization of TPA. In this
model, the characteristics of PET esterase (OQN32_06240)
including cell surface anchoring, constitutive expression, and PET,
BHET and MHET (in acid environment) hydrolysis activities were
all conﬁrmed in this study. The retention of MHET and TPA by
bioﬁlms results in creating an acidic microenvironment was
speculated based on the MHET hydrolysis activity of PET esterase
(OQN32_06240) in acid environment. As MHET was produced
from the PET surface under the coverage of bioﬁlm, steep gradients
of MHET concentration and pH were produced in the bioﬁlm,
which caused the heterogeneous physiological activity of the bio-
ﬁlm. The cells close to the plastic surface in the bioﬁlm are easier to
obtain TPA for proliferation, while the cells far away from the
plastic surface gradually become extinct due to less acquiring of
TPA. This can ensure the cells in the bioﬁlm closer to the plastic
have the vitality to provide PET degrading enzymes to decompose
PET for the bioﬁlm propagation on PET. In this model, bioﬁlm
plays two crucial roles in the biodegradation of PET. Bioﬁlm will
retain the released products, prevent them from losing in the
ocean, and ensure the carbon source supply of microorganisms.
Besides, the bioﬁlm will separate the acid microenvironment on the
plastic surface under its coverage from the alkaline seawater,
making sure the activation of MHET hydrolase activity of PET
esterase (OQN32_06240). In the ﬂask cultivation of R. pyr-
idinivorans P23 with PET, the biodegraded products would be
released into the culture supernatant for acquiring by cells. How-
ever, in marine conditions, the bioﬁlm formation on plastic is a
crucial and smart strategy to retain the released products.
Bioﬁlm is one of the Earth ’s most widely distributed and
successful modes of life42. The bacterial colonization and bioﬁlm
formation on different plastic surfaces, including low-density
polyethylene (LDPE), PS, and PET, has been widely reported43,44.
As plastics and bioﬁlms have a complicated relationship, the
precise mechanism of bio ﬁlm to degrade plastic for its pro-
liferation is still unclear until now. In marine environments, PET
not only provides a surface for attachment, colonization, and
bioﬁlm formation of marine bacteria, but also a carbon source for
PET-degrading marine microorganisms. This study clariﬁed the
formation and survival mechanism of R. pyridinivorans P23
bioﬁlm on PET surface. In marine environments, the community
composition of bioﬁlm on plastic is certainly much more com-
plicated, and R. pyridinivorans P23 deﬁnitely plays a crucial role
in the bioﬁlm community.
PET esterase (OQN32_06240) hydrolyzes PET to produce
MHET (the primary product) and tiny BHET, which is similar to
that of PETase from Ideonella sakaiensis 201-F6 (Is-PETase)18.
Compared with the typical Is-PETase, PET esterase of R. pyr-
idinivorans P23 has several distinct characteristics. First, in R.
pyridinivorans P23, PET esterase is a cell membrane anchoring
protein displaying on the cell surface, while theIs-PETase is a
secretory one released into the environment18. The difference
between the existence patterns of these two PET hydrolase is
presumed to be closely related to the isolation habitats of the two
strains. Ideonella sakaiensis201-F6 was isolated from PET bottle
recycling site18,w h i l eR. pyridinivorans P23 was from a marine
sediment sample. The marine environment requires that the PET-
degrading enzyme of marine microorganisms cannot be secreted;
otherwise, the enzyme will be lost after being secreted and cannot
be utilized to degrade PET for the survival of themselves. Secondly,
Is-PETase is inducible, while PET esterase ofR. pyridinivoransP23
is in a low and constitutive expression mode, which could be
attributed to the spatial limitations of the cell membrane on which
it anchors. Thirdly, although most PET hydrolases were reported
to have MHET hydrolase activity, none was activated under an
acid environment like PET esterase ofR. pyridinivoransP2318.T h e
MHET hydrolase activity of PET esterase fromR. pyridinivorans
P23 is generally inactive in seawater (about pH 8). Thus, the bio-
ﬁlm formation on the PET surface byR. pyridinivoransP23 would
make the microenvironment between the surfaces of PET and
bioﬁlm relatively cut off from alkaline seawater. With the gradual
release of MHET from PET into the microenvironment under the
catalysis of PET esterase fromR. pyridinivorans P23, the micro-
environment would turn acid gradually, being suitable for MHET
hydrolysis by PET esterase.
PET esterase (OQN32_06240) presents in the phylogenetic tree
on a branch quite far away from known PET hydrolytic enzymes
including Is-PETase (Abhydrolase_5) (Fig.3b). In this study, PET
esterase (OQN32_06240) was identiﬁed based on PET degrading
strain isolation followed by active PET hydrolase tracking and
identiﬁcation, which was more likely to discover enzymes with
distinct sequences. Thus, PET esterase (OQN32_06240) would
provide an enzyme sequence for modiﬁcation to improve the
enzyme activity and properties in the future. In this study, PET
esterase (OQN32_06240) with 0.92μM products released from
PET showed signiﬁcantly lower enzymatic activity thanIs-PETase
with 0.3 mM products released
18. The enzymatic activity of PET
esterase (OQN32_06240) towards PET was also lower than
Ple628 with 52.9 μM MHET released45, and lower than PE-H
from a marinePseudomonas strain with 4.2 mg/L (20μM) MHET
released46. E. coliBL21(DE3) may not be a suitable chassis for the
production of Gram-positive bacterium-originated PET esterase
(OQN32_06240) as the relatively low enzyme activity obtained.
However, cell anchoring PET esterase (OQN32_06240) of R.
pyridinivorans P23 could be easily prepared from the collection of
cells after fermentation and used as a cell biocatalyst to degrade
PET, rendering it a promising way of PET degradation.

In this study, 4.28% PET weight loss was observed in 5 weeks
cultivation of R. pyridinivorans P23 which was comparable with
1.3–1.8% of PET weight loss after 30 days incubation with four
marine strains Marinobacter sediminum BC31_3_A1, Mar-
inobacter gudaonensis BC06_2_A6, Thalassospira xiamenensis
BC02_2_A1 and Nocardioides marinus BC14_2_R321. Mean-
while, PET weight loss by R. pyridinivorans P23 (4.28%) was
signiﬁcantly lower than that byI. sakaiensis201-F6, with 60 mg of
PET ﬁlm almost completely degraded in 6 weeks of cultivation18.
Although the efﬁciency of R. pyridinivorans P23 in degrading
PET currently does not reach the level of industrial application, as
it was discovered in the marine environment, which is the
gathering place of discarded plastic waste in the environment, this
bacterium and its similar PET degradation and assimilation
functional microbial groups will play an essential role in the
natural bioremediation of marine plastic pollution.
Although a few PET-degrading strains have already been
reported, the biodiversity of bacteria with PET degradation and
assimilation capacity in the environment, especially the ocean,
still needs to be discovered. In this study, Proteobacteria and
Actinobacteriota were the main phyla with the presence of PET
esterase and the large subunit of the oxygenase component of
TPADO. Evidence has been provided in another investigation
that the PET hydrolases originate mainly from phyla Actino-
bacteria, Proteobacteria, and Bacteroidetes32. The restriction of
PET hydrolases and PET assimilation capability to a few bacterial
phyla indicate that this metabolic capability has evolved for a
short time since the production and release of PET into the
environment and thus limited to a very few phylogenetic groups.
It is speculated that the groups of Proteobacteria and Actino-
bacteriota with TPA degradation capability are more likely to
survive with PET as the carbon and energy source as it could
acquire PET hydrolase activity from the evolution of its native
esterase.
Materials and methods
Screening and identiﬁcation of PET degrading strain . The
Bacterial strain used in this study was isolated from a marine
sediment sample of the Paciﬁc Ocean. Approximately 1.0 g of the
sediment sample was inoculated into 150 ml mineral salt medium
with 1.0 g of poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) powder (crushed
from granular PET, 429252, Sigma-Aldrich, USA) as the sole
carbon and energy source and cultivated at 30 °C, rotation speed
200 rpm for one month for the enrichment of PET degrading
bacteria. The mineral salt medium contains (per liter of water):
1.0 g KH2PO4, 10.0 g (NH4)2SO4, 0.4 g MgSO4·7H2O, 0.5 g NaCl,
2.5 g carbamide, 0.0001 g FeSO4·7H2O, 0.0001 g MnSO4·4H2O,
and 50μg Biotin, pH 7.0. After enrichment, 100μl of the culture
was spread on 2216 marine agar (Haibo Corporation, Qingdao,
China) plate. The 2216 marine agar medium contains (per liter of
water): 5.0 g peptone, 1.0 g yeast extract, 0.10 g ferric citrate,
19.45 g NaCl, 5.90 g MgCl2, 3.24 g Na2SO4, 1.80 g CaCl2, 0.55 g
KCl, 0.16 g Na2CO3, 0.08 g KBr, 34.00 mg SrCl2, 22.00 mg H3BO3,
4.00 mg Na2SiO3·9H2O, 2.40 mg NaF, 1.60 mg Na2NO3, 8.00 mg
Na2HPO4, and 15.0 g agar, pH 7.6. Colonies were inoculated into
a test tube containing 5 ml of mineral salt medium with a piece of
PET ﬁlm (Good Fellow GF89357619) as the sole carbon and
energy source and cultivated at 30 °C, 200 rpm for three days.
PET degradation activity was estimated visually based on the
change of transparency of the culture medium due to the growth
of cells. Strain P23 was observed to grow in mineral salt medium
with PETﬁlm, selected and identiﬁed using 16S rDNA sequence,
obtained from whole genome sequencing. A phylogenetic tree
was constructed using the Mega 6.0 program using the Neighbor-
joining method based on the 16S rRNA gene.
Degradation of PET ﬁlm by R. pyridinivorans P23. A single
colony ofR. pyridinivoransP23 from the 2216 marine agar plate
was inoculated into a test tube (⌀18× 180 mm) containing 5 ml
2216 marine broth medium (pH 7.0) and shaken at 200 rpm,
30 °C overnight. Then, 5 ml of bacterial culture was centrifuged to
remove the remaining medium. The precipitate was washed three
times with 1.0 ml 20 mM phosphate buffer and inoculated into a
500 ml ﬂask containing 150 ml of mineral salt medium with a
piece of 8.0 cm × 8.0 cm PETﬁlm (Good Fellow GF89357619,
thickness 0.013 mm) weighing 92.9, 93.7, and 96.2 mg respec-
tively for three replicates as sole carbon and energy source.
Cultivations of PET ﬁlm in mineral salt medium without
inoculation were set as negative controls. After cultivation under
200 rpm at 30 °C for seven days, the remaining PETﬁlm was
removed, washed, dried, weighed, and served for the next round
of seven days of cultivation for a total ofﬁve weeks. In order to
observe the growth ofR. pyridinivoransP23 on PETﬁlm, 20μlo f
the prepared inoculum was spread on a mineral salt medium agar
plate (pH 7.0, 1.5% agar) and covered with a piece of sterile
1.0 cm× 1.5 cm PETﬁlm (Good Fellow GF89357619, thickness
0.013 mm) at 30 °C for seven days. After the formation of bioﬁlm
on it, the PETﬁlm was removed from the agar plate with tweezers
and directly subjected to environmental scanning electron
microscope (SEM, FEI Quanta450, USA) observation ofR. pyr-
idinivorans P23 cells grown on it.
Determination of substance released by PET degradation .
Culture ﬂuid (150 ml) ofR. pyridinivorans P23 grown on PET
ﬁlm and control cultures without inoculation were collected at
8 h, 30 h, and 7 d, respectively, and centrifuged (6,000 × g, 10 min,
4 °C) to remove the cells. The supernatant was adjusted to pH 2.0
using 2.0 M HCl and extracted with 150 mL of ethyl acetate twice.
The ethyl acetate layer was recovered and evaporated on a rotary
evaporator (Buchi, Switzerland). The residue was dissolved in
1.0 ml methanol, ﬁltered through a 0.22 μm pore size ﬁlter
(Shimadzu, Japan), and subjected to reverse-phase high-perfor-
mance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis. HPLC was per-
formed on a 1260 inﬁnity system (Agilent Technologies, USA)
equipped with a Cosmosil 5C
18-AR-II analytical column (4.6 ×
250 mm) from Nacalai Tesque (Kyoto, Japan). The mobile phase
was 35% methanol/ 65% 20 mM phosphate buffer (pH 1.5) at a
ﬂow rate of 1.0 ml/min, and the efﬂuent was monitored at a
wavelength of 240 nm. Bis(2-hydroxyethyl) terephthalic acid
(BHET, Sigma-Aldrich, USA), mono(2-hydroxyethyl) ter-
ephthalic acid (MHET, Amatek Scientiﬁc, China), and disodium
terephthalate (TPA-Na 2, Aladdin, China) were dissolved in
methanol and used as standards.
Complete genome sequence analysis ofR. pyridinivorans P23.
R. pyridinivorans P23 was grown in 2216 marine broth medium
at 30 °C, and its genomic DNA was extracted and puriﬁed using a
bacteria genomic DNA kit (Tiangen, Beijing, China) according to
the manufacturer’s instructions. The complete genome of R.
pyridinivorans P23 was constructed based on the co-assembly of
short reads (150 bp × 2) and long reads (average 4,029.55 bp)
derived from the Illumina HiSeq sequencing platform and third-
generation single-molecule sequencing technology with Pac-Bio
RSII sequencer conducted at MajorBio Technologies (Shanghai,
China)47. A total of 1,014,860,906 bp and 2,263,058,586 bp high-
quality data derived from the Illumina platform and third-
generation platform, respectively, were obtained and assembled
into a circular chromosome and four plasmids using the hier-
archical genome assembly process (HGAP) algorithm48,49. The
open reading frames were predicted by Prodigal 50, and the

were harvested by centrifugation at 6000 ×g, and 4 °C and then the

used in the preparation of RNA samples from the three different

platform (https://cloud.majorbio.com/)( S u p p l e m e n t a r yD a t a1 ) .
The RPKM (Reads Per Kilobase per Million mapped reads) method
was used to calculate unigene transcription and directly compare
gene transcription levels between samples with different cultivation
conditions57.
Heterologous expression of protein PET esterase
(OQN32_06240). The gene for PET esterase (OQN32_06240)
was commercially synthesized with codon optimization for
expression in Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) (Sangon, Shanghai,
China, Supplementary materials). The amino acid sequence cor-
responding to the transmembrane domain was predicted using
the TMHMM server V2.0 ( http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/
TMHMM/) and removed from the synthetic DNA. The syn-
thetic gene for PET esterase (OQN32_06240) was cloned into the
NdeI( 5′ end) andXhoI( 3′ end) sites of pET-30a vector (Sangon,
Shanghai, China) through fusion to its C-terminal hexa-histidine
tag-coding sequence. PET esterase (OQN32_06240) gene was
expressed inE. coliBL21 (DE3) by 0.5 mM IPTG induction at 20
°C for 16 h. TheE. coli cells were harvested by centrifugation
(4000 ×g, 10 min, 4 °C), resuspended in lysis buffer (50 mM Tris-
HCl, 300 mM NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100, pH 8.0) and disrupted by
sonication on ice. After centrifugation (12,000 ×g, 15 min, 4 °C),
insoluble debris was removed, and the supernatant containing the
soluble protein was transferred to a Ni-afﬁnity chromatography
column (GE Healthcare) pre-equilibrated with binding buffer
(50 mM Tris-HCl, 300 mM NaCl, pH 8.0). After washing
unbound proteins with the washing buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl,
300 mM NaCl, 20/50 mM imidazole, pH 8.0), the bound proteins
were eluted with elution buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, 300 mM NaCl,
500 mM imidazole, pH 8.0). Fractions containing the recombi-
nant protein were collected and dialyzed at 4°C against binding
buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, 300 mM NaCl, pH 8.0) to remove the
imidazole. The recombinant protein was then concentrated by
ultraﬁltration with centrifugal ﬁlters (Ultracel-3 k, Merck Milli-
pore, IRL) and subjected to sodium dodecyl sulfate-
polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE, 12% poly-
acrylamide) for visual estimation of molecular mass and purity.
The puriﬁed protein concentration was determined with a Non-
Interference Protein Assay Kit (Order NO. C503071, Sangon,
Shanghai, China).
Enzyme assays for PETﬁlm. Puriﬁed protein (1.0μM) of PET
esterase (OQN32_06240) was incubated with 4 pieces of PETﬁlm
(1.0 cm × 1.0 cm × 0.013 mm, Good Fellow GF89357619) in
300 μl buffer containing 300 mM Na
2HPO4-NaH2PO4 (pH
3.0–8.0) at 30 °C for 60 h. The reaction was terminated by heat
treatment (80 °C, 10 min). After the remaining PETﬁlm was
removed, the supernatant obtained wasﬁltered through a 0.22μm
ﬁlter and analyzed by HPLC. Reactions without the addition of
puriﬁed protein were used as negative controls. To investigate the
impact of temperature on the biodegradation of PETﬁlm, reac-
tions were carried out in 300 mM Na2HPO4-NaH2PO4, pH 4.5
with 1.0μM puriﬁed protein at 15–35 °C, respectively, for 60 h. In
the investigation of enzyme concentration on the biodegradation
of PETﬁlm, 0.2–3.0 μM of puriﬁed protein was used in reactions
which were carried out in 300 mM Na2HPO4-NaH2PO4, pH 4.5
at 30 °C for 60 h.
Enzyme assays for BHET and MHET. The puriﬁed protein
(1.0 μM) was incubated with 1.0 mM BHET (Sigma-Aldrich,
USA) in 300μl buffer containing 300 mM Na2HPO4-NaH2PO4,
pH 3.0–8.0 at 30 °C for 48 h. Besides, the puri ﬁed protein
(5.0 μM) was incubated with 1.0 mM MHET (Amatek Scientiﬁc,
China) in 300μl buffer containing 300 mM Na2HPO4-NaH2PO4,
pH 3.0–8.0 at 30 °C for 48 h. After reactions, the supernatant was
immediately ﬁltered through a 0.22 μm ﬁlter and analyzed
by HPLC.
Kinetic analysis of PET esterase (OQN32_06240) towards
BHET and MHET. OneμM puriﬁed protein was incubated with
0.1 mM to 5.0 mM BHET in 300 mM Na2HPO4-NaH2PO4,p H
4.5 at 30 °C. Besides, 1.0μM puriﬁed protein was incubated with
0.2 mM to 3.0 mM MHET in 300 mM Na2HPO4-NaH2PO4,p H
4.5 at 30 °C. After the reaction, the supernatant was immediately
ﬁltered through a 0.22 μm ﬁlter and analyzed by HPLC for
MHET and TPA produced. Initial degradation rates of PET
esterase (OQN32_06240) against BHET and MHET were plotted
against BHET and MHET concentrations, respectively, and the
kinetic parameters were determined by using the Michaelis-
Menten equation utilizing Graph Pad Prism version 6.01
(GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA).
PET, BHET, and MHET degradation by cells of R.
pyridinivorans P23. Cells of R. pyridinivorans P23 was used as
whole-cell biocatalyst towards PETﬁlm and incubated with four
pieces of PET ﬁlm (1.0 cm × 1.0 cm × 0.013 mm, Good Fellow
GF89357619) to ﬁnal concentration of OD600 1.0 in a 1.5 ml
centrifuge tube containing 300μl 300 mM Na2HPO4-NaH2PO4,
pH 3.0–8.0 at 30 °C for 60 h. The tube was shaken at 100 rpm to
prevent cell precipitation. When towards BHET and MHET
degradation, 1.0 mM BHET or 1.0 mM MHET was used as sub-
strate under the same reaction conditions with PET ﬁlm. The
reaction time was 30 min and 16 h for BHET, and 5 h and 16 h for
MHET, respectively, to make sure the dynamic transformation of
BHET to MHET and then TPA could be observed. The super-
natant obtained was ﬁltered through a 0.22 μm ﬁlter analyzed
by HPLC.
Protein homolog search on the fully sequenced genomes. The
Annotree server (http://annotree.uwaterloo.ca/app/) was utilized
to search the coexistence of PET esterase (PF07859, K01066) and
large subunit of the oxygenase component of TPADO (PF00848,
K16319) homologs in bacteria58. In the Pfam search pattern,
homologs of PF07859 and PF00848 with ≤1e−5 E-value were
searched against the genome database implemented in this server
and displayed at the phylum level. In the KEGG search pattern,
homologs of K01066 and K16319 with 30–100% identity, ≤1e−5
E-value were searched against the genome database and displayed
