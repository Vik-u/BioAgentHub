1.Introduction
Polyethylene terephthalate (PET) is exten-
sively utilized in automotive, building and
construction, electrical and electronics, in-
dustrial, and machinery, with a market
value of $26.99 billion in 2024 and pro-
jected to reach $36.61 billion by 2029.[1]
However, the enormous consumption and
low recovery rates have caused severe en-
vironmentaldamage.[2,3] Moreseriously,an
increasingnumberofstudieshavereported
the detection of microplastics in human
tissues, raising concerns about potential
health risks.[4] Traditional recycling meth-
ods, both mechanical and chemical, face
multiple substantial limitations.[5,6] Recent
years have seen a notable increase in in-
terest in plastic biodegradation. Enzymatic
catalysis breaks down PET into environ-
mentallybenignproducts,contributingtoa
circularPET-basedbioeconomy. [7]
In recent decades, plenty of PET de-
grading enzymes have been discovered
and engineered, belonging to classes of
cutinases,[8–13] lipases,[14] and esterases.[15]
Cutinases are predominant and show the
greatest promise due to their ﬂat, large
activepockets.[7,16] PETdegradingenzymes
are characterized as thermophilic (e.g.,
LCC,[9,10] HiC,[8] Cut190,[11] TfCut2[13])and
mesophilic enzymes (e.g., IsPETase,[12]

IsMHETase,[12] Fsc,[8] BsEstB[14]). In enzyme engineering, con-
siderable attention has been given to LCC andIsPETase as
key template enzymes. Thermophilic LCC has been engineered
into variants such as ICCG[9] and LCC-A2,[10] which function
near the glass transition temperature of PET, making them
as promising and attractive candidates for industrial-scale PET
biorecycling and uprecycling, particularly for macro- and meso-
plastics.Mesophilicenzymaticdepolymerizationisemergingas
a promising strategy with advantages for the in situ treatment
of PET waste in environmental settings,[17] especially micro-
or nano-plastics in soil and water.IsPETase andIsMHETase,
identiﬁed fromIdeonella sakaiensis201-F6, are particularly no-
table for their speciﬁc PET depolymerization activity at moder-
ate temperatures,[12] and have been the focus of extensive en-
gineering eﬀorts to improve their properties for greater indus-
trialapplicability. IsPETasehydrolyzesPETintomainlymono-(2-
hydroxyethyl) terephthalic acid (MHET), with small amounts of
bis-(2-hydroxyethyl) terephthalic acid (BHET), terephthalic acid
(TPA) and ethylene glycol (EG).[12] MHETase converts MHET
back into the basic units of PET,[12] namely TPA and EG
(Figure1A).Recentadvancementsin IsPETaseengineeringhave
generated mutants with enhanced depolymerization eﬃciency
and thermostability, such as DuraPETase,[18] ThermoPETase,[19]
FAST-PETase,[20] HotPETase,[21] DepoPETase.[22] However,these
PET hydrolases still show weak catalytic activity toward high-
crystallinity PET and intermediate MHET, [23] resulting in

Therefore, MHET conversion is a limiting factor of the over-
alldepolymerizationprocess. [26,27] Multiplestudieshavedemon-
stratedthattransformingMHETbeneﬁtsPETdepolymerization

Directedevolutionrepresentsapowerfulapproachtoenhanc-
ing enzyme properties, especially for beneﬁcial distal sites that
are challenging to identify employing in silico technologies.[30]
However, the low-throughput and high-cost of the existing
function-basedscreeningtoolstargetingdepolymerizationprod-
ucts limit the eﬃciency of the ‘design-build-test-learn (DBTL)’
cycle in enzyme engineering and mining. Recently, ﬂuorescent
assaysin96-wellplateswereestablishedbasedonPEToligomer
modelsubstrates[22,31] orsyntheticﬂuorogenicprobes. [32] Veryre-
cently, the production of 2-hydroxyterephthalate (TPA-OH) for-
mattedfrombis(2-hydroxyethyl)2-hydroxyterephthalate(BHET-
OH) was used to evaluate the PETase activity. The screened De-
poPETase showed a higher Tm value by 23.3°C and enhanced
depolymerization eﬃciency.[22] However, these assays based on
PETstructuralanalogsdidnotreﬂectthehydrolysisofactualPET
polymers,[32] andwereunsuitableforMHETaseevolutiondueto
either extensive or minimal hydrolysis on MHET.[22,31] To date,
there have been limited studies on high-throughput screening
(HTS)toolsforthedirectdetectionofcompletedepolymerization
products, TPA or EG, for screening PET and MHET hydrolases
candidatesandmetagenomelibraries.
Transcription factor (TF)-based biosensors (TFBs) oﬀer a
high-throughput platform by coupling input signal intensity to
output signal intensity in a dose-dependent manner.[33] Input
signalsareeitherbiochemicalmolecules(e.g.,metabolites, [34–36]
contaminants,[37] biomarkers[38]) or physical factors (e.g.,
light,[39] temperature[40]). TFBs have proven to be versatile tools
for detecting numerous molecules in HTS of overproducers
or superior biological blocks,[35,40] as well as in environmental
detection[37] and disease diagnosis.[38] Developing biosensor-
based tools for characterizing PET hydrolases and detecting
PET breakdown products, like TPA and EG, holds promise
for advancing enzymatic plastic degradation. To date, the only
reported TPA-based sensors rely on the TF-based genetical
circuits(includingTphR [41–43] andXylS[44]),orreductase-LuxAB-
coupled chemiluminescence reporting system, [45] showing
high-throughput potential in the plastic hydrolases activity
screening. Researchers have constructed TphR-based biosen-
sors inAcinetobacter baylyi,[42] Comamonas thiooxidans,[43] and
Pseudomonas putida[41] to recognizing TPA, while Li et al.[44]
engineeredtheXylS W88C-L224Q-basedbiosensorin Escherichia coli
(E. coli) for TPA detection. However, the cellular uptake of TPA
and its analogs, such as MHET and BHET, impedes accurate in
vivo detection through TPA-induced biosensors. The metabolic
background and physiological state of cells, alongwith thetran-
sientnatureofbioluminescencesignals,limittheapplicationof
LuxABbiosensors.WithTPAdetectioninlivingcells,thesetools
have yet to be validated with real PET depolymerase libraries.
Additionally, there are currently no reports on the EG inducible
biosensor, showing its development value in EG-based plastic
degradation,particularlyforPET.
BmoR, a promiscuous alcohol-dependent TF, was identiﬁed
fromThauera butanivorans.[46] Uponsensingalcoholmolecules,
it undergoes a conformational change to form the activated
BmoR-alcoholcomplexthatexhibitsenhancedaﬃnityfortheup-
stream activating sequence (UAS) of the BmoR-regulated pro-
moter,Pbmo.[47] The𝜎54 factor speciﬁcally binds to the−24 (GG)
and −12 (TGC) regions ofPbmo, forming an RNA polymerase
holoenzyme (E𝜎54) with the polymerase core.[48] However, it is
unabletoopentheDNAdouble-strandwithouttheassistanceof
BmoR-alcohol hexamer.[49,50] The BmoR-alcohol hexamer inter-
actswiththe 𝜎54 factorwithDNAlooping, [47,48] whichfacilitates
DNAunwindingandrestructuringtheE 𝜎54-DNAcomplexfrom
aclosedtoanopenconformationusingtheenergygeneratedby
ATPhydrolysisassociatedwiththehexamer. [51,52] Thisstructural
rearrangement activates thePbmo transcription, thereby produc-
ing analyzable biosignals (Figure1B), typically ﬂuorescence sig-
nals.OurpreviousstudieshaveestablishedBmoR-basedbiosen-
sors for HTS higher alcohol overproducers inE. coli[35,53,54] and
dynamic regulating the microbial cell factory.[36] The promiscu-
ousspeciﬁcityofBmoRisachallengeforaccuratedetection.Al-
ternatively, it oﬀers the possibility of customizing other speciﬁc
alcohol-induced variants. EG, an alcohol molecule with two hy-
droxyl groups, is a potential ligand for BmoR. Tailor-making a

ormetagenomelibraries.
In this study, a novel biosensor-derived visual HTS strategy
was deployed for the directed evolution of MHETase by evalu-
ating EG production (Scheme 1). First, we engineered BmoR
to achieve high sensitivity to EG, obtaining satisfactory BmoR
mutants through a ‘ﬂuorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS)

2.1.ConstructingandCharacterizingaBmoR-BasedBiosensor
Given that BmoR was sensitive to mono-alcohols, we supposed
that it might also respond to diols, such as ethylene glycol, the
end-product of PET degradation. To test this, we constructed
analcohol-inducedwhole-cellbiosensorbyintegratingthesens-
ing and output modules (Figure1C). BmoR was expressed un-
der the control of the constitutive promoter,PbmoR. The tran-
scription intensity of the reporter was modulated by the paired

tions. Yeom et al.[55] and Zhao et al.[56] suggested that replacing
thereporterwithasuper-foldergreenﬂuorescentprotein(sfGFP)
was beneﬁcial to improve the sensitivity and dynamic range
of TFBs. Following this suggestion, we constructed thePbmoR-
BmoR-Pbmo-sfGFPbiosensingsystem(pEG1)in E.coli XL10-Gold
(X-EG1)(Figure 1C).Here,sfGFPservedasavisualindicatorfor

wild-type BmoR (BmoRWT) to EG through dose-response test-
ing. The strain X-EG1 grew robustly across the range of 0–200
mM EG without growth inhibition, especially at high EG con-
centrationscomparedtoisobutanol.Thedose-responsecurveof

centrations,withamaximumNFI(NFI max =1584.67±16.95)at
75mMEG(Figure 1D).However,theBmoR WT-basedbiosensor
encountered several challenges: 1) pronounced leakage expres-
sionintheabsenceofEG(NFI 0 = 1268.57± 80.05);2)alimited

mal performance parameters restricted its application potential

mentsoflowbackgroundandhighresponsivenesstoEG.
2.2.ConstructingaBmoR-BasedBiosensorwith
Negative-SelectionFunction
Given the modularity and evolvability of TFs, TF engineering
is a common strategy to ﬁne-tune the biosensing behavior.[57]
BmoR possesses a ligand-binding domain (LBD) and a DNA-
bindingdomain(DBD),whichinﬂuencesignalrecognizingand
processing, respectively. Structural modiﬁcation to BmoR could
impact BmoR-ligandaﬃnityand BmoR-DNAaﬃnity, aswell as
itsphysicochemicalproperties,ultimatelyimprovingitssensing
performance.Inthisstudy,weemployedrandommutagenesisto
evolveBmoR,aimingtogeneratemutantswithsuperiorrespon-
sivenesstoEG.
To eliminate BmoR mutants with severe leaky expression
from the library, we used the SacB protein as a negative se-
lection marker, fused with sfGFP by a glycine-serine linker
(GGSGGGSGG). The resulting PbmoR-BmoR-Pbmo-sfGFP-SacB
biosensing system (pEG2) was developed (Figure1E). ThesacB
geneencodeslevansucrase,catalyzingthesynthesisoflevanfrom
sucrose. Yet the accumulation of levan inE. colicauses cytotoxi-
cityandcelldeath. [58] DuetoBmoR WT representingahighaﬃn-
ityforisobutanol, [53] isobutanolwasselectedastheligandtotest
the negative-selection function of SacB. The dose-response of
the BmoRWT-based biosensor to isobutanol presented a marked
ﬂuorescence response in the range of 0–50 mM isobutanol
(Figure1F). The NFI0 was 1241.06± 57.76 without isobutanol,
and the NFImax was 3446.53± 129.57 with 50 mM isobutanol,
resultinginadynamicrangeof2.78-fold.Tofurthervalidatethe

suredinLBmediumsupplementedwith100 μgmL−1 ampicillin
(LB/Amp100)and10mMisobutanol,withorwithout100gL −1 su-
crose. After 10 h cultivation, X-EG2 cells exhibited poor growth
in the sucrose-containing medium due to isobutanol-induced
sacBtranscription,whereastheygrewvigorouslyinthesucrose-
free medium (Figure1G). This indicated that SacB was eﬀec-
tive as a negative selection marker. Cells with server SacB leaky
expression in the absence of EG were inhibited in the sucrose-
containing medium, enabling the selection of superior mutants
withlowbasalinterferenceandhighsignal-to-noiseratio.
2.3.DirectedEvolutionofTranscriptionFactorBmoR
Basedonsequenceandstructureanalysis,the 𝜎54-dependentTF
BmoR possesses three characteristic domains of the bacterial
enhancer binding protein (bEBP) family:[35,47] LBD, central do-
main (CD), and DBD (Figure 2A). The N-terminal LBD (1–335
aa) is responsible for sensing and capturing alcohol molecules,
thereby determining speciﬁcity and overall activity.[35] The LBD
exhibits high sequence variability, making it a common target
for engineering eﬀorts.[54,59] The CD (336–499 aa) facilitates TF
oligomerization and ATP hydrolysis and is highly sequentially
conserved.[51] Mutations in the CD are likely to impair the re-
sponse activity of BmoR.[35] The C-terminal DBD (500–669 aa)
features a helix-turn-helix structure, enabling BmoR binding

FACS was employed to sort cells based on ﬂuorescence signals
at the single-cell level, considerably expediting the directed evo-

responsecurvestoEG.Besides,BmoR F177L/Q285L carriedsynony-
mous mutations at residues A76 and R120. Obviously, the NFI
valuesofthetwoBmoR Mut-basedbiosensorsincreasedmarkedly
compared to the BmoRWT-based biosensor within the range
of 0–200 mM EG, with both showing markedly enhanced dy-
namicrangeandsensitivity(Figure 2D,E).TheBmoR N207S-based
biosensor (pEG3) and BmoRF177L/Q285L-based biosensor (pEG4)
reachedtheirmaximumﬂuorescenceintensityat200mMmEG,
with NFImax values of 3917.18± 411.36 and 8536.09± 201.78,
respectively, representing 2.47- and 5.39-fold increases over the
NFImax of the BmoRWT-based biosensor. The dynamic ranges
were 5.64- and 3.32-fold, respectively, showing 4.51- and 2.66-
fold increases over that of the BmoRWT-based biosensor. We at-
temptedtoreplacethehigh-copyoriginColE1withthemedium-
copy origin p15A to further decrease basal ﬂuorescence, how-
ever, causing a loss of detectability (FigureS1A,B, Supporting

berofactivatedBmoR-EGcomplexesandthenloweredthetran-

biosensor,theBmoR N207S-basedbiosensorexhibitedahigherdy-

BmoRWT and BmoRMut based-biosensors was summarized in

therebyupregulatingthetranscriptionofthesfGFP-SacBfusion

servedusingthetwoBmoR Mut-basedbiosensorsinthepresence
of EG (Figure2D,E). To illustrate the molecular mechanisms
of the improved sensing performance, we conducted molecular
docking simulations and structural analysis. The detailed inter-
actions of BmoRWT,B m o RN207S,a n dB m o RF177L/Q285L with ethy-
lene glycol (EG) were examined. In the BmoRWT-EG complex,
EGinteractedwithresiduesQ203,E206,andR250,withbinding
distances of 1.9, 2.1, 2.2, and 2.0 Å, respectively, resulting in a
bindingenergyof −2.22kcalmol −1 (Figure3B).TheN207Smu-
tation, situated on an𝛼-helix, reduced the local positive electro-
static potential (Figure3A,E). This mutation brought EG closer
to residues Q203 (1.8 Å) and E206 (1.9, 1.9 Å), with a slightly
improvedbindingenergyof −2.28kcalmol −1 (Figure3C).Simi-
larly,theF177LmutationintheloopregionandtheQ285Lmu-
tationinthe 𝛼-helixofBmoR F177L/Q285L causedminorreductions

(Figure 3A,F,G). Residues involved in the binding of EG to the
BmoRF177L/Q285L mutantincludedQ203(1.7Å),E206(1.9,1.9Å),

2.5.PromotingFunctionalSolubleExpressionofMHETsae
MHET remains largely residual when using PET hydrolases
alone,[21] not only exerting an inhibitory eﬀect but also dimin-
ishing the bioeconomic beneﬁts of downstream applications.
MHETase was regarded as the key enzyme to promote com-
plete PET depolymerization.[64] However, direct expression of
a codon-optimized MHETase gene in pET28a(+) vectors un-
der PT7 (pLM1) or Ptac (pLM2) promoters resulted in nearly
all MHETase being expressed in inclusion bodies in the cyto-
plasm (Figure S3A, Supporting Information). MHETase con-
tained ﬁve disulﬁde bonds (residues 35–76, 208–513, 287–304,
324–332,and561–583inthisstudy;Figure S4A,SupportingIn-
formation),crucialforproperfoldingandfunction. [65] Disulﬁde
bond formation required multiple biomolecules and an oxida-
tive environment,[65,66] possibly explaining the folding diﬃcul-
ties inE. coliBL21(DE3). Additionally, the solubility prediction
of MHETase using the Protein-Sol website showed a low-scaled
solubility value of 0.211, below the population average of 0.45,
indicatingitsinherentsolubilitychallengein E.coli.Itspoorsol-
ubilitysubstantiallyhindereditspotentialasabiocatalyst.
We explored various fusion protein forms at diﬀerent tran-
scription rates to achieve soluble intracellular expression of
MHETase for further directed evolution (Figure 4A). We at-
tempted to enable highly soluble proteins to drive the soluble
expression of poorly soluble proteins. The machine learning-
predicted FAST-PETase (FastPETase), known for its enhanced
thermal stability and activity, was currently the most eﬃcient
mesophilic PETase mutant at 50 °C.[20] FastPETase showed
high solubility and was predominantly expressed in soluble
form in E. coli BL21(DE3) cells (FigureS3B, Supporting In-
formation). The structure of FastPETase contained only two
disulﬁde bonds (FigureS4B, Supporting Information), with a

predicted scaled solubility value of 0.409 using the Protein-
Sol website, 1.94-fold higher than that of MHETase. Fusion ex-
pression with FastPETase enabled the degradation of PET to
TPA and EG abundantly promising and attractive. Both the
MHETase-FastPETase and FastPETase-MHETase chimeras were
constructed using a ﬂexible (G4S)3 glycine-serine linker and
controlled by PT7 or Ptac promoters (pLM4−pLM7). Addition-
ally, solubilization tags were commonly fused to proteins to in-
crease their solubility and stability, such as MBP, TrxA, GST,
SUMO, and NusA.[67] We also employed a SUMO tag at the
N-terminal of MHETase to generate the SUMO-MHETase fu-
sion protein (pLM8−pLM9). However, initial attempts at the six
MHETase fusion proteins with a single-terminal solubilization
tag(pLM4−pLM9)didnotachievethedesiredsolubleexpression,
resulting in inclusion bodies or not expressed (FigureS3C,D,
Supporting Information). We then explored dual solubilization
tags by adding an N-terminal SUMO tag to both MHETase-
FastPETase and FastPETase-MHETase (pLM10−pLM13). Inter-
estingly, SDS-PAGE results revealed that adding highly soluble
proteins to the double terminals of MHETase, namely SUMO-
MHETase-FastPETase(SMF)fusionprotein,underalowertran-
scriptionrate( Ptac)achievedoptimalsolubleexpression(pLM11)
(Figure4B; S3D, Supporting Information), whereas other three
designsresultedinmarginalsolubility(Figure S3D,Supporting
Information).
Subsequently, we conducted structural modeling via Al-
phaFold 2[62] to investigate the inﬂuence of fusion expression
forms on catalytic mechanisms. Comparative analysis revealed
thatthemajorstructuresofeachcomponentwithintheSMFfu-
sion protein closely resembled their original structures (Figure
S5A–F,SupportingInformation).Dockinganalysis(Figure 4,D)
with MHET and BHET substrates demonstrated that the ac-
tive sites of MHETase and FastPETase within the SMF chimera
closely resembled those of their standalone components, main-
taining the same Ser-His-Asp catalytic triad.[20,28,68] The grid
boxes were specially adjusted to encompass the entire fusion
protein, enabling free substrate conformation and positional
changes.Theoverallstructuralsimilarityandconsistencyofthe
catalytic mechanism suggested that the double-terminal solubi-
lizationtagsdidnotadverselyaﬀectthenativestructuralandcat-

ﬁrmed the functional activity of the SMF fusion protein. When

completedegradation.UHPLCanalysisconﬁrmedthepresence

These results demonstrated that the use of double-terminal
solubilization tags facilitated the proper folding of MHETase in
an active form. The fused MHETase:FastPETase dual-enzyme

2.6.DirectedEvolutionofMHETaseviatheBmoR-Based

EG, the hydrolysate of MHET, was the speciﬁc ligand for
BmoRN207S,initiatingthetranscriptionofsfGFPuponbeingrec-
ognized.TheBmoR N207S-basedbiosensorconnectedEGsensing
with ﬂuorescence readouts, enabling the use of the microplate
reader or microﬂuidics techniques instead of low-throughput,
costly liquid chromatography techniques. The performance of
biosensors is strongly inﬂuenced by the abundance of TFs
and reporters, as well as by the host genome.[69] The context-
dependent activity of biological parts can eventually cause un-
wantedchangesintheinput–outputresponseofacircuit,thereby
disruptingthedesignedfunction. [70] Toensureplasmidcompat-
ibility and avoid the context eﬀects from direct and indirect in-
teractions with cellular resources and components, we consid-
ered maintaining the existing contextual settings of the sensing
strainsintheHTSprotocoldesign(host,keyplasmidparts).As

generate the random mutation library in theE. coliBL21(DE3)

with diﬀerent degradation strain variants in LB/Kan50 medium.
AfterIPTGinductionat16 °CandMHETdegradationat37 °C,
the mutation library cells were removed by centrifugation. Sub-
sequently,thesupernatantwasincubatedwiththesensingstrain
E. coliX-EG7 to evaluate EG production. To enable both strains
to grow under the same antibiotic resistance conditions, the re-
sistance gene of the BmoRN207S-based biosensor plasmid was
changed fromAmpr (pEG3) toKanr (pEG7). The diagram illus-
trating the biosensor-based primary HTS in the 96-well DWP
format and UHPLC secondary screening is shown inFigure

MHET concentration that would generate the highest amount
of EG under consistent protein conditions was determined. As
showninFigure 5B,MHETwascontinuouslydegradedintoTPA
andEGovertimeatallconcentrations,withthehighestTPApro-
duction at 10 mM MHET. After 48 h of bioconversion at 37°C,
the B-LM11 strain produced 2.25, 3.50, and 2.55 mM TPA from
initial MHET concentrations of 5, 10 and 15 mM, respectively.
Therefore, 10 mM MHET was selected as the substrate concen-
trationfortheHTSsystem.
The MHETase mutation libraries were constructed at ﬁnal
Mn2+ concentrations of 0.125, 0.25, and 0.5 mM, resulting in
mutation frequencies of 2–7‰, 3–8‰, 9–15‰, respectively.
The libraries with low and medium mutation frequencies gen-
erated at 0.125 and 0.25 mM Mn2+ were subjected to being

typeMHETase(MHETaseWT)andthreeMHETasemutantswere
aligned,andmutationsitesweremarked(Figure 5D).Themuta-
tion sites were randomly distributed across the sequence with-
out obvious hotspot regions. The spatial distribution of these
residues showed that the majority were distributed around the
enzyme structure, distal from the catalytic pocket (Figure5E).
The distal mutations harnessed the allosteric network of non-
covalent interactions, leading to a redistribution of the relative
stabilities of the conformational states to stabilize high-energy
statesorfavorstatesmorecompetentforhigherhydrolyticactiv-
ity, thereby producing a population shift in the conformational
landscapeofMHETaseandtranslatingintoincreasedactivity. [71]
Theseresultsdemonstratedthefeasibilityofthebiosensor-based

MHETase could be further enhanced by several rounds of iter-
ativeevolutionfacilitatedbyourﬂuorescentHTStool.

pared to SMWTF( F i g u r e6B, Table2), highlighting the eﬀective-
ness of the EG-induced biosensor HTS platform. This compar-
ison of parameters indicated that MHETaseM3 in SMM3Fh a da
stronger aﬃnity toward MHET and showed enhanced catalytic
eﬃciencyandturnoverrate.
MHETase is an esterase adopting the𝛼/𝛽 hydrolase fold,
with a substrate-speciﬁc lid domain over the active pocket.[23,68]
The typical catalytic triad, nucleophilic residue (Ser)-base (His)-
deprotonatedacid(Asp),waslocatedatpositionsSer209,His512,
and Asp476 in this study.[68] To gain insights into the activ-
ity enhancement in SMM3F, the structure of MHETM3 was
modeled using SWISS-MODEL with MHETaseWT (PDB ID:
6QZ3) as the model. First, the molecular docking simulations
of MHETaseWT and MHETaseM3 with MHET were performed.
The binding energies were−2.94 and −3.09 kcal mol−1,r e -
spectively, revealing a more favorable binding aﬃnity between
MHET and MHETaseM3. Docking results revealed substantial
changes in the molecular orientation of MHET within the two
complexes. The binding pose of MHET in MHETaseM3 formed
more hydrogen bonds and showed closer distances to Ser209
and His512 residues. The oxyanion hole, formed by the NH
groups of Gly116 and Glu210 residues, stabilized the negatively
charged oxygen atom in the tetrahedral transition state.[23,68] In
the MHET-MHETaseM3complex, the hydrogen bond distances
between MHET and the NH groups decreased, with the angle
betweenthetwohydrogenbondsincreasingfrom49.9 ° to63.1°.
In addition to the hydrophobic interactions, MHET formed a
cation-𝜋 interactionandasaltbridgewiththeHis512residuein
MHETaseM3 (Figure6,D).Thesestrengthenedandnewlyformed
enzyme-substrate interactionsfacilitated thecatalyticconforma-
tional positioning of MHET in the active pocket, stabilizing the
enzyme-substrate tetrahedral intermediate and ultimately im-
provingcatalyticeﬃciency.
The eight mutations of MHETaseM3 were distributed around
the surface-exposed loop regions. These distal residues af-
fected the substrate binding and product release in the active
pocket through altering the conformational states, and inﬂu-
enced enzyme function indirectly through eﬀects on protein
structuralstability,conformationalchanges,andlong-rangeelec-
trostatic eﬀects. Structural analysis was conducted at both over-
all and local levels. The overall surface electrostatic potential
of MHETaseWT ranged from −50.963 (red) to 50.963 (blue),
while that of MHETaseM3 ranged from−48.635 (red) to 48.635
(blue)(Figure 6E).Thereducedoverallelectrostaticpotentialcon-

solute values of negative surface electrostatic potential for the
catalytic triad of MHETaseWT and MHETaseM3 were 83.400 and
83.964, respectively, with an increase of 0.564 (Figure6F). The
catalytic mechanism of MHETase involved acylation and deacy-
lation, both being triggered by the protonation of the nitrogen
atom of His512 residue, with the electronegative oxygen atom
acting as a nucleophile to attack the carbonyl C (electropositive

of MHETaseWT and MHETaseM3 were increased from 2217.481
to 2487.920 Å2, facilitating substrate binding and product re-

2.8.AChemical-Enzymatic‘PET-BHET-MHET-TPA-PCA-GA’
UpcyclingRoute
The circular plastic bioeconomy has emerged as a vivid ﬁeld
aiming at reducing and upcycling plastic waste to promote sus-
tainable production and consumption. In this study, we in-
tegrated a degradation pathway with a biosynthesis pathway
to upcycle PET waste into valuable products, speciﬁcally pro-
tocatechuic acid (PCA) and gallic acid (GA), as illustrated in
Figure 7A. PET was ﬁrst degraded into BHET, which was then
eﬃciently broken down into TPA and MHET. Subsequently,
TPA was converted into 1,2-dihydroxy-3,5-cyclohexadiene-1,4-
dicarboxylate (DCD) by TPA 1,2-dioxygenase (TPADO), com-
posed of an oxygenase component (TphA2IIA3II)a n dar e -
ductase component (TphA1II). DCD was then catalyzed into
PCA by DCD dehydrogenase (TphBII). PCA, a phenolic acid
widelyusedinpharmaceuticals,functionalfoods,cosmetics,and
materials industry,[72] was further transformed into GA by p-
hydroxybenzoatehydroxylase(PobA ***).[73] GAisnotedforitsan-
tioxidant, antibacterial, antitumor, and antiviral properties, and

We hold the view that the key challenge in PET degradation
lies not just in breaking down the PET structure, but in ob-
taining a single depolymerization product of high purity. High-

The overexpression of pathways was regulated by PLlacO1,
Ptac,o r PT7 promoters and induced with 0.5 or 1.0 mM iso-
propyl 𝛽-D-1thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG). UHPLC analysis re-
vealed that the highest yields were achieved with a medium
transcription rate usingPtac and induced with 1.0 mM IPTG
(Figure 7,E). Therefore, we designed plasmid pLM45 to co-
expressTphA2IIA3IIA1II,TphBII,andPobA *** underasingle Ptac

proach eliminates the need for complex and costly puriﬁcation
steps, highlighting the potential advantages of scaling up pro-
duction to an industrial level. The BHET post-degradation so-
lutionwithoutdownstreampuriﬁcationwassupplementedwith
10 × M9Y medium and incubated with the GA biosynthetic
strain, B-LM45. After 24 h of cultivation, 997.16 mg L−1 (6.47
mM) PCA and 411.69 mg L−1 (2.42 mM) GA were detected,
with a TPA utilization rate of 45.2% (Figure7F). Bacteria ca-
pable of growing on TPA as a sole carbon source are highly
expected to construct transformation pathways for PET upcy-
cling. We proposed a chemo-biological process with the eﬀec-
tive SMM3F biocatalyst for recycling PET waste of arbitrary crys-
tallinity, and provided more insights into low-energy consump-
tion industrial practices through an open-loop upcycling route:
‘PET-BHET-MHET-TPA-PCA-GA’.
3.Conclusion
The advancement of recycling and upcycling platforms lever-
aging PET degrading microbes and enzymes has become a
top priority. We developed an advanced ﬂuorescent HTS tech-
nique utilizing the ﬁrst EG-induced BmoR-based biosensor to
directly detect EG production, a PET degradation end-product.
This “degrading-biosensing” two-step HTS protocol is applica-
ble for evolving both mesophilic and thermophilic PET degrad-
ing enzymes, with the only diﬀerence being the substrate in-
cubation temperatures. Bio-based polyesters of EG with TPA
structureanalogs(e.g.,thiophen-,furan-orpyridine-dicarboxylic
acid) are promising PET substitutes, such as polyethylene-2,5-
furandicarboxylate (PEF).[78,79] This work extends existing HTS

tools to target hydrolases for EG-based plastic polymers. Addi-
tionally, we anticipate the EG-responsive HTS tool will be in-
strumental in evolving PETase into‘PEXase’ and MHETase into
‘MHEXase’ for completely degrading emerging bio-polyesters
(PEX or MHEX). Moreover, this biosensor can serve as a ver-
satile tool in various EG-related biological and industrial appli-
cations, such as detecting EG pollution in wastewater; regulat-
ing EG-associated metabolic networks, and identifying EG or
EG-derivedoverproducers.ThehighlyEG-responsiveBmoRmu-
tants,BmoRN207S andBmoRF177L/Q285L,weregeneratedbyFACS-

perimentalandcomputationalresults,weanalyzedhowspeciﬁc

also worth mentioning that the promiscuous ligand spectrum
of BmoR holds promise for engineering it into other dihydric
alcohol-responsiveTFs,oﬀeringpotentialHTStoolsformultiple

To address the issue of low or non-expression of heterolo-
g o u sp r o t e i n si nE. coli, we proposed a novel strategy of adding
double-terminalsolubilizationproteins,considerablypromoting
the functional soluble expression of MHETase in the form of
SMF fusion proteins. The strategy of ‘leveraging highly soluble
proteins to drive the soluble expression of poorly soluble pro-
teins’presentsanapproachforthefunctionalexpressionofpro-
teins with poor solubility. Future eﬀorts also should focus on
increasing enzyme soluble expression, a necessary step toward
facilitatinglarge-scaleapplicationsandbroaderadoption.Utiliz-
ing the biosensor-based HTS tool, three SMF chimera mutants
with increased activity were generated after one round of pro-
teinengineering.ThecomprehensiveanalysisofSM M3Fchimera
throughsequenceandstructuralanalysis,mutationsiteanalysis,
enzymatic assays, computational analysis, and mechanistic ex-
planations, provided deeper insights into the structure-function
relationships of MHETase for further engineering eﬀorts. De-
spitetheachievementswithourﬂuorescence-basedHTSsystem,
there is still potential for further optimization. Free-diﬀusing
EG molecules can cause cross-talk among individual degrada-
tion variant cells, hindering the coupling of the BmoR-based
biosensorwithFACSforidentifyingtrulyhighlyﬂuorescentvari-
ants. The ﬂuorescence-activated droplet sorting (FADS) tech-
nique,combinedwithmicroﬂuidicdevicesthatencapsulatecells
