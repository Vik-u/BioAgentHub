Exceptional Thermostabilities Using Sequence
Similarity Networks

Enzymatic hydrolysis of polyethylene terephthalate (PET) is a prom-
ising technology for advancing a circular PET economy. Several
PET-degrading α/β hydrolases have been identified, but the full
potential of this enzyme family to catalyze PET hydrolysis remains
largely unexplored. To address this, sequence similarity networks
are employed to investigate theα/β hydrolase fold-5 subfamily
(IPR029059) for new PETases. Priority is given to sequences from
thermophiles, as thermostable enzymes are likely more suitable for
industrial applications. Ten enzymes with≈20% sequence identity
to the well-known LCC-PETase are identified, and seven are suc-
cessfully overexpressed and purified for in vitro characterization.
Each enzyme catalyzes the hydrolysis of p-nitrophenyl bu-
tyrate, a mimic of trimeric PET, and emulsified PET nanoparticles.
Notably, three enzymes are also capable of hydrolyzing PET films.
Novel PETases exhibit melting temperatures (Tm) exceeding 55 °C
and only modest losses of activity after incubation at 70 °C for 24 h.
The crystal structure of AroC (Tm =85 °C) is resolved to 2.2 Å,
revealing several salt bridges that likely confer thermostability,
and a unique loop that is conserved among the PETases described
here. These novel enzymes will enable engineering campaigns to
generate thermostable and catalytically efficient PETases for use as
industrial biocatalysts.
1. Introduction
Polyethylene terephthalate (PET) is a thermoplastic polymer syn-
thesized through the condensation reaction of ethylene glycol
(EG) and terephthalic acid (TPA). PET is widely utilized for its
exceptional properties including chemical inertness, thermal
stability, durability, tensile strength, and light weight. These qual-
ities make it an ideal material for applications in food packaging,
medical devices, and electrical equipment. [1] PET production
accounts for ≈8% of the world’s annual plastic production, but
less than 50% of PET waste is currently recycled.[2] The chemical
inertness of PET waste renders these materials extremely difficult
to degrade, such that these materials represent a severe concern
for our environment. Several PET recycling methods have been
established, including mechanical, chemical, and thermal recy-
cling.[3] Each method has drawbacks, including excessive energy
requirements and the poor quality of recycled products.
This renders PET recycling economically uncompetitive with the
production of “virgin” PET materials from fresh feedstocks of
EG and TPA, which are generally derived from petrochemicals.[4]
Biocatalytic hydrolysis of PET is emerging as a viable route for
PET recycling.[5] The first unambiguous description of a“PETase”
capable of catalyzing the hydrolysis of PET was reported in 2005,
when Müller et al. isolated a cutinase (TfH) from Thermobifida
fusca DSM43793 that depolymerized PET films by 54% after
21 days of incubation at 55 °C.[6] Another important development
was the isolation and characterization of a cutinase (HiC) from
the thermophilic fungus Humilica insolens that was maximally
active at 70–80 °C and could achieve nearly quantitative degra-
dation of amorphous PET films after 96 h at similarly elevated
temperatures.[7] In 2012, Kanaya et al. identified a thermostable
cutinase (LCC-PETase) that was produced by an unidentified
prokaryote from leaf compost and belonged to theα/β hydrolase
fold-5 subgroup (IPR029059) of theα/β hydrolase superfamily.[5]
This discovery was followed by Yoshida et al., who iso-
lated and characterized a mesophilic PETase and MHETase
(dubbed IsPETase and IsMHETase, respectively) that enabled
Ideonella sakaiensis to metabolize and grow on PET wastes.[8]
IsPETase-catalyzed hydrolysis of PET was found to produce
mono(2-hydroxyethyl) terephthalate (MHET) as the major prod-
uct, while IsMHETase was shown to convert MHET to TPA and
EG. Both enzymes belong to the α/β-hydrolase superfamily
and share the conserved catalytic triad of His-Asp-Ser residues
that typify this class of enzyme.[9] It has been proposed that
differences in the “lid domains” of IsPETase and IsMHETase are
responsible for the substrate specificities of these enzymes.[9]
Recent studies have focused on improving the thermostabil-
ity and efficiency of PETases to make them useful against
real-world PET waste at industrial scales. As the glass transition

temperature (Tg) of dry PET is 70–80 °C,[10] PETases that function
at similarly elevated temperatures are desirable, since at these
temperatures, individual strands of PET are thought to be more
accessible to enzyme active sites. Even when considering the
water-induced crystallization effects that reduce the effective
Tg of PET[11] (recent studies place the surface glass transition
temperature of PET in water at Tg = 40–45 °C[12]), increasingly
stable PETases are desirable to prolong the useful lifetime of
the biocatalyst. Directed evolution and genome mining studies
have identified variant PETases with enhanced thermostabili-
ties and catalytic efficiencies, including LCC ICCG[13] LCCWCCG,[13]
PHL7,[14] HOT-PETase,[15] and Fast-PETase.[16] Remarkably, one
such engineered PETase can break down 90% of 20 kg of PET
waste (pretreated with extrusion and micronization) in less than
three days.[8,17]
Although early adopters are now implementing enzymatic
PET recycling systems on industrial scales,[18] significant questions
about the nature and evolution of these enzymes remain. We
were interested in assessing how widespread PET-active enzymes
are within theα/β hydrolase superfamily. Recent works have also
investigated the diversity of sequences that enable enzymatic
PET depolymerization,[19] with one study employing bioinformat-
ics and machine learning to identify more than 70 putative
thermotolerant PETases comprising seven distinct phylogenetic
groups.[20] While most of the 38 sequences confirmed to be active
against PET were annotated as carboxylic ester hydrolases
(EC3.1.1.-) or cutinases (EC3.1.1.74), more distantly related
proteins (i.e., peptidases (EC3.1.1.74)) were also among those
confirmed to be active against PET. Recent bioprospecting efforts
by Fan et al.[21] have also demonstrated the diversity of sequ-
ences that are active against PET by mining the ≈2.5 million
unique sequences in their Global Ocean Microbiome Protein
Catalogue for proteins with homology to IsPETase. Nearly
1,600 such proteins were identified within this collection that
could be grouped into seven distinct clades with no dependence
on the geographic location of sampling sites. Six proteins were
prioritized for in vitro characterization based on their association
with extremophiles or extreme ecological niches, and three
of these proteins catalyzed PET hydrolysis, suggesting that a
significant proportion of the 1,600 putative PETases are authentic
PET-degrading enzymes. Intriguingly, the activities of the novel
PETases mined from the genomes of the ocean microbiome were
enhanced by high salt concentrations, likely reflecting the halo-
philic nature of the corresponding host marine microbes.
Given the importance of thermostability for efficient PET
processing, we used targeted genome mining to search for novel
PET-active α/β hydrolases from thermophilic microorganisms. As
mutations introduced through directed evolution to enhance
activity are often accompanied by compensatory decreases in sta-
bility of the protein,[22] we envisioned that the identification of
novel, naturally stable PETases would enable more extensive
explorations of sequence space while still retaining sufficient
stability for industrial purposes. To complement the previously
described search forIsPETase homologs,[21] we used LCC-PETase
as the seed sequence to construct sequence similarity networks
(SSNs) and identified ten genes from thermophiles that encoded
putative PETases. This work presents structural and biochemical
analysis of these novel enzymes against PET and structurally
related substrates. Each evaluated protein exhibited significant
thermostability, potentially making them useful starting points
for directed evolution campaigns aiming to produce new
PETases that are both stable and catalytically efficient. Finally,
the apparent “hit rate” for PETases within the α/β hydrolase
fold-5 subfamily highlights the underappreciated prominence of
PET-degrading activity in Nature and the effectiveness of genome
mining for finding new PETases.
2. Results and Discussion
2.1. Genome Mining for Thermostable PETases Using
Sequence Similarity Networks
The LCC-PETase[17] (accession ID: G9BY57) was used as the seed
sequence for constructing a PETase SSN. First, the InterProScan
webtool[23] was used to verify that LCC-PETase is a member of
IPR029059 (α/β-hydrolase fold-5 subfamily). At an alignment
score of 45 (corresponding to a %ID cut-off of≈26%), LCC-PETase
was partitioned into a small cluster of≈80 unannotated genes
(Figure 1, forest green), none of which were from thermophiles.
In contrast, the largest cluster (Figure 1, red) contained several
candidate genes encoding putative thermophilic enzymes.
Genes were initially prioritized based on 1) conservation of the
LCC-PETase catalytic triad (Ser165, Asp210, His242; LCC-PETase
numbering) and 2) the reported growth temperature of the host
organisms. AlphaFold2 [24] was then used to generate struc-
tural predictions for proteins of interest, and each prediction
was aligned with the experimentally derived structure of
LCC-PETase (PDB ID: 6THS) using the MatchMaker function
of ChimeraX.[25] As expected for members of theα/β-hydrolase
fold-5 subfamily, the overall folds of predicted structures
exhibited very low global root mean square deviation (RMSD)
when superimposed with LCC-PETase (Table S1, Supporting
Information). These structural alignments were also used to

work ( ) were contained in the large, red cluster, whereas LCC-PETase ()
was found in the smaller, forest green cluster.

evaluate the predicted active site architecture in proteins of inter-
est. In each of the ten enzymes selected for experimental char-
acterization ( Table 1), the residues comprising the putative
catalytic triad were found to be essentially coincident with the
corresponding residues in LCC-PETase (Figure S1 and S2,
Supporting Information). The ten enzymes exhibit 18–22%ID with
LCC-PETase, and 30–60%ID with one another (Table 1, Figure S1,
Supporting Information), thus providing a diverse sequence
space to explore for thermostable PETases.
2.2. Esterase Activity with an Activated Substrate
Each PETase was overexpressed inE. coliwith N-terminal His6 tags
and purified by immobilized metal affinity chromatography (IMAC)
(Figure S3, Supporting Information). Repeated attempts to overex-
press and purify TrmO, AroL, and NaTrm were unsuccessful, and
since TrmN could only be partially purified by IMAC, kinetic
comparisons with that protein should be interpreted with caution.
The purified enzymes were first tested for their capacity to hydro-
lyze esters withp-nitrophenyl butyrate (pNPB) as a substrate.[26]
Since most characterized PETases (including both IsPETase
and LCC-PETase) have been shown to be maximally active at
slightly alkaline conditions,[18,27] each purified enzyme was tested
for hydrolytic activity againstpNPB at pH values of 8 and 9 (50 mM
Tris–HCl, 30 °C). All tested enzymes catalyzed the hydrolysis of
pNPB and exhibited standard Michaelis–Menten behavior, except
for BelC, which could not be saturated with substrate (Figure S4,
Supporting Information). Likewise, with the exception of BelC, the
catalytic efficiencies (kcat/KM) of each enzyme at pH 8 and 9 were
similar (Table 2). BelC is a significantly more efficient catalyst for
the hydrolysis ofpNPB at pH 8 (kcat/KM =5100 M/C0 1 s/C0 1), although
this appears to be derived from a lowerKM value (KM =70 μM).
While this could be interpreted as an increased affinity for
the substrate, the lowerKM value may also arise from an accumu-
lation of the acyl-enzyme intermediate due to rate-limiting
deacylation.[28]
2.3. Evaluation of Protein Thermostabilities
Melting temperatures (Tm) of the purified enzymes were measured
using variable temperature circular dichroism spectroscopy.[29]
Gratifyingly, each protein tested was at least moderately thermo-
stable, withTm values ranging from 57 to 85 °C (Table 1, Figure S5,
Supporting Information). Notably, several proteins (i.e., TrmA, OcnT,
AroC, TrmN, and TrmD) exhibited thermostability in excess of
the reported growth temperature of the source bacterium. For
instance, although AroC was sourced from an organism with a
maximal reported growth temperature of 65 °C, theTm value for
purified AroC was significantly higher (Tm =85 °C).
Having established theTm values and esterase activity of the
enzymes, we next examined the stabilities of these proteins over
time. Given that PET has aTg ≈ 70 °C, PET-degrading enzymes that

remain stable and active at similarly elevated temperatures would
likely be ideal for biocatalytic PET recycling.[18] Therefore, we incu-
bated each enzyme at temperatures between 70 and 100 °C,
while removing aliquots at various time points to measure
residual hydrolytic activity against pNPB at 30 °C. Gratifyingly,
all of the enzymes retained at least 70% of their initial activity
over 24 h at 70 °C (Figure 2). Remarkably, several of the enzymes
exhibited even greater thermostabilities. While AroC and BelC
lost 25% and 40% activity, respectively, following 24 h at 80 °C,
OcnT, TrmA, and TrmH lost only≈10% activity under the same
conditions (Figure 2B–D), while TrmD showed no significant loss
of activity (Figure 2F). Likewise, while 24 h at 90 °C caused TrmA to
lose half of its initial activity (Figure 2B), OcnT retained nearly
100% of the initial activity, while AroC and TrmH retained
≈90% of the initial activity. Finally, we examined the impact of
boiling the enzymes for one hour. While TrmD lost about 80%
of the initial activity after this treatment, TrmA and TrmH lost only
≈20% and≈25% activity, respectively. Remarkably, OcnT retained
100% activity after one hour at 100 °C. Interestingly, these results
show that highTm values do not necessarily correspond to the
active lifetime of an enzyme at a given temperature. For example,
the Tm value of OcnT (Tm = 74 °C) is lower than that of both TrmA
and TrmD (Tm = 79 °C), and yet OcnT is active at elevated temper-
atures for longer periods than either TrmA or TrmD (Figure 2).
Notably, a recent study also described several PETases that
appeared to remain stable and active at temperatures exceeding
the melting temperatures of these proteins.[30]
2.4. Characterization of PETase Activity
We next examined the hydrolytic activity of the enzymes
against a closer structural mimic of PET. We synthesized 3PET

(bis(benzoyloxyethyl) terephthalate) to serve as a mimic of a trimer
of PET (Scheme S1, Supporting Information).[31] Although 3PET is
sparingly water-soluble, aqueous emulsions of this compound can
be produced, and the decrease in turbidity as 3PET is converted to
the water-soluble benzoic acid, TPA, and EG can provide a simple
assay of PETase activity.[32] Initial rates were obtained by recording
OD600 values over time following addition of the enzyme. Six of the
purified enzymes were tested against 3PET at pH 8 (50 mM
Tris-HCl) and 45 °C, and each was found to catalyze a reduction
in turbidity over 16 h. BelC and OcnT gave the highest initial rates
of clearance in the first hour (Table 3), consistent with the relative
catalytic efficiencies observed withpNPB as substrate (Table 2).
While kcat/KM values obtained with pNPB suggested that BelC
and OcnT were the most efficient hydrolases, the agreement
between the trends in activities obtained with 3PET andpNPB
is generally poor, likely reflecting the significant structural differ-
ences of these substrates.
Having observed enzyme-catalyzed clearance of the 3PET
emulsions, we next assayed both the benchmark PETase LCCICCG
and the putative PETases against authentic PET plastics. First,
PET nanoparticles were made into an aqueous emulsion with hex-
afluoroisopropanol.[33] Each enzyme was added to the solution and
the mixture was incubated at 65 °C for one hour. The amount of
TPA released from the PET emulsion was quantified using a previ-
ously established assay[34] that employs Fenton chemistry to con-
vert TPA into the fluorescent 2-hydroxyterephthlate (Table 4). The
novel enzymes evaluated here produced variable quantities
of TPA, with OcnT, TrmA, and TrmH being the most effective,
while AroC and TrmD did not catalyze the release of statistically
significant quantities of TPA. While the results in Table 4 demon-
strate that a subset of the novel PETases identified here catalyze
the release of TPA from emulsified PET, these enzymes are consid-
erably less efficient catalysts for this process than LCCICCG.A s
LCCICCG is an engineered PETase, it is not particularly surprising that
the naturally occurring proteins described are less efficient
PETases.
A comparison of the results in Table 3 and 4 also suggests
interesting differences in the apparent specificities of the novel
enzymes toward 3PET and emulsified PET nanoparticles. Most
notably, the clearance assay with 3PET indicates BelC and
OcnT are the most efficient enzymes (Table 3), whereas the
Fenton-based assays that specifically detect TPA suggest that
BelC is minimally active and OcnT is a relatively efficient catalyst
(Table 4). This result would be consistent with MHET being the
major product of the BelC-catalyzed degradation of PET, as
the Fenton-based assay will only detect TPA released from the
polymer. In contrast, results presented in Table 4 suggest that
TPA is the major product of the OcnT-catalyzed PET hydrolysis.
These results mirror previous observations that different
PETases will produce different distributions of MHET, TPA, and
EG during the catalyzed degradation of PET.[35]
2.5. Characterization of PETases against PET Film
As useful PETases will need to be active on real-world postcon-
sumer PET, the enzymes were next evaluated for their ability to
degrade PET films. Each enzyme (final concentration 1 nM) was
incubated with amorphous PET film (Goodfellow) for seven
days at 65 °C and pH 8 (50 mM Tris–HCl). Every 24 h, an aliquot
was removed and analyzed by ultra-performance liquid
chromatography-mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS). This same anal-
ysis was also conducted using LCCICCG, although the assay with
this protein was conducted over two days, due to the superior
performance of this catalyst. Of the novel proteins characterized
here, only BelC, OcnT, and TrmN were found to be active against
PET film, whereas no products of PET hydrolysis were detected
with the remaining enzymes. Over the course of this incubation,
these three enzymes clearly catalyzed the formation of varying
levels of TPA, MHET, and bis(2-hydroxyethyl) terephthalate
(BHET) (Figure 3). BelC and TrmN were found to release MHET
as the major product during the initial portions of the assay, with
TPA gradually accumulating over the course of the week
(Figure 3A,B). This“burst” of MHET production was also observed
with LCCICCG, consistent with previous examinations of the prod-
uct profile associated with this benchmark PETase (Figure S10,
Supporting Information). Intriguingly, the product profile associ-
ated with the OcnT-catalyzed depolymerization of PET film sug-
gested that this enzyme releases TPA as the major product over
the course of the assay (Figure 3C). Each of these enzymes was
also found to produce low and relatively constant concentrations
of BHET. The observation that BelC produces MHET almost exclu-
sively early in the reaction with PET film, while OcnT produces
TPA as the major product, is consistent with results obtained with
the TPA-specific activity assay against emulsified PET nanopar-
ticles (Table 4).
The residual activity of BelC, TrmN, and OcnT was also assayed
during the PET film degradation study, whereby an aliquot of the
reaction mixture was removed at the beginning and end of the
one-week assay. The residual hydrolytic activity of each enzyme
was then assayed againstpNPB (Figure 3). These enzymes were
found to exhibit widely variable levels of residual activity follow-
ing the one-week assay at 65 °C, with BelC, TrmN, and OcnT
retaining ≈25%, 50%, and 90% activities, respectively. Of the three
enzymes active against PET film, BelC exhibited the lowestTm
but was also the most efficient enzyme against bothpNPB and
3PET. BelC was also the most efficient of these enzymes against
PET film, releasing ≈80 μMo fT P Aa n d≈25 μMo fM H E To v e r

the course of the week-long assay (Figure 3A). The high efficiency
that BelC exhibited onpNPB, 3PET emulsions, and PET films may
provide some confidence that small molecule mimics of PET can
serve as useful compounds to enable comparative kinetic analyses
of PETases. In contrast, OcnT is more stable than BelC, and corre-
spondingly, OcnT catalyzed the release of only≈8 μMo fT P Aa n da
miniscule amount of MHET under identical conditions (Figure 3C).
The quantity of degradants released from the PET film was
then used to determine the extent of depolymerization of the
substrate by LCCICCG and the three novel enzymes found to be
active against films. Although BelC, TrmN, and OcnT are unam-
biguously active against PET film, the week-long treatment with
each enzyme resulted in only 1.2%/C6 0.2%, 0.44%/C6 0.03%, and
0.08% /C6 0.01% depolymerization, respectively. While these
enzymes might serve as useful seed sequences for directed
evolution campaigns to generate PETases with altered properties,
each protein is significantly less efficient at depolymerization
than engineered LCCICCG. In fact, LCCICCG was shown to achieve
nearly quantitative depolymerization of postconsumer PET waste
after only 24 h under similar conditions.[13] A more direct compar-
ison was facilitated by incubating LCC ICCG with amorphous
PET film at 65 °C and pH 8 (50 mM Tris-HCl) for two days. After
this shortened assay, LCCICCG had depolymerized 32%/C6 3% of
the film substrate, demonstrating the substantial difference
in efficiencies separating BelC, TrmN, and OcnT from this engi-
neered PETase.
Since AroC, TrmA, TrmD, and TrmH were apparently unable to
hydrolyze PET film, the level of residual activity of each protein
was assayed against pNPB following the week-long incubation.
While TrmD was largely inactive following the incubation
with the film, the three remaining proteins retained significant
levels of hydrolytic activity the 7-day reaction at 65 °C (Figure
S9, Supporting Information). The lack of reactivity toward PET film
by these enzymes may reflect differences in substrate specificity
as well as access to the PET polymer chain. Both the PET emulsion
assay and PET film assays were conducted at a temperature
below the Tg of PET. At this temperature, the emulsified PET
nanoparticles would likely be more accessible to the enzymes
than the PET film. In this context, it is notable that the Auclair
lab has recently demonstrated that the commercial cutinase
HiC is able to hydrolyze highly crystalline PET under moist-solid
conditions.[36]
2.6. Structural Characterization of AroC
We also attempted to structurally characterize several of the pro-
teins described here to better understand their activities and
thermostabilities. While all proteins were subjected to crystalliza-
tion screening, conditions could only be identified for the growth
of high-quality AroC crystals. This protein is not active on PET film
and is minimally active on PET nanoparticles (Table 4), but the
enzyme does exhibit a remarkably highTm (85 °C, Table 1) and
catalyzes the hydrolysis of 3PET (Table 3). As such, structural char-
acterization of AroC was pursued to gain insight into the thermo-
stability of this protein and, potentially, the stabilities of the
other hydrolases were described here. Additionally, the experi-
mentally determined structure of AroC could be compared with
the predicted structure of this protein to ensure that AlphaFold2
can accurately predict the structures of the α/β hydrolase
fold-5 subfamily members that could not be crystallized.
The structure of AroC was resolved to a resolution of 2.25 Å
(PDB: 9EH6) (Figure 4). The enzyme crystallized as a homodimer,
with each monomer exhibiting the canonical α/β hydrolase

fold made up of eightβ-strands arranged into a central mixed
β-sheet that is flanked by sixα-helices (Figure 4A).[37] AroC has
an additional N-terminalα-helix (residues A30QALASL36) that serves
as a seventh flankingα-helix (Figure S1, Supporting Information).
The AroC structure was then compared to the X-ray crystal struc-
ture of a mutant LCC-PETase in which the catalytic serine was
mutated to an alanine (PDB: 7VVE). The structures exhibited an
RMSD of 1.11 Å between 93 pruned atom pairs (8.16 Å across
all 193 pairs; Figure 4B) and the catalytic triad residues were effec-
tively coincident (Figure S2A, Supporting Information). However,
AroC has a distinctive loop (residues G208WYGEQPGDNPATIS222)
that folds over the active site (Figure 4B) that is not shared with
LCC-PETase (Figure S1, Supporting Information).
AlphaFold2 was then used to predict the structure of AroC, and
this prediction was compared to the X-ray crystal structure. The
alignment of the two structures exhibited a global RMSD of only
0.672 Å, suggesting that AlphaFold2 accurately predicts the struc-
tures ofα/β hydrolase fold-5 subfamily. As such, the structures of
the nine other proteins described in this work were predicted
and aligned with the experimentally derived structure of AroC.
This comparison indicated that each protein harbors the distinctive
loop (G208–S222; AroC numbering) that is absent in LCC-PETase, and a
multiple sequence alignment demonstrated significant sequence
conservation within and immediately preceding this loop:
F207GxY(G/E)xQx(G/E)DxxxxI(S/T)222 (AroC numbering, Figure S11,
Supporting Information). While this conservation is intriguing, the
role of this loop is not entirely clear: of the 13 first shell active site
residues that LCC-PETase is predicted to use to interact with a model
of a PET trimer,[13] AroC shares 4 identical residues, and 6 others that
are similar in polarity and size (Figure 4C,D, Figure S1, Supporting
Information). F207 of AroC is predicted to make a conserved
π-interaction with a terephthalate group, whereas Y210 and H125
are predicted to replicate H-bonds to ester linkages, and G68, L177,
Y152, and L127 are homologs to residues in LCC-PETase that form
hydrophobic contacts with the substrate (Figure 4D).
Next, the predicted structures of BelC, OcnT, TrmA, TrmD,
TrmH, TrmN, along with the X-ray crystal structure of AroC, were
used to rationalize the thermostability of the enzymes. The
number of salt bridges present on the surface of each protein
was determined and compared to theTm value for each protein
(Figure 5). In general, theTm of the enzyme correlates well with

the number of surface salt bridges on the exterior of the protein,
with TrmD and BelC havingTm values higher than expected. This
is consistent with the finding that salt bridges are more abundant
in hyper-thermostable proteins. [38] At higher temperatures,
the energetic penalty associated with desolvation of charged
residues decreases significantly, such that salt bridges are largely
stabilizing at elevated temperatures.[33] While the observed cor-
relation between thermostability and the number of salt bridges
is not exact, it does implicate these ionic interactions as being at
least partially responsible for imbuing the enzymes described
here with exceptional thermostabilities.
3. Conclusion
In this study, we made use of SSNs to mine theα/β hydrolase
family for novel PET-degrading enzymes from thermophilic
organisms. This approach proved to be highly efficient: out of
ten genes encoding putative thermophilic PETases from α/β
hydrolase_5 subfamily, seven soluble proteins were purified
and shown to be active toward a trimeric mimic of PET and
PET nanoparticles, and three of these enzymes were also capable
of degrading PET film. Given that these proteins were quite dis-
similar to LCC-PETase (%ID = 18–22%), results presented here
also suggest that PET-active proteins may be more widely distrib-
uted across theα/β hydrolase family than previously appreciated.
Each new PETase described here also exhibited high thermo-
stabilities, and structural analysis demonstrated a correlation
between the number of surface salt-bridges with observedTm val-
ues. With advancements in the understanding of PETase mech-
anisms, these naturally thermostable PETase variants can serve as
scaffolds for directed evolution to engineer variants that are both
thermostable and catalytically efficient. Overall, this work not only
expands our knowledge in enzymatic PET degradation but also
provides a template for the discovery of extremozymes for other
applications.
4. Experimental Section
General
Chemicals used to make media and buffers were obtained from
Bioshop. Genes encoding PETases were synthesized into expression
vectors by BioBasic (Canada). In cases where SignalP 6.0 predicted
signal peptides, the corresponding portion of the gene was
removed.[39] The genes were codon optimized for expression in
E. coli a n dc l o n e di n t ot h eN d e Ia n dX h o Is i t e so fp E T - 2 6 b(þ)t o
encode each enzyme with an C-terminal His6-tag. Optimized gene
sequences are given in the Supplementary Information (Table S4,
Supporting Information). Unless otherwise stated, all cultivation
media for E. coli was supplemented with 50 μgm L/C0 1 kanamycin.
Plysurf A210G surfactant was obtained from Dr. Sofia Lemak and
Prof. Alexander F. Yakunin (University of Toronto). PET film was
purchased from GoodFellow, PET nanoparticles were purchased
from Nanochemazone, and Ni2þ Sepharose high-performance resin
was purchased from Cytiva.E. coliBL21(DE3) and LOBSTR cells were
obtained from New England Biosciences and Fisher Scientific,
respectively.
SSN Analysis
LCC-PETase (accession ID: G9BY57) was analyzed by the InterProScan
webtool to assign this e nzyme to the IPR029059 ( α/β-hydrolase
fold-5) family. The Enzyme Function Initiative’sE n z y m eS i m i l a r i t yT o o l
(EFI-EST)[40] was then used to conduct an all-by-all BLAST for all members
of this protein family. An alignment score of 45 was used to visualize the
resulting network in Cytoscape 3.9.1. Sequences contained in this net-
work that were from thermophileswere identified using Cytoscape’s
ability to filter nodes on the basis of the name of the host organism.
Protein Expression and Purification
Plasmids encoding PETases were transformed into chemically compe-
tent E. coli cells by heat shock and plated onto lysogeny broth
(LB)-agar supplemented with 50 μgm L/C0 1 kanamycin. AroC, TrmA,
and OcnT were expressed in E. coli BL21(DE3) cells, while TrmD,
TrmN, BelC, and TrmH were expressed in E. coli LOBSTR cells.
Following overnight growth, a single colony was picked and used
to inoculate 10 mL of sterile LB media. The next day, this overnight
culture was used to inoculate 1 L of LB. The culture was allowed to
grow at 37 °C and 180 rpm until an OD600 of 0.6–0.8 was reached.
After incubating the cells on ice for 10 min, expression was then
induced by the addition of isopropyl β-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside
to a final concentration of 0.5 mM. The culture was then shaken
at 37 °C and 180 rpm for an additional 3 h before the
cells were harvested by centrifugation at 4 °C and 4000 /C2 g for
10 min. Harvested cells were resuspended in binding buffer
(20 mM Tris–HCl, pH 7.6, 100 mM NaCl, 20 mM imidazole, 10% glycerol
v/v) and lysed by three passes through an EmulsiFlex C-5 homogenizer
(Avestin, Ottawa) at 10,000 –15,000 psi. Cellular debris was then
removed by centrifugation at 16,000/C2 g for 1 hr and the supernatant
was loaded onto a Ni2þ-NTA resin that had been preequilibrated with
binding buffer. The column was then washed with 10–15 column vol-
umes (CVs) of binding buffer followed by elution of the protein of inter-
est with 3–5 CVs of elution buffer (20 mM Tris–HCl, pH 7.6, 100 mM
NaCl, 500 mM imidazole, 10% glycerol v/v). Fractions containing pure
enzyme were determined by SDS-PAGE, pooled and concentrated
using a 10 kDa MWCO centrifugal filter unit. Concentrated samples
were buffer exchanged into storage buffer (40 mM Tris–HCl, pH 7.6,
100 mM NaCl, and 10% glycerol v/v) using a PD-10 desalting column
or a 10 kDa MWCO centrifugal filter unit. Protein concentrations were
measured by absorbance at 280 nm using extinction coefficients
calculated for each protein using the ProtParam tool from Expasy.[41]
Enzyme Activity Assays withpNPB
Reactions to assay esterase activity were performed in 976μL5 0 m M
Tris-HCl (pH 8 or 9) equilibrated at 30 °C. Aliquots of 20μL pNPB dis-
solved in acetone were added to achieve the desired final substrate
concentrations. The reaction was initiated by the addition of 4μL
concentrated enzyme, and reaction progress was monitored by
absorbance at 405 nm using an Agilent Technologies G9864A spec-
trometer. Spontaneous rates of hydrolysis were measured prior to
adding enzyme and subtracted from the observed enzymatic rate.
Initial rates were measured at substrate concentrations between
≈0.2/C2 and ≈5/C2 the final KM values, where possible. Plots of initial
rates versus substrate concentration were fit to the Michaelis
Menten equation using Origin Lab 2024. Values ofkcat were deter-
mined using calculated enzyme extinction coefficients for enzyme
concentrations and ε405 = 18,000 M/C0 1 cm/C0 1 for p-nitrophenolate.[42]
Tm Measurements of Enzymes
Protein samples (300μL of 1 mg mL/C0 1) were loaded into a quartz
cuvette (Hellma USA Inc., round cylindrical cuvette, 1 mm pathlength)

and placed into a Chirascan V100 CD spectroscopy instrument
(Applied Photophysics Ltd.). Samples were incrementally heated from
20 to 90 °C in 2.5 °C steps. Ellipticity was measured as a function of
temperature between 180 and 260 nm. The melting temperature (Tm)
is the temperature at which the fraction unfolded (Fu) and fraction
folded (F) are equal. Fraction unfolded is calculated using the equa-
tion Fu = (Fo /C0 F)/(Uf /C0 F) whereFo is the ellipticity value at each tem-
perature, F is the ellipticity value at low temperature, andUf is the
ellipticity value at the highest temperature.
Enzyme Thermostability Analysis
Aliquots of enzyme at 100μM in storage buffer (40 mM Tris–HCl, pH
7.6, 100 mM NaCl, 10% glycerol v/v) were placed in a water bath set at
the desired temperature for 0 to 24 h. At a given time, an aliquot of
enzyme was removed, centrifuged at 8500 rpm for 1 min, then placed
on ice. 4μL of supernatant was then used to initiate the hydrolysis of
0.5 mMpNPB at 30 °C in 1 mL 50 mM Tris–HCl, pH 8. Initial rates were
measured in triplicate with three individual aliquots.
3PET Synthesis[43]
3PET was synthesized as described previously (Scheme S1, Supporting
Information), and purified by flash silica gel chromatography using tol-
uene: ethyl acetate 5:1 (v/v). NMR spectroscopic analysis of pure
3PET (Figure S6, Supporting Information) matched the literature
description.[43]
Enzyme Activity Assay with 3PET
A 3PET emulsion was formed by dissolving 0.1 g of 3PET in 5 mL of
acetone and adding 20 mg of the surfactant Plysurf A210G. The mix-
ture was poured into 20 mL of Tris–HCl (50 mM, pH 8) and suspended
by sonication at maximum frequency (Fisher Scientific Sonic
Dismembrator Model 100) on ice for 30 min. The solution was then
stirred at 60 °C for 30 min, followed by stirring at room temperature
overnight to be ready for use. The 3PET emulsion was diluted with
50 mM Tris–HCl (pH 8.0) to a final OD600 of ≈1. Then, 150μL of the
diluted 3PET emulsion was added to each well of a 96-well plate
along with 50μL of enzyme solution to achieve a final concentration
of 15–400 μM. The plate was shaken (180 rpm) at 45 °C for 72 h using
a BioTek Synergy H1 plate reader, and OD600 was recorded every
10 min. Triplicate measurements of the initial OD600 of a 3PET emul-
sion were recorded before these mixtures were centrifuged at
13,000 rpm for 10 min to collect the 3PET in the emulsion.
Residues were then dried in a 60 °C oven for≈11 h before being
weighed. The mass of the collected 3PET was then correlated to
the OD600 to convert OD600 measurements to approximate masses
of 3PET.[33]
Enzyme Activity Assay with PET Nanoparticles
The quantitation of TPA released from PET nanoparticles during enzy-
matic hydrolysis was determined by oxidatively converting TPA
to the fluorescent compound 2-hydroxyterephthalate as described
previously.[33] PET nanoparticles were dissolved in 1,1,1,3,3,3-
hexafluoro-2-propanol (HFIP) and then added dropwise into water
while sonicating on ice at maximum frequency (Fisher Scientific
Sonic Dismembrator Model 100). HFIP was subsequently removed
by rotary evaporation. 10μL aliquots of the PET emulsion were dis-
pensed into 96-well plates along with 1–10 μL of enzyme solution (to
a final concentration of 1μM) and a sufficient volume of 500 mM
sodium phosphate buffer (pH 8) to bring the total volume to
200 μL. The 96-well plate was then placed in a temperature-
controlled shaker (Labnet Vortemp 56) for incubation at 65 °C with
shaking at 800 rpm for 60 min. Plates were then centrifuged at
2,844 /C2 g and 4 °C for 15 min before transferring 150μL of the super-
natant into a black 96-well plate. Prior to measurements, 25μLo f
5 mM EDTA and 25μL of 5 mM FeSO4 were added to initiate the oxi-
dation of TPA, and the plates were incubated at room temperature
for at least 10 min before fluorescence readings were recorded on a
BioTek Synergy H1 plate reader (λex = 314 nm,λem = 421 nm). A stan-
dard curve of fluorescence versus known concentrations of TPA con-
verted to 2-hydroxyterepthlalate through the Fenton reaction
was used to quantify the enzymatic TPA product (Figure S7,
Supporting Information).
PET Film Assay
Goodfellow PET film (ES30-FM-000145, 0.25 mm thickness, transpar-
ent, amorphous) was cut into 2 mg discs of 6 mm diameter with a
standard paper hole punch. The PET discs were placed in a microcen-
trifuge tube containing 50 mM Tris–HCl, pH8 followed by adding
enzymes to a final concentration of 1 nM for a total reaction volume
of 1 mL. The reaction was incubated in a Labnet Vortem p56 shaker at
65 °C for 7 days at 800 rpm. Aliquots of 27μL were removed from the
reactions each day and mixed with 3μL DMSO to assist solubilization
of the products of hydrolysis. Samples were sonicated for 5 min and
then centrifuged at 21,000/C2 g for 10 min. The solutions were then
resolved on a Cortecs T3 UPLC reverse phase column (1.6 μm,
2.1 /C2 100 mm) using a Waters Acquity UPLC-MS H class system.
A1 0μL aliquot of the sample was injected and resolved using a gra-
dient of 89:1:10 to 55:35:10 water/acetonitrile/1% formic acid over
11 min with a flow rate of 0.3 mL min/C0 1. The hydrolysis products
(TPA, MHET, and BHET) were detected by absorbance at 240 nm
and quantified by comparison to standard curves (Figure S8,
Supporting Information). The depolymerization percentage of PET
was calculated based on the initial mass of the PET film (2 mg) used
in the experiment. The mass was divided by the molecular weight of
the PET repeating unit (192.18 g mol/C0 1) to determine the theoretical
100% conversion amount in moles. For each enzyme, the total
amount of UPLC-detected depolymerized products — terephthalic
acid (TPA), mono(2-hydroxyethyl) terephthalate (MHET), and
bis(2-hydroxyethyl) terephthalate (BHET)— was summed in moles.
This total was then divided by the theoretical 100% conversion
amount to obtain the percentage of PET depolymerization.
AroC X-ray Crystallography
Purified AroC was concentrated to 10 mg mL/C0 1 in 40 mM Tris-HCl, pH
7.6, 100 mM NaCl. Crystallization conditions were screened using the
Index HT screening kit (Hampton Research Corp) and the final protein
crystallization condition after refinement for crystal growth was
100 mM sodium acetate at pH 4.5 with 8% PEG3350. Protein crystals
were stored in liquid nitrogen and data collection was performed at
the Canadian Light Source synchrotron. Data was auto-processed
with XDS and scaled to a maximum resolution of 2.25 Å (Table S3,
Supporting Information). The AlphaFold2 predicted structure of
AroC was utilized for molecular replacement using MOLREP as part
of the CCP4 suite.[44] Water molecules were resolved, and refinement
was completed using REFMAC.[45] Coot[46] was used for structure ver-
ification and manual refinement to fit the structure into the observed
electron density map.[47] The final structure was deposited into the
Protein Data Bank as 9EH6.
