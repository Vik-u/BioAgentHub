Polyethylene terephthalate (PET) is a synthetic polymer in the polyester family. It is 
widely found in objects used daily, including packaging materials (such as bottles 
and containers), textiles (such as fibers), and even in the automotive and electronics 
industries. PET is known for its excellent mechanical properties, chemical 
resistance, and transparency. However, these features (e.g., high hydrophobicity 
and high molecular weight) also make PET highly resistant to degradation by wild-
type microorganisms or physicochemical methods in nature, contributing to the 
accumulation of plastic waste in the environment. Therefore, accelerated PET 
recycling is becoming increasingly urgent to address the global environmental 
problem caused by plastic wastes and prevent plastic pollution. In addition to 
traditional physical cycling (e.g., pyrolysis, gasification) and chemical cycling 
(e.g., chemical depolymerization), biodegradation can be  used, which involves 
breaking down organic materials into simpler compounds by microorganisms or 
PET-degrading enzymes. Lipases and cutinases are the two classes of enzymes 
that have been studied extensively for this purpose. Biodegradation of PET is an 
attractive approach for managing PET waste, as it can help reduce environmental 
pollution and promote a circular economy. During the past few years, great 
advances have been accomplished in PET biodegradation. In this review, current 
knowledge on cutinase-like PET hydrolases (such as TfCut2, Cut190, HiC, and 
LCC) was described in detail, including the structures, ligand–protein interactions, 
and rational protein engineering for improved PET-degrading performance. In 
particular, applications of the engineered catalysts were highlighted, such as 
improving the PET hydrolytic activity by constructing fusion proteins. The review 
is expected to provide novel insights for the biodegradation of complex polymers.

1. Introduction
Poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) is used extensively worldwide in plastic products, and 
around 350 million tons have been produced in 2017 ( Geyer et  al., 2017 ). However, the 
accumulation of PET waste and its resistance to degradation in the environment have posed a 
serious threat and become a global concern (Choi et al., 2022; Li et al., 2022). PET has different

crystallinities according to its usage, which leads to PET materials 
with different features and chemical properties, such as the fluctuation 
of polymer chains, surface area, functional groups, molecular weight, 
hydrophobicity, and melting temperature (Kawai et al., 2019). This has 
created another problem for scientists attempting to develop a strategy 
to efficiently degrade all kinds of PET wastes (Thomsen et al., 2022a).
To date, several strategies have been proposed for recycling PET 
waste, including primary recycling, mechanical recycling, chemical 
recycling, energy recycling, and biological recycling (Cao et al., 2022). 
Enzyme-based hydrolysis of postconsumer plastic (biological 
recycling) is an emerging strategy for closed-loop recycling of 
PET. This is a process catalyzed by PET-degrading enzymes (or 
microorganisms) that breaks the PET polymer into diverse products, 
such as terephthalic acid (TPA), ethylene glycol (EG), 
bis-(hydroxyethyl) terephthalate (BHET), and (mono-(2-hydroxyehyl)
terephthalic acid (MHET)). This is the interactive result of active site 
accessibility to the polymer surface ( Zumstein et  al., 2017 ), and 
especially it was found that the endo-lytic activity (ability to hydrolyse 
internal bonds in the polymer) was a key parameter for overall enzyme 
performance (Schubert et  al., 2023 ). Therefore, a circular carbon 
economy for PET is theoretically attainable through rapid enzymatic 
depolymerization followed by directed conversion into other high 
value-added products (Ru et al., 2020; Ellis et al., 2021; Kakadellis and 
Rosetto, 2021; Simon et al., 2021).
In a broad sense, the PET-degrading enzymes can be divided into 
the following categories according to their different functions: surface-
modifying enzymes and PET hydrolases ( Kawai et  al., 2019). The 
former is usually applied for the enzymatic surface modification of 
polyester fibers to improve hydrophilicity (surface hydrophilization), 
including lipases, carboxylesterases, and cutinases ( Biundo et  al., 
2018). These enzymes usually act on the ends or the loop (defined as 
a polymer chain, both ends of which are attached to the PET surface) 
on their surface of polymer chains, which are then hydrolysed to 
carboxylic acid and hydroxyl residues, increasing surface 
hydrophilicity (Kawai et al., 2017; Oda et al., 2018). The latter could 
significantly degrade the inner block of PET, as revealed by visible 
changes found through SEM. In addition, PET hydrolases are capable 
of performing surface hydrolysis, which would lead to the hydrolysis 
of the surface polymer chain instead of degrading the building 
blocks of PET.
The first enzymatic PET degradation study was reported by Rolf 
Joachim et  al. (2005) . It was shown that the obtained hydrolase 
hydrolysed two kinds of PET films at 55°C. Soon afterwards, the first 
purified poly(butylene terephthalate-co-adipate) (BTA) hydrolase 1 
was purified and characterized from the culture supernatant of 
Thermobifida fusca (T. fusca) (Kleeberg et al., 2005), which further 
revealed that the sequence of Tfu0883 is consistent with that of the 
gene for BTA-1 (Lykidis et al., 2007 ). Since then, various effective 
enzymes have been observed to perform enzymatic PET hydrolysis. 
These enzymes with PET-degradation activity mainly belong to the 
subfamily of carboxylic ester hydrolases (EC 3.1.1.x), including 
carboxylesterase (EC 3.1.1.1) ( von Haugwitz et  al., 2022 ), lipases 
(Moyses et al., 2021), cutinases (EC 3.1.1.74) (Wei and Zimmermann, 
2017), and arylesterase (EC 3.1.1.2) (Austin et al., 2018). In addition, 
several PETase-like enzymes have been identified, extending the scope 
of enzymatic PET recycling (Almeida et al., 2019; Karunatillaka et al., 
2022; Li et al., 2022 ). Among them, great achievements have been 
accomplished in the fields of crystallographic and protein engineering 
of T. fusca cutinases with various released structures [e.g., PDB ID: 
4CG1 ( Roth et  al., 2014 ), 6EQH ( Austin et  al., 2018 ), 6AID 
(Kitadokoro et  al., 2019), 7VPB ( Li et  al., 2022)], rational protein 
engineering (Lu et al., 2022), and metabolic engineering or synthetic 
biology-driven studies ( Brandenberg et  al., 2022; Jia et  al., 2022). 
Examples include the TfCut2 variant (Wei et al., 2016), Cut190 variant 
(Oda et  al., 2018 ), HiC ( Ronkvist et  al., 2009 ), and leaf-branch 
compost cutinase (LCC) (Sulaiman et al., 2012; Xue et al., 2021). In 
particular, LCC was shown to be among the most effective enzymes 
and has a potential ability to recycle PET. The engineered LCC was 
shown to breakdown a minimum of 90% of PET into monomers over 
10 h (Tournier et al., 2020). There are several excellent reviews or 
studies illustrating the molecular engineering, applications of 
cutinases and other biological strategies for PET hydrolysis (Zumstein 
et al., 2017; Ellis et al., 2021; Tamoor et al., 2021; Urbanek et al., 2021; 
Kumar et al., 2022; Brackmann et al., 2023).
In 2016, a novel bacterium, Ideonella sakaiensis 201-F6, was 
reported to proliferate on a low (1.9%)-crystallinity [The degree of PET 
crystallinity (XC) indicates the fraction of the total polymer chains 
being in the crystal structure state (Thomsen et al., 2022b)]. PET film 
at 30°C for 40 days and hydrolyse PET with catalysis by the two released 
enzymes [ISF6_4831 ( IsPETase) and ISF6_0224 ( IsMHETase)] 
(Y oshida et al., 2016). This led to the rapid development of IsPETase, 
an IsPETase-like enzyme, in the field of PET biodegradation. In 
addition, based on modern biotechnology, such as deep sequencing 
technologies, metagenomics, and AI-based bioscience, novel 
hydrolases with PET-degrading activity have been discovered and 
characterized, such as Ple629 (Meyer-Cifuentes et al., 2020), Mors1 and 
OaCut (Blázquez-Sánchez et al., 2022), MG8 (Eiamthong et al., 2022), 
RgPETase (Sagong et al., 2021) and BbPETase (Sagong et al., 2022).
To date, about 89 different enzymes [PAZy database (Buchholz 
et al., 2022)1] with PET-degrading ability have been discovered and 
characterized (Magalhães et al., 2021), and with the rapid development 
of bioinformatics and machine learning, an increasing number of PET 
hydrolases have been sourced from natural diversity (Erickson et al., 
2022). This greatly expands the number and diversity of efficient 
scaffolds for enzymatic PET deconstruction. All effective PET 
hydrolases might belong to the family of cutinases or homologous 
enzymes ( Kawai et  al., 2019 ). Although the application of PET 
hydrolase is a green and sustainable strategy for PET degradation, it 
has been hampered by the lack of robustness to pH and temperature 
ranges, slow reaction rates and inability to directly use untreated 
postconsumer plastics. Therefore, research to improve the stability of 
PET-degrading enzymes and designing robust industrial catalysts is 
still facing great difficulties. It is worth noting that several biotech 
companies have long been committed to transforming plastic waste 
into recycled and recyclable plastic, such as the French company 
Carbios2 and the commercial hydrolase enzymes from Novozymes 
[e.g., CalB (Lipozyme ® CALB L), RmL (Palatase ® 20000L), CaL 
(Eversa® transform), TlL (Lipozyme® TL), HiC (Novozym® 51032)].
In this study, a brief overview of the recent advances in special 
cutinases and cutinase-like enzymes with PET-degrading activities is 
provided, including their structures, catalytic mechanisms, and

applications. In particular, rational protein engineering based on 
macromolecule structures is highlighted. Finally, further perspectives 
on the industrial applications of enzyme-catalyzed PET degradation 
are also discussed.
2. Promising enzymes for PET 
degradation
Considering that polymer molecules tend to become flexible at 
temperatures above the glass transition temperature (Tg), the high Tg 
value of PET makes the thermostability of PET-degrading enzymes 
crucial for the efficient depolymerization of PET (Kawai, 2021). It is 
believed that the optimal temperature of a desired PET hydrolase 
needs to be >60 or preferably >70°C. Based on this recognition, a few 
thermophilic enzymes, including the TfH variant (TfCut2) (Mrigwani 
et al., 2023), LCC variant (LCCICCG) (Tournier et al., 2020), Cut190 
variant (Kawai et al., 2022), HiC (Carniel et al., 2021), and BhrPETase 
(Xi et al., 2021), satisfy the requirements for thermostability above 
60°C. In addition to thermophilic enzymes, the discovery of IsPETase 
from the mesophilic bacterium ( Ideonella sakaiensis ) caused 
mesophilic PET-hydrolysing enzymes to become a research hot spot. 
In this section, recent developments in special PET hydrolase with 
bright prospects are highlighted (Table 1).
The best enzymatic degradation reactions involving PET are carried 
out at (or near) PET’s glass transition temperature (~70 °C), the 
temperature at which chains become mobile and accessible to the active 
site(s) of thermophilic hydrolases (Kawai, 2020). The following enzymes 
are notable due to their ability to function at temperatures between 60°C 
and 70°C (Sonnendecker et al., 2022): (i) metagenomically derived leaf 
branch compost cutinase (LCC) (Zheng et  al., 2022); (ii) Humicola 
insolens cutinase (HiC) (Carniel et al., 2021); (iii) Thermobifida fusca 
cutinase (TfCut2) (Mrigwani et al., 2023); (iv) PES-H1 (or polyester 
hydrolase 7, PHL7), a close homolog of LCC that is twice as active as 
LCC (Richter et al., 2023); and (v) BhrPETase (from bacterium HR29), 
another close homolog of LCC that shows comparable activity.
2.1. Catalytic mechanisms of PET hydrolase
Computational studies on the catalytic mechanism of PETase and 
LCC were performed using quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics 
(QM/MM) MD simulations with different algorithms (Boneta et al., 
2021; Zheng et  al., 2022). Based on the free energy surfaces, the 
established four-elementary-step mechanism was further confirmed, 
including mainly (1) the acylation of the serine of the catalytic triad, (2) 
breakage of the C-O bond, (3) nucleophilic attack by water molecules, 
and (4) deacylation. It was also revealed that the similar catalytic 
behavior of the active site might lead to a similar catalytic mechanism, 
and the better performance of LCCICCG than PETase might result from 
the higher optimal working temperature and the special structure–
activity relationships with the PET polymer (Boneta et al., 2021).
2.2. Cutinase
Cutinases can usually hydrolyse both ester bonds found in 
aliphatic and aromatic polyesters, which display very large potential 
for biocatalytic plastic recycling ( Carr et  al., 2020 ; Ribitsch and 
Guebitz, 2021). In the hydrolysing process catalyzed by cutinases, the 
active-site serine residue is acylated by the substrate. Then, the 
substrates are transformed to carboxylic acids and alcohols through 
the formation of an acyl enzyme intermediate. This serine residue is 
located within a highly conserved GXSXG sequence motif and forms 
a catalytic triad with His and Asp.
2.2.1. Cut190 and the related variants
Oda (2021) provided a great contribution to the development of 
Cut190. In 2014, a putative cutinase gene ( cut190, from the 
thermophile Saccharomonospora viridis AHK190) was cloned and 
successfully expressed ( Kawai et  al., 2014 ). The mutant Cut190 
(S226P/R228S) was shown to display optimal activity at 65–75°C, pH 
6.5–8.0, and could remain stable at temperatures up to 65°C for 24 h; 
however, 60% of activity was lost after incubation for 1 h at 70°C. In 
particular, Ca2+ could clearly change the tertiary structure of Cut190, 
and the thermostability and activity could be greatly enhanced by 
high concentrations of calcium ions. To illustrate the structural basis 
for the Ca 2+-enhanced thermostability, Takuya et al. reported the 
crystal structures of Cut190 S226P in the Ca 2+-bound and free states 
(Figure 1(1,2)) (Miyakawa et al., 2015). It mainly adopts a classical 
α/β hydrolase fold and contains 9 β-strands, 6 α-helices and a 
disulfide bond linking C287 and C302. The active-site Ser-His-Asp 
catalytic triad (S176, D222, and H254) was located on the surface 
without the lid structure. Ca 2+ was located at the β1-β2 loop

(Figure 1(3,4)) formed by residues from S76 to F81 ( Figure 1(4)). 
Furthermore, the bound Ca2+ was coordinated by S76, A78, and F81 
via their main-chain carbonyl groups. Once Ca 2+ bound to 
Cut190S226P, it induced significant conformational changes, which 
mainly occurred in the following loops: the β1-β2 loop, the β3-α2 
loop (F97-A121), and the β4-α3 loop (I126-E155). Upon Ca 2+ 
binding, it will induce N133 to move toward the Ca2+ binding site (the 
β1-β2 loop, ~11.5Å), consequently enabling the movement of Q110 
toward D131 and forming an additional hydrogen bond. The β3-α2 
loop harbors the active-site sealing residue F106. Although Ca 2+ 
binding induced the β3-α2 loop to the flexible open state, it might 
be helpful for substrate binding.
Based on these findings, attention was focused on insights into 
the structure–activity relationship of substrate-Cut190 and rational 
protein engineering. Molecular modeling ( ghecom: pocket finding; 
fkcombu: docking; the myPresto program package : energy 
minimization) was applied to investigate the reaction mechanism 
and improve the enzyme activity by Kawabata et al. (2017) . The 
results showed that W201, F106, H175, M177 and F255 are 
important for substrate binding and enzymatic activities, especially 
for the aromatic polyester substrate. Numoto et al. (2018)  further 
analyzed the substrate recognition mechanism of Cut190 with the 
crystal structure of the inactive Cut190 mutant (Cut190 S176A). In this 
study, it was found that four Ca 2+ ions were bound to Cut190 S176A 
(Figure 2), which is different from that observed in a previous study 
(Miyakawa et al., 2015 ). From Figure 2, three of them are bound to 
the surface of the enzyme at site 1, site 2 and site 3. One more 
bound Ca 2+ is located at the interface in site 4, which might 
be caused by the crystal packing that stabilizes the crystalline state 
of the protein. Structure alignment shows that site 1 is the same 
Ca2+ binding site, and Ca 2+ binding displays a similar effect on the 
protein as that observed in the structure of Cut190 S226P (Miyakawa 
et al., 2015) (Figure 2(1,2)). At site 2, G80 moved slightly away from 
the Ca2+-binding site upon Ca 2+ binding, and Ca2+-binding showed 
little effect on site 3 ( Figure  2(3,4)). Researchers reported that 
functions for the different Ca 2+ are believed to be different, in which 
the Ca2+ at sites 1 and 3 might be responsible for the regulation of 
enzymatic activity, and Ca 2+ at sites 2 and 3 can accommodate 
thermostability. It was further verified that Mn 2+ and Mg2+ probably 
bind to site 2 with high affinity (responsible for stability 
improvement) and to sites 1 and 3 with low affinity (responsible for 
activity adjustment) ( Senga et al., 2019 ). These results indicate that 
it might be  possible to regulate the catalytic activity and 
thermostability by rational engineering of critical residues around 
site 1, site 2 and site 3.
Structure comparison of Cut190 S176A bound with different 
substrates (Figure 3) clearly shows that two distinct states occur in the 
catalytic process, the prereaction state (engaged form, PDB ID: 5ZRR) 
and postreaction state (open form, PDB ID: 5ZRS). Interestingly, the 
structure of the postreaction state is almost identical to the structure 
bound with only one Ca2+. This might indicate that Ca2+ could greatly 
accelerate from the closed and the engaged form to the open form,

which could also be illustrated by the weak Ca2+ binding interaction 
in site 1.
Recently, it was reported that mutating one Ca 2+-binding sites 
of Cut190 D250C/E296C  would increase its thermostability while 
causing little effect on its polyesterase activity ( Emori et al., 2021 ). 
First, a disulfide bond would be  introduced at the interface 
through the mutation of D250C/E296C (in site 2) without 
changing the overall structures ( Figure 4 (1)), which contributes 
greatly to the increase in thermostability. Furthermore, due to the 
weak binding of Ca 2+ in site 1, the catalytic activity was unaffected 
when the conformational change was altered from the engaged 
state to the open state. The Ca 2+ not bound to sites 2 and 3 is 
mainly caused by mutations in site 2 (D250C and E296C) and the 
residue nearby site 3 (N202H), which also reveals that Ca 2+ 
binding has little effect on its overall structure ( Figure 4 (2)). Rapid 
release of the degrading products is a critical process for efficient 
PET-degrading, and this process has been already determined in 
the open form of Cut190 through molecular dynamics simulations 
(Numoto et al., 2018 ). One possibility is that the final products 
might be transported back to the engaged form and be tightly 
regulated. To deal with this issue, recently a novel state, the 
ejecting form at site 1 ( Figure  4(3)) in the Cut190*-mediated 
catalytic process was determined with three C-terminal residues 
deleted in complex with metal ions ( Senga et  al., 2021 ). The 
closed-like and ligand-incompatible form displays a special 
conformation of F81 compared with the previous study ( Numoto 
et al., 2018 ), in which either F77 and F81 all exhibit the inward 
conformations despite in the absence of bound Ca 2+. This form is 
determined to allow the products to irreversibly dissociate, which 
should be properly controlled in the presence of an appropriate 
concentration of Ca 2+. This phenomenon could also be illustrated 
by the finding that weak binding affinity of Ca 2+ plays a critical 
role in the function of Cut190 ( Senga et  al., 2019 ). Once the 
products are irreversibly released, and the next cycle of reaction 
would be  efficiently performed. In addition, deletion of three 
C-terminal residues contributes to the increased stability ( Tm, 
85°C), which is largely the consequence of the 
decreased fluctuation.
Recently, Cut190 (S226P/R228S) was further engineered (Kawai 
et  al., 2022). Using the best performing Cut190 variant (L136F/
Q138A/S226P/R228S/D250CE296C/Q123H/N202H/K305del/
L306del/N307del) and amorphous PET powders, more than 90 mM 
degradation products were obtained in 3 days and approximately 
80 mM in 1 day.
2.2.2. LCC and the related variants
2.2.2.1. Structures
Sulaiman et al. (2012) reported the cloning and heterogeneous 
expression of a cutinase homolog, LC-cutinase, from a fosmid library 
of a leaf-branch compost metagenome. The enzyme shows 59.7% acid 
sequence identity to the Thermomonospora curvata (T. curvata) lipase 
and 57.4% identity to Thermobifida fusca ( T. fusca) cutinase. The 
catalytic triad was formed by Ser165, Asp210, and His242, and an 
oxyanion hole (formed by Tyr95 and Met166) and a typical 
pentapeptide GxSxG sequence motif were also fully conserved in the 
LC-cutinase sequence (Figure 5(1,3)). A recent NMR study confirmed

The enzyme could not only hydrolyse various fatty acid

activity of 12 mg/h/mg of enzyme. At that time, the PET 
degradation rate of LC-cutinase was reported to be higher than 
the reported values for other cutinases by 230- to 970-fold.

2.2.2.2. Protein engineerings
One of the most important variants of LCC [known as ICCG-
LCC, Figure 5(2,4)] was rationally designed and characterized in 2020 
by Tournier et al. and contains a four-site mutant, F243I, D238C, 
S283C, and Y127G (Tournier et al., 2020). In this study, molecular 
docking and enzyme contact-surface analysis were first performed to 
explore the structure–function relationship between LCC and the 
substrate 2-hydroxyethyl-[monohydroxyethyl terephthalate) 3(2-
HE(MHET)3]. Around the binding site, 15 critical amino acid residues 
were identified, among which 11 positions were further subjected to 
site-specific saturation mutagenesis, resulting in 209 variants. 
Although most displayed impaired depolymerization activities, F243I 
and F243W were identified to show improved activity, and T96M, 
Y127G, N246D and N246M were found to exhibit an increased 
melting temperature. Given that the disulfide bond enhanced 
thermostability, the D238C/S283C variant was designed with a 
disulfide bond. This led to an increase in melting temperature (94.5°C) 
by 9.8°C compared with that of wild-type LCC, but the catalytic 
activity decreased by approximately 28%. Then, F243I and F243W 
were added into this mutant, resulting in mutants F243I/D238C/
S283C (ICC) and F243W/D238C/S283C (WCC) with higher melting 
temperatures (6.2°C and 10.1 °C increased, respectively) but no 
activity losses. Finally, T96M, Y127G, N246D or N246M mutations

were introduced into ICC and WCC, and the results showed that 
mutants ICCG, ICCM, WCCG and WCCM displayed improved 
melting temperatures ranging from 9.3°C to 13.4°C with little effect 
on specific activity compared with that of wild-type LCC. In the 
scale-up PET recycling process, ICCG and WCCG showed the best 
conversion level with 82 and 85% conversion in 20 h and 15 h, 
respectively. Moreover, under the same conditions, 90% 
depolymerization could be achieved for WCCG and ICCG after 10.5 h 
and 9.3 h, respectively, but a higher initial rate was observed for 
ICCG. The obtained ICCG mutant, as one of the most promising PET 
hydrolases (with a mean productivity of 16.7 g·L−1·h−1 TPA), displays 
great potential for future PET recycling and highlights the importance 
of computer-aided enzyme engineering in the field of PET degradation.
Recently, the substrate-binding mode of ICCG was investigated in 
detail (Zeng et al., 2022). MHET could bind to the surface cleft formed 
by the hydrophobic region of the active site and the oxyanion hole 
(Figure 6(1)). Two hydrogen bonds are formed between the carbonyl 
O of MHET and the main chain NH of Y95 and M166 to maintain the 
reaction status, and the benzene ring is further stabilized by the 
aromatic pi-pi interactions resulting from Y95, V212, M166 and 
W190 (Figure 6(2)). In addition, two water molecules are found to 
be associated with the formation of H-bonds with the hydroxyl at both 
ends of MHET. G127 and I243 (two critical mutations in ICCG) are 
located near the MHET-binding cleft (Figure 6(2)). G127 is located on 
the protein surface around the oxyanion hole region, and I243 is closer 
to the active site. The F243I substitution could further expand the 
substrate-binding site capable of increasing the PET-binding capacity, 
as mentioned by Tournier et al. (2020). Intriguingly, the substrate 
binding modes of ICCG are quite similar to those of IsPETase, with 
the different aromatic moiety conformations of the two bound ligands 
deviating by ∼30°.
Based on these findings, structure-based rational design was 
conducted to improve the thermostability of ICCG by introducing 
proline or hydrophilic interactions on a protein surface or increasing 
internal hydrophobic interactions. Among the 27 obtained variants, 
mutants A59H, A59R, A59K, V63I, V75R, and N248P displayed 
improved activity at 90°C. Considering the functional roles of N248P , 
N248P combined with mutants A59R, A59K, V63I, and V75R was 
designed to generate seven triple mutants. The results showed that all 
obtained triple mutants displayed higher activity than that of ICCG at

90°C. When using reinforced PET as the substrate, mutants RIP 
(A59R/V63I/N248P), KIP (A59K/V63I/N248P) and KRP (A59K/
V75R/N248P) exhibit more effective PET hydrolytic activity at 
optimal operating temperatures (80–85°C). In particular, mutant RIP 
showed the highest efficacy at 85°C.
Structure analysis showed that the crystal structures of KIP , RIP , 
and KRP are almost identical to the ICCG structure (Figure 7(1)), and 
the improved activities may be caused by the additional intramolecular 
interactions. N248P (located in the β8-α6 loop) could pack against the 
adjacent W104 to stabilize the β8-α6 loop and provide additional 
interactions between the loop and helix α1 (Figure 7(2)). For KRP , 
V75R forms two additional hydrogen bonds (shown in green line), 
and A59K could help form an additional hydrogen bond. Similarly, 
for RIP , A59R can pack against Y78 and form a hydrogen bond. The 
methyl group of the V63I mutant in RIP and KIP could stretch into a 
hydrophobic cluster sandwiched between the central β-sheet and helix 
α2 capable of strengthening the local hydrophobic interactions 
(Figure  7(4,5)). In summary, the hydrophilic interactions on the 
protein surface (N248P) and the intermolecular stabilization result 
from these mutations.
In a recent study, a semirational protein engineering approach was 
used to improve the catalytic activities of LCC (Pirillo et al., 2023). 
LCC without the secretion signal (ΔLCC) was selected as the starting 
target. Molecular docking and molecular simulation were used to 
investigate the interactions between the substrate (3PET) and 
ΔLCC. Based on the individual ΔGbind values (≤ −1 kcal·mol−1) and 
the evolvability of each ΔLCC residue predicted, critical residues Y95, 
T96, Y127, M166, and V212 were selected as the binding hot spots 
capable of regulating the overall complex stability. The results obtained 
from site saturation mutagenesis (SSM) revealed that mutations at 
positions 212 and 243 lead to a significant fraction of improved 
variants, and F243T, F243I, V212T, V212M and T96H variants

especially showed a significant increase in activity on PET 
nanoparticles at 50°C compared with ΔLCC (increased by ~1.75-fold, 
~1.51-fold, ~1.34-fold, ~1.33-fold, and ~ 1.25-fold, respectively). For 
the biodegradation of PET film at 72 °C, only the F243T variant 
showed an increased activity with a production of 21.9 mM of 
products with a reaction rate of 0.48 mmol products·mgenzyme
−1·day−1, 
which is ~1.2-fold higher than that with wild-type ΔLCC. Then, 
mutations at A97 and S101 were introduced into ΔLCC_ F243T, 
which may play a role in the overall binding energy of the enzyme-PET 
complex. Four double variants (A97G/F243T, A97T/F243T, S101N/
F243T and S101V/F243T) displaying significantly increased activity 
for PET degradation were obtained; furthermore, the S101N/F243T 
and A97T/F243T mutants showed the largest increase in activity for 
the degradation of PET nanoparticles (compared with ΔLCC_F243T 
and ΔLCC). S101N/F243T was more efficient than that of A97T/
F243T mutants for the degradation of amorphous PET film at the 
tested temperatures and 2.0- and 3.5-fold faster than that of the wild 
ΔLCC at 55°C and 60°C, respectively. This study provides insights 
into the catalytic mechanism of LCC, especially the functional role 
played by F243, which should be further confirmed experimentally by 
crystal structures of the S101N/F243T complex.
In a very recent study ( Fang et al., 2023), whole-cell screening 
assays combined with rational design and combinatorial mutagenesis 
were applied for the engineering of LCCICCG. It was revealed that the 
mutant RITK (LCCICCG-D53R/R143I/D193T/E208K) displayed better 
whole-cell biocatalytic performance with an 8.33-fold increase in 
biocatalytic activity compared to those expressing ICCG. Moreover, 
the thermostability was also enhanced with a 12.75-fold increase in 
depolymerization compared to ICCG at 85 °C for 3 h. However, 
I believe further studies on the catalytic performance of RITK against 
different PET substrates with different crystallinities and the 
expression efficiency of different protein with the same expression 
vector. In a similar study, machine learning combined with 
evolutionary analysis was used for the rational design of LCC ICCG 
(Ding et al., 2023). Results showed that mutants (S32L, D18T, S98R, 
T157P , E173Q, N213P) all displayed higher degrading-activities 
toward PET powder than wild LCCICCG at 75°C. Based on this finding, 
LCCICCG_I6M (carrying mutations S32L/D18T/S98R/T157P/
E173Q/N213P) was constructed and was further determined to 
display the highest activity for PET powder (crystallinity 39.07%) at 
75–80°C, which could release 4.028 ± 0.078 mM products with a 4.63-
fold at 80°C compared with LCCICCG (0.871 ± 0.050 mM). In addition, 
the PET degrading performance against high crystallinity commercial 
PET materials (water bottle) was increased by 3.64-fold with 
31.91 ± 0.99 mM soluble products detected compared with 
LCCICCG. Moreover, the stability was also improved with the optimal 
temperature increased from 65 °C to 80 °C. Molecular simulations 
suggested that N213P mutations might play a role in increasing the 
overall structural rigidity, and the E173Q mutation might be capable 
of enhancing the flexibility of the substrate-binding pocket of 
LCCICCG_I6M.
2.2.3. Thermobifida fusca cutinases (TfCut)
Two open reading frames encoding cutinases named Tfu_0882 
(TfCut1) and Tfu_0883 (TfCut2) were identified in the thermophilic 
bacterium Thermobifida fusca (Chen et al., 2008). Although they share 
a high sequence identity of 93% in the amino acid sequence (261 aa), 
TfCut2 displayed much higher (~ two times higher) degradation 
activity than that of TfCut1 (Chen et al., 2010). TfCut2 displays 57.4% 
similarity in amino acid sequence with LCC. The homology model of 
Tfu_0883 displays a typical α/β-hydrolase fold with a canonical triad 
S170-H248-D216, a preformed oxyanion hole and a different 
nucleophilic serine exposed to the solvent. Although they show 
similar catalytic properties to fungal cutinases, TfCut1 and TfCut2 are 
a different subfamily of cutinases due to their sequence and structural 
differences. For example, they can hydrolyse insoluble triglycerides 
and soluble esters (e.g., pNPB) in addition to cutin. They also display 
superior thermostability compared with that of the F. solani pisi  
cutinase. A study showed that the higher linear degradation rates 
observed in the first 72 h of incubation are due to the high hydrolysis 
susceptibility of the mobile amorphous fraction (MAF , with a chain 
mobility similar to the purely amorphous polymer) of PET; however, 
a transition of MAF to the rigid amorphous fraction (RAF , with a 
lower chain mobility probably caused by its presence within the 
intraspherulitic or interlamellar regions in close vicinity to the 
crystalline domains) during further incubation resulted in drastically 
decreased degradation rates ( Wei et  al., 2019 ). The RAF could 
be cleaved only in an endo-type manner at a much lower rate.
To investigate the catalytic mechanisms of the bacteria-derived 
cutinases, several crystal structures of TfCut2 have been reported [e.g., 
PDB ID: 4CG2 (Roth et al., 2014), Figure 8, 5ZOA, 7QJR, 7XTT]. The 
structure of TfCut2 forms a classical α/β-hydrolase fold, contains 
conserved GXSXG motif, and contains a conserved catalytic triad of 
S-H-D residues is in a crevice on the surface. In the enzyme-inhibitor 
complex structure ( Figure  8 (2)), it was found that covalent 
modification of S130 would lead to the tighter interactions formed 
with the main chain of M131 and Y60 mainly through H-bonds 
interactions (Figure 8(3)). The phenyl ring is further stabilized mainly 
by hydrophobic interactions with I178 and Y60 (Figure 8(2)).
Efforts have been made to further improve the catalytic 
performance of TfCut2 through directed evolution and rational 
mutagenesis. The critical residues associated with substrate 
recognition were engineered (Wei et al., 2016). First, critical residues 
around the active site close to (without direct interactions with) the 
docked 2PET were identified and genetically engineered by 
performing structure alignment with LCC and TfCut2. Four residues 
(G62, T63, I178, and I213) were selected for further protein 
engineering. Among the single mutants, G62A was determined to 
show markedly increased hydrolytic activity. The improved catalytic 
performance of G62A likely resulted from a reduction in product 
inhibition due to MHET rather than the altered surface hydrophobicity 
or the enlarged substrate binding pocket. Although the double variant 
G62A/I178V and the triple variant G62A/I178V/I213S showed much 
higher hydrolytic activity than the wild-type TfCut2, they all displayed 
slightly lower degrading activity than the single mutant G62A. The 
single mutant I213S showed the highest thermostability, followed by 
G62A and G62A/I213S. After 24 h at 65°C, G62A and G62A/I213S 
caused a 20.5% weight loss of PET films.
In a similar study, the functions of critical residues around the 
substrate binding site were investigated, which were thought to 
facilitate the accessibility of the enzyme’s active site (Dong et al., 2020). 
Eleven bulky residues were selected to increase the substrate binding 
efficiency by site-directed mutation to Ala, which are located around 
the catalytic triad, the oxygen hole and the substrate binding region. 
The results showed that Y60A, T207A, F209A, L90A and I213A 
exhibited increased pNPB hydrolysing activity, especially the cutin 
Sui et al. 10.3389/fmicb.2023.1265139
Frontiers in Microbiology 11 frontiersin.org
hydrolysing activities of L90A, I213A, and L90A/I213A, which were 
increased by 5-, 2.4-, and 3.2-fold, respectively. MD simulations 
revealed that the higher flexibility of the substrate binding site of 
mutants L90A and I213A might lead to increased hydrolysing 
activities toward cutin. However, a subsequent study showed that the 
L90A mutant showed ~11.2-fold reduced degradation activity on 
commercially sourced PET film, but the L90F mutation displayed 
considerably increased degradation (~1.5-fold increased) activity 
(Mrigwani et al., 2023). This might be caused by the more efficient 
binding of PET resulting from the replacement of the hydrophobic 
phenylalanine residue.
Based on the abovementioned findings, molecular rational 
engineering of TfCut2 was performed by docking and MD simulations 
to modify the space at the active site and streamline the hydrophobicity 
at the active site or other interacting regions (Mrigwani et al., 2023). 
The results showed that the selected residues H129W , W155F , H184A, 
and H184S for engineering the PET-binding cleft exhibited little 
positive effect on the catalytic activities. Residues (A173C) that were 
identified for the insertion of thiols/disulfides (A173C/A210C, and 
A173C/ A206C) might distort the PET-binding site, causing a 
complete loss of activity against solid PET. Interestingly, residues (L90) 
distal to the active site could adjust its catalytic activity, especially the 
L90F mutation, which could considerably increase TfCut2’s 
PET-degrading activity (~1.5-fold). F209I, F249A and F249R were 
constructed to modify the surface hydrophobicity proximal/distal to 
the active site. The results showed that the single mutant (F209I) 
caused an ~4.4-fold decrease in activity; however, F249R led to an 
~1.27-fold increase in activity against solid PET. The double mutants 
displayed a remarkable increase in degradation activity (G62A/F209I 
with an ~6.4-fold improvement and G62A/F249R with an ~7.15-fold 
increase); however, their thermostability was reduced. These results 
also revealed that TfCut2 possesses high thermal stability, high 
kinetic-thermal stability, and high thermodynamic stability.
Based on the findings of the double mutation (DM) strategy 
(Chen et al., 2021), engineered TfCut was investigated for efficient 
biodegradation of poly(butylene adipate-co-terephthalate) (PBAT) 
(Y ang et al., 2023). The results showed that the mutant (TfCut-DM) is 
a highly potent catalyst that can completely decompose PBAT films in

36 h and release 3-fold more TPA (the major product) than TfCut 
within 12 h. This strategy was also determined to be appropriate for 
BurPL and TcCut. The overall complex structure of the MHET-bound 
TfCut complex structure is almost identical to that of TfCut-DM 
(Figure 9(1)), and the DM residues (S224 and I228) are located below 
the catalytic triad. The ethylene glycol motif of MHET bound points 
outside the enzyme, and the aliphatic part stretches to fill a cleft across 
the protein surface (Figure 9(3)), which is lined by several critical 
residues, such as M171, W195, Y100, I218, and T223. Several water 
molecules are also shown to be associated with the binding of MHET 
through H-bond interactions. Interestingly, the side chain of W195 in 
TfCut-DM exhibits a B-type conformation [Figure 9(2) in purple]; 
however, wild-type TfCut harbors a TPA-binding Trp in the C-type 
conformation [Figure  9(2) in brown]. The DM mutation and the 
B-type W195 lead to a more open and flatter TPA-binding pocket 
(increased flexibility), which would probably cause less hindrance for 
the entrance of bulkier substrates. This may be the dominating factor 
behind the improved hydrolytic activity toward PBAT and PET.
Then et al. (2016) directly introduced a disulfide bridge (D204C-
E253C) by substituting the calcium binding site of TfCut2 to eliminate 
dependence on calcium. The results showed that the thermal stability 
of the mutant was further improved, the melting point was increased 
to 94.7°C (TfCut2: 69.8°C), and the half-inactivation temperature was 
increased to 84.6°C (TfCut2: 67.3°C). Most curiously, the hydrolytic 
activity of the calcium-independent thermostable and efficient 
hydrolase was not affected when the calcium binding site was replaced. 
A similar study was carried out with the anchor peptide-cutinase 
mutant Tfuc2D204C/E253C (Liu et al., 2022). The PET degradation rate of 
the obtained fused protein was determined to be up to 57.9% at 70°C 
for 96 h, and the catalytic performance was improved by 22.7-fold 
compared with that of Tfuc2. Based on machine learning, Li et al. 
successfully designed a highly thermostable Tfuc2 mutant, S121P/
D174S/D204P , by mining molecular dynamics simulation trajectories 
and rational introduction of hydrogen and ionic bonds ( Li et  al., 
2022). The results showed that the PET degradation ratio was further 
increased by 46.42-fold at 70°C compared to that of wild-type TfCut2.
To further increase the thermostability of the polyester hydrolases 
from the thermophilic actinomycete Thermobifida fusca, rational 
engineering of the binding sites of specific metal ions (e.g., Mg2+ and 
Ca2+) was also investigated ( Then et  al., 2015). Based on the MD 
simulations, residues Asp174, Glu253, and Asp204 of TfCut2 might 
play roles in facilitating the binding site of Ca 2+, which were then 
mutated to screen for stability-enhanced mutants. The results showed 
that mutants D204R and E253R increased by more than 14 °C

compared to that of wild-type TfCut2; however, the PET-degrading 
activities were determined to be slightly reduced. In addition, it was 
found that the addition of a cationic surfactant (C12-N(CH3)3
+) greatly 
improved the degradation activity of TfCut2, which might be caused 
by the aggregation of enzymes near the PET film surface via 
electrostatic interactions ( Arnling Bååth et  al., 2022 ). The results 
showed that in the presence of cationic surfactant (30 ppm C 12-
N(CH3)3
+), the activity of the TfCut2 G62A/F209A mutant increased to 
31 ± 0.1 nmol min−1 cm−2, which is approximately 12.7 times higher 
than that of wild-type TfCut2 in the absence of surfactant.
2.2.4. BhrPETase
From the bacterium HR29, a close homolog of the LCC with 94% 
sequence identity was identified (BhrPETase, NCBI accession No. 
GBD22443) ( Kato et  al., 2018 ). Recently, high-level secretory 
expression of BhrPETase in Bacillus subtilis was successfully achieved 
with an expression titer of 0.66 g/L (Xi et al., 2021). More strikingly, a 
strong preference of BhrPETase for high temperature was determined 
for BhrPETase when the reaction temperature was increased from 30 
to 90°C. Even at 90°C, the catalytic performance remained superior 
to that of wild LCC, which rapidly dropped to 55% of the maximum 
activity. The Tm value of BhrPETase was determined to be  101 °C 
without the addition of Ca 2+ ions, ~11 °C higher than that of 
LCC. Against a crystallinity of 11.2% PET powder for 20 h at 70°C, 
approximately 6.3 mM degradation products were detected. Molecular 
modeling suggested that the increased thermostability might 
be caused by Ser175, Gln202, Pro199 and Pro248 in BhrPETase, which 
could either result in additional formed hydrogen bonds and/or 
increase the rigidity of the flexible loop.
In a recent study, molecular engineering of the hydrolase from the 
bacterium HR29 was reported by means of a protein language model 
and force-field-based algorithms (under review 3). The obtained 
TurboPETase (BhrPETaseH218S/F222I/A209R/D238K/A251C/A281C/W104L/F243T, Tm of 
84°C) exhibited a 4.4-fold increase in the degrading activities toward 
GF-PET films compared to that of wild-type BhrPETase. Moreover, 
the depolymerization rate of TurboPETase (21%) outperformed all the 
tested PET hydrolases, which was 4-, 4-, 8- and 33-folds higher than 
those of wild BhrPETase, LCCICCG, HotPETae and FastPETase at 65°C 
within 3 h, respectively. At 65 °C after 24, approximately 100% 
depolymerization could be obtained. Especially, the full degradation 
of pretreated PET (up to 300 g L−1) could be accomplished within 10 h, 
with a maximum production rate of 77.3 gTPAeq L−1 h−1. It shows 
beyond doubt that this strategy and the obtained TurboPETase might 
serve as a promising option for the engineering of interfacial enzymes 
and efficient PET cycling.
2.2.5. Est119
Thermobifida alba strain AHK119 (AB298783) was shown to 
be  capable of degrading aliphatic-aromatic copolyester film and 
polymer particles and releasing TPA (Hu et al., 2010). From AHK119, 
an esterase gene (est119) was cloned and identified, and the Est119 
protein contains the highly conserved motif (G-X-S-X-G) of the 
serine hydrolase family, a catalytic triad (Ser129, His207, and Asp175) 
and the oxyanion hole formed by Tyr59 and Met130. The optimal 
3 https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-2465520/v1
reaction temperature and pH were found to be  ~50 °C and 6.0, 
respectively. Kitadokoro et  al. determined the crystal structure of 
Est119 (Figure 10(1)), which shows a typical α/β-hydrolase fold that 
also consists of a central twisted β-sheet of 9 β-strands flanked by 9 
α-helices on both sides (Kitadokoro et al., 2012).
In another study (Thumarat et al., 2012), it was further confirmed 
that Est119 is a typical cutinase-like enzyme, and Ca2+ was necessary 
to display full catalytic activity (300 mM) and maintain thermostability 
(200 mM, stable at 50 °C for 16 h). Random mutagenesis analysis 
indicated that mutations with more hydrophobicity at the N-terminus 
would more likely result in enhanced activity, which led to mutants 
A68V and A68V/S219P showing the highest activity against pNPB. In 
particular, the degradation activity of A68V/S219P was further 
improved by ~50-fold and 1.7-fold compared with that of WT and 
A68V , respectively. In addition to est119, its homolog est1 was located 
upstream of est119 (Thumarat et al., 2015). Although showing 95% 
sequence identity and 98% sequence similarity with Est119, Est1 
displays a higher (~2-fold higher) activity toward p-nitrophenyl 
butyrate. Moreover, Est1 displayed a much higher thermostability, 
with 300 mM Ca2+, and it could maintain nearly 100% of the residual 
activity at 50°C for 20 h. Est1 and Est119 could also recognize the 
aromatic polyester and produce EG and TPA. As mentioned above, 
Est1A68V/T253P was constructed, and the results showed that the Tm value 
was increased to 79°C and the specific activity (833 ± 22.5 U/mg) was 
also improved by ~57.4-fold against pNPB. The increased 
thermostability was estimated to be caused by the introduction of 
proline, which could decrease the flexibility and increase the structural 
rigidity, especially at sites 219 and 253. However, Est1A68V/T253P/M259K was 
shown to display a higher catalytic activity than Est1A68V/T253P, with a 
specific activity of 910 ± 42.0 U/mg, and the thermostability was lower 
than that of Est1A68V/T253P over 50°C.
In a recent study, the crystal structure of Est119 complexed with 
ethyl lactate (EL) and lactic acid (LAC) was obtained (Figure 10(2)) 
(Kitadokoro et al., 2019). As expected, three Ca2+ ions were found in 
Est119; moreover, LAC and EL are located in the active site cleft with 
different positions. Based on the crystal structure, it was found that 
the substrate-binding cleft was a long narrow groove lined with F248, 
I217, H247, S169, W194, M170, Y99, T100, T102, S105, and N251. In 
the binding site, EL was stabilized by the H-bonds formed with H247 
and water and the hydrophobic interaction with H168. In addition, 
LAC was regulated by the hydrophobic interaction with W194 and the 
H-bonds formed with water. The catalytic S169 is located at the 
bottom of the cleft.
Recently, a novel directional-path modification (DPM) strategy 
was developed to improve the performance of PET-degrading 
enzymes, which mainly contains the introduction of positively 
charged amino acids and binding groove remodeling ( Chen et al., 
2022). First, the PET binding path was identified. Then, to decrease 
steric hindrance in the binding site at the exit of the PET binding path, 
neutral short side-chain amino acids were introduced. At the same 
time, positively charged amino acids with shorter flexible side chains 
(e.g., Lys) were selected to optimize the surface positively charged 
area. These modifications led to the identification of 13 potential 
residue sites and construction of 23 target mutants, and the results 
showed that the four-point mutant (4Mz, H184S/Q92G/F209I/I213K) 
displayed the highest degradation rate of ~90%. The degradation 
efficiency was increased by approximately 30-fold compared with that 
of the wild type. Molecular simulations revealed that the PET binding 
Sui et al. 10.3389/fmicb.2023.1265139
Frontiers in Microbiology 14 frontiersin.org
modes of 4Mz were extended to the left side, which was estimated to 
be more conducive to improving PET degradation. This finding was 
also confirmed by positive vacuum electrostatics on the left-side 
subbinding site. When applied to LCC, Est119, and BhrPETase, the 
constructed mutants LCCH218S/Y127G/F243I/S247K, Est119H248S/Q131G/F248I/I252K 
and BhrPETaseH184S/F93G/F209I/S213K all showed dramatically increased 
PET degradation efficiency, indicating the high efficiency and 
universality of the DPM strategy.
2.2.6. Polyesterase from Deinococcus 
maricopensis (DmPETase)
In a recent study, a novel thermophilic polyesterase from 
Deinococcus maricopensis (DmPETase) was characterized (Makryniotis 
et al., 2023). DmPETase, a phylogenetically distinct and thermophilic 
polyesterase, was found to display a similar overall structure with that of 
other bacterial cutinases, such as LCCICCG and IsPETase, and the catalytic 
triad is determined to be  Ser185, His263 and Asp231. The optimal 
temperature for DmPETase was 50°C lower than that of LCCICCG, and 
display the highest catalytic efficiency toward pNPB. It is also capable of 
degrading various synthetic polymers, including PET, polyurethane, as 
well as four semi-crystalline aliphatic polyesters. On the whole, 
DmPETase shows a much lower catalytic activities compared with those 
of LCCICCG, for example against the PCL powder DmPETase displayed 
a degrading approximately 70% of the tested materials compared with 
98.7% obtained by LCCICCG. However, at 50°C, it displays a comparable 
degrading activity compared with that of LCCICCG against the semi-
crystalline sections of post-consumer PET bottles (crystallinity, 41%).
2.3. Cutinase from fungi
2.3.1. Cutinase from Humicola insolens (HIC)
The cutinase from the fungus Humicola insolens (HIC, Figure 11) 
is a single-domain protein that shows high hydrolytic activity and 
FIGURE 10

Sui et al. 10.3389/fmicb.2023.1265139
Frontiers in Microbiology 15 frontiersin.org
stability at 70°C (Carniel et al., 2021), and sequence analysis showed 
that HiC exhibits high sequence identities to FsC (56%) ( Kold 
et al., 2014).
When used in moist-solid reaction mixtures instead of the typical 
dilute aqueous solutions or slurries, cutinase from Humicola insolens 
can directly depolymerize amorphous and crystalline regions of PET 
equally without any pretreatmentl a 13-fold higher space–time yield 
and a 15-fold higher enzyme efficiency were achieved than those 
reported in prior studies with high crystallinity material. Furthermore, 
this process shows 26-fold selectivity for terephthalic acid over other 
hydrolysis products (Kaabel et al., 2021).
In an earlier study, it was found that cutinase from Humicola 
insolens (HIC) could hydrolyse PET, especially the low-crystallinity 
(7%) film (~10-fold higher than biaxially oriented PET, 35% 
crystallinity) ( Ronkvist et  al., 2009 ). Moreover, HiC shows good 
thermostability and functions best from 70 to 80 °C, and the 
HiC-catalyzed degradation of the lcPET film resulted in a 97 ± 3% 
weight loss only releasing the water-soluble TPA after 96 h at 
70°C. Based on this finding, a novel synergistic chemoenzymatic 
hydrolysis of PET was developed to produce terephthalic acid (TA) 
from textile waste (Quartinello et al., 2017). First, conversion of PET 
into TA (purity, 85%) and small oligomers was achieved by chemical 
treatment (T = 250°C, p = 40 bar). Afterwards, the obtained oligomers 
were further hydrolysed by HiC, yielding ~6.5 mM TA after 6 h of 
incubation at 50°C (purity, 97%). This is a practical strategy for the 
efficient recycling of PET in an environmentally friendly way under 
neutral conditions, especially for promising catalysts displaying lower 
catalytic activities toward high-crystallinity PET.
Carniel et al. (2021) investigated the HiC-assisted hydrolysis of 
postconsumed PET (PC-PET) through controlling the pH and 
performing fractionation of enzyme feeding in stirred reactors. The 
results showed that pH variation plays a critical role in the 
HiC-catalyzed reaction, and a 0.86 pH variation (optimal pH 
8.95 ± 0.20) finally led to a decrease of 32% in the total of final 
products. Compared with the tris-buffered reaction, the soluble 
hydrolysis products from the unbuffered HiC-catalyzed reaction with 
pH control were increased by 81% at 50 °C (26.3 mM). Although 
enzyme feeding fractionation contributed little activity for the 
improved PET hydrolysis, an increase of 2.41-fold in the final 
degrading products released (97 mM) per protein amount was 
obtained when only half of the enzyme was loaded. These findings are 
important for the industrial PET biorecycling process.
Additionally, in a recent study, HiC-catalyzed PC-PET 
degradation was optimized (PET particle size, pH, ionic strength, and 
enzyme concentrations) for improved performance with experimental 
and mathematical modeling approaches (Eugenio et al., 2021). The

the active site of HIC. [The hydrophobic regions of the substrate binding site are highlighted in white surface, and the catalytic triads are shown in ball-
and-stick model in (3)].
Sui et al. 10.3389/fmicb.2023.1265139
Frontiers in Microbiology 16 frontiersin.org
results revealed that the PET particle size might play the most critical 
role in HIC-catalytic PET hydrolysis, and with a greater surface area 
(semicrystalline PC-PET), an 8.5-fold increased hydrolysing rate 
(1.7 mmol·L−1·h−1) was achieved. After 4 days at 70°C, 10.9 mmol·L−1 
TPA was detected against the semicrystalline PET (0.075–0.25 mm). 
The thermostability of wild HiC is much higher than that of the other 
reported cutinases, the half-life of which was determined to be 110 h 
at 70°C and pH 7.0. These results indicated that HiC displays great 
potential as a promising biocatalyst for efficient 
PET biodepolymerization.
SDS might be the most widely applied anionic surfactant and can 
regulate the bioactivities of cutinases or cutinase-like PET-degrading 
enzymes. The interactions of cutinase from Humicola insolens (HIC) 
with anionic surfactants (SDS) were investigated in several studies 
(Nielsen et al., 2005; Kold et al., 2014). The protein could specifically 
bind SDS at a very low molar ratio of SDS/HiC, and amino acids 
160–163 and 168–176 (near the active site) were determined to be able 
to directly interact with SDS by MD simulations. Kold et al. (2014) 
investigated the detailed molecular interactions between SDS and HiC 
based on thermodynamic and structural studies. Crystal structures 
showed that the binding mode of SDS is quite similar to the previously 
reported substrate analogs to cutinases (Figure 12(2)), and the binding 
affinity ( K) was determined to be  ~10 5 M−1. In addition, mono-
ethylphosphate (MEP) was found to covalently bind to S105 and could 
interact with F132, A108, A109, Q106, S28 and N69 by forming 
H-bonds (Figure  12(3)). Moreover, ethylated H173 was detected, 
probably resulting from the reaction with DNPP (diethyl 
p-nitrophenyl phosphate).
In a recent study, high-crystallinity PET in mixed PET/cotton 
textiles was reported to be directly and selectively depolymerized to 
TPA by using a commercial HIC (Novozym 51,032) and the Cellic 
CTec2 cellulases under moist-solid reaction conditions (Kaabel et al., 
2023). Results revealed that TPA is the main degrading products with 
more than 40-fold selectivity over MHET after 7 days of static 
incubation at 55°C in the presence of HiC (0.65% w/w) and/or CTec2 
(0.7% w/w), and 14.1% of TPA could be obtained when co-applied 
with CTec2. Interestingly, it was also found that the CTec2 enzymes 
were most efficient in the absence of HiC with up to 83.4% yield of 
glucose without any negative influence on the TPA yield.
2.3.2. Cutinase from Fusarium solani pisi (FsC)
FsC has long been explored for the hydrolysis of several 
industrially important esters, insoluble PET polymer films and poly(ε-
caprolactone) (PCL) ( Ronkvist et  al., 2009). FsC is also a single-
domain protein consisting of 197 amino acids (~20.8 kDa). The overall 
structure of FsC is similar to that of Hic, which is different from the 
bacterial-derived cutinase as a single-domain protein (Figure 13(1,2)). 
FsC also contains 5 slightly twisted parallel-stranded β-sheets that are 
covered by 4 α-helices on each side (Figure 13(3)). Among them, 2 
flexible loop domains (residues 80–90 and 182–189) and 2 disulfide 
bridges (DS1:Cys31 and Cys109, DS2:Cys171 and Cys178) are highly 
conserved and may be  associated with substrate binding and the 
stabilization of the overall structures (especially DS1) ( Matak and 
Moghaddam, 2009).
In a recent study, NMR spectroscopy was used to investigate FsC 
with PET-hydrolysing activity and the reaction, including the reaction 
conditions, interactions between FsC and BHET, and product release 
(Hellesnes et  al., 2023 ). It was found that BHET binding is 
predominantly regulated by hydrophobic interactions (with adjacent 
polar residues and polar residues); in particular, a more extended 
binding cleft around G49 and G192 is needed. Given that FsC L81A 
(improved by 4-fold) and FsCL182A (improved by 5-fold) showed much 
higher hydrolytic activity on PET and polyamide 6,6 fibers, the 
enlarged binding site might more likely result in improved cutinase 
activity, as discovered by Araújo et al. (2007). The main product (80% 
of the products) from PET hydrolysis is MHET, and after ~400 min, 
the release of TPA was detected ( Hellesnes et  al., 2023 ). More 
importantly, it was found that the pH and pD conditions might 
regulate the relative amounts of degradation products, and the low 
degrading activity of FsC on PET is caused by poor substrate binding 
and the subsequent slow MHET hydrolysing activity. Previously, it was 
concluded that increasing accumulation of the final product EG 
around the active site reduced the overall flexibility of FsC (Groß et al., 
2017), which certainly caused decreased thermostability and 
catalytic performance.
To further exploit the potential of FsC in the biodegradation of 
parabens, a novel biocatalyst (named SDFsC) was constructed by 
expressing FsC on the cell surface of Sacchromycese cerevisiae with 
Aga1p and Aga2p protein subunits and a glycosylphosphatidylinositol 
(GPI) attachment sequence (Zhu and Wei, 2019). Catalytic results 
indicated that SDFsC could be  used for the efficient removal of 
parabens with Km values of 3.1 ± 0.5 mM (for pNPA) and 
0.67 ± 0.15 mM (pNPB); thus, the catalytic performance of SDFsC was 
slightly affected. In addition, the side chain structures of parabens play 
a critical role in the degradation rates, and parabens with relatively 
long alkyl or aromatic side chains (propylparaben, butylparaben and 
benzylparaben) were more efficiently degraded, with efficiencies of 89, 
97 and 93%, respectively, after 24 h at 30°C. Moreover, SDFsC showed 
excellent reusability with 93% residual enzyme activity after being 
used for paraben degradation 6 times. Altogether, it is believed that 
biocatalysis based on the enzyme cell surface display would be a green 
and efficient alternative for efficient PET biodegradation.
2.3.3. Cutinase from Alternaria brassicicola (AbC)
In 1997, two distinct serine esterases with cutinolytic activity 
(52 kDa and 26 kDa) were discovered (Trail and Köller, 1993), and a 
cutinase-encoding gene, CUTAB1, was then identified from an 
A. brassicicola cDNA library (Y ao and Kller, 1994).
The cutinase CUTAB1 from Alternaria brassicicola (corresponding 
to the cutinase from the A. brassicicola culture) was successfully 
heterologously expressed in Pichia pastoris (Koschorreck et al., 2010). 
It displayed the highest enzymatic activity at 40°C and pH 7–9, and 
similarly, the chain lengths of different substrates showed significant 
effects on the hydrolysing activity; the highest catalytic activity was 
toward tributyrin and the lowest activity was toward p-nitrophenyl 
palmitate (p-NPP). In contrast to the findings for FsC (Hellesnes et al., 
2023), the mutants AbCL80A, AbCL181A and AbCI183A showed a significant 
decrease in specific activity toward p-NPB and p-NPP . In contrast, the 
specific activity of AbCA84F against p-NPP was significantly improved 
by ~10-fold. This strange phenomenon was thought to be associated 
with increased interactions with longer chain and hydrophobic 
substrates caused by the bulkier and more hydrophobic phenylalanine.
2.3.4. Cutinase from Aspergillus fumigatus (AfC)
Two cutinase genes from Fusarium solani (FsC) and Aspergillus 
fumigatus (AfC) were also successfully expressed in Pichia pastoris 
Sui et al. 10.3389/fmicb.2023.1265139

X33 (Ping et al., 2017). The results showed that FsC and AfC display 
significantly different optimal catalytic temperatures (40°C and 60°C, 
respectively) but similar pH values (7.5 and 8.0, respectively). This 
illustrated the superior thermostability of AfC. Both FsC and AfC can 
hydrolyse p-nitrophenyl substrates with different carbon chain 
lengths, and pNPD and pNPH were the preferred substrates for FsC 
and AfC, respectively. Moreover, AfC could completely hydrolyse the 
PCL film.
2.3.5. Cutinase from Aspergillus oryzae (AoC)
Aspergillus oryzae is a well-known filamentous fungus that has 
long been used in traditional microbial fermentation and the food 
industry. Recently, the fungus has attracted much attention for the 
biodegradation of poly(butylene succinate) (PBS) and poly(butylenes 
succinate-co-adipate) (PBSA) with the successful identification of a 
PBS-degrading enzyme (AoC) (Maeda et al., 2005). AoC (~21.6 kDa) 
displayed the highest catalytic activity at 55°C and could remain stable 
under a wide pH range (pH 6.0–11.0).
In a recent study, the biological properties of AoC were 
investigated, and the structure–activity relationship was analyzed 
based on the crystal structure (Liu et al., 2009). AoC showed better 
thermostability with a Tm value of 59°C. AoC showed a preference for 
pNPV with a Km value of 0.04 ± 0.01 μM and displayed the highest 
catalytic efficiency toward pNPB and pNPV with kcat/Km values of 
3.49 ± 0.51 μM−1 min−1 and 3.32 ± 0.74 μM−1 min−1, respectively. At 
40°C and pH 8.0, poly ε-(caprolactone) (PCL) was almost completely 
degraded (87% PCL) within 6 h; however, only 30% degradation was 
achieved catalyzed by FsC. The structure ( Figure  14(1)), which is 
similar to that of FsC and HiC, contains a typical α/β fold characterized 
by a central β-sheet of 5 parallel strands; this sheet is surrounded by 
10 α-helices with a highly conserved catalytic triad S126, D181, and 
H194. In addition, 3 disulfide bonds were identified, including DS1 
between Cys37 and Cys115, DS2 between Cys177-Cys184, and DS3 
between Cys63-Cys76. Among them, DS3 is unique to the cutinases 
from the Aspergillus family connecting helix 2 to strand 2 of the 
central β-sheet, which might lead to improved thermoactivity of 
AoC. Different from FsC and HiC, an extended groove was discovered 
around the substrate binding site that regulates the orientation of 
polymeric chains (Figure 14(3)), which resulted in a much higher 
hydrolysing activity of AoC toward the longer chain substrates. 
Furthermore, residues L87 and V190, similar to the “gate keepers, ” 
may be associated with substrate recognition, especially the different 
alkyl chains.
To further improve thermostability, Shirke et al. investigated the 
thermal inactivation mechanisms of AoC (Shirke et al., 2017). First, it 
was revealed that glycosylation plays a critical role in the improved 
thermostability of Thiellavia terrestris cutinase (TtC) expressed in 
Pichia pastoris by inhibiting its thermal aggregation. In view of this 
finding, kinetic models of cutinase thermal inactivation were created 
to account for thermal aggregation. However, the models also 
indicated that the glycosylation of TtC is helpful for the improved 
kinetic stability (5-15-fold) by inhibiting thermal aggregation at 
61°C. Then, one glycosylation site (L185N) was designed and 
incorporated into AoC, which completely inhibited the thermal 
aggregation of AoC with a 4-fold improvement in thermostability. 
However, it should be noted that the undesirable catalytic efficiency 
of AoCL185N was lower (~70%) than that of wild-type AoC, and this 
may be avoided by rationally designed glycosylation sites.
Recently, Lewatit VP OC 1600 was used as the macroporous 
support for the immobilization of AoC, HIC and TfC for industrial 
applications of cutinases (Su et al., 2018). The results demonstrated 
that HiC displays the highest solvent tolerance with increased polarity, 
and TtC shows the best thermostability at 80 °C. Furthermore, in 
nonane, the three obtained catalysts could maintain ~64% residual 
enzyme activity even at 90 °C, which reveals that this strategy is 
efficient in improving the organic solvent tolerance.
In a study, the abovementioned cutinases were investigated in 
detail (Baker et  al., 2012). HiC was shown to exhibit the highest 
stability with significantly improved poly(ε-caprolactone) hydrolysing 
activities at high temperatures under the tested conditions.

Sui et al. 10.3389/fmicb.2023.1265139
Frontiers in Microbiology 19 frontiersin.org
Additionally, at low pH conditions, HiC could maintain the overall 
structure with little affected activity, but AbC exhibited the largest loss 
in structure. Similarly, FsC and AbC were found to be the least stable 
at high temperatures.
2.3.6. Metagenome- and proteomics-derived PET 
hydrolase
Recently, two highly similar thermophilic PET hydrolases 
(PES-H1 and PES-H2) were identified from a compost metagenome 
library, and PES-H1 and PES-H2 differ in only four residues (A/E1, L/
F209, D/N232, and S/A254) (Sonnendecker et al., 2022). Although 
they contain quite similar amino acid sequences, PES-H1 displayed a 
much higher hydrolytic activity on amorphous PET films, even higher 
than that of the wild-type LCC under identical conditions. To 
investigate the catalytic mechanism, high-resolution crystal structures 
of PES-H1 complexed with various PET substrates were obtained, 
including citrate [PDB ID: 7E30, with 4-(2-hydroxyethylcarbamoyl) 
benzoic acid (MHETA), PDB ID:7W6C, 7W6O, and 7W6Q] and with 
bis(2-hydroxyethyl) terephthalate (BHET, PDB ID: 7W66) (Pfaff et al., 
2022). Regarding the structures, PES-H1 adopts the canonical 
α/β-hydrolase fold consisting of 9 β-sheets and 10 α-helices and 
exhibits highly conserved features of the α/β-hydrolase superfamily 
similar to LCC. Overall, the binding modes of the different ligands in 
the active sites are quite different but similar to those observed for 
HEMT bound to IsPETase R103G/S131A28 and MHET bound to the LCC 
ICCG. Given that the multiple noncatalytic intermediate binding modes 
(e.g., MHETA) far from S130 are less likely to undergo nucleophilic 
attack, enzyme-mediated PET hydrolysis involves the dynamic 
reorientation of polymer chains in the substrate-binding site. The 
effect of W155 was also identified (Figure 15(2–7)), which is critical 
for PET binding and stabilization. Especially, from Figure 15(2–4), the 
different conformations of MHETA were obtained, which clearly revel 
the MHET degrading process. MHETA located away from the 
catalytic triad is stabilized by hydrophobic residues, including F62, 
I178, L209, M131 and F62. In addition, the TPA moiety is in the 
vicinity of F62 rather than close to the catalytic triads. Moreover, the 
special binding mode of MHETA located at the surface of PES-H1 
(Figure 15(4)) indicates that for PET hydrolysis, it might first bind at 
the surface and be transferred into the deeper active site cavity.
Given the crystal structures and the MD simulations, mutational 
hotspots were identified for rational engineering of PES-H1, such as 
the R204C/S250C variant, R6C/S49C variant, L92F/Q94Y , and L92F/
Q94Y/R204C/S250C variant. The results showed that mutant 
PES-H1L92F/Q94Y displayed a 1.8 °C higher Tm and could almost 
completely degrade the Gf-PET film after 24 h at 72 °C, with the 
highest weight loss of 37.1 mg (62.4%). It outperforms the promising 
LCC ICCG mutant in the biohydrolysis of low-crystallinity (13%) PET 
powder with 2.2-fold more degradation products. It was believed that 
the enhanced activity was caused by the “aromatic tunnel” 
(substitutions of L90F) effect streaming the efficient binding of PET 
chains to the active site (Cui et al., 2021).
3. Enhancing PET hydrolytic activity by 
constructing fusion proteins
As a surface erosion process, low binding affinity with PET, as a 
critical factor, has been found to significantly restrict the further 
industrial application of various PET hydrolases. In addition to 
modulating protein evolution, the strategy involving constructing 
fusion proteins has also been proven to be effective in enhancing the 
binding affinity of enzymes and substrates with hydrophobic surface 
binding modules (Ribitsch et al., 2013; Várnai et al., 2014; Ribitsch 
et al., 2015).
Carbohydrate-binding modules (CBMs) are small noncatalytic 
protein domains that usually function as a part of modular enzymes 
(e.g., carbohydrate-active enzymes, CAZymes), which can enhance 
the binding affinity between enzymes and substrates (Armenta et al., 
2017; Weber et al., 2019). Consequently, CBMs have been used as 
efficient affinity tags for protein immobilization owing to their high 
adsorption capacity for solid substrates (Oliveira et al., 2015; Zhou 
et al., 2020). Based on the topology of the ligand-binding site, CBMs 
can be classified into types A, B (endo-type), or C (exo-type) (Gilbert 
et al., 2013). Type A CBMs display a high ability to bind crystalline 
polysaccharides (e.g., cellulose and chitin) through hydrophobic 
interactions regulated by conserved aromatic triplets and are therefore 
potential candidates for PET-binding peptides (Zhang et al., 2013; Liu 
et al., 2022).
Weber et  al. (2019) identified a novel PET-binding CBM and 
explored the CBM-PET interactions. First, a semiquantitative PET 
surface affinity assay was developed to detect CBMs bound to PET 
films. Then, eight CBMs from the carbohydrate active enzymes 
database4 (Drula et al., 2022) were screened for PET binding, and the 
results showed that BaCBM2 (GenBank accession numbers: 
ACQ50287/MK349005) possessed the strongest affinity toward 
PET. To investigate the CBM-PET interactions, molecular dynamics 
(MD) simulations identified an aromatic triad (Trp9/Trp44/Trp63) on 
the peptide surface that was stabilized by π-stacking interactions and 
hydrogen bonds. This was further verified by tryptophan quenching 
experiments and alanine point mutations; moreover, the strength of 
PET binding of CBMs was largely determined by the ratio of 
hydrophobic to polar contacts at the interface.
In a recent study, fusion of different CBMs to the C-terminus of 
LCCICCG was reported to improve the PET hydrolysing activities, 
including a ChBD from Chitinolyticbacter meiyuanensis SYBC-H1, the 
CBM from Hypocrea jecorina, the polyhydroxyalkanoate binding 
modules (PBM) from Alcaligenes faecalis  and Trichoderma 
hydrophobins HFB4 ( Xue et  al., 2021 ). The results showed that 
LCCICCG-ChBD displayed a low Km value (131.9 μM) but a much 
higher kcat/Km (0.343 s −1/μM) compared to LCC ICCG (171.8 μM, 
0.178 s−1/μM), indicating better substrate affinity to amorphous PET 
film (GF-PET, crystalline 6.7%). The adsorption of LCCICCG-ChBD to 
GF-PET films revealed that a maximum adsorption efficiency of 
30.2% was achieved after 70 min of incubation at 40 °C. For pNPB 
hydrolysis, LCCICCG-ChBD showed a lower Km and slightly lower 
catalytic efficiency ( kcat/Km, 0.404 s−1/μM) than LCC ICCG (0.534 s−1/
μM). However, for the ground GF-PET powder, depolymerization 
degrees of 87.5 and 98.5% were achieved with LCC ICCG-ChBD and 
LCCICCG-CBM at 65°C, respectively, which are 19.6 and 30.6% higher 
than those obtained with LCCICCG.
In a similar study, to enhance the binding affinity of LCCICCG with 
PET, TrCBM and CfCBM were rationally selected from the CAZy

database to construct fusion proteins with LCCICCG (Chen et al., 2023). 
Additional auxiliary domains TrCBM (PDB ID: 1AZ6) from 
Trichoderma reesei and CfCBM from Cellulomonas fimi were obtained 
from the CAZy database5 (Drula et al., 2022). CfCBM and TrCBM 
belong to the type A carbohydrate-binding modules (CBMs), which 
can bind hydrophobic substrates (e.g., chitin) through hydrophobic 
interactions. Then, blind molecular docking and molecular dynamics 
were applied to identify potential binding positions of 4-PET, and the 
results showed that five positions (2 for TrCBM and 3 for CfCBM) 
were favorable for the binding of PET-4 to CBMs, which occurred 
mainly through van der Waals interactions, conventional hydrogen 
bonding and pi-pi interactions. Then, the fusion proteins 
5 http://www.cazy.org/
LCCICCG-TrCBM and CfCBM-LCCICCG were generated and 
characterized. The results showed that the optimal temperatures of 
LCCICCG-TrCBM and CfCBM-LCCICCG were further increased to 70 
and 80°C, respectively. Compared with LCCICCG and CfCBM-LCCICCG, 
LCCICCG-TrCBM displayed the strongest thermal stability with 70.1% 
residual activity at 50 °C for 24 h. CfCBM-LCCICCG and LCC ICCG-
TrCBM were found to more favorably bind to PET films, increasing 
by 1.4- and 1.3-fold in comparison to LCC ICCG. The total products 
released from CfCBM-LCCICCG were shown to be 24.2% higher than 
those from LCC ICCG. This study clearly describes the significant 
contributions achieved that enhance the binding ability of LCCICCG to 
PET films and significantly improve the degradation ability of the 
crystalline region of PET materials by constructing fusion proteins.
Rennison et al. (2023) investigated the binding of BaCBM2 for 
PET in detail and showed that the binding affinity is highly associated 
with temperature and crystallinity. With the increase in tested

temperatures, the general trend of Kd increased first after declining. At 
~40°C, a maximum Kd of 408 nM for BaCBM2 was detected, showing 
an obviously lower affinity for this PET substrate. At low temperatures, 
the increased binding affinity might be caused by a gain in entropy 
caused by dehydration of the binding surface; nevertheless, at higher 
temperatures, it might result from an increase in crystalline regions 
on the PET surface. At 20°C, a clear trend is observed in which the 
affinity increases at higher crystallinity, and a significant increase in 
affinity was seen as ~20% bulk crystallinity. This indicated that 
BaCBM2 might bind preferentially to crystalline areas on the PET 
surface. MD studies indicated that the binding is mainly driven by the 
functions of critical residues W9, W44 and W63 through a gain in 
entropy, which is caused by the dehydration of the binding surface. 
We  believe that fusing a polymer-binding module to the PET 
hydrolase is a promising strategy to streamline the enzymatic 
hydrolysis of PET, however the binding capacity, affinity, and 
thermostability should be  improved to satisfy the needs of 
industrial operation.
4. Conclusion
It has absolutely been accepted that biodegradation may create 
new opportunities for recycling PET materials. Research on PET 
biodegradation is still ongoing, and while progress has been achieved, 
the following challenges remain in developing efficient and scalable 
methods for biodegrading PET. (1) The relatively slow degradation 
rates: PET is a highly stable and resistant polymer, and it requires a 
long time for natural biodegradation processes to break it down. 
Enzymatic and microbial methods are also slow, and full 
biodegradation of PET can last weeks or even months. (2) Complexity 
of PET materials: PET is often used in complex products, such as 
multilayer packaging or textiles, which can make it more difficult to 
biodegrade. In some cases, only certain layers or components of the 
product may be  biodegradable, while others are not. (3) Limited 
understanding of biodegradation mechanisms: While there has been 
significant progress in determining the mechanisms of PET 
biodegradation, much remains unknown. (4) Compatibility with 
recycling: Biodegradation of PET may pose challenges with traditional 
recycling methods, which often require separation of different types 
of plastics. (5) Cost: Developing and implementing effective and 
scalable methods for PET biodegradation can be expensive, which 
may limit their adoption by industry and governments. Overall, while 
challenges remain in developing effective and scalable methods for 
PET biodegradation, the potential benefits are significant and would 
certainly create new opportunities for sustainable 
materials management.
