Abstract:  11 
Efforts to transform polyethylene terephthalate (PET) deconstruction products using live 12 
cells have been limited by terephthalic acid (TPA) uptake. Here, we used an intracellular 13 
carboxylate reduction assay to show that apparent TPA uptake in E. coli cells that lack a dedicated 14 
TPA transporter sharply increases between pH 5 -6. Furthermore, we discovered that glycol ester 15 
deconstruction products, mono(2 -hydroxyethyl) terephthalate (MHET) and bis(2 -hydroxyethyl) 16 
terephthalate (BHET), surprisingly each result in rapid pH -independent uptake. We exploited 17 
glycol ester uptake along with deletion of 22 cellular oxidoreductases to design intracellular 18 
hydrolysis routes for synthesis of upcycled reduction products from BHET at >90% yields, and 19 
from real PET wastes after tandem catalytic glycolysis and cell -based valorization at >80% 20 
combined yields. Our work has important ramifications for PET utilization by cells and adds new 21 
perspectives on the evolution of the PETase/MHETase system.  22

Main Text:  23 
Introduction 24 
While society relies on synthetic polymers , the growth in plastic waste is a  global 25 
environmental problem  that is estimated to reach 1 21 million metric tons by 2050 without 26 
intervention1. Polyethylene terephthalate (PET) is an exemplary plastic that is one of the most 27 
abundantly produced polyester and is widely applied in single use. Chemical recycling of PET via 28 
catalytic or enzymatic routes can completely hydrolyze all ester bonds, forming terephthalic acid 29 
(TPA) and ethylene glycol (EG) , or generate  alternative deconstruction products, bis(2-30 
hydroxyethyl) terephthalic acid  (BHET) and  mono(2-hydroxyethyl) terephthalic acid (MHET)  31 
(Fig 1A). In the context of PET recycling or upcycling, a fter the discovery of a PET hydrolase 32 
(PETase) and a MHET hydrolase (MHETase) from Ideonella sak aiensis, the biocatalysis 33 
community has largely focused on discovering or engineering enzymes that catalyze complete 34 
deconstruction of PET to TPA and EG  with increased efficiency 2. A smaller number of  efforts 35 
have reported engineering assimilation or valorization of TPA or EG  by microbial cells 3–7; 36 
however, the use of cell-based biocatalysts for deconstruction or transformation of deconstructed 37 
PET has lagged considerably behind chemical or enzymatic alternatives8. This is despite the ability 38 
of whole cells to facilitate a larger number of valorizing transformations while also obviating the 39 
need for cell lysis and enzyme purification , thus potentially lowering catalyst costs at industrial 40 
scales. Given the polymeric nature of the feedstock, some initial deconstruction steps must occur 41 
in an extracellular environment; however, we sought to critically examine the conventional notion 42 
that complete extracellular hydrolysis to TPA and EG would be beneficial for cellular 43 
transformations.  44 
A key bottleneck in these processes is slow cellular uptake of TPA. In bioconversion and 45 
upcycling strategies, TPA is commonly prioritized due to its carbon richness compared to EG and 46 
potential to serve as a precursor for value -added aromatic compounds. However, as TPA cannot 47 
readily diffuse through microbial cell membranes at neutral pH, the expression of TPA transporter 48 
genes is thought to be essential to TPA catabolism or upcycling 9. Thus, the design of cell-based 49 
TPA transformations typically involves the expression and engineering of an active TPA 50 
transporter or less often methods to alter cell permeability. In Pseudomonas putida, heterologous 51 
expression of tpaK, which encodes an MFS-type TPA transporter from Rhodococcus jostii, was 52 
used to achieve β-ketoadipic acid production from catalytically depolymerized PET4. Interestingly, 53

the authors observed that secretion tags were not required for BHET conversion, speculating that 54 
either the PETase/MHETase might exit cells, that BHET might enter cells passively, or that a 55 
native transporter might allow BHET uptake.  Given the prominence of Escherichia coli in 56 
synthetic biology and industrial processes, it is an attractive host for  TPA transformations or 57 
utilization. Recently, adaptive laboratory evolution (ALE) of E. coli with heterologous expression 58 
of the TpaK transporter from R. jostii and genes for TPA assimilation reinforced the notion that 59 
TPA transport is limiting even after heterologous expression of transporters 10. To avoid active 60 
TPA transport, alternative approaches to enhance cell membrane permeability and/or TPA uptake 61 
have been employed including modification of membrane proteins11,  lowering culture pH (5.5) or 62 
using chemical additives12. However, these strategies can decrease downstream pathway activity 63 
cell viability, limiting their practical relevance13. 64 
We wondered if we could avoid the challenge of TPA uptake by instead targeting the 65 
alternative deconstruction products, the glycol esters MHET and BHET, as starting substrates for 66 
intracellular transformations (Fig. 1B). We used a carboxylic acid reductase (CAR) to modify the 67 
carboxylates present in both TPA and MHET  as a proxy for detecting cellular uptak e and to 68 
produce terephthalaldehyde (TPAL), which is a  valuable monomer with uses in thermosets14–16, 69 
polyspiroacetals17, polymeric organic frameworks 18,  nanocomposites 19, and other polymer 70 
reactions20–23, as well as in the production of new Schiff Bases ligands24–26. The reactive aldehyde 71 
functionality of TPAL also enables potential biosynthe tic routes to numerous alternative 72 
chemistries27–29, including to the valuable di amine para-xylylenediamine (PXDA or pXYL), 73 
which has an estimated market size of USD ~1 billion30–35. 74 
Here, we report the enhanced uptake of BHET and MHET, and we exploit this finding for 75 
the design of whole cell cascades capable of upcycling PET deconstruction products at neutral pH. 76 
We show that MHET is efficiently transported intracellularly and converted toward its aldehyde 77 
(2-hydroxyethyl 4-formylbenzoate, or MHET-ald) at neutral and acidic pH; however, TPA uptake 78 
and conversion toward its corresponding aldehydes (4 -formylbenzoic acid, FBA , and TPAL) is 79 
strictly limited to acidic conditions (pH <  6.2). To enable intracellular hydrolysis of BHET and 80 
MHET for subsequent transformations , we screen published PETases  and cutinases for general 81 
intracellular “ETase” activity under ambient conditions. We then show that coupling our selected 82 
PETase and CAR enzymes within the same cell enable s the biosynthesis of TPAL at high yields. 83

Finally, we show that this PETase-CAR system can be coupled with an ω-transaminase for high-84 
yield biosynthesis of pXYL from products of catalytic glycolysis using real PET textile and bottle 85 
waste streams. Overall, our work has significant ramifications for those interested in supplying 86 
PET deconstruction products to cellular catalysts, whether for valorization or for catabolism. 87 
Results 88 
Cellular uptake of TPA is controlled by pH 89 
To measure apparent uptake of carboxylate group containing PET deconstruction products 90 
into E. coli, we created an enzyme -coupled assay based on heterologous expression of a CAR 91 
shown in vitro to possess activity on our candidate substrates (CAR from Mycobacterium avium, 92 
MaCAR)36 (Fig. 2A). To retain desired aldehyde products for eventual upcycling reactions, we 93 
expressed MaCAR in the previously engineered E. coli RARE.Δ16 strain designed for TPAL 94 
retention37. We supplemented TPA, MHET, as well as mono-substituted carboxylates FBA (the 95 
single reduction product of TPA) and 4 -hydroxymethylbenzoic acid (HMBA, a potential over-96 
reduction product), to cells expressing MaCAR at a starting pH of 7.5  under aerobic culturing 97 
conditions. To ensure that all potential intermediates are collected in the supernatant, we performed 98 
a methanol -based extraction of all collected samples. We observed full conversion of MHET, 99 
FBA, and HMBA to their respective aldehydes after 4 h, indicating these substrates are readily 100 
imported by cells (Fig. 2B). However, we observed no conversion of the dicarboxylic acid TPA, 101 
consistent with this step being a bottleneck. Interestingly, we did observe the full conversion of 102 
TPA after 24 h, suggesting a delayed uptake relative to monocarboxylic acids. Given that others 103 
have briefly observed that pH can play a role in TPA uptake11, we monitored culture pH alongside 104 
TPA conversion as a function of time. We found that pH decreases correlated to TPA conversion 105 
(Fig. 2C), suggesting a simple explanation for the delay. To collect further supporting evidence, 106 
we saw that buffering the culture media abrogated TPA conversion (Fig. S1), and that lowering 107 
initial culture pH accelerated TPA uptake and conversion (Fig. 2D).  108 
To more extensively study how pH affects TPA and MHET import, we transitioned from 109 
growing cells to resting cells , allowing for a more controlled reaction . However, we found that 110 
resting cells of the engineered RARE.Δ16 host rapidly oxidized TPAL, which is a phenomenon 111 
not present in growing cells  and could counteract carboxylate reduction  (Fig. 2E-F). To negate 112 
this, we further engineered the RARE.Δ16  to include knockouts of 6 aldehyde dehydrogenases 113

that have been shown to mitigate aryl aldehyde oxidation38, generating the ROAR.Δ22 strain. We 114 
found that the ROAR.Δ22 host increased TPAL (4.2-fold) and MHET -ald ( 3.7-fold) 115 
concentrations compared to RARE.Δ16 after 4 h (Fig. 2G, Fig. S2). The strain exhibited negligible 116 
fitness difference nor sensitivity of aldehyde retention in various reaction media (pH and glucose 117 
concentration) (Fig. S2-5). We resuspended resting cells of ROAR.Δ22 that expressed MaCAR 118 
with TPA or MHET at starting pH  ranging from 4.8 -7.5 in increments of 0.2  (Fig. 2H). As 119 
expected, TPA conversion increased as we lowered pH, until TPA precipitated out of solution at 120 
pH 5.0 and 4.8  (Fig. 2I). We could only  observe TPA conversion at pH 6.2 or lower , with a 121 
maximum conversion of 92% at pH 5.2, indicating that TPA uptake can occur in acidic pHs. The 122 
observed TPA uptake  correlates well with the predicted  formation of the partially deprotonated 123 
TPA, highlighting the possibility that the mono -protonated form of TPA is accepted by native 124 
transporters (Fig. S6). Excitingly, we observed the full conversion of MHET towards MHET -ald 125 
at all pH tested (Fig. 2J), and we sought to investigate the design of new transformation routes 126 
that would exploit this finding. 127 
Screening of “ETase” activity to enhance cellular uptake of PET deconstruction products 128 
Because these experiments showed that MHET uptake was fast and unaffected by reaction 129 
pH, we hypothesized that intracellular expression  of selective esterases (here designated as 130 
“ETases” for potential activity on PET, BHET, MHET, and/or MHET-ald) could facilitate 131 
complete ester hydrolysis after uptake (Fig. 3A). We desired an ETase that had activity on BHET, 132 
MHET and MHET-ald at 30°C for intracellular TPA production with limited membrane leakage 133 
that could lead to TPA production extracellularly 39,40. We screened 10 previously engineered 134 
ETases on BHET, MHET and MHET-ald.  We selected five engineered variants of the Ideonella 135 
sakaiensis PETase (FAST41, HOT42, Dura43, Themo-Stable: denoted here as Thermo44 and TS45) 136 
two leaf-branch compost cutinase variants  (LCC39, LCC-ICCG: denoted here as ICCG 46), two 137 
variants of bacterium HR29  PETase (BhrPETase47 and Turbo48) and one metagenome-derived 138 
PETase (PES-H1:denoted here as PES49). While many of these enzymes were primarily studied at 139 
elevated temperatures for PET deconstruction, we sought to measure ETase activity under ambient 140 
conditions (Table S1). 141 
We expressed each ETase initially in RARE.Δ16 in growing cells to track cell viability and 142 
to test activity on supplemented BHET, MHET and MHET-ald. We observed a wide range of TPA 143

production when cultures were supplemented with BHET and MHET, indicating differences in 144 
substrate specificity  and activity  between engineered variants , as well as the robust uptake of 145 
BHET (Fig. 3B-C). Analysis of the ETase activity allowed us to characterize several BHET-146 
selective ETases, such as  FAST, PES and D URA, which had high BHET conversion and low 147 
MHET conversion. We also observed several generalist ETases such as BHR, Turbo, LCC, ICCG, 148 
and HOT, with high conversion of both BHET and MHET. Surprisingly, we noticed that our entire 149 
library of ETases had activity on MHET-ald (Fig. 3D-E), and obtained higher conversion s on 150 
MHET-ald than MHET  (Fig. S7-8). After profiling ETase specificity , we noticed a subset of 151 
ETases has substantial effects to overexpression (BHR, Turbo, ICCG and PES) with others having 152 
minor effects (Thermo, TS, LCC, Dura, HOT and FAST) (Fig. 3F). Considering both activity and 153 
toxicity, FAST showed promise for further applications. 154 
Coupling ETase and CAR to explore the enhanced uptake of BHET and MHET  155 
After identification of viable ETases, we reasoned that by expressing FAST and MaCAR 156 
together in one-pot we could produce TPAL from BHET and MHET at neutral pH in growing cells 157 
(Fig. 3G). We compared expression of FAST and MaCAR in separate cells (Cell A and Cell B , 158 
respectively) as against expression in the same cell (Cell C) . We hypothesized that expression of 159 
FAST and MaCAR in the same cell could directly result in TPAL, potentially fully circumventing 160 
TPA accumulation. First, we showed that supplemented TPA is not consumed under well-buffered 161 
conditions (Fig. 3H). We then tested if supplying MHET or BHET would yield TPAL. Excitingly, 162 
we observed TPAL synthesis in all reaction conditions starting from MHET and BHET, indicating 163 
both strategies are viable alternatives to avoid challenges posed by TPA uptake. Using Cell C, we 164 
obtained high TPAL yields of 82.7% or 98.0% from 5 mM MHET or BHET, respectively (Fig. 165 
3I-J). Using Cell A and B in co-culture, we found that a 1:1 inoculation ratio resulted in optimum 166 
TPAL yields of 82.6% and 68.8% from MHET and BHET, respectively. To further highlight our 167 
approach, we tested both strategies in resting cells with MHET or BHET as our starting substrates. 168 
We again saw TPAL production in all our reaction conditions starting from 5 mM MHET or BHET 169 
(Fig. S9). We observed high TPAL yields of 77% or 88% from MHET or BHET, respectively 170 
using Cell C . These results indicate that coupling intercellular TPA  synthesis to downstream 171 
enzymatic transformations can effectively enable TPA valorization using cells. 172

Whole cell valorization towards diamines starting from PET intermediate deconstruction 173 
products 174 
Having designed efficient routes from alternative PET deconstruction products to the 175 
highly reactive platform molecule TPAL , we next designed a whole cell cascade for the 176 
biosynthesis of the difunctionalized amine, para-xylylenediamine (pXYL). To do this, we used a 177 
transaminase from Chromobacterium violaceum, which has been shown to accept PET-derived 178 
aldehydes36. Additionally, we co-expressed an alanine dehydrogenase from Bacillus subtilis  179 
(AlaDH) to recycle pyruvate back to the alanine amine donor. We first investigated the operating 180 
pH range of CvTA  in resting whole cells . We noticed that as reaction pH is lowered, para-181 
aminomethyl benzoic acid (pAMBA) accumulates, presumably via endogenous oxidation  (Fig 182 
4A). We observed that the amination of 5 mM TPAL had an optimal conversion to pXYL at pH 183 
7.5, resulting in a 90% conversion after 1 h (Fig. 4B). These results highlight a unique challenge 184 
if we were to start with TPA as an initial substrate as low pH is needed for TPA uptake, but higher 185 
pH is optimal for amination. Despite our progress with alternative PET deconstruction products, 186 
we chose to investigate addressing this when starting from TPA by employing a one-pot, two-step 187 
approach (Fig. 4C) in which the reaction is pH-adjusted from that optimal for TPA to that optimal 188 
for CvTA. For this reaction, we supplemented 5 mM TPA at a starting pH of 7.5 or 5.2. For the 189 
pH 5.2 case, after 2 h we increased pH to 7.5 with NaOH. After which, cells expressing CvTA and 190 
AlaDH (Cell D) were supplemented in both conditions and the reactions were ran for an additional 191 
2 h. As expected, when starting at a pH of 7.5, we observed no TPA conversion  (Fig. 4D).  192 
However, when starting at a pH of 5.2, we obtained a 97% conversion to the desired  diamine 193 
pXYL (Fig. 4E).  194 
While we achieve d high conversion to pXYL from TPA  using pH adjustment, we next 195 
aimed to produce amines without pH adjustment using MHET or BHET as starting substrates. For 196 
direct comparisons of pXYL conversion from TPA to that of our proposed cascade starting from 197 
MHET or BHET, we continued to run our reactions in a one-pot two-step approach, meaning that 198 
Cell D was added after 2 h. We ran reactions using our Cell C as well as the best performing Cell 199 
A:B ratio to generate TPAL from MHET and BHET. Using Cells A, B and D, we obtained pXYL 200 
yields of 80.5% from MHET or 57.4% from BHET (Fig. 4 F, G). With Cell C and D, we observed 201 
high pXYL yields of 93.1% from MHET or 95.9% from BHET. We also examined whether we 202 
could selectively  biosynthesize the  antifibrinolytic drug , para-aminomethyl benzoic acid 203

(pAMBA) from our intermediate deconstruction products 50. As MaCAR has been shown to have 204 
minimal activity on pAMBA, we hypothesized that we could  target pAMBA synthesis using a 205 
one-pot one-step approach36. We found that our t hree-cell approach at a cellular ration of 1:10:2 206 
of Cells A:B:D resulting in 83% yield pAMBA from 5 mM MHET (Fig. S10).  207 
Reaction scaleup and upcycling of post-consumer PET waste 208 
Given that coupling FAST and MaCAR in the same cell showed high  TPAL and pXYL 209 
yields at 5 mM concentrations of either MHET or BHET, we investigated the ability of  our 210 
upcycling cascade for either substrate at elevated substrate loading of 10, 20, or 40 mM. We ran 211 
these reactions at an increased glucose concentration (80 mM) to ensure sufficient co-factors for 212 
carboxylate reduction. For either substrate, we sampled at 4 and 8 h. We observed high yields of 213 
TPAL in just 4 h with each concentration tested for both supplemented MHET (10 mM: 77%; 20 214 
mM: 83%; 40 mM: 80%) and BHET (10 mM: 77%; 20 mM: 79%; 40 mM: 79%) (Fig. S11). At 8 215 
h, we found the yield at 40 mM increased slightly for MHET (84%) and BHET (89%).  216 
After successfully achieving TPAL production at increased substrate loading, we scaled up 217 
our cascade to a 10 mL reaction volume (from 300 µL) and used intermediate PET deconstruction 218 
substrates from glycolysis of  post-consumer textile or plastic  waste (Fig. 5A). Using previously 219 
established methods, we performed catalytic glycolysis on a 100% polyester red T-shirt resulting 220 
in mixture of 78% BHET, 21% MHET and 1% TPA 51. We also conducted glycolysis on a post-221 
consumer PET plastic bottle that resulted in a mixture of 99% BHET and 1% MHET mixture 52. 222 
We next ran our one -pot two -step method to target pXYL production  starting from these  223 
deconstruction products. Both solid residues were resuspended in our cellular reaction buffer at an 224 
estimated 40 mM concentration.  We supplemented Cell C for 8 h and then added Cell D and let 225 
the reaction run for an addition 8 h for a total of 16 h. We were excited to see the full conversion 226 
of deconstruction products in both reactions, with pXYL yields of 89.5% or 90.5% from polyester 227 
textile waste or post-consumer PET plastic waste, respectively  (Fig. 5B, C ). As both PET 228 
deconstruction and upcycling steps resulted in high yields, our tandem chemical deconstruction 229 
and biological upcycling strategy resulted in overall pXYL yields of >80%.  230

reinforces the value of tandem hybrid processes and provides greater reasoning for their efficient 234 
performance. Based on our findings, an entirely cellular alternative could also be designed where 235 
a secreted ETase is chosen for the ability to selectively  produce glycol esters for subsequent 236 
intracellular processing by a complementary intracellular ETase. Collectively, our results 237 
showcase the industrial promise of bypassing TPA as a substrate, harnessing intracellular ETases, 238 
exploiting extensive strain engineering for TPAL retention, and interfacing engineered bacterial 239 
cells with catalytic glycolysis for robust hybrid PET valorization. 240 
The cellular transport of various PET deconstruction products revealed in this study, if 241 
similar for other bacteria, offers new perspectives on why known natural PET degrading bacteria 242 
such as  Ideonella sakaiensis utilize a two -enzyme (PETase-MHETase) system for PET 243 
assimilation. Naturally observed PETases tend to generate MHET, which  may leverage aromatic 244 
carboxylate transporters for cellular entry that could be widespread across environmental bacteria. 245 
As a result, MHETase secretion may not be strictly necessary for natural PET assimilators . 246 
However, based on sequence conservation of the signal peptide on characterized MHETases and 247 
uncharacterized homologs, we expect MHETase secretion to be the norm. Given that, another 248 
plausible explanation is  that MHETase secretion accompanied by evolution of a dedicated TPA 249 
transporter, while less efficient for the PET assimilator,  may have been an evolutionary solution 250 
to mitigate the formation of MHET as a common good that other bacteria containing promiscuous 251 
hydrolases could utilize. 252

PET beverage bottles (Coca -Cola) were washed with water, dried, and cut into ~4 mm × 4 mm 463 
square pieces prior to use. 464 
In a typical experiment, 500 mg of PET flakes, 5 mL of ethylene glycol (EG), and 5 mg of 465 
catalyst were added to a microwave reaction vial. Commercial ZnO nanopowder (<5 μm particle 466 
size, Sigma-Aldrich) was used as the catalyst. The contents of the vial were thoroughly mixed 467 
using a vortex mixer to ensure uniform dispersion of ZnO in EG. The vial was then placed in the 468 
microwave reactor, which was programmed to maintain a constant temperature of 210°C for 15 469 
minutes with a stirring speed of 600 rpm. 470 
After the reaction, the vial was rapidly cooled to room temperature. Subsequently, 100 mL 471

reactor was programmed to maintain a constant temperature. On completion of a reaction, the 491 
reaction vial was allowed to cool down rapidly to room temperature. 100 mL of distilled water was 492 
added to separate BHET and oligomers. The unreacted polymer and larger oligomers were 493 
removed using a Whatman filter paper. The residual water from the product solution was then 494 
evaporated under vacuum (72 mbar) at 60 °C using a rotary evaporator, and the resulting BHET 495 
was crystallized by cooling the residual solution overnight to 4 °C in a refrigerator after the 496 
addition of a small amount of distilled water to the residue. The resultant crystals were filtered 497 
using a glass filter and dried at 80 °C. 498
