Abstract: Approximately 400 billion PET bottles are produced annually in the world, of which from
8 to 9 million tons are discarded in oceans. This requires developing strategies to urgently recycle
them. PET recycling can be carried out using the microbial hydrolysis of polymers when monomers
and oligomers are released. Exploring the metabolic activity of fungi is an environmentally friendly
way to treat harmful polymeric waste and obtain the production of monomers. The present study
addressed: (i) the investigation of potential of strains with the potential for the depolymerization
of PET bottles from different manufacturers (crystallinity of 35.5 and 10.4%); (ii) the search for
a culture medium that favors the depolymerization process; and (iii) gaining more knowledge
on fungal enzymes that can be applied to PET recycling. Four strains (from 100 fungal strains)
were found as promising for conversion into terephthalic acid from PET nanoparticles (npPET):
Curvularia trifolii CBMAI 2111, Trichoderma sp. CBMAI 2071, Trichoderma atrovirideCBMAI 2073, and
Cladosporium cladosporioides CBMAI 2075. The fermentation assays in the presence of PET led to the
release of terephthalic acid in concentrations above 12 ppm. Biodegradation was also conﬁrmed
using mass variation analyses (reducing mass), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) that showed
evidence of material roughness, FTIR analysis that showed band modiﬁcation, enzymatic activities
detected for lipase, and esterase and cutinase, conﬁrmed by monomers/oligomers quantiﬁcation
using high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC-UV). Based on the microbial strains PET
depolymerization, the results are promising for the exploration of the selected microbial strain.

1. Introduction
Despite the environmental damage caused by plastic, its current application in human
society has become so diverse that a short-term replacement is unlikely. In 2018, the
world production of polymers reached 360 million tons (Mtons). If the current treatment
(i.e., production and disposal) of plastics persists by 2050, it is believed that 12 Mtons of
this material will be deposited in landﬁlls or the natural environment [ 1]. Europe alone
was responsible for causing 62 Mtons of this global amount to be available, of which 7.7%
comprised polyethylene terephthalate (PET), a thermoplastic with an excellent mechanical

and thermal resistance [2,3]. The initiatives by the European Parliament intended to increase
PET recycling with the support of international companies and the promise to step up
recycling. However, a decline in the uptake by the selective collection of the polymer has
been observed, threatening the goal of the estimated amount for 2025 [4]. It is assumed that,
only in 2021, will the number of produced bottles reach 583.3 billion units worldwide [5],
which is a serious matter of concern for the environment.
The great persistence and low (bio-) degradability reported under natural conditions
are responsible for the huge environmental impact of inadequate PET disposal. The material
may require thousands of years to degrade [6,7]. The shortage of production associated
with excessive consumption and the timid reuse of PET bottles requires research and
development aimed at remediating this recalcitrant material. It is estimated that the amount
of plastic packaging on the market may quickly become equal to the quantity discarded,
reinforcing the urgency for establishing new recycling strategies for this material [8].
The bottles for beverage and food recycling relates to the production of ﬁbers and
special ﬁlms, laminated and thermoformed, as well as textiles [ 3]. PET recycling routes
may be mechanical, chemical, or energetic [9]. Among them, chemical recycling emerges
as a more interesting alternative because it prevents the deposition of solid waste in the
environment, besides providing monomers to obtain new bottles and packaging [10,11].
The types of chemical recycling are glycolysis, methanolysis, aminolysis, ammonolysis,
and hydrolysis. The ﬁrst has been the most used by the industry despite the high cost
associated with separating and reﬁning the products in the mixture [12]. The studies on the
depolymerization of PET search for innovative aspects and are certainly of great scientiﬁc,
economic, and industrial importance [13]. Alternatively, microorganism-mediated polymer
hydrolysis occurs with the advantage of not requiring solvents and reagents that usually
increase puriﬁcation costs [14].
Microbial hydrolytic enzymes such as lipases (EC 3.1.1.3), esterases (EC 3.1.1.6 and
EC 3.1.1.2), and cutinases (EC 3.1.1.74) can assist in the biodegradation of the hydrophobic
polymer [15–17]. Several studies have addressed the use of microorganisms or their en-
zymes in PET depolymerization processes [18–20]. Recently, the species Ideonella sakaiensis
(Burkholderiales, Proteobacteria), isolated in Japan, has been in the limelight due to the
selectivity and efﬁciency of its enzymes in 18 h of activity [ 21]. Despite the satisfactory
activity of some hydrolases, the microbial conversion of PET is far from complete. It is
still not clear in which species or phyla these enzymes can be mainly found. According to
Lear et al. [22], these questions represent important notes that must be answered, which
justiﬁes further studies.
Fungi are excellent degraders of organic matter, especially natural polymers, as they
grow under adverse conditions of pH and humidity. In addition, mycelial development
favors the colonization of the substrate, which, together with its multienzyme system,
speeds up the degradation of several compounds [ 23]. The literature highlights cuti-
nases from Fusarium solani [24] and esterases from Cladosporium cladosporioides [25] and
Penicillium citrinum [26], as well as lipases from Aspergillus oryzae [27], which have the po-
tential to increase the hydrophilicity of the PET polymer. Recently, Malafatti-Picca et al. [18]
selected nine strains of remarkable hydrolytic activity for converting PET. However, most
of the reports still focus only on bacterial species, while fungi remain unexplored for such
an application. This fact is evinced in the literature as highlighted in the reviews performed
by Taniguchi et al. [3] and Ru et al. [28].
Several methods are used to evaluate microbial activity on polymers. High-Performance
Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) is used to study microbial activity on polymers, al-
lowing for the quantiﬁcation of the released terephthalic acid (PTA) monomers and
bis(2-hydroxyethyl) terephthalate (BHET) and mono(hydroxyethyl) terephthalate (MHET)
oligomers. Although efﬁcient, the methodology is time-consuming and requires speciﬁc
infrastructure and adequate room [24,28]. Miniaturized screening approaches to detect
polyester hydrolases are considered of great value because they are quick and helpful for
the development of sustainable methodologies. Wei et al. [29], for example, implemented a
Polymers 2023, 15, 1581 3 of 24
high-performance screening technique with ﬂuorescence detection (HTS-ﬂuorescence) for
the quantiﬁcation of terephthalic acid from PET nanoparticles (npPET) by converting PTA
to the free radical 2-hydroxyterephthalate (HOTP). The assays of this investigation were
carried out with recombinant cutinases of Thermobiﬁda fusca (Actinomycetales, Bacteria).
Addressing the same principle, Chaves et al. [30] reported the bacteria, ﬁlamentous fungi,
and yeasts with the potential for depolymerization of npPET in PTA, although using the
entire cell structure of the tested isolates, not just the isolated enzymes.
Focusing on fungal strains from hydrocarbon-associated environments, this work eval-
uated their hydrolase production potential for npPET assimilation using microscale assays.
The effect of the strains with the best conversion rates on fragments of PET bottles from
two brands and different production technologies, “plant-bottle” and conventional, was
evaluated. For this purpose, the analyses of PTA, BHET, and MHET quantiﬁcation through
HPLC-UV after liquid–liquid extraction, as well as total proteins and hydrolase activity
(lipase and esterase), were carried out on fermented liquid (free of mycelium). On PET
fragments, the analyses included weight variation, scanning electron microscopy (SEM),
and infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). The proposal of a culture medium to provide greater
PET conversion into PTA and oligomers was another contribution of the present study.
2. Material and Methods
2.1. Microorganisms
One hundred fungal strains were investigated in this work, which was the same
number Malafatti-Picca [18] used in their study. The strains were obtained from a culture
collection of interest to the petrochemical industry deposited in the Brazilian Collection
of Environmental and Industrial Microorganisms (CBMAI, Unicamp, SP , Brazil) and/or
preserved in the working research collection of the laboratory.
2.1.1. Enzymatic Assays with PET nanoparticles
The isolates were cultivated in Potato Dextrose Agar (PDA) purchased from Kasvi,
Spain, at 28 ◦C for seven days. The analyses were performed in 96 well plates with a black
background divided into enzymatic assays and negative, positive, and microbial control,
as indicated in Table 1.

Afterward, the plates were incubated at 28 ◦C and agitated at 200 rpm. The enzyme
activities were monitored at zero, ﬁve, ten, and ﬁfteen days. The following reagents
obtained from Sigma-Aldrich, (Saint Louis, MO, USA) were added per well, in the following
order: 30 µL of a 2% H2O2 solution (CAS 7722-84-1), 20 µL of 2 mM EDTA (CAS 13235-
36-4), and 20 µL of 3 mM Fe 2SO4·7H2O (CAS 7782-63-0), resulting, respectively, in the
ﬁnal concentrations in the wells of 0.0026 mM, 0.2 mM, and 0.3 mM. After that, the plates
were incubated at room temperature for 25 min for the conversion of terephthalic acid into
HOTP , then the ﬂuorescence was revealed [30].
The ﬂuorescence was observed at wavelengths λex = 328 nm (excitation) and
λem = 421 nm (emission) using a TM 2300 EnSpire® multimode plate reader (PerkinElmer,

2.1.2. Assays to Detect Cutinase Production 
Plate Tests with Cutin and Polycaprolactone (PCL) as the Sole Carbon Sources 
Agar blocks (3.0 mm of diameter) containing fungal mycelium grown for seven days 
in PDA at 28 °C were transferred t o the center of two different Petri dishes (90 mm × 15 
mm) with two configurations: (i) minimal mineral medium supplemented with cutin 
(extracted from Fuji apple peel, according to the methodology proposed by Macedo and 
Pio [32]); and (ii) minimal mineral medium supplemented with polycaprolactone (Sigma 
Aldrich®, Saint Louis, MO, USA - average molar mass 10,000 g.mol−1). The formulations 
of the culture media were the following: 
1. Cutin: 3.0 g NaNO3 (CAS 7631-99-4); 1.0 g K 2HPO4 (CAS 7758-11-4); 0.5 g KCl  (CAS 
7447-40-7); 0.01 g FeSO4.7H2O (CAS 7782-63-0); 0.2% cutin; 17 g agar  (CAS 9002-18-
0); and 1000 mL distilled water [33,34]. 
2. Polycaprolactone: 4 g (NH4)2SO4 (CAS 7783-20-2); 6 g KH2PO4 (CAS 7778-77-0); 0.2 g

10043-52-4); 10 µg H 3BO3 (CAS 10043-35-3); 10 µg MnSO 4 (CAS 10034-96-5); 70 µg 
ZnSO4 (CAS 7446-20-0); 50 µg CuSO4 (CAS 7758-98-7); 10 µg MoO3 (CAS 1313-27-5); 
500 mg PCL (acetone:water); and 1 L distilled water [35]. 
The reagents used in the above formulations were obtained from Sigma Aldrich and 
Merck (Darmstadt, Germany).  
The results were scored as the diameter of the colonies in centimeters in both culture 
media, in addition to the formation of a whitening zone at the center of the colony in the 
medium with PCL. 
2.2. PET Depolymerization Assays 
The biodegradation tests were carried out by fermentation in a liquid medium with 
polymeric films of different brands: PET1 was a fragment of  a 500 mL Crystal ® mineral 
water bottle, and PET2 was a fragment of a 2 L Sprite ® diet soda bottle. The bottles were 
purchased from local stores, and, after removing the bottlenecks, caps, and labels,

Agar blocks (3.0 mm of diameter) containing fungal mycelium grown for seven days in
PDA at 28 ◦C were transferred to the center of two different Petri dishes (90 mm ×15 mm)
with two conﬁgurations: (i) minimal mineral medium supplemented with cutin (extracted

2.2. PET Depolymerization Assays
The biodegradation tests were carried out by fermentation in a liquid medium with
polymeric ﬁlms of different brands: PET1 was a fragment of a 500 mL Crystal ® mineral
water bottle, and PET2 was a fragment of a 2 L Sprite® diet soda bottle. The bottles were
purchased from local stores, and, after removing the bottlenecks, caps, and labels, fragments
of approximately 4.5 cm ×2.5 cm (500 mg) were cut using sterile scissors and transferred
to Petri dishes (adapted from Sharon and Sharon [ 36]; Malafatti-Picca et al. [ 18]). The
thicknesses of the PET ﬁlms were measured using a RoHS® digital micrometer (Newton,
NJ, USA), and thermal analyses of differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) were performed
to determine the melting temperature and crystallinity percentage of the PET samples
(Table 2). The differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) analyses to obtain the thermograms
were performed using the Netzsch DSC 200 PC equipment (Waldkraiburg, Germany) with
Polymers 2023, 15, 1581 5 of 24
PET1 and PET2 polymers. Then, they were studied in the temperature range from 30 ◦C to
350 ◦C with a heating ramp of 10 ◦C·min−1 under a nitrogen ﬂow (N2) of 50 mL·min−1 [37].

Equation S1 of the supplementary material presents the data to obtain the crystallinity

The fragments were weighed on an analytical balance (e = 0.001 g), washed with tap
water and common neutral detergent, and rinsed with sterile distilled water. Afterward,
they were immersed in 2% sodium hypochlorite for 1 h, rinsed again with sterile distilled
water, and kept for 30 min under ultraviolet light inside the biological safety cabinet
(492 watts of power at a 50 cm distance of PET fragments). The fragments were left in the
drying oven at 40 ◦C until complete evaporation of the water.
The fungal strains were grown to produce fermented broth for the lipase and es-
terase activity. The fungal strains were grown for seven days at 28◦C in a BOD chamber
(Biothec, Piracicaba, S ão Paulo, Brazil) and subcultured in test tubes containing PDA
(20 g·L−1 glucose) with approximately 100 mg of 0.5 cm ×0.5 cm PET1 bottle fragments.
A suspension of 10 6 spores per mL or, in the case of non-sporulating fungi, part of the
mycelial mass was aseptically transferred to 125 mL Erlenmeyer ﬂasks containing 40 mL of
liquid medium (Table 3) plus approximately 500 mg of previously cleaned PET fragments
(as reported above).

The content was transferred to sterile Falcon tubes (50 mL) and centrifuged at 4472×g and
8 ◦C. Then, the suspensions were ﬁltered through a 0.45µm cellulose membrane to separate
the PET fragments from the mycelium present in the fermented liquid. Each assay was per-
formed in triplicate with an abiotic control (only media and PET fragments, without fungi).

The post-fermentation PET fragments were subjected to a new disinfection process, as
previously mentioned, until no mycelium could be seen (in the binocular stereomicroscope).
Later, they were dried at 40 ◦C in a conventional drying oven until constant weight. The
mass variation of the fragments was calculated based on Equation (2), where BF and AF
represent the fragments before and after fermentation, respectively.

2.3. Analysis of Post-Fermentation PET Fragments
2.3.1. Attenuated total reﬂectance/Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR/ATR)
The PET1 and PET2 samples were characterized using infrared spectroscopy with a
IRPrestige-21 spectrometer (Shimadzu, Chiyoda-ku, Tokyo, Japan) within the range from
4000 cm−1 to 400 cm−1 with 32 accumulations and a resolution of 2 cm−1.
2.3.2. Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM)
The PET fragments were covered with gold using a Sputter Coater SCD 050 (Bal-Tec,
Balzers, Liechtenstein) apparatus at 25 milliamps for 40 s under a pressure of 80 Pa. The
images were obtained using a TM 3000 Tabletop Microscope (Hitachi, Tokyo, Japan) with a
voltage acceleration of 15 k (analytical mode from 1 Kv to 30 Kv) (adapted from Sepperumal,
Markandan, Paljara [40]).
2.3.3. Analysis of the Post-Fermentation Broth
Total Proteins
The total protein content of the fermented broth was determined using the Bradford
method [41], and the concentrations were obtained through a standard curve of Bovine
Serum Albumin solution, BSA-Sigma Aldrich (Saint Louis, MO, USA) with a linear range
between 3.33 µg·mL−1 and 33.33 µg·mL−1 (R2 = 0.994, 6 calibrators, n = 3). The absorbance
readings were performed on a spectrophotometer at a wavelength of 595 nm, corresponding
to the anionic form of Coomassie Brilliant Blue G-250 (Bio-Rad, Mississauga, Ontario, CA,
USA) when associated with proteins.
2.4. Enzymatic Activities
Lipase: The lipolytic activity was determined by the titration of fatty acids released by
the hydrolysis of palm oil analytical grade, 76% (Supelco®, Bellefonte, PA, USA) [42]. Then,
1 g of the oil (lipid substrate), 4 mL of sterilized distilled water, and from 5 to 10 glass beads
were transferred to an Erlenmeyer ﬂask (125 mL) to then receive 1 mL of the mycelium-free
fermented broth.
The ﬂasks were incubated at 50 ◦C and shaken at 150 rpm for 30 min, and the reaction
stopped by adding 10 mL of a solution of acetone:ethanol (1:1). The released fatty acids
were quantiﬁed using titration with a standardized NaOH solution (0.05 mol·L−1) and by
adding three drops of phenolphthalein (0.1% in absolute ethanol) as an indicator. A blank
was prepared with 1 mL of distilled water. These assays were processed in triplicate and
the enzyme activity was expressed in units of lipolytic activity (LA) corresponding to the
number of enzymes capable of providing a micromol of fatty acids per min of reaction.
Esterase: The esterase activity was estimated using the enzymatic hydrolysis of a
1.5 mmol·L−1 (alpha) α-naphthyl acetate solution (in a 300 mmol ·L−1 phosphate buffer
containing isopropyl alcohol). The aim was the quantiﬁcation of α-naphthol, revealed by
the formation of a diazo-complex after adding Fast Blue RR (0.1 mg ·mL−1 in dimethyl
sulfoxide and ethanol, in a relation of 1:2) (Sigma-Aldrich, Saint Louis, MO, United States)
(Figure 2). The quantiﬁcation was determined against an α-naphthol calibration curve

at concentrations from 10 µmol·L−1 to 100 µmol·L−1 (5 calibrators, n = 3, R 2 = 0.999).
Spectrophotometric readings were performed using the 490 nm wavelength [ 43]. The
samples were analyzed using test tubes, and 100 µL of the fermented broth was added to
2 mL of α-naphthyl acetate, then incubated in a water bath at 37 ◦C for 1 h. The reaction
was interrupted by adding 1.0 mL of sodium dodecyl sulfate (10% in sterile water, pH
corrected to 7.0); 1.0 mL of Fast Blue RR was added to reveal the α-naphthol formed, and
the absorbances were determined against a blank containing 100 µL of sterile water.

The flasks were incubated at 50 °C and shaken at 150 rpm for 30 min, and the reaction 
stopped by adding 10 mL of a solution of acetone:ethanol (1:1). The released fatty acids 
were quantified using titration with a standardized NaOH solution (0.05 mol.L−1) and by 
adding three drops of phenolphthalein (0.1% in absolute ethanol) as an indicator. A blank 
was prepared with 1 mL of distilled water. These assays were processed in triplicate and 
the enzyme activity was expressed in units of lipolytic activity (LA) corresponding to the 
number of enzymes capable of providing a micromol of fatty acids per min of reaction. 
Esterase: The esterase activity was estimated using the enzymatic hydrolysis of a 1.5 
mmol.L−1 (alpha) α -naphthyl acetate solution (in a 300 mmol.L −1 phosphate buffer 
containing isopropyl alcohol). The aim was the quantification of α-naphthol, revealed by 
the formation of a diazo -complex after adding Fast Blue RR (0.1 mg.mL −1 in dimethyl 
sulfoxide and ethanol, in a relation of 1:2) (Sigma-Aldrich, Saint Louis, MO, United States) 
(Figure 2). The quantification was determined against an α-naphthol calibration curve at 
concentrations from 10 µmol. L −1 to 100 µmol. L −1 (5 calibrators, n = 3, R 2 = 0.999). 
Spectrophotometric readings were performed using t he 490 nm wavelength [43]. The 
samples were analyzed using test tubes, and 100 µL of the fermented broth was added to 
2 mL of α-naphthyl acetate, then incubated in a water bath at 37 °C for 1 h. The reaction 
was interrupted by adding 1.0 mL of sodium dodec yl sulfate (10% in sterile water, pH 
corrected to 7.0); 1.0 mL of Fast Blue RR was added to reveal the α-naphthol formed, and 
the absorbances were determined against a blank containing 100 µL of sterile water.

followed by an elution gradient, according to Table S1 (supplementary material), in a ﬂow of
0.5 mL ·min−1. The analytes were detected at a wavelength of 254 nm. Benzoic acid
(retention time = 23.4 min) was used as an internal standard. The method was the following:
linearity from 0.15 ppm to 300.0 ppm for PTA, BHET, and MHET, with a correlation
coefﬁcient of 0.999 for the three analytes (6 calibration solutions n = 3); precision determined
by the relative standard deviation (variation coefﬁcient) between 1.1% and 31.1%. The

using the same primers with the following program: 95 ◦C for 1 min followed by 28 cycles
at 95 ◦C for 15 s, 50 ◦C for 45 s, and 60 ◦C. After the reaction, all the samples were removed
for further puriﬁcation and sequenced with the BigDye Terminator (Life Technologies,
Waltham, MA USA) in an ABI3500XL series sequencer (Applied Biosystems, Waltham, MA
USA) according to the manufacturer instructions.
The BioEdit Sequence Alignment Editor v.7.0.5.3 [48] was used to generate the con-
sensus sequence, which was compared with sequences from organisms represented in the
GenBank nucleotide database (National Center for Biotechnology Information (nih.gov)
(accessed on 10 February 2023) and CBS database (Westerdijk Institute (knaw.nl)) (accessed
on 10 February 2023). The sequences of organisms related to the unknown fungi were
selected and used for further genetic distance analysis. After the alignment using the
CLUSTAL X software [49], a phylogenetic tree based on genetic distance was generated
using MEGA software version 4.0 [50] with the neighbor-joining method [51] and bootstrap
values calculated from 1000 replicates. The sequences of the genetic material of the fungi
highlighted in this work were deposited in the GenBank receiving the following accession
numbers: Curvularia trifolii CBMAI 2111 (OL804101); Trichoderma atroviride CBMAI 2073

2.7. Statistical Analyses
The data assumed a non-parametric distribution and were analyzed using the Kruskal–
Wallis test, followed by mean comparison studies with the Student–Newman–Keuls test.
The analyses were performed using the Bioestat 5.3® software (Belém, PA, Brazil), consider-
ing a 95% conﬁdence interval, p ≤0.05.
3. Results
3.1. Enzymatic Assays with PET Nanoparticles
From a total of 100 fungal isolates, 26 produced extracellular enzymes with the po-
tential to convert the polymer nanoparticles into terephthalic acid. Of these, ﬁve strains
exhibited conversion percentages of 2% or higher (Table 5). Table 5 shows the lineages (in
bold) that are part of this study. The selected strains presented good results in the tests
with PET nanoparticles, with a considerable mycelial aggregation to the PET polymer of
bottles during the biodegradation tests.

as the sole carbon sources.Curvularia trifoliiCBMAI 2111 (A) andCladosporium cladosporioides
CBMAI 2075 (D) exhibited colonies with 1.5 cm and 1.8 cm diameters in the presence
of cutin and 3.5 cm and 4.5 cm for the medium with PCL, respectively. In addition, the
decolorization zones were observed in the culture plate with PCL, indicating polymer
degradation (see white arrows). Figure S2 of the supplementary material shows overlays
of FTIR images of the cutin and PCL.
3.3. PET Depolymerization Assays
Due to the growth in cutin and polycaprolactone media and with npPET studies,
the strains T. atroviride CBMAI 2073 and C. cladosporioides CBMAI 2075 were chosen for
further tests with culture media containing different rates of glucose and palm oil as the
sole carbon source. After 40 days of fermentation, a tendency for a mass gain of the PET1
fragments was observed, while the PET2 fragments lost mass in the three tested culture
media (Figure 6). MM1 and PDB showed a greater reduction in the mass of the PET2
polymers for both isolates studied, showing a variation between 1.2 mg and 2.2 mg.
The enzymatic activities were evaluated in the fermented broth (Table 6). T. atroviride
(CBMAI 2073) grown in MM2 showed higher esterase and lipolytic activity on PET1 and
PET2 fragments, respectively. C. cladosporioides CBMAI 2075 had more evident esterase
activity in MM1 and PDB (on PET1), while a higher lipase value was found in MM2 (on
PET2). The activity determined showed high standard deviation, which could be attributed
to the variability in the microorganism growth and enzyme production. Both strains were
able to depolymerize PET in by-products such as terephthalic acid, bis(2-hydroxyethyl)
terephthalate, and 2-hydroxyethyl methyl terephthalate (Figure 7).

3.3. PET Depolymerization Assays 
Due to the growth in cutin and polycaprolactone media and with npPET studies, the 
strains T. atroviride CBMAI 2073 and C. cladosporioides CBMAI 2075 were chosen for further 
tests with culture media  containing different rates of glucose and palm oil as the sole

(light gray) and T. atroviride CBMAI 2073 (dark gray). Data below the x-axis (negative values) 
indicate mass gain at the end of the process. 
The enzymatic activities were evaluated in the fermented broth (Table 6). T. atroviride 
(CBMAI 2073) grown in MM2 showed higher esterase and lipolytic activity on PET1 and 
PET2 fragments, respectively. C. cladosporioides CBMAI 2075 had more evident esterase 
activity in MM1 and PDB (on PET1), while a higher lipase value was found in MM2 (on 
PET2). The activi ty determined showed high standard deviation, which could be 
attributed to the variability in the microorganism growth and enzyme production. Both 
strains were able to depolymerize PET in by -products such as terephthalic acid, bis(2 -
hydroxyethyl) terephthalate, and 2-hydroxyethyl methyl terephthalate (Figure 7). 
The statistical analyses suggested that in the PDB medium, CBMAI 2073 had a greater 
release of the PTA monomer on both PET types (p < 0.05). It was also observed that BHET 
was available in a greater  amount in PDB ( p < 0.05) using PET1, unlike the result for 
MHET, which did not show any significant difference regarding the treatment applied to 
both types of polymers (p > 0.05). 
Figure 8 presents the infrared spectra for PET1 and PET2. In general, CBMA I 2073 
and CBMAI 2075 revealed a greater number of molecular changes for PET2, as seen in 
Table 7. The disappearance of bands was observed in the PET, suggesting a modification 
of the chemical structure. The disappearance of bands was noted at the region of 983 cm−1, 
962 cm−1, and 835 cm−1, which could be related to the aromatic ring. The bands at the region 
of 1481 and 1427 cm−1 could be related to stretching of the C-O group, and deformation of 
the O-H group. The vibration of the aromatic skeleton (C = C) could be attributed to the 
band at 1579 cm−1.

The statistical analyses suggested that in the PDB medium, CBMAI 2073 had a greater
release of the PTA monomer on both PET types (p < 0.05). It was also observed that BHET
was available in a greater amount in PDB (p < 0.05) using PET1, unlike the result for MHET,
which did not show any signiﬁcant difference regarding the treatment applied to both
types of polymers (p > 0.05).
Figure 8 presents the infrared spectra for PET1 and PET2. In general, CBMAI 2073
and CBMAI 2075 revealed a greater number of molecular changes for PET2, as seen in
Table 7. The disappearance of bands was observed in the PET, suggesting a modiﬁcation of
the chemical structure. The disappearance of bands was noted at the region of 983 cm−1,
962 cm −1, and 835 cm −1, which could be related to the aromatic ring. The bands at
the region of 1481 and 1427 cm −1 could be related to stretching of the C-O group, and
deformation of the O-H group. The vibration of the aromatic skeleton (C=C) could be
attributed to the band at 1579 cm−1.
Fewer modiﬁcations were observed with PET1 (Table 7). The fermentation of CBMAI
2073 showed an increase in band intensity at 1579 cm−1 and 1573 cm−1, band displacement
from 630 cm−1 to 632 cm−1, band appearance at 613 cm −1, and band disappearance at

1579 cm−1 and 1573 cm−1.

A total of 26 strains showed the potential to enzymatically hydrolyze PET nanopar-
ticles. The strains with the ability to depolymerize are known to be good producers of
hydrolases such as lipases, esterases, and cutinases [52].
The preliminary use of npPET to test the enzymatic activity was addressed to select
the representatives that produce polyester hydrolases. In general, nanoparticles have a high
ratio of exposed surface by volume occupied, which allows for greater enzymatic access
compared to other structural forms such as ﬁlms or ﬁbers [53]. Using the high-throughput
screening test (HTS), six strains with values above 2% of npPET conversion were identi-
Polymers 2023, 15, 1581 17 of 24
ﬁed, while the best results in previous works were limited to 1%, except for a strain of
Trichoderma sp. L1239 with 7.1% [30].
In this screening, four isolates were selected for further analysis: Curvularia trifolii
CBMAI 2111, Trichoderma sp. CBMAI 2071, Trichoderma atroviride CBMAI 2073, and
Cladosporium cladosporioides CBMAI 2075 (Table 2). The selection was based on the best
results of the NPPET analysis and for presenting strong mycelial adhesion to the PET-bottle
polymer, as per the preliminary tests reported for strains Microsphaeropsis arundinis CBMAI
2109 and CBMAI 2110 [18].
The evaluation of the enzymatic activities of the selected strains on short (two car-
bons) and long (eight carbons) esteriﬁed ﬂuorescent probes was previously performed
(Table S1). In general, it was observed that the strains did not show good results for this
former type of tested probe (two and eight carbons) with conversion rates below 50%
according to the criteria established by Malafatti-Picca et al. [18]. The strain T. sp. CBMAI
2071, for example, was not able to convert the probes under the conditions tested (Table S1),
showing no conversion for probes (substrates) with two and eight carbons. However, these
data corroborate those found by Yoshida et al. (2016) [21], who identiﬁed a new bacterial
species, Ideonella sakaiensis, capable of adhering to the PET surface and secreting enzymes
characterized as cutinase-like (PETases), which assimilated the PET polymer in preference
to other substrates.
Plate tests with minimal mineral media containing cutin and polycaprolactone (MM
10,000 g·mol−1) were performed with the selected isolates (Figure 6) and revealed their
ability to assimilate both polymers. Nimchua et al. [19] used a minimal medium with PCL
in the isolation of enzyme-producing ﬁlamentous fungi, which increased the hydrophilicity
of PET ﬁbers. Polycaprolactone is considered an analog of cutin, an insoluble biopolyester
and structural component of plant cuticles [ 35]. Figure S2 of the supplementary mate-
rial overlays the FTIR spectra of these polymers and indicates similarity between the
two compounds.
The genera Curvularia [54], Cladosporium [55], and Trichoderma [56] contain plant
pathogen species but also others that beneﬁt the growth of many plants. They are ubiquitous
with representatives that are considered “indoor fungi”, and well-known for producing
different enzymes [57]. The literature reports the presence of genes encoding cutinase in
the genome of representatives of Curvularia lunata, Trichoderma reesei, and Cladosporium
fulvum [58–60]. The results obtained herein by the qualitative test in plates were consistent
and justiﬁed the afﬁnity of these enzymes with the NPPET substrate and their low afﬁnity
with the esteriﬁed ﬂuorogenic probes, which agrees with the data reported by Yoshida
et al. [21]. However, it is important to highlight that a more in-depth investigation of the
type of enzyme produced by the selected strains is recommended.
Although the nanoparticles are considered structurally favorable to the enzymatic
action when aiming at the depolymerization of PET, they do not correspond to the ﬁnal
disposition of the polymer. The transformation of all PET to be recycled into nanoparticles to
undergo enzymatic hydrolysis could also be a good alternative; however, this process may
use halogenated or metallic organic solvents that are miscible in water and unsafe for the
environment [61]. Therefore, further tests were carried out with the most promising strains
on PET bottle fragments, which is the structure most found in different environments.
The present investigation used two types of polymers denominated PET1 and PET2.
The former comes from the “plant bottle” technology and uses 30% of PET derived from
sugar cane, referring to mono-ethylene glycol (MEG) and called BioMEG [ 62]. The sec-
ond uses conventional technology based on non-renewable fossil resources as precursors.
Table 2 shows the different crystallinity percentages determined using DSC analyses: 35.47%
and 10.41% (PET1 and PET2, respectively). Wei and Zimmerman [63] reported that PET
from bottles and ﬁbers with a high degree of crystallinity (above 30%) represent the most
abundant type of post-consumer polymer and may not be readily hydrolyzed efﬁciently in
enzymatic processes. The “plant bottle” technology manufacturer reports that the biodegra-
dation of the polymer does not differ from conventional technologies; however, some
Polymers 2023, 15, 1581 18 of 24
studies showed greater enzymatic degradation efﬁciency for polymers with crystallinity of
around 10% [24,64].
The strains T. atroviride CBMAI 2073 and C. cladosporioides CBMAI 2075 were chosen
to test the culture medium that best favored PET depolymerization. Among the media
tested (MM1, MM2, and PDB—Table 3), both strains expressed better activities in PDB,
promoting the depolymerization of PET into PTA and BHET with a signiﬁcant difference
at the 95% conﬁdence level ( p < 0.05). Both the minimal mineral medium [ 65–67] and
those rich in glucose [68] have been used in polymer biodegradation or depolymerization
studies. In this study, the parameters used to evaluate the polymer degradation were mass
variation, FTIR spectra, and scanning electron microscopy images. In the fermented broth,
concentrations of monomers (PTA) and oligomers (BHET and MHET) were measured, as
well as enzymatic activities.
As most studies on biodegradation apply mass variation to assess the effect of strains
on the polymer [36,69,70], it was also included here, but the results were considered incon-
sistent (Figures 7 and 10). El-Saffei et al. [71] also considered this approach inconclusive as
mass gain may occur either by the adhesion of the mycelia to the fragment or the oxidation
or water absorption of the culture medium.
The PET recalcitrance characteristics discourage depolymerization studies, causing
little information to be available in the literature on polymer analyses using FTIR. According
to Holland and Hay [72] and Vijayakumar and Rajakumar [73], the spectra from bottles
must contain some vibrations from groups that conﬁrm the presence of important chemical
bonds functioning as “ﬁngerprints” for that material. They may be 1713 cm−1 (presence
of carbonyl group C=O conjugated to the aromatic ring), 1234 cm−1 (asymmetric C-C-O
stretching involving carbon in the aromatic ring), 728 cm−1 (aromatic ring C-H movement
outside the plane), 872 cm −1 (C-H stretching of the aromatic ring outside the plane),
1128 cm−1 and 1091 cm−1 (O-C-C split asymmetric stretching), 2960 cm −1 (asymmetric
stretching of C-H), 1505 cm−1 (aromatic ring C-C stretching), 1453 cm−1 (deviation/folding
of C-H), and bands at 1408 cm −1 and 1339 cm−1 (C-H deformation of the alkane). The
vibrations, stretching, and folding may vary from 0.5 cm−1 to 1.5 cm−1 on average. The
treatments with C. trifolii CBMAI 2111, T. sp. CBMAI 2071, T. atroviride CBMAI 2073, and
C. cladosporioides CBMAI 2075 led to changes at various points of the spectrum in the
regions mentioned above (Figures 9 and 11). Analyzing Penicillium spp. and PET, Nowak
et al. [70] and Yamada-Onodera et al. [74] obtained similar results to those found in this
work. After studying the biodegradation of polyethylene, Jumaah [75] concluded that some
modiﬁcations observed using FTIR indicate the microbial action on the recalcitrant element.
This is considered a good result because it reveals that a strain capable of promoting such
modiﬁcations (albeit small) may also synergistically interact with others, approaching the
mineralization of the compound. It was clear that the FTIR spectra of PET2 in treatments
with the most promising strains (C. trifolii CBMAI 2111, T. sp. CBMAI 2071, T. atroviride
CBMAI 2073, and C. cladosporioides CBMAI 2075) were more likely to have molecular
changes than PET1 samples, thus showing that they are better degraded by the strains. The
results from Table 4 highlight the high crystallinity of PET1, which would proportionally
have a smaller amount of the polymer in its amorphous form and is preferred for the
enzymatic action of hydrolases [76].
The enzymatic activities quantiﬁed after the fermentation of PET1 and PET2 with all
strains studied (Tables 6 and 8) proved the production of extracellular enzymes (lipases
and esterases), which could act on the polymer. The wide use of Trichoderma strains to
produce industrial biomolecules is well-known and scientiﬁcally reported as one of the
most promising genera for biotechnology. The better lipase and esterase activities observed
in the fermented broth of CBMAI 2071 was expected (Table 8). On the contrary, the good
performance of CBMAI 2111 (Curvularia trifolii) was considered a novelty for this species.
According to Yamada-Onodera [74], extracellular biological catalysts produced by hyphae
may help in the rapid degradation of polymers. Hiraga et al. [23] consider it is important
Polymers 2023, 15, 1581 19 of 24
to elucidate the mechanisms of cell adhesion to polymers, as it is certainly what could
implement the PET biodegradation process.
To conﬁrm the PET depolymerization, the determination of monomers and oligomers
is the most important among the evaluated parameters since they are the by-products that
will originate new bottles. This approach meets the needs of the current recycling context
and allows the selection of strains with greater effectiveness in the depolymerization of
this material.
The quantiﬁcation of monomers and oligomers is a difﬁcult task as it may involve a
slow process such as the assimilation of a polymer by the microorganism [77]. The previous
experiments carried out using chromatographic determinations of PTA in fermented broth
without pre-concentration led to quantiﬁcation data below the established limit for chro-
matographic separation under the conditions established for this work. Pre-concentration
strategies such as liquid-liquid extraction are often necessary to increase analyte recovery
and result in reliability [44].
In this research, the chromatographic separation of the PTA, BHET, and MHET analytes
was achieved after liquid–liquid extraction by reverse-phase high-performance liquid
chromatography. The results showed that the strains under study were able to convert
the PET1 and PET2 fragments into concentrations of terephthalic acid monomer (PTA)
between 12 ppm and 45 ppm (for PET1) and between 17 ppm and 55 ppm (for PET2).
Considering the visible increase in microbial biomass, it is possible that the fungi tested
may have assimilated the mobilized compounds (PTA, BHET, and MHET) as reported by
Gong et al. [ 78], thus the concentration of monomers and oligomers released from PET
were possibly higher.
Some previous works that evaluated PET biodegradation/depolymerization often
used microbial enzymes and the biocatalysis promoted by isolated enzymes. The process
was improved by applying the polymer with different physical characteristics (amorphous
PET and low-crystallinity product). Zhang et al. [ 79] demonstrated the degradation of
PET ﬁbers mediated by unidentiﬁed microorganisms (synergism between bacteria and
fungi) with conversions into terephthalic acid at concentrations between 0.3 ppm and
3.0 ppm. Danso et al. [ 13] evaluated the biodegradation potential of an enzyme from
the marine environment using a metagenomic approach (called PET 2 in their work) on
14 mg of amorphous PET and obtained 900 µM (149 ppm) of terephthalic acid after 24 h.
Another study used isolated cutinases produced by Thermobiﬁda fusca (TfCut2) (Actinobac-
teria) and recombinant cutinases (TfCut2 G62A/F209A) designed based on the cutinase
gene sequence of Ideonella sakaiensis. In the presence of a cationic surfactant, the cutinases
degraded low-crystallinity (3% to 5%) PET with 200 µm thickness and PET with high
crystallinity (40%) and 190 µm thickness. The polymer studied was obtained commercially,
corresponding to a very homogeneous material [80]. The strains studied in this work are
considered highly promising for PET depolymerization when the results are compared
with those reported in the literature. The highlights of this study may be listed as follows:
1. the application of microbial strains as whole cells under room temperature (approxi-
mately 28 ◦C); 2. PET samples from commercial bottles, thus corresponding to heteroge-
neous material with different crystallinities; and 3. there are no reports of PET biodegrada-
tion capacity for the fungal species identiﬁed here except for C. cladosporioides [25], which
highlights the novelty of the data obtained.
A hypothesis for the promising result of the Trichoderma atroviridestrain CBMAI 2073
is based on Espino-Hammer et al. [81], who reported that some species of Trichoderma can
produce class II hydrophobin molecules that stimulate the activity of cutinases on PET.
Although analysis using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) is usually considered
only qualitative to evaluate the effects of microbial growth on polymers [82], its use was con-
sidered highly valuable here. The images obtained (Figure 11) clearly indicated that the four
selected strains were able to promote structural changes on the material and corroborated
the results obtained in the other analyses carried out in the present investigation.
Polymers 2023, 15, 1581 20 of 24
The work with the selected strains enabled us to gain insights into important appli-
cations in PET depolymerization. It is recommended that further studies focus on the
isolation, identiﬁcation, and use of these enzymes in biodegradation assays, in addition to
promoting synergistic interactions between the isolates to try to optimize this process.
5. Conclusions
Considering that this work aimed to elucidate important points, better guide PET
biodegradation studies, which are scarce, and highlight the fungal strains with the potential
to assimilate the polymer, the contributions are as follows: between the two types of PET
addressed in this study, the material with the highest crystallinity (here called PET1) showed
greater resistance to enzymatic action. Trichoderma sp. CBMAI 2071, Trichoderma atroviride
CBMAI 2073, Cladosporium cladosporioides CBMAI 2075, and Curvularia trifolii CBMAI 2111
are possible cutinase-producers because they can grow in a culture medium with cutin and
polycaprolactone as the sole carbon sources, according to qualitative analyses. Compared
to other culture media, Potato Dextrose Broth (PDB) favored the conversion of Polyethylene
Terephthalate into PTA, BHET, and MHET during fermentation with the strainsTrichoderma
sp. CBMAI 2071 and C. cladosporioides CBMAI 2075. The studied strains Trichoderma sp.
CBMAI 2071, Trichoderma atrovirideCBMAI 2073, Cladosporium cladosporioides CBMAI 2075,
and Curvularia trifolii CBMAI 2111 showed action on depolymerization according to the
analysis of the enzymatic activities and the release of monomers (concentrations above
12 ppm) and oligomers (concentrations above 0.6 ppm) in the fermented liquid. They are
also capable of promoting important changes in the chemical structure and surface of the
polymer (according to FTIR and SEM). The evaluation of mass variation, however, seems
to be an inconclusive parameter of inconstant results.
