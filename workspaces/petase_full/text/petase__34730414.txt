ABSTRACT Cutinases are enzymes produced by phytopathogenic fungi like
Moniliophthora roreri. The three genome-located cutinase genes of M. roreri were
ampliﬁed from cDNA of fungi growing in different induction culture media for cuti-
nase production. Themrcut1 gene was expressed in the presence of a cacao cuticle,
while the mrcut2 and mrcut3 genes were expressed when an apple cuticle was used
as the inducer. The sequences of all genes were obtained and analyzed by bioinfor-
matics tools to determine the presence of signal peptides, introns, glycosylation,
and regulatory sequences. Also, the theoretical molecular weight and pI were
obtained and experimentally conﬁrmed. Finally, cutinase 1 fromM. roreri (MRCUT1)
was selected for heterologous expression in Escherichia coli. Successful overexpres-
sion of MRCUT1 was observed with the highest enzyme activity of 34,036 U/mg
under the assay conditions at 40°C and pH 8. Furthermore, the degradation of dif-
ferent synthetic polyesters was evaluated; after 21 days, 59% of polyethylene succi-
nate (PES), 43% of polycaprolactone (PCL), and 31% of polyethylene terephthalate
(PET) from plastic residues were degraded.
IMPORTANCE Plastic pollution is exponentially increasing; even the G20 has recog-
nized an urgent need to implement actions to reduce it. In recent years, searching
for enzymes that can degrade plastics, especially those based on polyesters such as
PET, has been increasing as they can be a green alternative to the actual plastic deg-
radation process. A promising option in recent years refers to biological tools such
as enzymes involved in stages of partial and even total degradation of some plastics.
In this context, the MRCUT1 enzyme can degrade polyesters contained in plastic resi-
dues in a short time. Besides, there is limited knowledge about the biochemical
properties of cutinases from M. roreri. Commonly, fungal enzymes are expressed as
inclusion bodies in E. coli with reduced activity. Interestingly, the successful expres-
sion of one cutinase ofM. roreri in E. coli with enhanced activity is described.
KEYWORDS cutinase, Moniliophthora roreri, polyester degradation
C
utinases (EC 3.1.1.74) are carboxylic ester hydrolases that carry out the hydrolysis
of a lipid polymer called cutin, a structural component of plants (1, 2). Cutin is a
lipidic polymer of the plant cuticle formed by hydroxylated epoxy fatty acids of 16 and
18 carbons linked by ester bonds (3). Some bacteria such asBacillus subtilis, Citrobacter,
Enterobacter, and actinomycetes such asMycobacterium and Streptomyces; yeasts such
as Candida tropicalis; and many phytopathogenic fungi from the generaAspergillus,
Fusarium, Trichoderma, and Moniliophthora has been shown to produce cutinases
(4–8). More than one cutinase gene has been found in phytopathogenic fungal
genomes. For example,Fusarium solanipossesses two,Monilia fructicola contains four,
and Moniliophthora roreri has three putative cutinase genes in their genome (8–12). In
Aspergillus nidulans, four cutinase genes are located in the genome, two of which have
been studied and characterized: ANCUT1 with esterase activity and ANCUT2 with

additional cutinase activity (9, 10). In fact, it has been demonstrated that recombinant
cutinases fromA. nidulanscan efﬁciently degrade polyesters (13).
Moniliasis disease of cacao crops is caused by the biotrophic or hemibiotrophic fun-
gus M. roreri. To destroy the plant tissue causing necrosis, the production of several
enzymes and toxins is essential. InM. roreri, several enzymatic activities in media with
different carbon sources have been previously reported (12).
Cutinases have various applications in the food industry, particularly in oils, fats,
and ﬂavors (1). Besides, they have been used in other industries such as detergents
and fur (14). They have also been valuable for degrading contaminating compounds
such as polyesters and pesticides (14, 15). Plastics are long-persisting synthetic poly-
mers like polyesters. Plastic pollution is exponentially increasing; even the G20 has rec-
ognized an urgent need to implement actions to reduce marine litter, especially ma-
rine plastic litter and microplastics (16). The amount of plastic waste before the
coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic was 4.8 million to 12.7 million metric
tons; nevertheless, due to the contingency and the new use of N95 masks made of
polypropylene (PP) and polyethylene terephthalate (PET) and in the same way the use
of surgical gloves, there is a probability that the number of microplastics will increase
in aquifer mantles (17). Chemical and physical methods have been used for plastic ma-
terial degradation; however, some polymers are resistant to these methods and are
harmful to the environment (18). A promising emergent solution to plastic pollution is
the enzymatic degradation of polyesters contained in recalcitrant plastics like PET or
even in biodegradable plastics like polycaprolactone (PCL) and polyethylene succinate
(PES) (19–23). Biological treatments involving microorganisms and enzymes for plastic
waste degradation are being evaluated (18, 19, 24).
Cutinases are valuable enzymes, which are emerging tools for the decontamination
of plastic residues (24). Recently, a synergistic system composed ofMicrobacterium olei-
vorans JWG-G2 and theThermobiﬁda fusca cutinase was used to degrade bis(hydrox-
yethyl)terephthalate (BHET) and a PETﬁlm, obtaining terephthalic acid (TPA) and ter-
ephthalate mono(2-hydroxyethyl) (MHET) as a result (16). This work describes the
heterologous expression of a cutinase of the cacao phytopathogenic fungusM. roreri
in Escherichia coli, besides their characterization and polyester degradation capacity.
RESULTS

(cDNA) was synthesized from the different extracted RNAs and used as a template for
reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) with cutinase-speciﬁc primers, and themrcut1 cuti-
nase gene was expressed in minimum medium that contained a cacao inducer. The
amplicon size obtained was approximately 600 bp, which was expected by the theoreti-
cally calculated value (558 bp) without introns (Fig. 1B). The genes encoding the MRCUT2
and MRCUT3 enzymes expressed in minimum medium with apple cuticle have lengths of
500 and 600 bp, respectively; these molecular sizes are not consistent with the theoreti-
cally expected deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) size, probably due to the presence of introns.
Next, themrcut1 gene for the cutinaseESK97883.1
(GenBank) was chosen for subsequent
experiments with UniProt accesion numberWG66_16246.
Data from the bioinformatic analysis of themrcut1 gene are displayed in Fig. 2.
The cutinase gene has a signal peptide from amino acids 1 to 18, containingﬁve
introns. The mature protein has 185 amino acids with a theoretical molecular
weight of 19.28 kDa and a pI of 5.17. The canonical catalytic triad from all carboxylic
acid ester hydrolases is observed; it is formed by serine 120, which is contained in
the consensus pentapeptide of serine hydrolases (G-Y-S-Q-G); aspartic acid 172;
and histidine 185. It is important to mention that the Kozak consensus sequence for
a translation initiation site was observed for themrcut1 gene, which means that a
purine (A) is present 3 bases upstream of the start codon (AUG) at positions 1 to 3,
followed by a guanine (G) (25) (Fig. 2). Moreover, the glycosylation protein predic-
tion analysis displayed no N-glycosylated sites and only one O-glycosylated site at
serine 95.
The evolutionary relationship betweenM. rorericutinases and others from different
microorganisms was investigated by constructing a phylogenetic tree using the cuti-
nase sequences retrieved from GenBank. The results revealed that allM. rorericutinases
are clustered in the same branch (Fig. 3).
Overexpression of themrcut1 gene inE. coli. The mrcut1 gene was successfully
inserted into the pET22b vector. Next, pET22mrcut1 was puriﬁed and used for the
transformation ofE. coliBL21. PCR with T7 universal primers corroborated the presence
of the insert. The amplicons obtained showed a size of between 750 and 1,000 bp, cor-
responding to the theoretical one (890 bp). After bioinformatics analysis, the amplicon
sequence displayed high similarity (98%) with the cutinase gene ofM. roreriMCA 2997
in the NCBI database under accession numberESK97883
. Themrcut1 gene was also in
the correct open reading frame.
A 4-h induction with IPTG (isopropylb-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside) was done, and
the protein proﬁle after cell breakage was determined by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 4A). One
intense band of approximately 23 kDa was observed, within situ activity detected by
zymography (Fig. 4B) and conﬁrmed by Western blotting (Fig. 4C).
MRCUT1 production was monitored for 5 h, and its activity was quantiﬁed by the
hydrolysis of p-nitrophenyl acetate (p-PNA) (Fig. 5). A maximum peak at 3 h of induc-
tion was observed, which was established as the optimal time of induction of the
recombinant protein MRCUT1. The highest speciﬁc activity under the evaluated condi-
tions was 34,036 U/mg. The optimum temperature of MRCUT1 was 40°C, and the opti-
mum pH was 8 under the evaluated conditions (Fig. 6).
Polyester degradation. Polyester degradation was evaluated by two techniques,
with similar results. The highest level of degradation was observed after 21 days when
PES was used as the substrate: 43% as determined by weight loss and 16.2 ml by titra-
tion. In the PET bottles, 31% degradation was obtained by weight loss, and 13 ml was
obtained by titration. In the PCL degradation assay, 59% was obtained by weight loss,
and 13.91 ml was obtained by titration (Fig. 7).
Finally, a scanning electron microscopy (SEM) evaluation of PETﬁlms was done
(Fig. 8). We detected the degradation of PETﬁlms treated with MRCUT1, which was
observed as holes with scraped edges and eroded surfaces (Fig. 8B). In contrast, the
surface looked smooth with the control PET, with only cracks belonging to the original
PET (Fig. 8A).

DISCUSSION
M. rorericontains several cutinase genes, as reported for other fungi likeAspergillus
nidulans and Fusarium solani (24, 26). We found that the genome ofM. roreri encodes
three cutinases that are induced under different conditions.mrcut1 is induced with co-
coa cuticle. In contrast,mrcut2 and mrcut3 are induced with apple cuticle and olive oil,
respectively. The results obtained in the presence of cocoa cuticles follow previous
work that reported the transcriptional expression of themrcut1 gene in medium sup-
plemented with cocoa pod shells (12). In the case ofmrcut2 and mrcut3, gene expres-
sion was not previously reported.

Interestingly,M. rorericutinase expression is similar to that observed for other phytopa-
thogenic fungi such asA. nidulans, whose cutinases are also differentially expressed; for
example,ancut2 was detected only in the presence of olive oil (9, 10). After gene isolation,
the sequencing results displayed that themrcut1gene has no introns. However, themrcut2
gene has retained 2 introns from 3, andmrcut3kept 1 from 5; thisﬁnding could be a conse-
quence of alternative splicing, as has been observed for other enzyme genes (27). It would
be interesting to clone the obtainedmrcut2and mrcut3genes to establish the differences in
their biochemical properties and reaction speciﬁcities.
The phylogenetic analysis displayed that all cutinases ofM. roreriwere grouped in the
same clade, with MRCUT1 and MRCUT2 being more related (55% similarity). Moreover,
both enzymes contain almost the same numbers of amino acids (203 and 198, respec-
tively), while MRCUT3 contains only 127 amino acids. It is important to mention that all
M. rorericutinases are related to other fungal cutinases that contain 4 cysteines, such as
the cutinase fromA. nidulansunder GenBank accession numberCBF83913.1.
The enzyme MRCUT1 with GenBank accesion numberKTB31184.1 was chosen for
cloning and was successfully overexpressed inE. coli, as shown in Fig. 4Aas an intense
wide band of approximately 23 kDa; this was conﬁrmed by thein situ esterase activity
with MUF (4-methylumbelliferone)-butyrate as the substrate (Fig. 4B). Additionally,
recombinant cutinase expression was conﬁrmed by Western blotting with anti-His tag

neighbor-joining method (56). The optimal tree with the sum of the length of the branch is 9.31922869. The
percentage of repetitions in which the associated taxa are grouped in the bootstrap test (10,000 repetitions) of trees is
shown next to the branches (48).

antibodies (Fig. 4C). These results agree with the theoretical molecular weight of the
protein of interest (21.8 kDa) after the correct processing of thepelB signal peptide.
Once overexpression was corroborated, kinetic MRCUT1 production was determined.
The maximum speciﬁc activity under the evaluated conditions was 34,036 U/mg after 3 h
of induction. Interestingly, this value is higher than those of other fungal cutinases over-
expressed inE. coli,s u c ha st h ec u t i n a s eo fThermobiﬁda fusca(167.4 U/mg) considering
p-NPA as the substrate, even after improvingT. fuscacutinase expression was done (21,
28, 29). Su and collaborators obtained 1,063.5 U/ml after cloning the truncated version
of the extracellularT. fuscacutinase without the signal peptide, obtaining higher speciﬁc
activity and the extracellular release of the enzyme (30). In this work, we have cloned
MRCUT1 without a signal peptide, also with high speciﬁc activity, but most of the
enzyme, as expected, was intracellularly located. The correct processing of thepelB signal
peptide and folding of the enzyme can contribute to the observed high enzyme activity.
The ﬁnding is also successfully unexpected for a eucaryotic cutinase gene expressed in a
procaryotic system. Fungal cutinases can be glycosylated, which impedes enzyme aggregation

and improves its stabilization; however, for MRCUT1, only one predicted glycosylation site was
found (serine 95). Besides, the activity in the recombinant enzyme was not committed, which
indicates that this modiﬁcation is not necessary for MRCUT1, and it is probably not present in
t h en a t i v ee n z y m e( 2 1 ) .
High enzymatic activity is observed even under no-induction conditions; this follows
other reports where the expression of recombinant enzymes under no-induction condi-
tions has been observed, known as leakage phenomena (21, 29, 30–31). Another possibil-
ity is that cutinases can partially hydrolyze the phospholipids in theE. colimembrane (31).
MRCUT1 has an optimum temperature of 40°C and an optimum pH of 8, similar to
the results obtained for cutinases of otherﬁlamentous fungi such asFusarium solani,
Alternaria brassicicola, and Aspergillus nidulans (9, 11, 32). Fungal cutinases having six
cysteines are thermostable; in this case, as shown in Fig. 2, MRCUT1 contained four cys-
teines forming two disulﬁde bonds, and it is not thermostable (9) (Fig. 6).

Finally, in recent years, enzymatic modiﬁcation of synthetic polymers has been increas-
ingly studied because of the prolonged environmental persistence of these materials (33).
Replacing harsh chemicals with enzymes is an environmentally friendly technique for
polymer waste treatment (34). Biodegradability is a crucial characteristic of aliphatic poly-
ester materials (PES and PCL), which are widely used in injection-molded products and
the pharmaceutical and biomedical industries and recently for 3D (three-dimensional)
printing materials; however, research about the biocatalytic degradation of these materi-
als is scarce (23, 35). On the other side, aromatic polyesters (PET) are recalcitrant, and their
residue accumulation is increasing at an alarming rate (36). We explored the possibility of
using recombinant MRCUT1 for the degradation of PES, PCL, and PET. Our results demon-
strate that recombinant MRCUT1 can efﬁciently hydrolyze biodegradable polyesters like
PES and PCL; however, it can also degrade long-persistence polyesters like PET in residues
of water storage bottles in 21 days. After 6 days, PESﬁlms can be almost totally degraded
(95%) by recombinantF. solanicutinase but cannot be degraded by polyhydroxybutyrate
depolymerase fromAspergillus fumigatus(23, 37). MRCUT1 cutinase can degrade 43% af-
ter 21 days. For PCL, biodegradation is slower because of its high hydrophobicity and
degree of crystallinity; MRCUT1 degrades 59% after 21 days, and similar results were
obtained in compost where the fungusA. fumigatuswas the most abundant microorgan-
ism found (22). A recent study displayed PCLﬁlm degradation after usingCandida antarc-
tica lipase andF. solanicutinase; it has been found that weight loss reached 87.56% and
80.8%, respectively, after 72 h (38).
Furthermore, 31% degradation of PETﬁlm, which is highly crystallized from com-
mercial bottles, was obtained by weight loss after 21 days. It was corroborated by SEM
images, which showed eroded surfaces and holes in samples treated with the recombi-
nant cutinase MRCUT1. Compared with other enzymes that have demonstrated efﬁ-
cient PET ﬁlm degradation, such as theIdeonella sakaiensis PETase (IsPETase), or cuti-
nase from leaf-branch compost (LC-cutinase), the MRCUT1 cutinase has a promising
capacity (39, 40). Those enzymes initially showed results similar to those of MRCUT1
and better results after improving protein engineering or reaction parameters (40–42).
For example, atﬁrst, Ideonella sakaiensishad a PETﬁlm weight loss of less than 20% in
20 days, and recently, after using improved consensus protein engineering, the degradation
activity for amorphous PET was increased by almost 40-fold in comparison with the wild
type at 40°C in 24 h (40, 41). The LC-cutinase initially could degrade 1.45 mg in 24 h from a
20- to 25-mg PETﬁlm, and after using computer-aided enzyme engineering of LC-cutinase,
an improvement of enzyme-catalyzed PET depolymerization to 90% conversion in less than
10 h was obtained (39, 42). We must take advantage of the fact that this recombinant
enzyme is expressed in large quantities and with high activity in this expression system.
Conclusions. The mature cutinase MRCUT1 of M. roreri was successfully overex-
pressed in E. coli with enhanced speciﬁc activity even under no-induction conditions.
MRCUT1 is a new alternative enzyme for the efﬁcient degradation ofﬁlms of plastic

residues from aliphatic polyesters (PES and PCL) and aromatic polyesters (PET) contained
in plastic bottles, indicating its environmental applicability for plastic reduction in an eco-
friendly manner. New enzymes are needed for plastic depolymerization; this work further
acknowledges polyester degradation by cutinases. It is important to mention that this is
the ﬁrst report of polyesterﬁlm degradation by MRCUT1 cutinase. Consequently, the
enzyme MRCUT1 can be a suitable candidate for future protein engineering, looking for
high-level and short-time eﬃcient polyester degradation under extreme conditions.
Besides, reaction parameters such as pH, temperature, enzyme quantity, substrate avail-
ability, or the addition of surfactants must be evaluated for better polyester degradation.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Microorganisms. M. roreri was previously isolated from cacao pods (12). E. coli BL21 [F2 ompT
hsdSB(rB
2 mB
2) gal dcm(DE3)] and plasmid pET22b1 from the pET system (Novagen) were purchased.
Microorganism growth. Liquid minimum induction medium (50 ml) in 250-ml Erlenmeyerﬂasks
was inoculated with 1 /C2108 spores/ml of M. roreri. The medium contained salts (KNO3 at 6 g/liter,
K2HPO4 at 1.5 g/liter, MgSO4/C17H2O at 0.5 g/liter, FeSO4/C17H2O at 0.002 g/liter, ZnSO4/C17H2O at 0.002 g/liter,
and MgCl2/C17H2O at 0.002 g/liter), dextrose (0.5%), and an induction source at 1% (apple cuticle, cacao cu-
ticle, or olive oil). Cultures were incubated at 27°C in an orbital shaker at 300 rpm for 4 days.
E. coli BL21 was inoculated in Luria-Bertani (LB) medium. Brieﬂy, 20mlo f E. coli cultures was added
to obtain an optical density at 600 nm (OD600) of 0.9 to 10-ml assay tubes containing 5 ml of LB broth.
Cultures were incubated at 37°C in an orbital shaker at 250 rpm for 12 h.
Cuticle extraction. The cuticle was obtained according to the method described previously by
Castro-Ochoa et al. (9).
RNA isolation and cDNA synthesis.Fresh mycelium fromM. roreri was frozen by immersion in liq-
uid nitrogen, ground to a powder in a prechilled mortar, and stored at280°C until RNA extraction. RNA
was extracted with TRIzol according to the provider’s protocol (Invitrogen), treated with DNase (Thermo
Fisher) according to the manufacturer’s instructions, and used as the template for cDNA synthesis with
the cDNA cycle kit according to manual instructions (Thermo Fisher). The reaction mixture was incu-
bated for 5 min at 25°C for cDNA synthesis and then for 60 min at 42°C and 5 min at 70°C.
Primers and PCR conditions for cutinase gene ampliﬁcation. The three cutinase genes ofM. roreri
were ampliﬁed withTaq PCR polymerase (Invitrogen) and three pairs of the designed primers described
in Table 1. EcoRI/NotI restriction sites were introduced into each cutinase gene ofM. roreri.The following
program was used: 1 cycle at 94°C for 5 min followed by 35 cycles of 94°C for 40 s, 55°C for 40 s, and
72°C for 1 min; 1 cycle at 72°C for 10 min; and,ﬁnally, a storage step at 4°C.
Bioinformatic tools.According to the provided instructions, amplicons were gel puriﬁed with a DNA
clean and concentrator kit (Zymo Research). Puriﬁed PCR products were sequenced at the USSDNA at
Biotechnology Institute (UNAM) in a PE Applied Biosystems 121 automated DNA sequencer (model 3130xl).
The internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region and the three isolated genes were analyzed using the NCBI
database (Basic Local Alignment Search Tool). Signal peptide analysis was performed using SignalP 5.0 soft-
ware (43), and the presence of introns in the sequences was determined with the Multaline program (44).
Glycosylation prediction analysis was done with the NetNGlyc 1.0 server and the NetOGlyc 4.0 server (45, 46).
Restriction analysis was performed with Nebcutter software (47). Phylogenetic analysis was performed with
MEGA 6 with 1,000 replicates (48). The sequences used and their GenBank accession numbers (in parenthe-

from Mycobacterium colombiense(EJO88404), cutinase fromStreptomyces scabiei(WP_013005307.1), cuti-
nase from Alternaria alternata(XP_018379037), and cutinase fromThermobiﬁda fusca (CBY05529). These
sequences were aligned using ClustalW (49).
Expression inEscherichia coli. (i) Cloning of themrcut1 gene in the pET22b vector.The plasmid
pET22b1 and themrcut1 cutinase gene were digested with NotI and EcoRI restriction enzymes (Thermo
Fisher) and then ligated with T4 ligase (Thermo Fisher) according to the manufacturer’s instructions to
obtain the pET-mrcut1 recombinant vector.
(ii) E. coli BL21 transformation.Competent E. coli BL21 cells were elaborated as described by pro-
vider in the Novagen pET expression system manual, transformed by a chemical method with CaCl2, and
cultured on LB-ampicillin agar plates (50). Ampicillin-resistant colonies were grown in liquid LB-ampicil-
lin medium. The pET expression system manual describes colony PCR, which we have done with the spe-
ciﬁc primers described in Table 1 to corroborate the gene insertion.
(iii) Induction ofmrcut1 gene expression.The selected clones were grown in 5 ml of LB broth until
an OD600 of 0.6 to 0.9 was reached (precultured cells). For induction, a 250-ml Erlenmeyerﬂask contain-
ing 50 ml of LB broth was inoculated with 200ml of precultured cells and incubated at 37°C at 250 rpm
until an OD600 of 0.9 was reached. Next, 0.4 mM IPTG (isopropyl b-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside) was
added, and the culture was incubated under the same conditions as the ones described above until
MRCUT1 expression was observed. An aliquot of 10 ml was taken each hour during the induction time
and assayed for esterase activity.
(iv) Enzymatic assays.A qualitative assay was performed with a mixture of 75mlo fa na-naphthyl
acetate (a-NA) solution (0.005 Ma-NA, 25% acetone, and 50 mM sodium phosphate buffer [pH 7]) and
75 ml of the crude induced extract. The mixture was homogenized and incubated for 15 min at 37°C.
After the reaction time, 75ml of a Fast Red (FR) solution (0.008 M FR dissolved in 0.05% Triton X-100 and
50 mM sodium phosphate buffer [pH 7]) was added. Esterase activity was observed as a change in color
to red-brown. Phosphate buffer (without enzyme) was used as the negative control (51).
Esterase activity quantiﬁcation was done by usingp-nitrophenyl acetate (p-PNA) as a substrate. A
mixture of 25
mlo f1m M p-NPA in ethanol, 200ml of 50 mM sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.5), and
25 ml of the pure enzyme or crude extract was homogenized and incubated at 37°C for 15 min, and the
absorbance at 410 nm was measured every 3 min. Phosphate buffer without enzyme was used as a neg-
ative control. A standard curve of 25 to 200
mM p-nitrophenol was used to determine the enzymatic ac-
tivity. An enzymatic activity unit (U) is deﬁned as the amount that transforms 1mmol of PNA per min.
(v) Protein determination. Proteins were quantiﬁed by the Bradford method according to the
instructions provided by the manufacturer (Bio-Rad). A standard curve of 0.01 mg to 0.1 mg of bovine
serum albumin (BSA) was used (52).
(vi) SDS-PAGE and zymograms.The SDS-PAGE technique was used to obtain the protein proﬁles
of crude extracts in 14% acrylamide gels (53). Samples in sample buffer were boiled at 95°C for 5 min,
loaded into each well, and run at 80 and 120 mV in a vertical chamber, and the gels were stained with
Coomassie overnight. According to the protocol described previously by Brunelle and Green, the gels
were stained and destained until bands were observed (54).
A zymogram was performed using 100
mM MUF (4-methylumbelliferone)-butyrate as a substrate to
detect in situ enzymatic activity. After gel running, proteins were renatured by gel immersion in Triton
X-100 (5%) for 30 min at 100 rpm and subsequent immersion in 50 mM sodium phosphate (pH 7) for
5 min. MUF-butyrate was added, and the mixture was left at room temperature for 10 min. The bands
were observed under UV light (55).
(vii) Western blotting. After SDS-PAGE, proteins were transferred to a polyvinylidene diﬂuoride
(PVDF) membrane in a semidry transfer cell at 20 V for 1 h according to the provider’s protocol (Bio-Rad). A
band corresponding to the recombinant enzyme was revealed by anti-His tag antibodies coupled to alka-
line phosphatase (Thermo Scientiﬁc), which detect the His tag added at the enzyme C terminus.
(viii) MRCUT1 cutinase puriﬁcation. Afﬁnity puriﬁcation was performed with a cobalt column
(Clontech), according to the manufacturer’s protocol.
Biochemical characterization.Temperature and pH optima for the assayed conditions were deter-
mined by a spectrophotometric quantiﬁcation method as described above. The effect of temperature on
enzyme activity was assayed at 20°C, 30°C, 40°C, 50°C, 60°C, 70°C, and 80°C at pH 7.5 (0.1 M phosphate
buffer) for 15 min with appropriate controls. The pH optimum was assayed during 30 min at 37°C in a pH
range from 2 to 9 in the following buffers: 50 mM citrate (pH 2 and 4), 50 mM acetate (pH 5), 50 mM sodium
phosphate buffer (pH 6 to 7), and 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8 to 9). Triplicates were performed for each reaction,
and the values were corrected for the noncatalyzed hydrolysis of the substrate.
Polyester degradation assay.The polyester degradation ability of recombinant MRCUT1 cutinase
was analyzed by three techniques, dry weight measurement, titration, and scanning electron micros-
copy (SEM).
(i) Dry weight measurement.First, circular ﬁlms of approximately 3 mm in diameter and 1 mm
thick were prepared, weighing around 10 mg. Polycaprolactone (PCL) and polyethylene succinate (PES)
were melted at 80°C and compressed in a mold to obtain smallﬁlms (22). For polyethylene terephthalate
(PET), samples were used directly from commercial water bottles, and fragments were taken and cut
into small pieces (5 mm
2) weighing around 25 mg.
For the degradation assay, 0.05 g of small cut polyester pieces of PES, PCL, or PET was added to 1 ml
of an enzyme solution (100 U/ml in 50 mM sodium phosphate buffer [pH 7.5]) in a 5-ml reaction vial.
The vial was incubated at 37°C at pH 7.5 for 21 days, and a sample was taken each day for 7 days. The
negative control was evaluated under the same conditions; in this case, only phosphate buffer was
added to polyester. After the reaction time, the polyester was washed with ethanol and allowed to dry

in an oven at 37°C overnight before dry weight measurement. PET was obtained from commercial water
bottles, and PES and PCL were acquired from Sigma-Aldrich. After dry weight measurement, these sam-
ples were then used for SEM analysis as described below.
(ii) Titration assay.Upon hydrolysis, an aliquot of the reaction mixture was withdrawn and titrated
with 0.01 N NaOH, and phenolphthalein was used as an indicator. The expenditure of milliliters of NaOH
was recorded (39).
(iii) Scanning electron microscopy.An FEI Sirion XL30 SEM instrument with aﬁeld emission gun
(FEG-SEM) was used to observe the polymeric ﬁlms before and after the hydrolysis process with
MRCUT1. A thin layer of Au was deposited on the polymeric samples to avoid charge accumulation dur-
ing the SEM observations.
