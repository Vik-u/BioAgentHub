Summary
Due to the rising global environment protection
awareness, recycling strategies that comply with the
circular economy principles are needed. Polyesters
are among the most used materials in the textile
industry; therefore, achieving a complete poly(ethy-
lene terephthalate) (PET) hydrolysis in an environ-
mentally friendly way is a current challenge. In this
work, a chemo-enzymatic treatment was developed
to recover the PET building blocks, namely tereph-
thalic acid (TA) and ethylene glycol. To monitor the
monomer and oligomer content in solid samples, a
Fourier-transformed Raman method was success-
fully developed. A shift of the free carboxylic groups
(1632 cm/C01) of TA into the deprotonated state (1604
and 1398 cm/C01) was observed and bands at 1728
and 1398 cm/C01 were used to assess purity of TA
after the chemo-enzymatic PET hydrolysis. The
chemical treatment, performed under neutral condi-
tions (T = 250 °C, P = 40 bar), led to conversion of
PET into 85% TA and small oligomers. The latter
were hydrolysed in a second step using theHumi-
cola insolens cutinase (HiC) yielding 97% pure TA,
therefore comparable with the commercial synthesis-
grade TA (98%).
Introduction
Global population and rising living standards are directly
correlated to the continuous increase of textile waste
(Allwood et al., 2006). Overproduction of fabrics since
2010 is driven by the increased rate of replacement of
products. In 2008, around 14 M tons of textile waste
was generated in Europe, but only 5 M tons was recov-
ered (Zamani, 2014). About 75% of the recovered fabrics
were reused or recycled mainly in industrial applications
(Jorgensen et al., 2008). The remaining collected waste
textiles are either landﬁlled or incinerated. However, the
recycling of used textiles would lead to several environ-
mental beneﬁts such as energy saving, as this process
requires less energy than the production of the same
products from virgin materials and reduction of the car-
bon footprint of the overall process (Clarket al., 2016).
The textile and clothing industry is a heterogeneous
business which covers different types ofﬁbres, with a con-
sistent 54% that is represented by man-made synthetic
materials. The consumption of these synthetic ﬁbres
increased by 77% between 2000 and 2012 (Harderet al.,
2017). On the other hand, the growth share of synthetic
ﬁbres in global consumption results in the rising demand
for petroleum-based chemicals (Pellis et al., 2016a).
Among the synthetic textiles, poly(ethylene terephthalate)
(PET) is one of the most widely used polymers in the global
textile industry (Herrero Aceroet al., 2011). PET is a semi-
crystalline thermoplastic polymer which shows excellent
tensile strength, chemical resistance and high thermal sta-
bility. Two PET grades are dominating the global market:
the ﬁbre grade PET, with a Mw of 15– 20 Kg mol/C01 and
intrinsic viscosity between 0.4 and 0.75 dl g/C01, and the
bottle grade PET, which refers to a higher Mw polymer
(> 20 Kg mol/C01) with an intrinsic viscosity above
0.95 dl g/C01 (Tasca et al., 2010; Al-Sabaghet al., 2016).
Due to its wide production and utilization (Cavaco-
Paulo and Guebitz, 2008), PET represents a broad

disposal inert textile. The non-toxic nature, durability and
crystal clear transparency of PET during use are the
principal advantages of this polyester, while its rather
slow biodegradability is the major cause of concern to
the environmentalists. Recycling the textile waste-
derived polyesters can signiﬁcantly cut down the energy
usage, resource depletion and greenhouse gas emis-
sions. Unfortunately, different factors such as colouring
dyes (Giannotta et al., 1994) and other chemicals such
as detergents, fuels and pesticides (Demertzis et al.,
1997) reduce the quality of recycled PET reducing the
number of the possible applications. When compared to
mechanical recycling and incineration, chemical hydroly-
sis could lead to higher value products (Paszun and
Spychaj, 1997). The most common chemical-based PET
hydrolysis processes are alkaline hydrolysis using 4 –
20% NaOH/KOH solutions (Karayannidis et al., 2002),
phase transfer catalysts and acidic hydrolysis using con-
centrated sulphuric acid or other mineral acids (Yoshioka
et al., 2001). All these processes are very costly and
toxic because the chemicals required and laborious
puriﬁcation steps are needed. In recent years, more
environmentally friendly PET recycling strategies based
on neutral hydrolysis (carried out using water or steam
at 1 – 4 MPa and temperatures of 200 – 300 °C) were
reported (Launay et al., 1994). In last decade, the inter-
est of biotechnologies towards polyesters biodegradation
and recycling is gaining a key role. Yoshidaet al. (2016)
showed a novel bacterium,Ideonella sakaiensis 201-F6,
able to break down the plastic using two enzymes to
hydrolyse PET and assimilate its building block for
growth. Earlier, various studies demonstrated that a
class of enzymes belonging to thea/b hydrolase family,
namely cutinases, are able to hydrolyse the ester bonds
of PET and several other polyesters (Pelliset al., 2015,
2016b; Barth et al., 2016; Wei et al., 2016). Among
them, cutinase are currently under investigation for the
bioprocessing of PET textiles on an industrial scale
(Silva et al., 2005). Earlier, it was reported that cutinases
from Thermobiﬁda fusca and Humicola insolens were
able to hydrolyse low-crystallinity PET while complete
hydrolysis by enzymes only seems to be difﬁcult if not
impossible for PET with higher crystallinity (Mueller,
2006; Nimchua et al., 2007; Ronkvist et al., 2009). In
this work, we propose an innovative synergistic chemo-
enzymatic hydrolysis of PET for the production of high-
purity TA (97%) avoiding harsh chemical treatments.
Results and discussion
FT-Raman analysis
In the past, several methods, mainly HPLC-related, have
been established to follow enzymatic hydrolysis of PET in
aqueous solutions (Herrero Acero et al., 2011; Pellis
et al., 2016c). However, water-insoluble oligomers would
obviously escape quantiﬁcation of TA in the presence of
insoluble oligomers; hence, a novel method based on FT-
Raman and triethylamine was adapted for this study. TA,
p-C
6H4(COOH)2, has two carboxylic groups which are
detectable using Fourier transform Raman spectroscopy.
The analysis of benzene dicarboxylic acids such as isoph-
thalate and terephthalate using FT-Raman was previously
described by Arenas and Tellez (Arenas, 1979; T/C19ellez
et al., 2001). According to these reports, the -COOH
group of solid TA reveals a typic-centred band at
1631 cm
/C01, mainly given by the asymmetric stretching
(mas)o fC=O. As described by Tellez, a coupled vibrational
mode is characteristic of the single band at 1286 cm/C01.
The discrimination of monomeric TA from esteriﬁed spe-
cies was performed converting these functional groups
into the corresponding anions. The simplest reaction of
carboxylic acid is saliﬁcation by a base. This reaction
causes the shift of (m
as) of the C=O group and appearance
of new bands due to the in-phase and out of phase -
COO
(/C0) stretching vibration (Socrates, 2004). The shift of
the acid peak of the carboxylic group from 1720 cm/C01 to
1580 cm/C01 after alkaline treatment was previously
reported for the grafting of cotton with cyclodextrins (Von-
cina and Majcen, 2005) or for detection of end groups of
ﬂuoropolymers (Piancaet al., 1999).
The conversion of the -COOH group into the carboxy-
late species was carried out using triethylamine (TEA) in
chloroform solution (Di Robertet al., 2015). The deproto-
nated anion obtainedvia incubation with tertiary aliphatic
amine caused the shift of m
asC=O and the increase of
the single band of the symmetric stretching (ms)o fC =O
at 1400 cm/C01 and an ammonium-related band in the
2700 cm/C01 region.
Figure 1 shows the shift of the acid peak of solid TA
from 1631 to 1604 cm/C01 after deprotonation with TEA.
Furthermore, the clear appearance of a peak at
1398 cm/C01 was observed due the symmetric stretching
mode of the carboxylate moiety. On the other hand, the
peak at 1286 cm
/C01 was strongly reduced. The 1:5 TA/
TEA ratio showed the clearest signal for the monomers
due to a complete conversion of the desired groups
(Fig. S2).
To assess the suitability of this method to quantify TA
in the presence of oligomers, BHET, DMT and PET were
incubated with the tertiary aliphatic amine (1:5 ratio).
Expectedly, the shift of 1632 and 1395 cm
/C01 typical for
TA did not occur as all carboxylic groups of these oligo-
mers are esteriﬁed (Figs S3– S5).
Water-based PET hydrolysis
Preliminary experiments showed that water-based PET
depolymerization was not achieved with ratio 1:4 PET/

H2O and incubation for 90 min. Therefore, a series of
experiments were performed, to deﬁne the appropriate
depolymerization conditions (Table 1).
The incubation of PETﬁbre at 180°C and 12 bar did
not lead to any depolymerization of the sample, and
hence, there was no difference of spectra. In Fig. S6, it
is possible to observe how the spectra of raw PETﬁbre
and Sample 2 are very similar with no remarkable differ-
ences that could be spotted, showing that reaction tem-
perature and pressure were not optimal for the
hydrolysis of the polymer. Finally, when temperature and
pressure were increased to 250°C and 39 bar, respec-
tively, the polymer was completely reduced in a whitish
powder (Fig. S7). In Fig. S8, it is possible to see that
spectrum of PET depolymerization product for Sample 4
(blue) was similar to the spectrum of commercial TA.
Using these conditions, a powder consisting of 85% TA
was obtained from the water-based PET depolymeriza-
tion according to HPLC and
1H-NMR analysis. Unfortu-
nately, further variation of the reaction conditions
including addition of zinc acetate did not lead to a higher
yield of TA. Hence, enzymatic hydrolysis of the remain-
ing oligomers was assessed in the next step. To note
that experiments with various steady-state lengths were
performed but did not lead to an improvement of the TA
yield, therefore the enzymatic ﬁnishing step was critical
in order to obtain high-purity TA.
Enzymatic PET hydrolysis
The kinetics of the formation of degradation productsvia
enzymatic treatment depends on various factors, includ-
ing the chemical – physical structure of polyester sub-
strate (Eberl et al., 2008). Already, various authors have
previously demonstrated that cutinase preferentially
hydrolyze the amorphous region on PET (Donelliet al.,
2009; Gamerith et al., 2017). On the other hand, it was
shown that enzymatic hydrolysis of PET oligomers is
way faster than of a long-chain polymer (Ribitschet al.,
2011). Therefore, due to the high crystallinity of the PET
ﬁbres used in the textile industry, a chemical pre-hydro-
lysis was established in this work.
The sample from chemical pre-treatment with the high-
est degree of hydrolysis (Sample 4, 85% TA) was further
incubated with different concentrations ofHumicola inso-
lens cutinase (HiC) to hydrolyse remaining oligomers
(Fig. 2). The highest amount of soluble TA (6.5 mM)
was obtained after 6 h of incubation both when 1 or
2m gm l
/C01 of HiC was applied without any further
increase until 24 h of incubation. The lower concentra-
tions of enzyme of 0.1 and 0.5 mg ml
/C01 led to the
release of 0.53 and 1.9 mM of TA respectively.

Terephthalic acid with 97% purity was obtained after
enzymatic treatment of the chemical-treated PET which
is comparable to synthesis-grade TA (98% pure). When
chemical pre-hydrolysis of PET was performed in the
presence of zinc acetate as a catalyst, a negative inﬂu-
ence on enzymatic hydrolysis was observed (Fig. 3). In
fact, there was no further increase in the amount of TA
seen (Fig. 3).
Zinc and other metal ions are well known to be poten-
tial inhibitors of many enzymes, including cutinases as
recently reported by Chenet al. that biochemically char-
acterized Thermobiﬁda fusca cutinases (Chen et al.,
2010).
FT-Raman detection of depolymerized PET
While in the chemically pre-treated sample oligomers
were present, the peak at 1728 cm
/C01 indicative of ester
bond was considerably reduced after enzymatic hydroly-
sis (Fig. 4). In parallel, the increase in the band at
1398 cm
/C01 indicated formation of TA. Finally, the signal
at 1286 cm/C01, as expected, had the opposite trend of
the asymmetric stretching of CO, further conﬁrming the
reduction in the oligomers to TA (Fig. 5).
In addition to FT-Raman, 1H-NMR analysis was per-
formed. Likewise, 1H spectra (recorded in DMSO-d 6)
indicate the presence of some longer oligomers in the
chemically pre-treated sample while the spectra of the
reaction product after subsequent enzymatic hydrolysis
suggest their conversion into TA. Based on the
1H-NMR-
performed calculations (see ESI for details), the oligo-
mers are mostly comprised of less than four (but nearer
two) constitutional repeat units, and TA end groups dom-
inate over EG suggesting the oligomerization is more
effective at releasing free EG than free TA, or that the
puriﬁcation steps involved preferentially remove EG.
Materials and Methods
Chemicals, substrates and enzymes
Buffer components, bovine serum albumin (BSA),para-
nitrophenyl-butyrate (p-NPB), methanol, zinc acetate, TA
and formic acid were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich
(USA). All other chemicals and reagents used in this
work were of analytical grade and used without further
puriﬁcation if not otherwise speciﬁed. Humicola insolens
cutinase (HiC) was a gift from Novozymes (Beijing,
China). All hydrolyses were performed using Wellman
PET ﬁbre with a viscosity of 0.62 dl g
/C01.
Water-based PET hydrolysis
Water-based PET hydrolysis was performed in 1 l stain-
less steel high-pressure and high-temperature reactor at
different temperatures (180 and 250 °C) and with and
without the addition of zinc acetate as catalyst. All exper-
iments were carried out with 25 g of virgin PETﬁbre in
250 ml of deionized water. The reactions were stopped
after 60 and 90 min, respectively (30 min after reaching

assessed. A temperature and pressure proﬁle of a typi-
cal reaction is shown in Fig. S1. At the end of the pro-
cess, H
2O and EG were removed and a white powder
was obtained (Fig. S7B). The EG stream can be further
processed anaerobically due to the current low cost of
the compound.
ATR FT-IR analysis
ATR FT-IR spectra were recorded on a Perkin-Elmer
Spectrum GX spectrometer. The ATR accessory (supplied
by Specac Ltd., UK) contained a diamond crystal. A total
of 16 scans for each sample were taken with a resolution
of 4 cm
/C01. All spectra were recorded at 21°C over the
wavelength interval between 4000 and 650 cm/C01.
FT-Raman analysis
To remove the water, terephthalic acid (TA), bis(2-hydro-
xyethyl) terephthalate (BHET), dimethyl terephthalate
(DMT) and poly(ethylene terephthalate) PET as stan-
dards were lyophilized for 24 h; 50 mg of samples was
incubated with different volumes of pure triethylamine in
10 ml of chloroform for 6 h. Afterwards, chloroform was
removed by evaporation at 21 °C for 24 h. The virgin
material and the powders obtained from the chemical
process and after the enzymatic treatment were also
incubated as described above. The FT-Raman spectra
were recorded using a Perkin-Elmer Raman station 400,
coupled with a 785 nm laser. Spectra were collected at
a resolution of 2 cm
/C01 for 25 scans and normalized in
the region 2200– 2400 cm/C01 before any data processing.
The bands were assigned as follows: 3000– 2700 cm/C01
m(Et-NH4
+), 1728 cm/C01 m(C=O, bended), 1632– 1604 cm/C01
mas(C=O), single band 1398 cm/C01 d(C-O), single band
1286 cm/C01 coupled modem(C=O)+d(COH).
Protein quantiﬁcation and SDS-PAGE analysis
Protein concentration was measured using the Bio-Rad
Protein Assay Kit (Bio-Rad, Vienna, Austria). BSA was
used as protein standard; 10 ll of the sample was
added into the wells of a 96-well plate. Afterwards,
200 ll of the prepared Bio-Rad reagent solution was
added (Bio-Rad Reagent diluted 1:5 with MQ-water).
The plate was incubated for 5 min at 21 °C and
400 rpm. Buffer (100 mM Tris-HCl pH 7) was used as
blank. The absorption after 5 min was measured at
k = 595 nm in a plate reader (Tecan INFINITE M200)
and the concentration calculated from the average of
triplicates. Sodium dodecyl sulphate– polyacrylamide gel
electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) was performed according
to Laemmli using 4% stacking gels and 15% separating
gels and run at 150 V (Laemmli, 1970). Pre-stained pro-
tein marker IV (Peqlab, Germany) was used as a molec-
ular mass marker. Proteins were stained with
Coomassie method.
Esterase activity assay
Esterase activity was measured at 25°C usingp-nitrophe-
nyl-butyrate (p-NPB) as a substrate according to Biundo
et al. (Biundo et al., 2015). The ﬁnal assay was carried
out by mixing 200 ll of the substrate stock solution, in
100 mM Tris– HCl buffer pH 7, with 20ll of enzyme solu-
tion. The increase in the absorbance at 405 nm due to the
release of p-nitrophenol ( e 405 nm = 10.27 ml (lmol

cm)/C01) was measured for 5 min, every 18 s with a plate
reader. A blank was included using 20ll of buffer instead
of enzyme solution. The activity was calculated in units (U),
where 1 unit is deﬁned as the amount of enzyme required
to hydrolyse 1 lmol of substrate per minute under the
given assay conditions. The activity assay was also per-
formed in the presence of 1, 5, 10, 25 or 50 mM of the
chemical catalyst (zinc acetate). All the experiments were
performed in triplicates.
Enzymatic hydrolysis of PET oligomers
The enzymatic hydrolysis of the PET powder resulting
from the chemical treatments was performed as previ-
ously described with some modiﬁcations (Herrero Acero
et al., 2011; Pellis et al., 2016a). Brieﬂy, 10 mg of pre-
treated PET powder and 2.0 ml of enzyme solution (di-
luted in 100 mM Tris-HCl buffer pH 7) were added in a
test tube. The mixture was incubated for 24 h at 50°C
and 600 rpm in an orbital shaker. Different concentra-
tions 0.1, 0.5, 1 and 2 mg ml
/C01 of enzyme were used to
understand the optimal concentration of HiC. All the
experiments were performed in triplicates.
High-Performance Liquid Chromatography
Proteins were removed using a 1:1 (v v
/C01) ice-cold
methanol precipitation. Therefore, samples were cen-
trifuged at 14 000 rpm (Centrifuge Beckman JU-MI) at
0 °C for 15 min. The supernatant was acidiﬁed by add-
ing 8 ll of 6 M HCl and then transferred into HPLC vials.
The released products were analysed by high-perfor-
mance liquid chromatography (HPLC) (Agilent Technolo-
gies, Palo Alto, CA) coupled with a UV detector, at
241 nm, using a water/methanol linear gradient
(Table S1). To determine the TA percentage in the mix-
ture, 10 mg of PET powder resulting from before and
after the enzymatic hydrolysis was diluted in 100 ml of
100 mM Tris-HCl buffer pH 7 and analysed as described
before.
1H-NMR analysis
1H nuclear magnetic resonance was performed on a
Bruker Avance II 400 spectrometer (resonance fre-
quency of 400.13 MHz for 1H) equipped with a 5 mm
observe broadband probe head (BBFO) with z-gradients.
DMSO-d
6 was used as NMR solvent for all samples.
Conclusions
In this study, the synergism of chemical and enzymatic
hydrolysis of PET was demonstrated on a multigram
scale. To monitor the PET hydrolysis and formation of
TA, a FT-Raman method based on the deprotonation of
the – COOH group was established. The chemical pre-
treatment performed in an environmentally friendly way
under neutral conditions, therefore avoiding harsh chemi-
cals, leads to depolymerization of the polyester-com-
posed waste textiles yielding about 85% TA. The
enzymatic hydrolysis performed in a second reaction
step leads to further hydrolysis of the remaining oligo-
mers yielding TA with a purity of 97%. Future studies
should consider the chemo-enzymatic treatment of differ-
ent PET containing textiles wastes as well as studies on
synthesis of PET based on the recovered TA.
