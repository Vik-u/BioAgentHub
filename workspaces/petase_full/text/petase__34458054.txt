Abstract 
This article introduces the EU Horizon 2020 research project MIX‑UP , "Mixed plastics biodegradation and upcycling 
using microbial communities" . The project focuses on changing the traditional linear value chain of plastics to a 
sustainable, biodegradable based one. Plastic mixtures contain five of the top six fossil‑based recalcitrant plastics 
[polyethylene (PE), polyurethane (PUR), polypropylene (PP), polyethylene terephthalate (PET), polystyrene (PS)], along 
with upcoming bioplastics polyhydroxyalkanoate (PHA) and polylactate (PLA) will be used as feedstock for microbial 
transformations. Consecutive controlled enzymatic and microbial degradation of mechanically pre‑treated plastics 
wastes combined with subsequent microbial conversion to polymers and value‑added chemicals by mixed cultures. 
Known plastic‑degrading enzymes will be optimised by integrated protein engineering to achieve high specific bind‑
ing capacities, stability, and catalytic efficacy towards a broad spectrum of plastic polymers under high salt and tem‑
perature conditions. Another focus lies in the search and isolation of novel enzymes active on recalcitrant polymers. 
MIX‑UP will formulate enzyme cocktails tailored to specific waste streams and strives to enhance enzyme production 
significantly. In vivo and in vitro application of these cocktails enable stable, self‑sustaining microbiomes to convert 
the released plastic monomers selectively into value‑added products, key building blocks, and biomass. Any remain‑
ing material recalcitrant to the enzymatic activities will be recirculated into the process by physicochemical treatment. 
The Chinese–European MIX‑UP consortium is multidisciplinary and industry‑participating to address the market need 
for novel sustainable routes to valorise plastic waste streams. The project’s new workflow realises a circular (bio)plastic 
economy and adds value to present poorly recycled plastic wastes where mechanical and chemical plastic recycling 
show limits.

Background
General global plastic waste situation
Due to their benefits as a functional material, their 
extreme durability, longevity, low weight and low price, 
synthetic plastics, including polyvinyl chloride (PVC), 
PE, PS, PP , PUR, and PET, have become ubiquitous 
not only in work and social environments, but also in 
natural systems as contaminants. Plastic pollution has 
become a global threat, affecting all ecosystems, even 
remote ones like the pole regions, uninhabited atolls 
or deep ocean basins [1 –6]. The global scale of plastics 
production increased by 21% in the last six years, reach -
ing 368 million metric tons (Mt) in 2019 [7 ]. China and 
the European Union (EU) account for 31% and 16%, 
ranking first and third globally of all the world’s plastic 
production, respectively. Nonetheless, European plas -
tic production revealed a decline since 2018 which has 
been significantly intensified by COVID-19 pandemic 
(estimated rate 2020: −   8.5%) [7 ]. Highest in plastic 
waste generation in 2016 were the United States, with 
42 Mt followed by the EU (30  Mt), India (26 Mt) and 
China (22 Mt) [8 ]. All nations worldwide are strug -
gling to manage the current volumes of plastic waste, 
making a highly efficient waste management system 
increasingly important. A significant unintended draw -
back of the existing plastic economy is its linearity. Of 
all plastics produced globally, 83% has not been reused 
due to a lack of proper recycling technologies, and of 
the recycled 10%, only 15% has been reused more than 
once [9 ]. Seven main plastic polymers account for 92% 
of all primary produced plastic ever made (1950–2015: 
8,300 Mt). The largest groups are the polyolefins, with 
PE (36%), and PP (21%), PVC (12%), followed by PET, 
PUR, or PS (less than 10% each) [7 , 9]. Biobased plas -
tics (bioplastics) with increasing volumes emerged as 
non-fossil alternatives on the last decennium’s plastic 
markets (Fig.  1A). Persistent biomass-derived plastic 
materials, non-biodegradable bioplastics derived from 
renewable resources represent 57% of all the bioplas -
tics (2  Mt), including biobased PET, polyamides (PA), 
and PE [10]. Global bioplastics production capacities 
increase has been forecasted from around 2.1 Mt (bio -
degradable 1.3 Mt) in 2020 to approx. 2.9 Mt (1.8 Mt) in 
2025, amounting to a 0.4% (2020) share of biodegrad -
able plastics in general plastic waste streams [11].
Effective plastic recycling poses a significant challenge 
for sustainability, as a plastic polymer currently degrades 
each time it is recycled [12]. Technological solutions as

mechanically pre‑treated, unsorted plastic waste is exposed during Plastics Depolymerisation to heavily engineered, plastic type‑specific enzyme 
blends. These enzymes have been produced preliminarily by defined mixed cultures during Enzyme production. Released metabolites, additives, 
plastic mono‑ and oligomers of various plastic types will be used as plastic derived feedstock for defined microbial communities (Mixed culture) to 
bio‑convert them into biomass products (e.g. PHA), and secreted products released during upcycling processes, respectively. During Separation, 
downstream processing, removal of toxin (e.g. diamines) and product recovery will be tackled. Finally, recalcitrant residues will be subjected to 
Physicochemical treatments, thereby synthesising added‑value products and closing MIX‑UP cycle by re‑entering into bioprocess steps

part of a circular economy can form only part of more 
radical changes required in human behaviours like 
throw-away mentality symbolised by single-use con -
sumer plastics or unnecessary packaging. Multilevel mit -
igation strategies to reduce the waste of natural resources 
started with policymakers banning and placing levies 
on single-use plastic consumer products to stimulate 
sustainable alternatives and changed consumer behav -
iour. Upcycling plastic waste from fossil sources in an 
open-loop process to biodegradable plastic and chemi -
cals to valorise post-consumer plastic should be part of a 
rethinking towards a circular economy [13–15]. Essential 
for a circular economy is the intense utilisation of every 
side stream to minimise waste production or redundant 
 CO2 release. Available recycling concepts are often not 
cost-competitive and produce polymers of lower qual -
ity. The biotechnological recycling supplemented with 
physicochemical techniques to tackle the more recalci -
trant plastic polymers may promote new waste manage -
ment strategies. Promising new value-chains for plastic 
waste and the increasing demand for recycled plastics 
by the multinational brand owners, driven mainly by 
the rising consumer awareness concerning sustainability 
issues, shall urge the private sector to invest in a circu -
lar economy. The partners of the MIX-UP consortium 
envision a better plastic future built on the ’6 R’ princi -
ples (rethink, refuse, reduce, reuse, recycle, replace) [16]. 
In the 2019 position paper " A circular economy for plas -
tics", the European Commission explained its vision for a 
circular plastics system. The plastics should be produced 
using renewable energy and feedstocks. The plastic prod -
ucts should be designed to be used, reused, repaired and 
recycled (mechanically, chemically, biologically) so that 
the material streams in society are fully circular, keeping 
high value without posing risks for human health nor the 
environment [17].
Chemical and mechanical plastic waste recycling
Crude oil and other fossil resources are the cost-effective 
lifeblood of the chemical industry and have been exten -
sively used as energy and carbon feedstock for almost 
90% of its products. One of the last boosts has been the 
shale gas-driven multi-billion investments into the U.S. 
chemical industry, leading to an acceleration of virgin 
plastics manufacturing [18]. For decades, the traditional 
economy of high-income countries followed the "take-
make-dispose" strategy creating economic value by man -
ufacturing and selling as many products as possible. The 
envisioned global transition to a circular economy initi -
ated the founding of initiatives like, e.g. The Global Plas -
tics Alliance or Alliance to End Plastic Waste [19, 20]. It 
activated private investors’ investment or development 
banks into recycling technology to recover and create 
value from plastic waste.
The only widely applied large-scale technology to 
treat solid plastic waste is mechanical recycling. Limi -
tations for mechanical recycling are temperature-sen -
sitive plastics, composites, and thermosets that cannot 
be liquidised at high temperatures [21]. Differences in 
mechanical behaviour and thermal properties of all the 
different plastics require thorough sorting, washing to 
remove organic residues and shredding of the collected 
wastes. The melted and remoulded polymers are often 
blended with virgin plastics to correct for lost proper -
ties. Two of the most prominent commodity plastics, 
PET and PE, with annual EU market shares of about 8% 
and 30%, respectively, mainly used in packaging, are the 
only ones recovered by mechanical recycling [7 , 21].
Chemical recycling has emerged as an alternative, 
promising technology to valorise plastic waste. Plastic 
wastes can be gasified into synthesis gas. Solvolytic pro -
cesses may convert polymers into monomers and oligom-
ers, subsequently re-polymerised after purification by, 
e.g. precipitation combined with filtration [22]. Pyrolysis 
(thermolysis) and hydrogenolysis using advanced cata -
lysts can selectively produce gases, fuels, or waxes. The 
latter requires selective and efficient catalysts, preserving 
critical functional groups [21]. High-energy costs but low 
costs for competing virgin monomers from fossil-based 
feedstocks often make chemical recycling commercially 
unattractive [23]. Effective recycling processes within cir-
cular approaches should not only produce monomers for 
later polymerisation ("bottle to bottle") but rather focus 
on value-added products or intermediates for alternative 
supply chains. The upcycling of PE into long-chain alkyl 
aromatics ready to be sulfonated to make surfactants was 
reported [ 24]. Others described the synthesis of inter -
mediary cyclic acetals, which are useful as solvents, fuel 
additives or monomers for polymers [25]. The greatest 
challenge is the chemical recycling of commingled plastic 
waste, as even small amounts of the various polymer con-
taminants may change the properties of the end-product. 
Therefore, chemical recycling requires often the use of 
pure waste feedstocks obtained only after resource-
intensive sorting. The use of suitable compatibilisers for 
upcycling recovered polymer mixtures can overcome this 
problem [26–28].
Another feasible approach for PET/polylactate (PLA) 
polyester mixtures is using a molecular ruthenium cata -
lyst for selective hydrogenolysis to separate the differing 
sorts of monomeric diols, and methanol, respectively, at 
varying reaction conditions (temperature, solvent) [29]. 
Alternatively, using pyrolysis oil in a naphtha cracker 
might close the carbon loop, but much of the beneficial

molecular structure and plastic properties are lost in this 
option.
Microbial and enzymatic plastics biotransformation
Facing the unabated growth of global plastic produc -
tion and considering the shortcomings of traditional 
mechanical and chemical recycling technologies, bio -
logical depolymerisation and conversion technolo -
gies have been increasingly discussed, complementing 
end-of-life plastic treatment options. With a view to 
the economic circularity, selective removal of poly -
mer-building blocks using enzymatic treatments under 
mild conditions and the ability to the selective recov -
ery of monomers from mixed plastic substrates would 
be a real improvement [30– 32]. Building blocks of 
plastic polymers can, in general, be divided into dif -
ferent major groups as (i) monomers with vinyl groups 
to produce PS, PE or PVC; (ii) bifunctional monomers 
with terminal hydroxyl, amine, or carboxyl groups to 
obtain polyesters or polyamides; (iii) diisocyanates for 
PUR [33]. In recent years, considerable progress con -
cerning plastic polymers with hydrolysable groups in 
their backbones, as PET, PA, or PUR were reported, 
obtained mainly by polyaddition or polycondensation. 
Several studies described the ability of microorganisms 
and enzymes to degrade these plastics [34– 47]. Typi -
cal enzymes are cutinases, lipases, and carboxylester -
ases [48]. The main challenge of enzymatic degradation 
is the fraction of plastic polymers based on persistent 
and robust chemical groups, which resist hydrolysis 
with common biological enzymes that are highly recal -
citrant even under conditions favouring microbial pro -
cesses. These polymers (e.g. PE, PP , PS, PVC) obtained 
by chain polymerisation comprise the major part of 
the plastic waste market and are generally considered 
non-biodegradable. The polymers possess extensive 
inert C–C backbone structures, are completely devoid 
of functional groups and might be only degraded by 
high-energy redox reactions [48]. Only a few enzymes 
have been reported to reduce the molar mass of PE and 
PS. Alkane hydroxylase AlkB, a hydroquinone peroxi -
dase, laccases, and a laccase mediator system demon -
strated C–C-bond cleavage via autooxidation mediated 
by putative radical mechanisms thought to occur ran -
domly, generating a large diversity of short-chain scis -
sion products [4 , 48–55]. In addition to the description 
of enzymatic activities towards PE and PS, several 
reports described their mineralisation to  CO2 by insect 
larvae and their enteric microbiome. The latter poten -
tially benefitting from the combined mechanical pre -
treatment and enzymatic hydrolysis [56– 61]. Recently, 
biodegradation of PVC in the gut of Tenebrio molitor  
larvae has been described [62]. No biodegradation has 
been demonstrated so far for the highly recalcitrant 
polymer PP .
Mixed cultures in industrial applications
The application of microbial consortia in traditional 
foods, such as bread, soy sauce, cheese and wine, have 
been recorded for centuries. These bioprocesses were 
realised with naturally occurring mixed cultures. Mixed 
cultures were gradually replaced by pure cultures in fer -
mentation processes to avoid contaminations by food 
spoilers or pathogenic microbes. Pure cultures have been 
the workhorses for biotechnological processes to produce 
bulk products like amino acids, antibiotics, enzymes or 
organic acids. Fermentations based on pure cultures usu -
ally require strict aseptic conditions, purified substrates, 
high operational energy costs, and gain in addition to 
the targeted product high concentrations of by-products 
in the form of biomass and potentially of organic acids 
or alcohols. The traditional strategy of consolidated bio -
processing integrates all bioconversion reactions in one 
step-bioprocesses using metabolically engineered whole-
cell biocatalysts hosting all required functional genes in 
one consolidated strain.
Compared with the competing fossil-based chemical 
production, industrial biotechnology lacks cheap, read -
ily available feedstocks to produce bulk biobased chemi -
cals using highly specialised whole-cell biocatalysts as 
pure cultures. The main drawback for using lignocellu -
lose, molasses, sludge or organic wastes as feedstock in 
pure-culture fermentations is the heterogeneity of the 
feedstocks, non-aseptic conditions and the high costs 
for substrate pre-treatments. Although mixed cultures as 
industrial microbiomes are well established in the fields 
of biofuels (biogas, bio-hydrogen, butanol-production), 
biobased chemicals, and biopolymers, the emphasis in 
industrial biotechnology still lies on pure cultures [63–
66]. The specific advantages of mixed-culture fermenta -
tion compared with pure culture are (i) the possibility of 
utilising cheaper or mixed substrates (e.g. organic waste, 
lignocellulose, raw glycerol); (ii) the synergies of different 
enzymatic systems and combination of metabolic path -
ways of various microorganisms that can result in more 
efficient utilisation of substrates and a narrow produc -
tion spectrum contributing to product purification; (iii) 
shorter development times for mixed-culture design 
compared with deep-genetic engineering to create uni -
versal "superbugs", and (iv) cost reduction, due to the 
high microbial diversity with non-sterile requirements 
[67]. An alternative for the latter is the use of robust 
extremophilic strains able to produce the target com -
pounds (e.g. PHA) under simplified process conditions, 
in open unsterile, continuous fermentation facilities 
where most other organisms are unable to proliferate.

The extremophiles based process seems to be suitable for 
simple growth on mixed degradation products, includ -
ing fatty acids, plastic monomers and food wastes [68–
71]. In mixed cultures and consortia exist in addition to 
intraspecies interactions, e.g. quorum sensing, interspe -
cies interactions between cells of the different species. 
Metabolite effects like mutualism, synergy, and compe -
tition for nutrients in an ecological niche might affect 
metabolisms and the yield of fermentation target prod -
ucts [72–75].
EU H2020 Project "From Plastic Waste to Plastic value using 
Pseudomonas putida Synthetic Biology" (P4SB): achieved 
results embedded in MIX‑UP
MIX-UP can, in part, build on the success of P4SB (grant 
no: 633962), an H2020 project in which several of the 
MIX-UP partners [RWTH-iAMB (coordinator, Aachen), 
University College Dublin, CIB-CSIC (Madrid), CNRS-
University of Strasbourg; industrial partners: SOPREMA, 
Bioplastech] already worked together on plastic waste 
valorisation. The innovation radar has ranked P4SB as 
one of the top ten EU Biotechnology projects [76]. The 
main outcomes of P4SB regarding plastic hydrolysis are 
engineered PET degrading enzymes with significantly 
increased PET hydrolysing activity [77]. Furthermore, 
PUR hydrolases were identified [39]. In terms of mono -
mer metabolism, P. putida strains for growth on all PET 
and PUR monomers tested could be isolated. However, 
efficient growth could not be achieved on all monomers. 
Subsequently, via genetic engineering, the P4SB partners 
could generate recombinant P. putida strains capable of 
efficient catabolism of ethylene glycol, terephthalic acid, 
and 1,4-butanediol [13, 14, 66, 78]. For the valorisation 
of plastic monomers, besides PHA synthesis, hydroxy 
alkanoyl oxy-alkanoic acids (HAA) synthesis has been 
successfully established. PHA synthesis could be shown 
on all PET and PUR plastic monomers [14]. Consolidated 
strains of P. putida engineered within P4SB for PET and 
PUR monomer metabolism will be used to benchmark 
the performance of defined mixed cultures in MIX-UP . 
Therefore, the strains will be combined with, e.g. engi -
neered pseudomonads capable of metabolising oligo- and 
monomers from PS, PP , and PE degradation, and produc-
ing alternative novel biopolymers. In contrast to P4SB, 
MIX-UP focuses on consolidated bioprocesses in a com -
bination of highly efficient enzymatic (pre-)treatment, 
defined mixed-culture biodegradation of released plastic 
monomers, additives and toxic constituents to biomass, 
value-added products, and building blocks using various 
engineered microbes. The increased interdisciplinary of 
the MIX-UP consortium was achieved by broadening 
the expertise’s in the following fields: intensive protein 
engineering (University Greifswald, RWTH-BIOTEC); 
plastic biodegradation (Nanjing Tech University, Beijing 
University of Chemical Technology); enzyme production 
upscaling (AB Enzymes, IPE); bacterial stress-response 
and directed evolution (Research Center Jülich); envi -
ronmental education and innovative clean-up technology 
(everwave); extremophilic PHA-bioproduction (Tsinghua 
University); product separation and chemical catalysis 
(RWTH-AVT, ITMC).
Project aim, concept, and approach
The core aim of MIX-UP project is to establish mixed 
plastic waste as standard second-generation feedstock 
for industrial biotechnology—plastic waste as a valuable

resource. The bioconversion of unsorted, mixed plastic 
waste into value-added, sustainable biomaterials using 
heavily engineered enzyme mixtures for depolymerisa -
tion and mixed microbial cultures as whole-cell biocata -
lysts for biosynthesis is the way to achieve this goal as a 
contribution to the transition towards a low-fossil carbon 
circular bio-economy (Fig. 1B).
The main idea of MIX-UP is to showcase a novel 
approach to the circularity of the plastic life cycle. The 
overall concept is depicted in Fig. 2. MIX-UP will develop 
and use engineered polymer hydrolyzing and oxidis -
ing enzymes to depolymerise the mechanically sheared 
mixed plastic waste (e.g. marine litter, household) into 
their monomeric components (biotic plastics depoly -
merisation). These enzymes will be expressed in mixed 
microbial cultures, synthesised in an optimised produc -
tion reactor (enzyme production) or as envisioned in a 
subsequently consolidated bioprocess with simultane -
ously implemented whole-cell biocatalysts biodegrada -
tion. The released metabolites, additives (e.g. stabilisers, 
plasticisers, and colourants), plastic monomers, and oli -
gomers from the various plastics types will be transferred 
to the bioreactor (mixed culture). Here the plastic 
derived feedstock is fed to dedicated microbial commu -
nities converting the substrate into central metabolites, 
which provide afterwards the building blocks for the 
synthesis of novel polymers (e.g. HAA, PHAs), products 
(biosurfactants) or building blocks for chemo-catalysis 
(Fig.  2). The approach follows the bow-tie structure of 
metabolism [79]. Finally, MIX-UP will tackle downstream 
processing and recovery of the product by, for example, 
conditional release of the intracellular products and sepa-
ration. The recalcitrant process residues will be separated 
and subjected to chemical transformation, also cracking 
persistent ester bonds, synthesising valuable chemicals, 
and closing the cycle by subsequent re-entering of the 
bioprocesses. The entire bioprocess will be optimised, 
performing metabolic engineering in an integrated man -
ner by considering the upstream (strain/microbiome 
development, protein engineering), midstream (fermen -
tation), and downstream (recovery and purification) pro -
cesses altogether.
MIX-UP targets the engineering of a new-to-nature 
biological route to convert mixed plastic waste to value-
added bio-products, which will enable the recycling 
industry a qualitatively new dimension. Furthermore, 
when successful, mixed plastic wastes can be estab -
lished as novel second-generation carbon sources for 
bio-products, aiding to solve the conflict of food vs.  fuel 
that is pervasive in contemporary Industrial Biotech -
nology. Thus, through a combination of metabolic engi -
neering of mixed cultures, intensive protein engineering 
and bioprocess-optimisation, MIX-UP will enable new 
value-chains within the framework of a sustainable 
knowledge-based bio-economy across sectors, including 
materials, chemicals, and environmental technologies. 
That will ultimately benefit the economy, environment, 
and society at large. The project has already produced 
a large number of publications that are available at the 
MIX-UP website www. mix- up. eu.
