Introduction
Plastics are widely used due to their durability, versatility, and cost-effectiveness; however, their accumulation
in the environment has led to severe pollution and ecosystem disruption [1-3]. Conventional plastic waste
management methods, including chemical recycling and incineration, are often energy-intensive processes that
generate harmful byproducts [4-6]. Therefore, more sustainable, biological approaches are urgently required to
facilitate plastic degradation.
Enzyme-driven biocatalytic depolymerization has emerged as a promising strategy for breaking down plastics
into reusable monomers [7-10]. Among these enzymes, IsPETase, identified in Ideonella sakaiensis, efficiently
degrades polyethylene terephthalate (PET) into its monomeric components—bis(2-hydroxyethyl) terephthalate
(BHET), mono(2-hydroxyethyl) terephthalate (MHET), terephthalic acid (TPA), and ethylene glycol (EG)-which
can be recycled into new plastic products [11, 12]. Also, a specific cutinase, TfCut2, exhibits hydrolytic activity on
polycaprolactone (PCL), a biodegradable polyester [13, 14]. Despite their potential, the practical applicability of
these enzymes is limited by their low catalytic efficiency , poor thermal stability, and high production costs in
conventional microbial expression systems. To overcome these challenges, plastic-degrading enzymes have been
engineered to improve catalytic performance, with bacteria systems frequently employed for gene cloning and
enzyme expression [15-19]. However, this approach is labor-intensive and time-consuming, requiring multiple
iterative cycles of genetic manipulation, enzyme production in living cells, and subsequent purification for
screening [18, 20-22]. Moreover, heterologous gene expression in microbial hosts imposes a significant metabolic
burden, often resulting in unintended mutations that further complicate the enzyme engineering process [23-25].
The Cell-Free Protein Synthesis (CFPS) system has emerged as a powerful alternative to traditional microbial
approaches that can help overcome these limitations. Co mposed of crude cell extracts, energy sources, amino
acids, and cofactors, CFPS provides a controlled and efficient platform for synthesizing target proteins, free from
the constraints of living cells [26-28]. This setup enables the direct and efficient translation of genetic templates
such as plasmid DNA, linear DNA, or mRNA, while avoiding common challenges associated with cellular systems
such as resource competition and metabolic stress [29, 30]. Hence, CFPS offers several advantages over cell-based
systems, including enhanced translation efficiency and rapid, flexible protein production. It also eliminates time-
The accumulation of plastic waste poses a signif icant environmental challenge, necessitating the
development of efficient plastic-degrading enzy mes for bioremediation and recycling. However,
traditional enzyme engineering approaches rely on microbial expression systems and are time-
consuming and prone to unintended interactions between host cells and recombinant circuits. To
address these limitations, a cell-free protein synthesis (CFPS) platform was developed for rapidly
screening plastic-degrading enzymes. Using CFPS , cutinase and PET-degrading enzymes (PETases)
were successfully synthesized, and their catalytic activities were assessed using polymer-containing
agar plates. Clear degradation halos were observ ed for cutinase and PETase on polycaprolactone
(PCL)-containing and bis (2-hydroxyethyl) terephth alate (BHET)-containing plates, respectively. The
optimization of CFPS conditions revealed that  enzyme synthesis efficacy was higher at room
temperature than at 37 oC. The screening of PETase variants (C3 N1377, Mipa-P , and C5 N1251),
synthesized using the CFPS platform, demonstrated that the catalytic activity of Mipa-P was the
highest and surpassed that of IsPETase. This find ing was further validated through purified enzyme
analysis. Our results establish CFPS as a rapid, scalable, and cell-free alternative platform for screening
and optimizing plastic-degrading enzymes, facilita ting advancements in enzymatic plastic recycling.

consuming processes such as cell growth, gene expression optimization, and protein purification, making CFPS
an attractive tool for rapidly producing and screening engineered enzymes. By bypassing metabolic burdens and
growth limitations, CFPS accelerates enzyme optimization and exhibits great promise for advancing plastic-
degrading enzyme engineering [31].
In this study, a CFPS-based screening method was developed for screening plastic-degrading enzymes, including
cutinase and PETases. Upon synthesizing these enzymes using the CFPS system, their catalytic activity was
confirmed through clear halos formed on polymer-containing plates, indicating polymer degradation. The halo
size was positively correlated with both the enzyme concentration and degradation efficiency. Conditions for
efficient enzyme synthesis were optimized by evaluating template DNA concentrations and reaction temperature
in the CFPS process. Our results highlight the potential of this simple and rapid CFPS-based screening platform
for catalytic enzymes, overcoming the limitations associated with living cell systems. This approach facilitates the
high-throughput screening and optimization of engineered plastic-degrading enzymes.
Materials and Methods
Bacterial Strains, Growth Conditions, and Plasmid Construction
All bacterial strains, plasmids, and primers used in this study are listed in Tables S1 and S2. E. coli strains were
routinely grown at 37°C in Luria-Bertini (LB) broth (BD, USA) while shaking the solution at 180 rpm to achieve
transformation and enzyme production. Kanamycin (50 μg/ml, Daejung, Republic of Korea) and ampicillin
(150 μg/ml, Sigma-Aldrich, USA) were added to bacterial cultures when necessary. 
Construction of the Plastic Degrading Protein Expressions
The characteristics of the bacteria, plasmids, and primers used in this study are summarized in Tables S1 and S2.
DNA manipulations were performed according to a standard protocol [32]. Plasmid DNA was isolated from
bacterial cells using the Exprep Plasmid SV Mini Purification Kit (GeneAll, Republic of Korea, Cat. No. 101-102).
Restriction endonucleases were purchased from Ne w England Biolabs (NEB, USA). Plasmids expressing
IsPETase, TfCut2, C3 N1377, Mipa-P , and C5 N1251 were previously built [33]. To construct a plasmid carrying
the GFP-tagged cutinase, the coding sequences for GFP and cutinase (TfCut2) were amplified separately using
Phusion High-Fidelity DNA Polymerase (NEB) with primer pairs FW/GFP RV for GFP and FW/TfCut2+Linker
RV for cutinase. The resulting gene fragments were subsequently assembled with the pET28b vector using Gibson
Assembly Master Mix (NEB) according to the manufacturer’s protocol.
For the preparation of DNA templates for CFPS, including TfCut2, TfCut2-GFP , C3 N1377, Mipa-P , and C5
N1251, PCR amplification was performed using Phusion High-Fidelity DNA Polymerase and primers T7 FW and
T7 RV to incorporate the T7 promoter and T7 terminator into the PCR products.
The strains harboring plastic-degrading genes were pre-cultured overnight in LB medium and subsequently
diluted 1:100 in fresh LB containing 20 μM isopropyl β- D-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG; Thermo Scientific,
USA) to induce protein expression under the T7-LacO promoter.
Cell-Free Protein Synthesis System
The AccuRapid (Bioneer, Republic of Korea) Protein Expression kit was used as the Cell-Free protein synthesis
(CFPS) system, with reagent quantities  adhering to the manufacturer’s protocol. Concentrations of extracted
plasmid and PCR product were measured using the NanoVue Plus spectrophotometer (GE Healthcare, USA), and
an appropriate amount of DNA was added to CFPS solutions as the template DNA. CFPS mixtures were incubated
for 2 h at 37
oC or room temperature (RT). To minimize hindra nce to enzyme activity, the CFPS reactant was
dialyzed with distilled water using Slide-A-Lyzer MINI dialysis devices (10K MWCO, Thermo Fisher Scientific)
for 10 min. The purified enzyme was spotted onto filter paper, from which 5-mm disks were prepared using a hole
puncher. These disks were then incubated at room temperature for 2 h to evaluate catalytic activity.
Preparation of Polymer Containing Media
Polymer-containing media were prepared following the protocol reported by Perez-Garcia et al. [34]. Briefly,
0.1 g of polycaprolactone (PCL, Average Mw~14000, Sigma-Aldrich, USA) was melted in 12 ml of acetone (Duksan,
Republic of Korea) at 70oC. The PCL solution was then added to 200ml of LB or M9 minimal media (Sigma-
Aldrich) containing 1.5% (w/v) agar. To prepare BHET-containing media, 0.15 g of BHET was dissolved in 6 ml of
acetone at 70oC and added to 100 ml of M9 containing 1.5% (w/v) agar. To prepare PET-containing media, PET
was ground to a particle size of < 200 μm. A total of 0.05 g of powdered PET was dispersed in 5 ml of 1,1,1,3,3,3-
hexafluoro-2-propanol (Daejung). The solution was then slowly added dropwise into 50 ml of ice-cold water and
stirred vigorously before mixing 100 ml of M9 medium containing 1.5% (w/v) agar media. BHET and PET powder
were ground to a size < 200 μm before dissolution.
Enzyme Purification
Enzyme purification was conducted as described by H. Seo et al. [33]. Briefly, an overnight-induced culture was
harvested via centrifugation, and the cell pellet was resuspended in lysis buffer (40 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0) before
being lysed by ultrasonication. After centrifugation (13,000 ×g, 30 min), the supernatant was loaded onto a Ni-
NTA agarose column (Qiagen, Germany) pre-equilibrated with lysis buffer. Bound proteins were washed with
30 mM imidazole and eluted with 300 mM imidazole in lysis buffer. All purification steps were performed at 4°C.

Measurement of Hydrolytic Activity
Hydrolytic activity was assessed based on the formation of clear halos after applying plastic-degrading enzymes
onto polymer-containing agar plates. The size of each clear halo was quantified using an image analysis software
ImageJ by considering the diameter of the clear zone surrounding each enzyme-spotted disc. The measured
diameters were normalized to the diameter of the filter  disc used for enzyme spotting. All experiments were
performed in triplicate ( n = 3), unless indicated otherwise, and data are presented as the mean ± standard
deviation (SD). Statistical analyses were conducted using GraphPad Prism 10.4.2. Depending on the experimental
comparison, statistical significance was evaluated using Student’s t-test or one-way ANOV A with Dunnett’s
multiple comparison test. Differences were considered statistically significant at P < 0.05.
Results and Discussion
Instability of Heterologous Gene Expression in Living Systems
To assess the expression and catalytic activity of TfCut2 in bacteria, we constructed genetic circuits by cloning
the gene encoding the plastic-degrading enzyme into the pET28b plasmid, which carried an IPTG-inducible T7
promoter system. The plasmid was introduced into E. coli BL21(DE3), a strain expressing T7 RNA polymerase.
Since TfCut2 efficiently degrades polycaprolactone (PCL), transformed cells were cultured on PCL-containing
plates with 100 μM IPTG to evaluate enzyme functionality . After incubating cells overnight, clear halos were
formed around the cells, indicating successful enzyme synthesis, secretion, and subsequent PCL degradation
(Fig. 1A).
While halo formation confirmed the functional expression and secretion of TfCut2, quantifying its expression
level in living cells required an alternative approach. To address this issue, we fused TfCut2 to a green fluorescent
protein (GFP) via a tandemly repeated linker (GGGGS 3) and assessed its catalytic activity and expression level.
The fusion protein retained enzymatic function (Fig. 1B), although the halos produced by Tfcut2-GFP were less
distinct than those formed by native cutinase. The use of GFP fusions to quantify TfCut2 expression introduced
steric hindrance, reducing enzymatic activity [35]. Our preliminary results indicated that using a shorter linker
substantially decreased hydrolytic activity. Thus, optimizing linker length, flexibility, or fusion orientation could
effectively mitigate interference, preserving enzyme functionality while enabling accurate quantification.
To evaluate gene expression levels, fluorescence intensity was measured using a microplate reader. The reporter
strain was cultivated in an LB medium with varying IPTG concentrations, and after 24 h, the highest GFP signal
was observed at 50 μM IPTG (Fig. 1C). However, fluorescence intensity decreased at IPTG concentrations above
50 μM (Fig. 1C), suggesting that excessive induction may impose a metabolic burden on the cells. Nonetheless,
these findings demonstrate that the genetic circuit can serve as a platform for evaluating plastic-degrading
enzymes based on their expression levels in bacterial cells.

TfCut2 was constructed and introduced into E. coli BL21(DE3). When transformed cells were cultured on LB agar plates

hydrolysis activity. (B) PCL degradation was also observed in cells expressing the TfCut2-gfp fusion gene; however, hydrolysis
activity was lower compared to the non-fused enzyme. (C) The stability of reporter activity across growth cycles was assessed by
serially transferring the reporter strain by diluting cultures 100-fold into fresh medium containing varying IPTG
concentrations, followed by incubation for 24 h. This process was repeated, and GFP activity was measured in each cycle using
a microplate reader (n = 3) or (D) assessed at the 1st and 3rd cycles using flow cytometry analysis.

Since prolonged cultivation can affect heterologous gene expression, we monitored GFP expression across
successive growth cycles. Serially transferring the reporter strain by diluting cultures 100-fold into fresh medium
and incubating for another 24 h resulted in a significant decline in GFP intensity (Fig. 1C). This reduction
persisted with further serial passage, with GFP activi ty remaining consistently low (Fig. 1C). To determine
whether this decline was associated with genetic instability at the single-cell level, we analyzed the population via
flow cytometry (Fig. 1D). Under the culture conditions used for microplate analysis, most cells exhibited strong
GFP expression after 24 h (Fig. 1D). However, after two rounds of serial culture at 24-h intervals, a substantial
portion of the population exhibited a loss in GFP expression, presumably due to the widespread mutations that
had affected gene expression (Fig. 1D). Although population heterogeneity was not observed in samples treated
with 1 mM IPTG, overall GFP expression levels were reduced, possibly due to the emergence of mutations in the
reporter's expression or regulatory system (Fig. 1D).  These findings highlight that continuous induction of
heterologous gene expression in living systems often lead s to instability, driven by cellular burden and genetic
mutations. The progressive decline in expression levels  and increased cell-to-cell variability during extended
cultivation poses significant challenges for the reliable screening and characterization of plastic-degrading
enzymes. This variability necessitates a more stable expression system. To address these limitations, we explored
cell-free protein synthesis (CFPS) as an alternative. Unli ke living systems, CFPS elim inates cellular stress and
unintended mutations associated with gene expressi on burdens [29, 30]. Leveraging these advantages, we
established CFPS as a robust platform for screening plastic-degrading enzymes.
Validation of Catalytic Enzyme Productivity of CFPS Using Cutinase
To evaluate the effectiveness of cell-free protein synthesis (CFPS) for screening catalytic enzymes, we synthesized
TfCut2 using a commercially available CFPS kit and assessed its catalytic activity through a polycaprolactone
(PCL) degradation assay previously optimized for TfCut2-expressing cells. CFPS reactions were conducted using
identical concentrations of DNA templates encoding TfCut2 under the control of the T7 promoter, consisting of
plasmid DNA or PCR-amplified linear DNA (Fig. 2A). To ensure an accurate and fair comparison between the
different DNA templates, we introduced an equal molar quantity (0.15 pmol) of each DNA type into the CFPS
reaction. Using equal molar concentrations guarantees that each reaction contains the same number of template
molecules, thereby avoiding discrepancies that could result from variations in DNA length. Following a 2 h
incubation period at 37°C to synthesize the protein, reaction mixtures were dialyzed against distilled water for
10 min to remove small molecules potentially interfering with enzymatic assays. Aliquots of 50 μl were obtained
Fig. 2. CFPS-based TfCut2 synthesis and its hydrolysis activity. (A) Schematic representation of the CFPS workflow.
Reactions were allowed to occur using equal concen trations (0.15 pmol) of a DNA template encoding TfCut2 under the T7
promoter, provided as either plasmid or PCR-amplified linear DNA sequences. Following a 2-h incubation at 37°C, reaction
mixtures were dialyzed for 10 min to remove small molecules. (B) CFPS products were applied to M9 agar plates with PCL
using filter paper to limit diffusion. After incubating for 2 h at 37°C, clear degradation halos were observed, indicating
enzymatic activity (n = 3). Comparison of relative halo size showed no significant difference between reactions using plasmid
DNA and linear DNA templates (ns, not significant; p > 0.05). (C) Using the same approach, GFP-fused TfCut2 was synthesized
with varying amounts of linear DNA, and both GFP fluorescence intensity and catalytic activity were measured ( n =3 ) .  A
positive correlation was observed between GFP expression level and halo size, as determined by Pearson correlation analysis (r
= 0.9478, P = 0.0040). (B, D) Error bars represent S.D. CFPS, Cell-free protein synthesis.

from each dialyzed sample and applied onto M9 agar plates supplemented with PCL, using filter papers to confine
samples and prevent diffusion. After incubation at 37°C for 2 h, clear degradation halos were observed on PCL-
containing plates, indicating enzymatic activity. Importantly, halo sizes and clarity were comparable between
plasmid-derived and PCR-amplified DNA templates (Fig. 2B), suggesting no disadvantage in using PCR-amplified
DNA. Due to these equivalent results, subsequent CFPS assays exclusively utilized PCR-amplified DNA templates,
offering advantages such as cost-effectiveness and convenience.
Next, we investigated how varying the DNA template amount influenced protein yield and catalytic activity in
CFPS reactions. Using a TfCut2-GFP fusion construct allowed the parallel measurement of fluorescent and
catalytic activities across multiple DNA template concentrations. CFPS reactions were conducted as described
above, products were transferred into 384 well plates, and GFP fluorescence was quantified using a microplate
reader. Fluorescence intensity increased proportionally with DNA template quantities of up to 300 ng but
plateaued at higher concentrations (500 ng; Fig. 2C). Similarly, when CFPS-produced cutinase was evaluated via
application onto PCL agar plates, the observed halo size and clarity correlated closely with DNA template amounts,
aligning effectively with GFP fluorescence measurements  (Fig. 2C). The observed increases in fluorescence
intensity and halo formation with higher amounts of DNA template - up to 300 ng - indicate that protein
production and enzymatic activity in CFPS are positively correlated with template DNA concentration. These
findings collectively demonstrate that CFPS is an effective platform for rapidly synthesizing and screening
catalytically active enzymes, with enzymatic functionality readily verified through substrate-containing agar
assays. Crucially, optimizing DNA template concentrations is essential to maximize protein yield and catalytic
efficiency during CFPS reactions, with optimal conditions likely varying across different enzymes, depending on
the specifically targeted enzyme.
Efficiency Screening of the PETase Variants Using CFPS
To expand the applicability of the CFPS-based enzyme screening platform initially established with Cutinase,
we evaluated its effectiveness for producing and assessing PETases. While both cutinase and PETase function as
catalytic enzymes, their distinct substrate preferences affect their potential for degrading plastic. Cutinase primarily
hydrolyzes low-crystallinity polyesters such as PCL, a relatively simple substrate that facilitates straightforward
activity detection. In contrast, PETase targets polyethylene terephthalate (PET), a highly crystalline polyester with
a r o m a t i c  r i n g  s t r u c t u r e s  t h a t  c o n f e r  c o n s i d e r a b l y  m o r e  r e s i s t a n c e  t o  e n z y m a t i c  d e g r a d a t i o n  [ 3 6 ] .  G i v e n  t h e
escalating global plastic pollution crisis and the need for sustainable degradation solutions, PETase has garnered
significant interest for its ability to degrade PET unde r mild conditions [37]. To enhance PETase catalytic
efficiency, several engineered PETase variants have been developed [16, 38]. However, screening and optimizing
PETase variants for improved activity, stability, and substrate specificity remain major bottlenecks, limiting their
practical applicability in industrial and environmental settings. A CFPS-based approach, if successfully applied to
PETase, could provide a high-throughput, cell-free altern ative to traditional expression systems, enabling the
rapid discovery and optimization of PET-hydrolyzing enzymes without the constraints associated with cell
viability, secretion pathways, or complex expression conditions. 
Fig. 3. Optimization of CFPS reactions for PETase synthesis. (A) PETase variants (C3 N1377, Mipa-P , and C5 N1251)
were synthesized using CFPS, and their hydrolysis activity was assessed on PET-containing plates (n = 3). No detectable halo
formation was observed. (B) To further evaluate the hydrolysis activity of a specific PETase, PET was replaced with its soluble
analog, BHET, as the substrate. Additionally, the CFPS reac tion volume was increased (2X), and the CFPS synthesis was
performed at room temperature (RT) and 37°C to optimize PETase production (n = 3). Mipa-P produced under optimized
CFPS conditions (2X reaction volume and RT synthesis) genera ted significantly larger halos, indicating enhanced catalytic
activity. Asterisks indicate significant differ ences established by an unpaired two-tailed t-test ( P < 0.05). BHET, bis(2-

Considering these advantages, we aimed to test the feasibility of CFPS for synthesizing and screening PETases
and evaluated its broader applicability for enzymes targeting structurally complex and industrially relevant
substrates. Thus, we conducted a comparative analysis of PETase variants within the CFPS framework, to evaluate
their activity and stability. We synthesized three PETases (C3 N1377, Mipa-P , C5 N1251) [33] using CFPS and
assessed their catalytic activity on PET-containing agar plates, following the approach used for cutinase. However,
none of the CFPS-expressed PETases exhibited detectable catalytic activity against PET (Fig. 3A). This lack of
activity was probably attributable to the buffer conditions used during CFPS synthesis and dialysis, which may
have hindered the interaction of PETase with PET. In addition, the rigid and crystalline structure of PET presents
a physical barrier to enzymatic access, typically requiring a high local concentration of active enzyme for effective
hydrolysis. Given the moderate expression levels typically obtained through CFPS, the resulting concentration of
PETase may not have reached the threshold necessary to effectively hydrolyze the highly crystalline PET surface,
thereby preventing visible degradation. Therefore, we used bis(2-hydroxyethyl) terephthalate (BHET), a soluble
monomeric substrate, to assess catalytic activity under more permissive conditions. Mipa-P [33] was synthesized
via CFPS, and its activity was tested on BHET-containing plates. When prepared using the same approach as
cutinase, clear halo zones appeared around enzyme-con taining disks (Fig. 3B), confirming their enzymatic
activity. Furthermore, doubling CFPS reaction mixture volumes resulted in larger halos, indicating increased
PETase production in CFPS (Fig. 3B). To further enhance CFPS-based PETase synthesis, we optimized incubation
conditions by reducing reaction temperature and increasing reaction volume. Since CFPS relies on T7 RNA
polymerase derived from E. coli, which functions optimally at 37°C, reactions are typically conducted at this
temperature. Although the overall capacity for protein synthesis may be reduced at room temperature, the PETase
synthesized under these conditions exhibited significantly enhanced hydrolytic activity (Fig. 3B), likely attributable
to improved protein folding, stability, and functional integrity [39, 40]. Collectively, these adjustments resulted in
notably larger halos on BHET-containing plates. These findings underscore the potential for optimizing CFPS
reaction parameters to enhance enzyme production and activity. With appropriate modifications, CFPS provides
a powerful platform for screening and engineering PE T-degrading enzymes, accelerating the development of
highly efficient biocatalysts for plastic degradation.
Application of CFPS-Based Screening to Evaluate Engineered PETase Variants
Building upon the optimization of CFPS-based enzyme synthesis and substrate selection for PETase, we sought
to demonstrate its practical application in evaluating engineered PETase variants. To achieve this, we synthesized
three efficiency-verified PETase variants using the optimized CFPS-based method and evaluated their catalytic
Fig. 4. Screening hydrolysis activity of PETase variants synthesized via CFPS. (A) PETase variants (IsPETase, C3
N1377, Mipa-P , and C5 N1251), synthesized via CFPS, were assessed for enzymatic activity using BHET as a substrate. Halo
formation served as an indicator of relative catalytic activity. A quantitative comparison using IsPETase as a reference enzyme
revealed that engineered Mipa-P exhibited the highest enzymatic activity, followed by C3 N1377, while IsPETase and C5 N1251
demonstrated minimal activity as same as reference (n = 3). Statistical significance was determined using one-way ANOV A
followed by Dunnett’s multiple comparisons test against the IsPETase. Both Mipa-P and C3 N1377 showed significantly higher
activity compared to IsPETase (**** P < 0.0001). (B) To prove these findings, extracted and purified Mipa-P and IsPETase from
E. coli were applied to PET-containing plates to compare catalytic efficiency ( n = 3). The results confirmed that Mipa-P
exhibited superior activity to IsPETase, consistent with CFPS-based screening results. This was further supported by
quantitative analysis of halo size, which showed a significant increase in degradation area for Mipa-P (unpaired two-tailed t-
test, P < 0.05).

activity on BHET-containing plates for comparative screening. The resulting halo sizes varied based on the catalytic
efficiency of each PETase (Fig. 4A). Mipa-P exhibited the highest activity, forming the largest halos, followed by
C3 N1377, whereas both IsPETase and C5 N1251 showed no detectable activity. Additionally, we compared the
halo-forming PETases (Mipa-P and C3 N1377) with IsPETase as a reference to evaluate  their relative catalytic
performance. This assessment facilitated a relative comparison of the efficiency of engineered PETase variants
against IsPETase, the naturally occurring enzyme used for plastic degradation (Fig. 4B). The results demonstrated
that Mipa-P exhibited robust enzymatic activity, generating clearer and larger halo zones on BHET-containing
media than any of the other hydrolases tested. Notably, we observed minimal hydrolytic activity for IsPETase and
C5 N1251 using this CFPS platform, despite their reported plastic-degrading capabilities [33]. This finding
suggests that only enzymes possessing a sufficiently high level of intrinsic hydrolytic activity can be effectively
screened with the current CFPS method. Overcoming this limitation will likely require further optimization of
both the CFPS conditions and the screening methodologies.
To validate CFPS-based screening results, the catalytic activity of purified Mipa-P and IsPETase was further
confirmed using PET-containing media (Fig. 4B). Switching from BHET to PET substrates with purified enzymes
allowed us to directly validate enzyme activity on a more relevant polymer, emphasizing the platform’s capability
for rapid screening and deployment of engineered enzymes. Furthermore, this experiment enabled a direct
comparison of enzymatic efficiency under controlled conditions, reinforcing the trends observed in the CFPS-
based screening (Fig. 4A). These results highlight the potential of CFPS as an efficient platform for screening and
evaluating engineered PETase variants. By bypassing traditional bottlenecks associated with protein expression,
CFPS provides a valuable tool for rapidly identifying and optimizing plastic-degrading enzymes, paving the way
for future advancements in enzymatic plastic degradation strategies.
Conclusion
The instability of heterologous gene expression in living systems poses a significant challenge to enzyme
characterization and stable production. The prolonged cultivation of E. coli expressing TfCut2 led to a sharp decline
in expression levels, likely due to cellular burden and accumulated genetic mutations. This study demonstrates
that CFPS offers a stable and efficient platform fo r screening plastic-degrading enzymes, overcoming the
limitations of conventional microbial expression systems. We successfully synthesized and evaluated TfCut2 and
PETase variants, confirming their catalytic activity on PCL- and BHET-containing plates, respectively. Notably,
the optimization of CFPS reaction conditions, including the reduction in incubation temperature and increase in
reaction volume, enhanced enzyme stability and production. Although direct PET degradation was not observed,
CFPS-based screening with BHET effectively helped differentiate PETase variants by their hydrolysis activity.
These findings establish CFPS as a powerful tool for enzyme engineering, enabling the rapid screening and
optimization of plastic-degrading biocatalysts for bioremediation and industrial recycling.
