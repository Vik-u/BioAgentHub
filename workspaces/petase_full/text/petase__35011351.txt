Abstract: The effect of aqueous solutions of selected ionic liquids solutions on Ideonella sakaiensis
PETase with bis(2-hydroxyethyl) terephthalate (BHET) substrate were studied by means of molecular
dynamics simulations in order to identify the possible effect of ionic liquids on the structure and
dynamics of enzymatic Polyethylene terephthalate (PET) hydrolysis. The use of speciﬁc ionic liquids
can potentially enhance the enzymatic hydrolyses of PET where these ionic liquids are known to
partially dissolve PET. The aqueous solution of cholinium phosphate were found to have the smallest
effect of the structure of PETase, and its interaction with (BHET) as substrate was comparable to that
with the pure water. Thus, the cholinium phosphate was identiﬁed as possible candidate as ionic
liquid co-solvent to study the enzymatic hydrolyses of PET.
Keywords: molecular dynamics (MD) simulations; PETase; BHET; PET; ionic liquids (ILs)
1. Introduction
Due to the major concern on the global environmental crisis, research on how to
recycle synthetic polymers has been promoted extensively for the last two decades. Among
various synthetic polymers, the polyethylene terephthalate (PET), with its simple synthesis,
robustness, and durability, led to a drastic increase in its industrial production; therefore,
by the year 2020, production has reached more than 70 million metric tons [1–3]. Different
chemical degradation approaches, e.g., hydrolysis, ammonolysis, aminolysis, methanolysis,
and glycolysis have been introduced to recycle and remove the plastics. Nevertheless,
these techniques need high temperatures and produce other environmental pollutants as
byproducts.
The high solubility of PET in solvents, as the ﬁrst step of recycling, is difﬁcult; there-
fore, ﬁnding proper solvents for recycling and degrading is challenging. There are few
solvents that were commonly used for PET solubilization, such as dichloroacetic acid [4,5]
triﬂuoroacetic acid [6], phenol/1,1,2,2-tetrachloroethane solution [7], and chlorophenol [8].
Nonetheless, these solvents are not only costly but also toxic; therefore, it is desirable to
use pretreated PET to avoid any secondary pollution in the environment.
The hydrophobic nature and crystallinity of PET are two major issues on dissolu-
tion and recycling of PET; therefore, ﬁnding environmentally friendly solvents is needed.
Herein, ionic liquids (ILs) can be used to overcome this problem, as some ILs can partially
change the crystalline structure of PET to an amorphous structure [ 9,10]. Moreover, as
an alternative to traditionally used volatile organic compounds, many ionic liquids are
environmentally friendly and some of them can enhance the stability and catalytic activity
of certain enzymes [ 11,12]. ILs in general have unique features, such as strong solvent

power for dissolution of organic and inorganic compounds, thermal stability, non-volatility,
electrochemical stability, and low ﬂammability [13,14]. Ionic liquids can be mixed with
water at various concentrations, forming so-called hydrated ionic liquids, and hence, water
and ILs act as co-solvents in the solution [15–21]. At the present time, ionic liquids have
attracted enormous research interest due to their speciﬁc advantages and variability, which
can be achieved by optimization of the choice of cation and anion combinations, inﬂuencing
thermal stability, non-volatility, and many other properties [22,23]. Ionic liquids can be
used for degradation of complex polymers, as was shown for cellulose, which can be
utilized by ILs [24,25]. Degradation of PET in the presence of several ILs has been reported
experimentally, and the results show that ILs have increased the degradation ability of
PET [4,7]. The advantage of using ILs as a co-solvent over conventional catalysts, such as
metal acetates, to recycle PET is that the puriﬁcation of the glycolysis products is simpler.
The mechanism of action of ILs is based on the changes of the highly crystalline structure
of PET ﬁlm into an amorphous structure (lost crystalline structure), which can be easily
attacked by PETase during catalytic degradation.
One of the methods for disposal of plastic waste is biodegradation of plastic materials
by enzymes [26]. Development of these environmentally friendly methods is desirable. In
the case of PET, the terephthalic (TPA) moiety present in PET is hydrophobic, which makes
it resistant to the bio-degradation process. In view of this, industries are focusing more
on synthesizing bio-based—rather than oil-based—polymers. Herein, microorganisms
play important roles in the clean-up of pollutants released by humans within the ecosys-
tem. The process of enzymatic hydrolysis of PET ﬁlms was ﬁrst reported by Müller et al.
(2005). The hydrolytic enzyme was puriﬁed from the culture supernatant of T. fusca[27].
Recently, the bacterial strain Ideonella sakaiensiswas discovered and shown to grow on
low-crystallinity PET ﬁlms while using PET as a carbon source [ 28–33]. The enzyme,
known as PETase, showed much higher depolymerization activity against PET ﬁlms at
the mesophilic temperature, unlike thermophilic PET-degrading enzymes tested to date.
PETase works with a two-step process of degradation, at the ﬁrst step, it degrades the
PET into Mono-(2-hydroxyethyl) terephthalate (MHET) and then the different enzyme
MHETase degrades the MHET into TPA and ethylene glycol [34]. The unique feature of
PETase from Ideonella sakaiensisis the fact that it degrades PET ﬁlm at room temperature,
unlike other hydrolases, which function only at high temperatures [35,36]. This conﬁrms
the unique structural and sequence features of Ideonella sakaiensisPETase. Additionally,
experiments reveal that Ideonella sakaiensisPETase exhibits the highest activity among the
other thermophilic PET degrading enzymes [4,37].
Here, we report molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of Ideonella sakaiensisPETase
with various ionic liquids in order to understand the effect of aqueous solutions of ILs on
the structure of PETase and the catalytic/active site of PETase in the presence of ILs. For MD
simulations, the wild-type of Ideonella sakaiensisPETase with ligand (bis(2-hydroxyethyl)
terephthalate (BHET)) have been simulated in pure water and in different concentrations
of three different ionic liquids, which were used as a solvent for dissolution of PET.
2. Results and Discussion
2.1. Root Mean Square Deviation (RMSD)
In order to investigate the effect of non-aqueous solvent on the complex structure of
Ideonella sakaiensisPETase with ligand (BHET), we performed here MD simulations with
three different ionic liquids (Figure 1) in three different concentrations (20%, 30%, 40%) by
mass.

As depicted in Figure 3, RMSD values for PETase in water is lower than in ionic liq-
uids during MD simulation of all systems, indicating that PEtase structure in water is 
closer to the crystal structure t han the structures in ionic liquids. On the other hand, the 
fluctuation of RMSD decreases with increased concertation of ILs, indicating more stable 
structures with less thermal fluctuations. Figure 3A shows the deviation of backbone at-
oms with respect to the reference structure (PDB code 5XJH) when inserted in water and 
in [Ch]3[PO4] ionic liquid with 3 different percentages: 40%, 30%, and 20%. We observed 
that the overall structure of PETase is not deviating much from its starting structure which 
implies that the chosen ionic liquids [Ch] 3[PO4] would not significantly alter the enzyme 
structure and it is suitable for further studies on the reaction mechanism of BHET

and [C2MIM][Ac] ionic liquids, we have not observed signiﬁcant deviation of backbone

atom of PETase with the addition of these ILs. The RMSD graphs for [C4MIM][Ac] and
[C2MIM][Ac] is shown in Figure 3B,C, respectively.
2.2. Ligand RMSD
Analysis in the previous section showed that the enzyme structure is quite stable and
not deviated much from the crystal structure after immersing into three different ionic
liquid solutions. Now, the next main step is to see the reaction site of PEtase, where catalytic
triad (facilitating the BHET hydrolysis) is present on the active site of the enzyme. The
ligand BHET is surrounded by three catalytic amino acids, which will help BHET hydrolysis
through SN-2 reaction mechanism. For this purpose, the position of the BHET ligand should
be stable during MD simulations in the presence of different solvents. Therefore, we have
plotted the RMSD of BHET atoms during the simulation in order to identify the stability of
BHET atoms. The RMSD of the ligand, with respect to the PETase, was calculated during
the simulation time of 150 ns. Here, as depicted in Figure 4A, the BHET atoms are not
deviating much from their starting structure in the presence of [Ch]3[PO4].

served significant deviation of backbone atom of PETase with the addition of these ILs.

As shown in graph Figure 4A, the ligand is quite stable in pure aqueous media and
in the presence of [Ch] 3[PO4] ionic liquid. However, the same stability trend has not

been observed in the case of [C4MIM][Ac] or [C2MIM][Ac] ionic liquids, as shown in
Figure 4B,C, respectively. A detailed inspection of the trajectory revealed that after 40 ns,
the BHET molecule starts moving away from catalytic triad residue ser-131 and the BHET
molecule starts bending from the central carbonyl carbon due to non-bonding interaction
between two sites of BHET rings. The same trend of instability of BHET was observed
for [C4MIM][Ac] after 40 ns of MD simulation, whereas the stabilization in the presence
of [Ch]3[PO4] and pure water for the entire simulation indicated no signiﬁcant deviation
of the geometry and position of BHET molecule within PETase. Furthermore, when the
concentration of ionic liquids decreased to 30% and 20%, the instability of BHET increased
for [C2MIM][Ac] and [C4MIM][Ac]. Again, the molecule started to bend from the carbonyl
carbon and this might be due to electrostatic interaction between two sites of BHET. The
BHET structure was quite stable for the whole simulation time of 150 ns in the presence of
[Ch]3[PO4] and pure water.
2.3. Root Mean Square Fluctuation (RMSF)
In order to have a deep insight into structural stability, one can analyze the stability
of each residue over the simulation time. The ﬂexibility and stability of each residue is
investigated by RMSF. As shown in Figure 5, the RMSF values of PETase in 40% [Ch]3[PO4]
are lower than in water, which is consistent with RMSD ﬂuctuation in Figure 3.

The residues which are fluctuating more are at residue positions 100 –120 and 170 –
180. Among these two domains, we have found that the residue Asn -183 has the highest 
value of RMSF and it is the most unstable one. The same residue has the highest RMSF 
also in the presence of [C4MIM][Ac] and [C2MIM][Ac] ionic liquid. 
To understand this further , we performed a detailed inspection of the simulations 
and found that [Ch]3[PO4] with 40% concentration has a strong hydrogen bond interaction 
between the residue Asn-183 and PO43-. One hydrogen bond interaction between the hy-
drogen atom of residue Asn -183 of  the PETase enzyme with the oxygen of phosphate 
group PO43- was observed. This hydrogen bond interaction was with the bond distance of 
1.8 Å  to 3 Å . However, we noticed that it was not stable enough over the simulation. This 
makes the residue Asn -183 stabl e relatively when we have [C4MIM][ Ac] and  
[C2MIM][Ac] as solvents. There was no eligible entity in [C4MIM][Ac] and [C2MIM][Ac] 
to have an interaction with residue Asn183 and , as a result, the residue was unstable in 
the presence of both [C4MIM][ Ac] and [C2MIM][Ac]ionic liquids ; therefore, producing 
the higher root mean square fluctuation value.

The residues which are ﬂuctuating more are at residue positions 100–120 and 170–180.
Among these two domains, we have found that the residue Asn-183 has the highest value
of RMSF and it is the most unstable one. The same residue has the highest RMSF also in
the presence of [C4MIM][Ac] and [C2MIM][Ac] ionic liquid.
To understand this further, we performed a detailed inspection of the simulations and
found that [Ch]3[PO4] with 40% concentration has a strong hydrogen bond interaction
between the residue Asn-183 and PO 43−. One hydrogen bond interaction between the
hydrogen atom of residue Asn-183 of the PETase enzyme with the oxygen of phosphate
group PO43− was observed. This hydrogen bond interaction was with the bond distance of
1.8 Å to 3 Å. However, we noticed that it was not stable enough over the simulation. This
makes the residue Asn-183 stable relatively when we have [C4MIM][Ac] and [C2MIM][Ac]
as solvents. There was no eligible entity in [C4MIM][Ac] and [C2MIM][Ac] to have an
interaction with residue Asn183 and, as a result, the residue was unstable in the presence
of both [C4MIM][Ac] and [C2MIM][Ac]ionic liquids; therefore, producing the higher root
mean square ﬂuctuation value.
2.4. Radius of Gyration
Calculating the radius of gyration of a protein is a measurement of its compactness.
Thus, if a protein is stably compact, it will maintain a relatively stable value of Rg over
the simulation of time. However, if a protein unfolds during the simulation of time, the
Rg value will ﬂuctuate. Therefore, the measurement of the compactness of protein is
investigated by the radius of gyration function. The radius of gyration of each simulated
system is calculated and compared between simulations in water and simulations in ionic
liquid. There were no structural distortions or unfolding of the secondary structure during
150 ns simulations. However, PETase in water possesses a low radius of gyration relatively
with simulated ionic liquid systems. As shown in Figure 6, the protein in ionic liquids have
a radius of gyration from 1.66 to 1.68 nm, which is larger than in water, where the radius of
gyration was around 1.64 nm. This indicates that the protein has a slightly less compact
structure in ILs than in water. This can be explained by interactions of the IL’s ions with
protein instead of the water molecules. The protein radius of gyration in ILs at different
concentrations is comparable, except the [Ch]3[PO4] at 40%, where Rg is slightly lower at
1.66 compared with 1.67 in [C2MIM][Ac] and [C4MIM][Ac]. This is most likely due to local
higher concentration of the [PO4], which (in comparison to then [CXMIM] and [Ac]) is less
likely to disrupt local geometry of the water molecules in the vicinity of the protein (see
Hofmeister series [38]).
After analyzing the overall structure of PETase, we focused on the active site of PETase,
where BHET ligand binds and is degraded into smaller units through the catalytic reaction.
The catalytic triad is present on the protein surface. The triad is composed of Serine 131,
Histidine 208, and Aspartic acid 177. We investigated the distance between our ligand
(BHET) carbonyl carbon and oxygen of Ser-131. In order to understand the stability of
the interaction between ligand and catalytic residue, the distance between the ligand and
Ser-131 in the presence of water and all ionic liquids in all three ionic concentrations was
calculated over the whole duration of MD simulation. As depicted in Figure 7, the distance
between these two residues is stable over the simulation in water and in [Ch] 3[PO4] as
shown in Figure 7A.

The black curve shows the distance in the water and the blue one with [Ch] 3[PO4]
at 40% concentration. This shows the stability of ligand during the simulation; hence the
condition that is favorable for the reaction is maintained. Therefore, one can consider
[Ch]3[PO4] ionic liquid as a possible medium for BHET hydrolysis. However, in the case of
[C4MIM][Ac] and [C2MIM][Ac], the distance ﬂuctuates signiﬁcantly during the simulation,
which implies the instability of ligand on the active site of PETase. Among the ionic liquids,
[Ch]3[PO4] illustrated the best result for maintaining ligand stability at the catalytic site.

2.5. Hydrogen Bonds and Hydrophobic Interaction 
The solubility and stability of a protein are also dependent on its solvent interaction. 
The solvent interaction can stabilize or destabilize the amino acids of the protein. Moreo-
ver, the hydrogen bond interaction plays an important role in the overall stability of the 
protein structure. Thus, the number of H bonds with the protein demonstrates its struc-
tural stability. 
As shown in Figure 8, the number of H bonds of water molecules, cholinium, and 
phosphate ions with protein residues were calculated in different ionic  liquid

2.5. Hydrogen Bonds and Hydrophobic Interaction
The solubility and stability of a protein are also dependent on its solvent interaction.
The solvent interaction can stabilize or destabilize the amino acids of the protein. Moreover,
the hydrogen bond interaction plays an important role in the overall stability of the protein
structure. Thus, the number of H bonds with the protein demonstrates its structural
stability.
As shown in Figure 8, the number of H bonds of water molecules, cholinium, and
phosphate ions with protein residues were calculated in different ionic liquid concentrations.
Here, 40%, 30%, and 20% concentrations of each system were calculated by adding the
solvent values for a separate system.
Figure 8 illustrated that, when pure water was replaced with aqueous solutions of
ionic liquids, the number of hydrogen bonds decreased, probably due to the bigger size
of cation and anions. Furthermore, the number of H bonds in the 20% solution is higher
than the one in the 40% solution. However, in the case of water-[C4MIM][Ac] and water-
[C2MIM][Ac] (Supplementary data Figure S1A,B), the [C4MIM] and [C2MIM] cations
do not play important role for H bonding with the PETase, as they do not have groups
that promote H bonds. However, there is no signiﬁcant change in H bonds for different
concentrations of [C4MIM][Ac] and [C2MIM][Ac].

Figure 8 illustrated that , when pure water was replaced with aqueous solutions of 
ionic liquids, the number of hydrogen bonds decreased , probably due to the bigger size 
of cation and anions. Furthermore, the number of H bonds in the 20% solution is higher

promote H bonds. However, there is no significant change in H bonds for different con-
centrations of [C4MIM][Ac] and [C2MIM][Ac]. 
Furthermore, the hydrophobic amino acids are also located at the surface of PETase, 
which are not solvated by water molecules. Therefore, they interact more with the hydro-
phobic part of [C4MIM], [C2MIM], and cholinium cations. The hydrophobic interaction 
took place between hydrophobic amino acids , such as A123, F26, P145, A197, P9, A11, 
F232, and F162, and methyl groups of cholinium, hydrocarbon (-CH2-CH3), or the imidaz-
olium ring of [C4MIM] and [C2MIM] cation. Hence, cholinium cations (Figure 9), 
[C4MIM] and [C2MIM] (Supplementary data Figure S2A,B) are mainly distributed over 
the hydrophobic surface of PETase.

2.6. Radial Distribution Function 
The radial distribution function (RDF) —the probability of finding a particle from a 
reference particle over distance—is a powerful tool in MD simulations for understanding 
how the (CH3)3N+ group of cholinium cation, the ring of imidazolium [C4MIM], and 
[C2MIM] are distributed around the side chain of the hydrophobic surface amino acids. 
The RDF of the (CH3)3N+ group of cholinium cation around the side chain of hydro-
phobic amino acids  at the protein surface  (such as A_123, F_26, P_145, A_197, and P_9 ), 
the RDF of the ring of [C4MIM] around the side chain of hydrophobic amino acids  at the 
protein surface (such as A_123, A1_1, F_232, P_9 , and F_162), and the RDF of the ring of 
[C2MIM] around side chain of hydrophobic amino acids  at the protein surface ( such as 
A_123, A_11, F_232, P_9, and F_162), were calculated, and the results are shown in Figure 
10, Supplementary data Figure S3, and Supplementary data Figure S4, respectively. 
As shown in Figure 10, in different concentrations (40%, 30%, and 20%), the height of 
the first peak (A_123) of the distribution function is larger than the rest of the amino acids. 
According to S3, in different concentrations (40%, 30%, and 20% of [C4MIM][Ac]), the 
height of the first peak (A_123) in the radial distribution function is greater. As shown in 
S4, in all designed systems of [C2MIM][Ac] in different concentrations 40%, 30%, and 20%, 
the height of the first peak (A_123) of the RDF is larger than the rest. Thus, in accordance 
with Figure 10 through S4, the height of the first peak (A_123) for different ionic liquids 
is as follows: 
Alkyl groups of [C2MIM] cation < Alkyl groups of [C4MIM] cation < methyl groups 
of cholinium cation. 
On the other hand, the highest peak in RDF corresponds to the probability of methyl 
groups of cholinium cation around the methyl group of A_123 (Figure 10). From Figure 
10, can be seen that methyl groups of cation showed insignificant differences of probabil-
ity density around the rings of F_26 and P_9. As it was expected from A_123 and P145, 
the probability density of methyl groups of cholinium cation was more for the methyl 
group (side chain) of A_123 than for the ring of P_145. 
Furthermore, by decreasing the concentration of [Ch] 3[PO4], the density of cations 
around A_123 is also decreased. It can be also concluded that with the increase in the 
length of the alkyl chain from [C2MIM] to [C4MIM] , the density of the cations around 
A_123 increased, but by increasing the concentration ( from 20% to 40%) of [C2MIM][Ac] 
and [C4MIM][Ac], the change in the density of these cations is not significant. Thus, the

3. Materials and Methods 
Several different model systems were set up to perform molecular dynamics simula-
tions of wild-type Ideonella sakaiensis PETase enzyme with the PDB code of 5XJH [39]. The 
simulation systems with three different concentration of three ILs of 1 -ethyl-3-methylim-
idazolium acetate [C2MIM][Ac], 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium acetate [C4MIM][Ac], and 
cholinium phosphate (choline phosphate) [Ch] 3[PO4] were prepared.  Recent studies re-
veal that [Ch]3[PO4] is a bi-functional media, capable of both high solubilization (solvent) 
and effective depo lymerization (catalyst) of PET [4]. Furthermore, [Ch] 3[PO4] is also an 
effective depolymerizer (catalysts). Furthermore, the lower cost of cholinium phosphate 
[Ch]3[PO4] ionic liquid has quite a good ability to dissolve PET (10  wt%) [4]. Hence, the 
initial structures with these ionic liquids w ere setup using PACKMOL [40]. As a control, 
the PETase enzyme was also simulated in pure aqueous media. The ligand present ed in 
our study has two TPA rings , which are called BHET. Parametrization of the ligand and

As shown in Figure 10, in different concentrations (40%, 30%, and 20%), the height of
the ﬁrst peak (A_123) of the distribution function is larger than the rest of the amino acids.
According to Figure S3, in different concentrations (40%, 30%, and 20% of [C4MIM][Ac]),
the height of the ﬁrst peak (A_123) in the radial distribution function is greater. As shown
in Figure S4, in all designed systems of [C2MIM][Ac] in different concentrations 40%, 30%,
and 20%, the height of the ﬁrst peak (A_123) of the RDF is larger than the rest. Thus,
in accordance with Figure 10 through Figure S4, the height of the ﬁrst peak (A_123) for
different ionic liquids is as follows:
Alkyl groups of [C2MIM] cation < Alkyl groups of [C4MIM] cation < methyl groups
of cholinium cation.
On the other hand, the highest peak in RDF corresponds to the probability of methyl
groups of cholinium cation around the methyl group of A_123 (Figure 10). From Figure 10,
can be seen that methyl groups of cation showed insigniﬁcant differences of probability
density around the rings of F_26 and P_9. As it was expected from A_123 and P145, the
probability density of methyl groups of cholinium cation was more for the methyl group
(side chain) of A_123 than for the ring of P_145.
Furthermore, by decreasing the concentration of [Ch] 3[PO4], the density of cations
around A_123 is also decreased. It can be also concluded that with the increase in the
length of the alkyl chain from [C2MIM] to [C4MIM], the density of the cations around
A_123 increased, but by increasing the concentration (from 20% to 40%) of [C2MIM][Ac]
and [C4MIM][Ac], the change in the density of these cations is not signiﬁcant. Thus, the
effect of crowding on the stability of the hydrophobic surface is more pronounced in the
presence of [Ch]3[PO4] than other ionic liquids.
3. Materials and Methods
Several different model systems were set up to perform molecular dynamics simulations
of wild-typeIdeonella sakaiensisPETase enzyme with the PDB code of 5XJH [39]. The simulation
systems with three different concentration of three ILs of 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium acetate
[C2MIM][Ac], 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium acetate [C4MIM][Ac], and cholinium phosphate
(choline phosphate) [Ch]3[PO4] were prepared. Recent studies reveal that [Ch]3[PO4] is a
bi-functional media, capable of both high solubilization (solvent) and effective depolymer-
ization (catalyst) of PET [4]. Furthermore, [Ch]3[PO4] is also an effective depolymerizer
(catalysts). Furthermore, the lower cost of cholinium phosphate [Ch]3[PO4] ionic liquid has
quite a good ability to dissolve PET (10 wt%) [4]. Hence, the initial structures with these
ionic liquids were setup using PACKMOL [40]. As a control, the PETase enzyme was also
simulated in pure aqueous media. The ligand presented in our study has two TPA rings,
which are called BHET. Parametrization of the ligand and ILs were carried out using general
amber force ﬁeld GAFF [41], as this forceﬁeld can accurately predict thermodynamic and
transport properties of various ionic liquids [42], and we have successfully used it in our
previous calculations with ILs [43,44]. Each system was placed in a cubic box, sized 12 nm,
using PACKMOL program package. Each model system has been neutralized by counte-
rions. The system was ﬁrst equilibrated in canonical ensemble (NVT) for 500 ps at 300 K
temperature followed by the NPT—the isothermal isobaric ensemble. The temperature
was maintained at 300 K and the pressure was maintained at 1bar with compressibility of
4.6 × 10−5/bar by weak coupling to temperature and pressure baths using the Berendsen
method [45] with relaxation times of 0.1 ps. Van der Waals forces were evaluated with a
Lennard-Jones potential, having 10 Å cut-off, and long-range electrostatic contributions
were evaluated using the particle mesh Ewald method [46] with a direct interaction cut-off
of 10.0 Å. A time step of 2 fs was employed. Lengths of all covalent bonds were constrained
by the linear constraint solver algorithm (LINCS) [ 47]. All simulations were run with
periodic boundary conditions for 150 ns. The MD simulations and related analyses were
performed using the GROMACS program package [ 48–50]. Molecular graphics images
were produced using VMD [51] software and all the graphs were prepared using xmgrace
program.

4. Conclusions
In the current study, the structural basis of the possible co-solvent candidates for the
stability of PETase were analyzed and their interaction patterns were compared. The in
silico-based investigation, using MD simulations, provides new insights into the interacting
residues of the protein with the ionic liquids and water. The effect of ionic liquids cholinium
phosphate [Ch]3[PO4], 1-butyl-3-methyl- imidazolium acetate [C4MIM][Ac], 1-ethyl-3-
methyl-imidazolium acetate [C2MIM][Ac], and their water solutions on Ideonella sakaiensis
PETase with BHET substrate were investigated. Moreover, after the careful structural and
interactive analyses of the ligand with the PETase, it is concluded that among all the above
mentioned ionic liquids, [Ch]3[PO4] has the smallest effect of the structure of PETase and its
interaction with the BHET substrate, which is comparable to the pure water solvent. This
makes the water solution with [Ch]3[PO4] a good candidate for the solvent used during
BHET hydrolysis, which can be used for future investigation.
