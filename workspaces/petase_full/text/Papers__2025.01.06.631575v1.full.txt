Abstract  9 
The biocatalytic recycling of plastics, such as polyethylene terephthalate (PET), promises a sustainable 10 
alternative to our present open-loop cycles. Engineering of PET-hydrolases for this purpose has focused on 11 
improving activity near the glass-transition temperature of the polymer by increasing their thermostability, 12 
neglecting other features of the protein-polymer system that affect enzymatic activity. Here, we isolate the effect 13 
of electrostatics on the activity of a thermophilic PETase by rationally redesigning its surface charge, while 14 
preserving its thermodynamic properties. The enzyme variant, SfInv, shows orders of magnitude improvements 15 
in binding affinity and in activity towards untreated plastic films, with inverted morphological preference. When 16 
combined, the wildtype enzyme and SfInv act synergistically, revealing an entirely new mechanism for 17 
cooperative activities driven by complimentary electrostatic interactions at the PET surface. These findings 18 
highlight unexplored avenues in improving PETase function through the control of morphological preference or 19 
introduction of protein cooperativity by exploiting protein electrostatics.  20 
Introduction  21 
Using enzymes for biocatalytic depolymerisation of plastics provides a low-energy and low-resource alternative to 22 
the current open-loop recycling of common consumer materials1. In the case of polyethylene terephthalate 23 
(PET), this process allows for the nearly quantitative recovery of the constituent monomers terephthalic acid 24 
(TPA) and ethylene glycol (EG), making new routes to (bio)-chemical valorisation and repolymerisation 25 
accessible2,3. The range of PETases, enzymes capable of carrying out this conversion, has also been expanded in 26 
recent years through discovery and further engineering4–8. Most of these research efforts have targeted large-27 
scale bio-recycling through increases in enzymatic thermostability, allowing for improved reaction rates and 28 
depolymerisation extents by taking advantage of higher polymer chain mobility near the bulk PET glass transition 29 
temperature (Tg)9–14. This primary focus on thermostability has deepened our understanding of 30 
thermodynamically important structural features of PET-degrading enzymes;10,14 however, it has left obscure 31 
much of the fundamental nature of the interactions between the proteins and the polymer surface, which 32 
ultimately governs enzymatic selectivity, optimal conditions and industrial performance. 33 
Plastic-degrading enzymes face a multitude of challenges associated with the physical-chemical properties of 34 
their solid, hydrophobic substrate beyond polymer chain dynamics, which cannot be overcome by enhanced 35 
enzymatic thermostability and higher reaction temperatures. On solid substrates, catalytic activities can be 36 
influenced by restricted diffusion, variations in the density of surface charge, degree of crystallinity, and protein-37 
protein interactions15–19. These complications have been shown to underlie some of the more counter intuitive 38 
behaviours we observe in natural PETases, such as diminished activities at elevated enzyme 39 
concentrations,17,20,21 which prevent some members of the enzyme family from being used at an industrial scale. 40 
Studying such attributes can therefore clarify fundamental enzyme-polymer interactions underlying catalytic 41 
activities, allowing us to better engineer biocatalysts towards industrial recycling applications. 42 
In this study we examine SfCut, a highly active, thermostable PETase from Saccharopolyspora flava most closely 43 
related to PHL78 (Figure 1), previously reported4 to have an exceptional preference for micronized PET powder 44 
over amorphous PET film. We sought to understand the molecular basis for this morphological preference, 45 
hoping to gain insight into how substrate specificity is controlled. Through focused structural analysis, we 46 
identified that the principal feature differentiating SfCut from other PETases was its markedly negative charge; to 47 
explore the implications of this property, we used a rational protein design approach that maintained the 48 
thermodynamic stability of SfCut while inverting its overall charge. This allowed us to clarify the role of protein 49 
electrostatics in substrate morphological preference and provided new insights into how we can use protein 50

charge to exploit protein-protein interactions at the plastic surface. By connecting structural analysis with careful 51 
protein design, this study contributes to advancing the development of more efficient targeted strategies for 52 
improving enzymes for plastic biodegradation. 53 
Results and Discussion  54 
Structural analysis of SfCut and surface charge redesign  55 
To understand the parameters that influence the substrate morphological preference of SfCut, we carefully 56 
examined its structure. Like other reported PETases, SfCut (PDB: 7QJP) adopts a typical alpha-beta hydrolase 57 
fold, with a conserved disulfide bond between Cys243 and Cys260. The active site matches that of a typical PET-58 
degrading serine hydrolase, composed of a catalytic triad (Ser132, Asp178 and His210), a conserved tryptophan 59 
(Trp157), an oxyanion hole (Phe64 and Met133) and a lipase box. Despite these features, SfCut is strikingly 60 
different to other highly active PETases owing to its negative surface charge and total charge density of -0.55 61 
per kDa at neutral pH. These charges are mostly found on the surface opposite to the active site, away from 62 
residues expected to directly interact with the plastic (Figure 2a/c). This pronounced charge appears to modulate 63 
the morphological selectivity of SfCut, causing its activity to drop considerably between pH 6.0 and pH 7.5 on 64 
films while it increases on amorphous powders4. As PET has a stable, negative zeta potential independent of pH 65 
at these conditions22, the changes in depolymerisation rates implicate the involvement of both protein and 66 
polymer electrostatics as significant factors in these properties. 67 
We aimed to investigate how protein charge influences substrate morphology preference of SfCut by extensively 68 
redesigning its surface. To ensure clarity in our analysis, we sought to isolate the effects of charge substitutions 69 
from inadvertent changes to enzyme activity caused by variations in protein thermostability. To avoid this, we 70 
selected a manual design approach over computational methods, as the later have been constructed in a way 71 
that produces stabilised proteins as outputs. For design purposes, all charged residues in the crystallographic 72 
structure, including histidines involved in salt bridges, were identified and counted towards the overall protein 73 
charge (-16). Owing to the lack of observed crystallographic density, we did not count the first and last glutamic 74 
acid residues in the sequence. 75 
To minimise disruption of the protein-polymer interface and the active site, only residues at a distance greater 76 
than 10 Å from the catalytic triad were considered for mutation. For the purposes of design, we ranked residues 77 
based on how amenable to change they might be, excluding those that were buried, involved in critical polar 78 
contacts, stabilising secondary structural elements, or providing an ambiguous structural role. Our choices of 79 
sites for mutation were supported by referencing the position-specific scoring matrix (PSSM) of SfCut 80 
(Supplementary Spreadsheet 1) excluding residues at highly conserved sites. As a priority for mutation, we 81 
focused on changing isolated negatively charged residues on Sf Cut’s surface, considering structural context to 82 
minimise steric clashes and preserve native contacts. Once all the free residues amenable to change were 83 
exhausted, we proceeded to consider mutations within larger salt-bridge clusters followed by neutral surface 84 
residues. In the interest of investigating solely the effect of the surface charge, we did not intentionally introduce 85 
mutations that could create new stabilising interactions.  86 
The redesigned variant, here referred to as Sf Inverse (SfInv), incorporates 24 mutations (Supplementary Table 87 
2; Supplementary Figure 2) at sites with an average information content of 0.41, resulting in an overall charge of 88 
+16 (Δcharge of +32) and a charge density of + 0.54 per kDa at neutral pH. Structural predictions using 89 
ColabFold23,24 and ESMfold25 (pLDDT > 0.9, Supplementary Figure 3) closely align with the crystal structure of 90 
SfCut, having Cα RMSD values of 0.38 Å and 0.52 Å, respectively. These results suggested that the redesign was 91 
likely to preserve the protein fold, without introducing structural changes that could impact enzymatic function.  92 
Biophysical characterisation of SfInv 93 
We sought to confirm that the extensive surface modifications introduced to SfInv did not impact its biophysical 94 
properties or its ability to hydrolyse PET plastic. SfInv expressed in E. coli at comparable levels to the wildtype 95 
enzyme, and its identity was confirmed by mass spectrometry after purification (Supplementary Spreadsheet 2). 96 
Both SfInv and SfCut showed similar melting temperatures and thermo-kinetic profiles when analysed by DSC. 97 
The apparent Tm were 73 °C for SfInv and 76 °C for SfCut (Figure 2d, Supplementary Figure 4, Supplementary 98 
Table 3), with both enzymes unfolding in a single irreversible step therefore realising our design ambition of 99 
minimising the impact on thermodynamic stability. 100 
The protein fold and success of the design were further confirmed through circular dichroism (CD) and structure 101 
determination by X-ray crystallography. SfInv readily crystallised under several conditions, and its structure was 102 
solved to a final resolution of 1.17 Å (Supplementary Table 4). The asymmetric unit in the structure contained 103

two chains, which aligned with a Cα RMSD 0.24 Å, and the more complete chain B was used for structural 104 
analysis. The solved crystallographic structure of SfInv (PDB: 9EWR) confirmed that the enzyme retained its 105 
alpha-beta hydrolase fold (Figure 2b) and exhibited the expected positively charged surface (Figure 2c). 106 
Structural alignment with the wildtype protein yielded a Cα RMSD 0.36 Å and a TM-score26 of 0.99 (Figure 2b), 107 
demonstrating that the overall fold and structure were preserved, despite extensive modification. We were able 108 
to confirm that no new stabilising interactions were introduced, and that the backbone conformation, disulfide 109 
bond, and salt-bridges remained largely intact, with the only exceptions being due to crystallographic contacts 110 
spanning symmetry related monomers (Supplementary Figure 5). CD also revealed that both proteins remain 111 
well folded under the reported optimum reaction temperature of SfCut (50 °C) (Figure 2e). 112 
With confidence in the achievement of our structural design goals, we explored the activity of SfInv on 113 
amorphous PET powder. SfInv exhibited an optimum reaction temperature at 50 °C, similar to that of the 114 
wildtype enzyme (Figure 2d), but demonstrated a higher pH optimum (pH 9) compared to SfCut (pH 7.5). This 115 
shift to a higher pH optimum aligns with the activity profiles of positively charged PETases, which demonstrate 116 
pH optima above pH 84,27. We anticipated that the changes in the surface charge between SfCut and SfInv could 117 
lead to substantial differences in their binding affinity to PET. Indeed, despite its relatively high activity, SfCut 118 
showed no appreciable binding to the amorphous PET powder under tested conditions (Figure 3b, 119 
Supplementary Figure 6). This stands in clear contrast to SfInv, which demonstrated a Kd of less than 4.5 nM 120 
with a surface coverage (max) of 10-16.5 nmol g-1 PET, consistent with characteristics measured with other 121 
highly active PETases28. These results confirmed the success of our design efforts, and provided a basis for us to 122 
examine the isolated effects of protein charge on PET-degrading activities and morphological preference. 123 
The role of surface charge on protein-polymer interactions 124 
To explore how their significant difference in protein surface charge manifested in terms of depolymerase activity 125 
across PET morphologies, we examined SfCut and SfInv on three PET substrates: amorphous powder (aPow), 126 
amorphous film (aFilm) and semi-crystalline powder (cPow) (Figure 3a, Supplementary Figure 7). SfInv 127 
demonstrated higher activity than the wildtype enzyme across all substrates tested, with broader pH and 128 
temperature optima, as well as three-fold and six-fold more product release on semi-crystalline powders and 129 
amorphous powders respectively. Our results confirmed previous observations that SfCut has a considerably 130 
lower activity on films compared to powders, independent of substrate crystallinity. In contrast, SfInv showed an 131 
inverted selectivity: its activity on films was enhanced, approximately 2-fold higher than on powders, 132 
demonstrating that enzyme specificity for different substrate morphologies is a genetically encoded, engineerable 133 
property. This corresponds to over 200-fold enhancement in the activity on amorphous PET films compared to 134 
SfCut, effected simply by surface charge inversion. Despite the substantial difference in evident binding affinity 135 
to amorphous powders, both enzymes show activity saturation on amorphous films above 250 nM, confirming 136 
that binding alone is insufficient to explain their catalytic properties (Supplementary Figure 8). Although not an 137 
intended outcome of our design process, SfInv demonstrated a similar level of conversion as the most promising 138 
industrialised enzyme, LCCICCG, 10, at their respective optima (Figure 3a). In a direct comparison at 50 °C, SfInv 139 
outperformed LCCICCG at laboratory scale (Supplementary Figure 9). 140 
Although the greatly enhanced binding affinity observed with SfInv can partially explain its higher enzymatic 141 
activity, differences in enzymatic morphological preference must be caused by a change in how the differently 142 
charged enzymes interact with the polymer. Electrostatic interactions between the polymer surface and the 143 
enzymes can be mediated by both unspecific and specific interactions with ions in solution, therefore we 144 
assessed the activities of both enzymes at a range of ionic strengths, using both monovalent and divalent salts. 145 
The negatively charged wildtype enzyme, SfCut, showed a monotonic rise in activity on amorphous films as ionic 146 
strength increased from 0 M to 4 M, with a relative activity enhancement of nearly 600-fold (Figure 3c, & 147 
Supplementary Figure 10a). This behaviour contrasts with that of some of the best-performing PETases, such as 148 
LCCICCG, where the depolymerase activity is not affected by the ionic strength of the solution (Figure 3c & 149 
Supplementary Figure 10b). For SfInv the effect of ionic strength was less pronounced (Figure 3c), with activity 150 
peaking at 250 mM ionic strength at approximately five-fold higher than in buffer with 0 M salt, before declining 151 
to approximately 7% of its maximal value at 2 M (Supplementary Figure 10a). These results on amorphous films 152 
were consistent across different salts (Supplementary Figure 10), indicating that the selectivity observed in SfCut 153 
and SfInv is driven by electrostatic interactions between the enzyme and the polymer surface, rather than by 154 
specific interactions mediated by salts. 155 
Interestingly, the effect of ionic strength on the enzyme activity was distinct on amorphous powders. SfInv 156 
showed the same monotonic rise in activity as SfCut, although less pronounced (Supplementary Figure 10c), with 157 
both enzymes seeing no benefit to activity above an ionic strength of 1 M. Overall, positively charged SfInv sees 158 
relatively moderate benefits of increased ionic strength, with a greater effect observed on powders than films, 159

whereas SfCut shows substantial improvements in activity with salt, benefitting more on films than powders. This 160 
demonstrates that the interplay between the electrostatic fields of the polymer and the protein varies between 161 
polymer morphologies, influencing the observed selectivity of the two enzymes, with notably more dominant 162 
effects on PET film digestions.  163 
Despite the benefit of ionic strength on the activity of SfCut, it is important to note that the total product 164 
released by SfCut did not surpass that of SfInv at its maximum under the conditions tested. Additionally, while 165 
increased salt concentration did have an effect on the apparent Tm of SfCut, causing an increase of 4 °C at 2 M 166 
sodium chloride, no such change was observed for SfInv (Supplementary Figure 11). This suggests that some of 167 
the activity improvement in SfCut with increasing ionic strength may be a result of enhanced thermostability, an 168 
effect that is absent in SfInv. 169 
SfInv shows greatly enhanced PET-degrading activity at pilot scale and on post-consumer waste 170 
The improved selectivity of SfInv towards amorphous PET films under analytical conditions suggested a potential 171 
for digesting unmodified amorphous films at pilot scale, pH-controlled experiments. Under these conditions (1 172 
mgenzyme gPET-1 with high solids loading of 20% w/v)1,29, the wildtype enzyme (SfCut) demonstrates limited 173 
activity, achieving less than 1% substrate conversion and a monomeric product yield of 0.15 g/L as measured by 174 
HPLC. In contrast, the engineered SfInv exhibited significantly higher efficiency, achieving approximately 8% 175 
substrate conversion within 24 hours (Figure 4a), with a monomer yield of 18.6 g/L. Strikingly, at substantially 176 
lower enzyme loading (1 M, ~0.15 mgenzyme gPET-1), SfInv achieved the same high levels of conversion within the 177 
same time frame, suggesting there is substantial potential for reaction condition optimisation to maximise the 178 
digestion of amorphous PET films while reducing resource requirements (Supplementary Figure 12).  179 
Comparable results were also found to be true on untreated post-consumer waste (PCW) in the form of PET-film 180 
sandwich trays (Figure 4b, Supplementary Table 5, Supplementary Figures 13 and 14). SfInv efficiently digested 181 
over 10% of the waste within 24 hours, achieving a measured yield of 19.25 g/L, while SfCut yielded negligible 182 
amounts of product (Figure 4b). This further highlights that it may be possible to engineer enzymes specifically 183 
targeting the processing of complex post-consumer waste streams of PET with limited pre-treatments, upstream 184 
of current methods reliant on resource-intensive preparation of micronized powders.29 185 
SfCut and SfInv act synergistically in degrading aPET films 186 
Building on the evident enhancement in activity and change in selectivity of SfInv over SfCut on PET substrates, 187 
we sought to understand whether the enzymes act at distinct sites on the PET surfaces with differing geometries 188 
or electrostatic charge, which could account for the observed differences in morphological preferences and allow 189 
for the enzymes to work synergistically in degrading PET. Specifically, we hypothesised that the amount of 190 
product released from a mixture of the two enzymes could exceed the sum of the product release for each 191 
enzyme individually at its respective concentration. To quantify this, we define synergy as:  192 
(1)     𝑆𝑦𝑛𝑒𝑟𝑔𝑦 ≡
𝑃𝑅𝑚𝑖𝑥
𝑃𝑅𝑆𝑓𝐶𝑢𝑡+𝑃𝑅𝑆𝑓𝐼𝑛𝑣
> 1 193 
where PRSfCut, PRSfInv, and PRmix are the product released by each enzyme at specified concentrations, and their 194 
mixture, respectively. When SfCut and SfInv were mixed at different concentrations and ratios, and applied to 195 
PET films, we observed clear evidence of synergistic activity (Figure 5a). The effect is most notable at lower 196 
concentrations of SfInv, with a synergy value above 2 (Figure 5c). However, at elevated concentrations of SfInv, 197 
the synergistic benefit is lost, possibly owing to surface crowding17,20 or competition for binding sites on the 198 
plastic substrate. In contrast, increasing SfCut does not eliminate the observed synergy, suggesting that each 199 
enzyme plays a distinct role when acting in concert on the film surface.  200 
To further clarify the mechanism of the synergistic activity, we explored potential causes involving the differing 201 
enzyme charges. One possibility was that the enzymes might assemble in solution in a way that enhances their 202 
stability and activity. To test this, we incubated the enzymes together at elevated concentrations (~ 34 M, 203 
compared to the 0.05-1 M enzyme concentrations used in polymer digestions) and evaluated whether they form 204 
complexes by size exclusion chromatography on the mixture (Figure 5e); no shift was observed in the elution 205 
profile, suggesting that the enzymes do not appreciably bind to each other in solution. To exclude the possibility 206 
that the enzymes are targeting different sites on the polymer chain and therefore modifying the plastic surface 207 
such that it becomes a better substrate for the oppositely charged enzyme, we examined whether the enzymes 208 
showed a stepwise synergy. The activities of the enzymes were evaluated on amorphous PET film coupons that 209 
had been pre-treated with either SfCut or SfInv (Figure 5d), with no significant difference in activity observed on 210 
films pre-treated with either enzyme, showing that the surface targets for both enzymes are largely the same.  211

Given these findings, and that SfCut alone shows negligible binding to PET, it is likely that the synergy observed 212 
at principally low concentrations of SfInv is a result of charge masking, similar to that of the ionic strength 213 
experiments. In this case, SfInv binds to the plastic surface masking the negative charges of the polymer and 214 
any bound SfCut, which in turn allows more SfCut to bind productively. Similar effects have been previously 215 
observed with the use of synthetic surfactants30, where anionic detergents were used to increase the negative 216 
surface charge of the polymer, therefore attracting the cationic IsPETase31 to the surface, accelerating enzymatic 217 
degradation. In this case, however, the enzymes themselves are modulating the surface charge. 218 
The difference in how the film surface is modified by the enzymes acting individually or as a mixture can be 219 
visualised after partial digestion of PET coupons using SEM (Figure 5b). SfCut increases the roughness of the 220 
surface leaving what appears to be thread-like crystalline regions behind, whilst SfInv shows broad pitting, a 221 
surface modification commonly observed with other highly active PETases18,31. However, with the enzyme 222 
mixture, an unusual double-pitting effect is observed. Broad pits similar in dimensions to those formed by SfInv 223 
contain deeper pits within them, perhaps from SfCut being ‘funnelled’ into the centre of areas where the 224 
positively charged SfInv masks the negative charge on the surface of the film. 225 
As far as we are aware, this is the first time that synergy has been observed in enzymes directly modifying 226 
plastic surfaces. These results reveal a previously unexplored mechanism by which enzyme mixtures can 227 
enhance the degradation of plastic through beneficial electrostatic interactions, offering new opportunities for 228 
improving bio-recycling through synergistic enzymatic activity. 229 
Conclusions 230 
Prior to this study the most significant changes in the activity of PET degrading enzymes were realised by 231 
increasing the performance of the biocatalysts at elevated temperatures, where the polymer is more dynamic. 232 
This focus on thermostability has obfuscated how other physical-chemical properties of the polymer surface 233 
influence the activity of PETases, limiting our understanding on the enzyme-substrate interactions at play. 234 
Here, by rational redesign of the surface of a highly active PETase, SfCut, we were able to investigate the impact 235 
of electrostatics on enzymatic activity in the absence of confounding factors like thermodynamic stability or 236 
changes in features near the active site13,30,32. Through carefully crafted studies on the effects of ionic strength 237 
on product released from different substrates, we demonstrate that substrate selectivity is driven by polymer 238 
morphologies having distinct electrostatic profiles, and therefore influencing enzyme-surface interactions in 239 
contrasting manners. Measured zeta potentials are known to have smaller magnitudes on rough surfaces than on 240 
smooth surfaces33,34, and the impacts of this are likely manifesting here. Within the diffuse layer around the 241 
neatively charged polymer surface, the anionic SfCut experiences repulsion while the cationic SfInv experiences 242 
attraction, with these interactions being more pronounced on smooth films than on rough powders. 243 
By focusing on electrostatic interactions governing the activity of PET degrading enzymes at the polymer surface, 244 
we demonstrated that it is possible to not only tune the selectivity of PETases for substrates of differing 245 
morphologies, but also increase their binding affinity through the rational engineering of surface charge away 246 
from the active site. The process of introducing large scale changes in protein surface electrostatic potential in 247 
SfInv also afforded substantially improved activities on all PET substrates tested, exposing the benefits of using 248 
an electrostatically-oriented approach to engineering plastic depolymerases for improved activities at the low salt 249 
concentrations relevant for industrial processes. As we demonstrate through the preservation of the 250 
thermodynamic stability of SfInv, this approach is complementary to established methods designed to enhance 251 
the thermostability of enzymes and can be introduced in the engineering process towards better industrial PET 252 
depolymerases. 253 
We also found that synergistic activity between PETases can be realised through the applications of 254 
complementarily charged proteins. While the enhancement in activity we observed on films is relatively modest, 255 
just over two-fold, this advance is the first method for building synergy into enzymes acting at plastic surfaces 256 
and opens the door to engineering campaigns specifically tailored towards improving it. In contrast to synergies 257 
between enzyme pairs acting at different chemical sites on a substrate, the mechanism of synergy in this case 258 
appears to depend upon the electrostatic masking effect of the positively charged SfInv when bound to PET, 259 
which in turn promotes the activity of the negatively charged SfCut. This mechanism is likely generalisable and 260 
opens the possibility of exploiting this discovery to reduce the enzyme loading needed for industrial processes or 261 
to create dynamic mixtures of enzymes capable of accommodating variations in surface electrostatics across 262 
substrates or over the course of depolymerisations.  263

Through isolating the effect of electrostatics on Sf Cut’s activity on PET, we have been able to establish an 264 
engineering approach that allows tuning of binding affinity, improvement of enzymatic turnover, control of 265 
substrate morphological preference, and introduction of functional synergy in PETases. These insights not only 266 
expand the repertoire of established features under the control of rational protein design for plastic 267 
depolymerases, but are also likely not limited to PET. As such, we expect these results to be translatable to 268 
enzymes capable of digesting a broad range of synthetic polymers, and that the considerations established here 269 
will prove crucial when finding and engineering enzymes to tackle plastics found in complex industrial and post-270 
consumer waste streams.  271 
Materials and Methods 272 
Amorphous PET film (ES30-FM-000145) and semi-crystalline PET powder (ES30-PD-006031) were purchased 273 
from Goodfellow. Post-consumer plastic waste was obtained from PET sandwich packaging. All reagents for 274 
molecular biology and strains were purchased from New England Biolabs. All other reagents and buffer 275 
components were acquired from Fisher Scientific or Merck, unless stated otherwise. 276 
Phylogenetic and sequence analysis: Protein sequences of reported PETases were aligned using 277 
ClustalOmega35 with default settings. A phylogenetic tree was built from the sequence alignment using IQtree36 278 
with 100,000 UltraFast bootstraps37, nearest neighbour interchange (NNI) search, automatic model selection38, 279 
and 100,000 cycles of single branch testing (SH-aLRT)39. Sequence identities were found using protein BLAST40 280 
with default settings. The position specific scoring matrix was calculated in POSSUM41 using Uniref50 as the 281 
database, with 3 iterations and an E-value threshold of 0.001.  282 
Manual surface redesign: The surface redesign was done manually using the crystal structure of SfCut (611, 283 
PDB: 7QJP). All charged residues with crystallographic densities were identified, including histidines involved in 284 
salt bridges or catalytic contacts; those that were not interacting were counted as non-charged. Redesign 285 
focused on charged surface residues more than 10 Å away from the active site not involved in any polar or 286 
evident structural contacts, when these were exhausted mutations within larger salt-bridges and to uninvolved 287 
surface neutral residues were considered. No mutations were added to purposefully increase or impair enzymatic 288 
stability and activity. The overall charge was changed from -16 to +16, by mutating negatively charged as well 289 
as neutral surface residues mostly not involved in stabilisation of the protein structure by visual inspection. The 290 
final SfInv sequence was modelled using ColabFold/AlphaFold223,24 and ESMFold25 to confirm that no disruption 291 
to the protein structure by the design was predicted.  292 
Plasmid construction: Genes for SfCut and SfInv were synthesised by Twist Bioscience. SfCut was cloned by 293 
Twist directly into pET21b(+), SfInv was synthesised as a gene fragment and cloned into pET28b(+) using 294 
Gibson assembly. The assembly mixture was transformed into NEB5 competent cells, DNA purified (Qiagen 295 
miniprep kit), and sequence confirmed by Sanger sequencing (Eurofins Genomics). Both constructs include a C-296 
terminal His-tag, and were sequence optimised for Escherichia coli. 297 
Protein expression and purification: Proteins were expressed using BL21(DE3) E. coli strain. Cells were 298 
grown in terrific broth with the selection antibiotic at 37 °C, in 4.5 L cultures in bioreactors (Eppendorf BioFlo 299 
120w) with pH and air flow control (Biocommand Bioprocessing Software). Protein expression was induced at an 300 
OD600 of 1.2 for 18 hours at 20 °C, using a final concentration of 1 mM IPTG. Harvested cells were resuspended 301 
in HisTrap binding buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 300 mM sodium chloride, 40 mM imidazole) with nuclease 302 
(expressed in house) and 25mM of magnesium added. The resuspended cells were then homogenised, sonicated 303 
(Amplitude 40, 3 sec ON, 9 sec OFF for a total processing time of 6-10mins), and clarified by centrifugation at 304 
55,000 x g. Clarified lysate was filtered through a 0.45 m MCE filter and purified by affinity chromatography on 305 
a HisTrap FF (5 mL) column, eluted over a gradient up to 500 mM imidazole. The protein peak was further 306 
purified by size exclusion chromatography using a Superdex 16/600 HiLoad 75pg equilibrated with 50 mM 307 
sodium phosphate pH 7.5, and 100 mM sodium chloride. SDS-PAGE was run to assess purity.  308 
Differential scanning calorimetry: Apparent melting temperature (Tm) values for the purified proteins were 309 
determined using a MicroCal PEAQ-DSC with automated sampler (Malvern Panalytical), using a buffer matched to 310 
that of the size exclusion chromatography step as reference. The analyses were performed using 1 mg/mL of 311 
protein, at a temperature range of 30-100 °C, using low feedback, at 192 °C/ hour, 96 °C/ hour, 90 °C/ hour, 48 312 
°C/ hour, 24 °C/ hour, 12 °C/ hour and 6 °C/ hour. Baseline subtraction was performed using the instrument’s 313 
data analysis software. Calfitter 2.042 was used to derive the activation energy (Eact), the heat capacity change 314 
(ΔCp), the activation enthalpy change (ΔH‡), and the reference temperature of the irreversible melting step (Tact) 315 
using the thermal denaturation model with the lowest SSR value.  316

Structure determination by X-ray crystallography: SfInv was concentrated to 10 mg/mL and crystallised 317 
by the sitting drop vapour diffusion method using a Mosquito crystallisation robot (SPT Labtech) and SWISSCI 3-318 
lens low profile plates in condition C8 of the SaltRx screen (Hampton Research): 0.1 M Tris pH 8.5 and 3.5 M 319 
sodium formate. Crystals were cryo-protected with 20% glycerol before flash-freezing in liquid nitrogen. 320 
Diffraction data were collected at the Diamond Light Source (Didcot, UK) at beamline I03 and automatically 321 
processed with the AutoPROC+STARANISO43,44 pipeline on ISPyB. The structure was solved by molecular 322 
replacement on CCP4 Cloud using Molrep45 and an AlphaFold2-model23. Coot was used for model building, 323 
followed by model refinement using Refmac46. The final structure was evaluated with MolProbity47, and the 324 
structure has been visualised in VMD48 and ChimeraX49. The structure was deposited in the PDB with code 9EWR. 325 
Data and refinement statistics can be found in Supplementary Table 4.  326 
Structural characterisation by circular dichroism: Spectra were collected on a PiStar-180 (Applied 327 
Photophysics) with water bath temperature control. Protein samples were analysed at a concentration of 0.1 328 
mg/mL in 10 mM sodium phosphate pH 7.5 with 20 mM sodium chloride at 50 °C, in a 1 mm stoppered quartz 329 
cuvette. Data collected at wavelengths between 200 and 260 nm, with half bandwidth of 1.5 nm and a 330 
wavelength interval of 0.5 nm (1 sec per point, 5 repeats), were averaged and baseline subtracted using a 331 
matched buffer blank. Raw ellipticity data was converted to mean residue ellipticity by dividing by the path 332 
length, concentration, molecular weight and number of residues.  333 
Amorphous PET powder production and analysis: Sheets of amorphous PET film were cut into strips, 334 
immersed in liquid nitrogen and cryo-milled at 2,400 rpm in a SM300 cutting mill (Retsch), with a bottom sieve 335 
with 4 mm square holes. Subsequently, this product was reduced in size further by immersing in liquid nitrogen 336 
and cryo-milling at 18,000 rpm in a ZM200 centrifugal mill, with a 0.12 mm ring sieve with trapezoidal holes. The 337 
particle size and crystallinity of the cryo-milled amorphous PET powder was compared to that of the purchased 338 
semi-crystalline PET powder, as well as the PET film, using a CAMSIZER X2 (Microtrac MRB) and Differential 339 
Scanning Calorimetry (Supplementary Table 5, Supplementary Figures 13 and 15).  340 
Reaction quenching and product quantification by HPLC: All reactions were quenched by addition of 341 
equal volume of HPLC-grade methanol, and PET solids removed. Samples were centrifuged at 10,000 x g, using 342 
a table-top centrifuge, prior to analyte quantification by HPLC. For samples with subsequent polymer analysis, 343 
the PET was washed by rinsing three times with a 1% (w/v) SDS solution, followed by multiple rinses with 344 
distilled water. The partially digested polymer substrates were then dried at room temperature under vacuum 345 
before analysis. The HPLC analysis was adapted from a reported UPLC method14 to allow for HPLC pressures as 346 
previously described50. Samples were evaluated on a pre-equilibrated C18 Kinetex LC column (00B-4605-AN) 347 
with a guard, at 1.1 mL min-1 with 0.1% formic acid and acetonitrile as the stationary and mobile phases 348 
respectively. Samples were prepared with a known dilution to an absorbance at 240 nm of around 1.0 before 10 349 
L were loaded onto the column using an automatic sampler (Agilent). Samples were eluted with an isocratic 350 
elution at 13% mobile phase for 0.87 minutes, followed by a step to 95% mobile phase for 1.12 minutes and a 351 
re-equilibration at 13% mobile phase until a total time of 3.6 minutes. Peaks were integrated using Agilent’s 352 
OpenLab software and the product quantification was performed against calibration curves of known standards 353 
(TPA, MHET, BHET). An example of the HPLC trace and elution times is provided in Supplementary Figure 16. 354 
PET degradation assays at small scale: Unless stated otherwise, small scale assays were set up in 1.5 mL 355 
tubes with 11 mg of PET substrate, and incubated in triplicate 500 L reactions for 24 hours at 300 rpm on 356 
thermomixers. A final concentration of 100 nM enzyme and 100 mM sodium chloride was used, in 50 mM sodium 357 
phosphate pH 7.5, or 50 mM glycine pH 9.0 for SfCut and SfInv respectively. In the case of the ionic strength 358 
tests 50 mM HEPES pH 7.5 and 50 mM CHES pH 9.0 were used instead, with varying amounts of sodium 359 
chloride, magnesium chloride and sodium sulphate. These buffers were chosen in order to minimise their 360 
contribution towards the ionic strength. Nevertheless, the buffer component was fully accounted for in the ionic 361 
strength calculations by considering their pKas, and calculating the concentration and charges of their respective 362 
ionic species. The ionic strength of the solution was calculated by using the formula 𝐼 =   ½  𝑛 ∑ (𝐶𝑖 𝑍𝑖 )𝑖 , where 𝐼 363 
represents the ionic strength, 𝑛 is the number of ions in solution, 𝐶𝑖  is the concentration of a specific ion in moles 364 
per litre, and 𝑍𝑖  the valence of the particular ion species. For the temperature and pH optima experiments, the 365 
reactions were performed at three temperatures (40 °C, 50 °C and 60 °C) and using three different buffers (50 366 
mM MES pH 6.0, 50 mM sodium phosphate pH 7.5, and 50 mM glycine pH 9.0) with 100 mM sodium chloride. To 367 
determine the concentration dependency for each of the enzymes, both were tested individually, and together at 368 
equimolar ratios, to a final enzyme concentration ranging from 0 - 1 M.  369 
Binding isotherms: Binding affinities to the plastic were measure in two ways as described previously28. All 370 
samples were incubated for 1 hour at 4 °C with rolling in low-binding 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tubes (Eppendorf) 371 
to prevent loss from non-specific binding. After centrifugation, free enzyme concentrations were determined 372

using a Micro BCA protein assay kit (Thermo Scientific) with a calibration curve derived for the respective 373 
enzyme. 150 L samples were mixed with the Micro BCA Working Reagent as per the kit’s instructions, and 374 
incubated for 1 hour at 50 °C in a covered microtiter plate mixing at 300 rpm. 200 L samples were measured at 375 
562 nm on a plate reader. Substrate saturation: Amorphous PET powder at a fixed substrate loading (100 g/L for 376 
SfCut or 50 g/L for SfInv) was incubated with 0.05 - 1.5 M enzyme. The substrate coverage was calculated 377 
using the equation 𝛤 =
𝐸𝑡𝑜𝑡 – 𝐸𝑓𝑟𝑒𝑒
𝐿𝑃𝐸𝑇 , and the Kd obtained by fitting the data to the Langmuir adsorption isotherm 378 
equation 𝛤 =
𝛤 max 𝐸𝑓𝑟𝑒𝑒
𝐸𝑓𝑟𝑒𝑒 + 𝐾𝑑
, where 𝛤𝑚𝑎𝑥 is the substrate coverage at surface saturation. Enzyme saturation: 1 M 379 
enzyme was incubated with substrate loads ranging from 0 – 200 g/L. The bound fraction was calculated from 380 
the difference between total and free enzyme concentrations. Kd and max were derived from fitting the data to 381 
the equation28 𝜃 =

) − √(1 +

)] , where the fraction bound 𝜃 =382 
𝐸𝑡𝑜𝑡 – 𝐸𝑓𝑟𝑒𝑒
𝐸𝑡𝑜𝑡 , and LPET is the experimental solids loading.  383 
PET degradation assays – pilot scale and post-consumer waste: Duplicate reactions were undertaken in 384 
250mL MiniBio Reactors (Applikon Biotechnology) to a total reaction volume of 100 mL. Reactions were carried 385 
out at 20% (w/v) solids loading and a final enzyme concentration of 1 mg of enzyme per gram of PET. Reactions 386 
were incubated at 50 °C, stirring at 200 rpm for 24 hours. Substrates used in the reactions were amorphous PET 387 
film or washed and dried post-consumer plastic film waste, roughly cut into 1 cm x 1 cm squares. All pH probes 388 
were calibrated immediately prior to analysis, pH changes were followed and maintained by the automatic 389 
addition of 1 M (SfCut) or 5 M (SfInv) freshly prepared sodium hydroxide via the system pump, which was 390 
calibrated prior to the experiment. The base addition was followed as a function of time by the Lucullus® Process 391 
Information Management System software and converted to percentage hydrolysis by calculating the moles of 392 
TPA neutralised. At the end of the incubation, samples were taken and quenched as described previously using 393 
an equal volume of methanol for HPLC analysis. The PET film was recovered by filtration, rinsed thoroughly with 394 
deionised water, and allowed to dry before weighing to confirm depolymerisation extent.  395 
Polymer analysis and characterisation: Polymer DSC was performed on a Netzsch DSC 214 Polyma, 396 
equipped with aluminium crucibles and lids. Approximately 10 mg of samples was heated from 25 to 300 °C at a 397 
rate of 10 °C per minute in a nitrogen atmosphere. Measurements were performed in triplicate, and sample 398 
crystallinity was calculated using the equation % 𝐂𝐫𝐲𝐬𝐭𝐚𝐥𝐥𝐢𝐧𝐢𝐭𝐲 =  
∆𝐇𝐦−∆𝐇𝐜
∆𝐇𝐦° , where ΔHm is the enthalpy of melting 399 
of the sample ΔHc is the enthalpy of crystallisation of the sample and ΔHm° is the enthalpy of melting for a 400 
theoretical 100 % crystalline sample (taken as 140.1 Jg-1). 401 
PET degradation assays for investigating synergy: To quantitate synergy across enzyme concentrations 402 
and ratios, amorphous PET coupons were incubated in 50 mM sodium phosphate pH 7.5, 100 mM sodium 403 
chloride, for 24 hours, with various enzyme ratios and concentrations ranging from 0 – 200 nM, as per Figure 5. 404 
To investigate whether the synergy was caused by opposite charge effects between the enzymes, size exclusion 405 
chromatography was performed with 1 mg of total enzyme (~ 34 M) on its own or at equimolar ratio using a 406 
Superdex 75 equilibrated with 50 mM sodium phosphate pH 7.5, and 100 mM sodium chloride. For the stepwise 407 
synergy studies, a final concentration of 100 nM enzyme was used. Films were pre-treated with the selected 408 
enzyme for 24 hours, reactions quenched and the coupons washed and dried as described above. Coupons were 409 
then incubated a further 24 hours with the second selected enzyme before the reactions were quenched one 410 
final time prior to product analysis by HPLC.  411 
Scanning electron microscopy: Samples were incubated with 100 nM of the respective enzyme for 24 hours 412 
as described above in PET degradation assays for investigating synergy. For the mixed enzyme samples, a total 413 
of 200 nM enzyme at an equimolar ratio was used instead. Samples were quenched, washed and dried as 414 
described above before analysis by SEM. PET film samples were mounted onto aluminium stubs using carbon 415 
adhesive tabs, and sputter coated with Au/Pd under argon using a Quorum Q150RES (Quorum Technologies 416 
Ltd). Samples were imaged using a MIRA3 FEG-SEM Microscope (TESCAN) operated at 3 kV.   417
