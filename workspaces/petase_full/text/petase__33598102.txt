abstract
An extracellular lipase from Amycolatopsis mediteranei (AML) with potential applications in process
biotechnology was recently cloned and examined in this laboratory. In the present study, the 3D struc-
ture of AML was elucidated by comparative modelling. AML lacked the ‘lid’ structure observed in most
true lipases and shared similarities with plastic degrading enzymes. Modelling and substrate speciﬁcity
studies showed that AML was a cutinase with a relatively exposed active site and speciﬁcity for medium
chain fatty acyl moieties.
AML rapidly hydrolysed the aliphatic plastics poly(
e-caprolactone) and poly(1,4-butylene succinate)
extended with 1,6-diisocyanatohexane under mild conditions. These plastics are known to be slow to
degrade in landﬁll. Poly(L-lactic acid) was not hydrolysed by AML, nor was the aromatic plastic
Polyethylene Terephthalate (PET). The speciﬁcity of AML is partly explained by active site topology
and analysis reveals that minor changes in the active site region can have large effects on substrate pref-
erence. These ﬁndings show that extracellular Amycolatopsis enzymes are capable of degrading a wider
range of plastics than is generally recognised. The potential for application of AML in the bioremediation
of plastics is discussed.

1. Introduction
Cutinases are similar to lipases and esterases in their ability to
hydrolyse carboxylate esters. They belong to the a/b hydrolase
superfamily with the signature a/b fold and a catalytic triad
formed by three residues (a nucleophile, histidine, and a catalytic
acid) at the active site [1]. Some a/b hydrolases, including lipases,
have a ‘lid’ domain that covers the substrate-binding site which
‘opens’ at a lipid-water interface [2].
In previous work, we identiﬁed an interesting extracellular
lipase from Amycolatopsis mediterannei (AML) with biotechnologi-
cally useful properties [3]. In the present study, we examine the
three-dimensional structure of AML by comparative modelling.
This modelling approach uses experimentally determined struc-
tures of homologous proteins as templates [4]. A template
with > 50% similarity to the target can provide good quality predic-
tions, often as good as X-ray elucidated low resolution structures
[5]. Lipases have previously been structurally characterised using
comparative modelling techniques [6].
The structural characterisation of AML along with substrate
speciﬁcity studies show that this enzyme is more appropri-
ately described as a cutinase. A BLAST search of the a/b hydro-
lase database found that AML was homologous to several
known plastic degrading enzymes. When tested for this activ-
ity, AML was found to be capable of the degradation of certain
aliphatic, but not aromatic, plastics. This interesting speci-
ﬁcity is discussed in terms of the active site structure and
homology with other plastic degrading enzymes. The ability
of AML to degrade aliphatic plastics underlines the fact that
Amycolatopsis is capable of digesting a wider range of polye-
sters than is generally recognised. The signiﬁcance of an extra-
cellular plastic degrading cutinase in Amycolatopsis species is
discussed.

2.2. Production of AML
AML was produced using the recombinant system pET-49b (+)
in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) cytosol as described by Tan et al.
(2021; in press). A starter culture (MDG media; [7]) was inoculated
and incubated overnight at 37 /C176C and 300 rpm. The starter culture
was added at a 1:1000 ratio to the culture media and incubated at
37 /C176C and 300 rpm until the OD 600 reached 0.5–0.7. At this point,
IPTG was added to a ﬁnal concentration of 1 mM to induce expres-
sion. The induced culture was incubated at 25 /C176C overnight and
centrifuged at 13,000 /C2 g for 2mins at 4 /C176C. The pellet was resus-
pended in 3 ml per 20 ml culture of lysis buffer and was sonicated
(Q55 Sonicator with a standard 1/8 00 diameter probe from QSonica,
LLC) on ice using 30–60 s bursts at a setting of 30%-40% amplitude.
The sonicated mix was pelleted at 12,000 /C2 g for 15mins. The
supernatant was loaded on a Macherey-Nagel TM Protino/C210Glu-
tathione Agarose column and AML was cleaved off from the tag
using GE Healthcare PreScission /C210Protease.
2.3. Comparative modelling of AML
The amino acid sequence of the AML was obtained from the
National Centre for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) database
(Amycolatopsis mediterranei U32 lipase GenBank accession no.
ADJ49206). The sequence was inputted into the interactive web
interface of SWISS-MODEL ( https://swissmodel.expasy.org/inter-
active). The 3-D template coordinates of Streptomyces exfoliatus
lipase (PDB code: 1jfr; [8]) were chosen and using a target-
template sequence alignment an all-atom model of the AML target
sequence was generated using ProMod-II [9]. The initial quality
assessment of the generated model used the information provided
by SWISS-MODEL: target-template alignment, step-by-step mod-
elling log, oligomeric state, ligands, and cofactors in the model.
2.4. Model quality validation
The quality of the model coordinates was evaluated using the
QMEAN score of the SWISS-MODEL server and the tools of the
Structure Analysis and Veriﬁcation Server (SAVES) ( http://ser-
vicesn.mbi.ucla.edu/SAVES/), including VERIFY3D [10] and ERRAT,
[11] Protein Structure Analysis (ProSA) server ( https://prosa.ser-
vices.came.sbg.ac.at/prosa.php; [12]), and RAMPAGE ( http://mor-
dred.bioc.cam.ac.uk/’rapper/rampage.php; [13]). The secondary
structure of AML was predicted using JPred4 ( http://www.comp-
bio.dundee.ac.uk/jpred/; [14]). The visualisation and ﬁgure genera-
tion were performed using PyMOL v2.3.3 [15].
2.5. Classiﬁcation of AML and identiﬁcation of its functional residues
The amino acid sequence of AML in FASTA format (GenBank ID:
ADJ49206) was searched through the BLAST tool [16] available on
the LED database ( http://www.led.uni-stuttgart.de/) and ESTHER
database ( http://bioweb.supagro.inra.fr/ESTHER/general?
what = blast) to classify AML according to the family system in
each database respectively.
2.6. Flexible docking of substrate onto AML model
All the protein and ligand structures were prepared for docking
using Biovia Discovery Studio 4.0 [17]. The binding site was
deﬁned by a sphere encompassing corresponding residues in
Table 1. Flexible docking was performed with Biovia Discovery Stu-
dio 4.0, using default parameters and setting the speciﬁc residues
as ﬂexible. The visualisation and ﬁgure generation were performed
using PyMOL Molecular Visualisation System v2.3.3 [15].
2.7. Turbidity assay for aliphatic plastic degradation
The turbidity assay for polyester degradation was carried out as
outlined in Masaki and colleagues, [18] with slight modiﬁcation.
The enzyme degradation of plastics was carried out at 30 /C176C with
continuous shaking at 50 rpm for up to 2 days. One gram of polye-
ster (Merck Sigma-Aldrich Catalogue#: 448028; poly(1,4-butylene
succinate), extended with 1,6-diisocyanatohexane, 440,752 (poly-
caprolactone), or GF45989881 (polylactic acid)) was dissolved in
6 ml of chloroform with the aid of a water bath sonicator, along
with 100 mg of Plysurf A209G surfactant (DKS Co. Ltd.). The solu-
tion was added to 25 ml of water and shaken vigorously to create
an emulsion. The medium was autoclaved at 121 /C176C at 15psi for
20mins to evaporate the chloroform. The ﬁnal reaction mixture
contained 0.04% w/v emulsiﬁed plastic, 0.0016% (w/v) Plysurf
A209G, 50 mM Tris HCl (pH8.0) and AML (2.5 mg/ml). The degrada-
tion ratio was calculated by measuring the decrease in turbidity at
660 nm of solutions before and after the addition of the enzyme,
with a reading being taken at one-hour intervals for 6hrs.
2.8. PET degradation assay
The ability of AML to degrade PET was tested using the proce-
dure adapted from Austin and co-workers [19]. The PET ﬁlm of
2.5
lm thickness (Goodfellow Cambridge Ltd. Catalogue#:
ES301025) was placed in a 1.5 ml Eppendorf tube with 300 mLo f
50 mM phosphate buffer (pH8.0) and with 2 mM AML. The diges-
tion was carried out at 30 /C176C with agitation at 150 rpm. After
72hrs of digestion, the reaction was terminated by enzyme inacti-
vation by heating at 85 /C176C for 15 min. The AML treated ﬁlms were
rinsed with 1% (v/v) SDS, followed by dH 2O, and then ethanol and
left in a 37 /C176C incubator to dry overnight (18hrs). Subsequently, the
sample was centrifuged at 17,000 /C2 g for 10 min. The ﬁlms were
coated with a 6 nm layer of gold/palladium (Au/Pd) and analysed
using a Hitachi SU6600 Field Electron Microscopy (FESEM) instru-
ment employed at a 5.0 kV voltage acceleration, with a 7.1 mm
working distance and beam current of 17 mA.
The supernatant of AML-treated PET ﬁlm was removed for HPLC
and ﬂuorescence spectroscopy analysis. Terephthalic acid (TPA)
and bis(2-Hydroxyethyl) terephthalate (BHET) released from PET
degradation were quantiﬁed using HPLC. The HPLC analysis was
performed using a Waters Alliance e2695 Separations Module
equipped with ZORBAX Eclipse XDB C-18 (80 Å, 5 mm, 4.6 mm
/C2 150 mm) HPLC column from Agilent Technologies. The mobile
phase was neat methanol/50 mM phosphate-citric acid buffer
(60:40% (v/v), pH3.8). Standard solutions of TPA and BHET over a
concentration range of 0.05 – 1.0 mM were prepared as the refer-
ence for sample detection. The elution was operated at the ﬂow
rate of 1.0 ml/min in isocratic mode. The eluent peaks were
detected at 241 nm using a Waters Alliance 2998 Photodiode Array
Detector.
The analysis was performed as per Silva and Cavaco-Paulo [20]
and Nimchua and colleagues, [21] with minor adaptations. The
terephthalic acid released from PET degradation was quantiﬁed
by ﬂuorometric determination at 425 nm from hydroxy-
terephthalic acid ( kek = 315 nm, kem = 425 nm) formed by the reac-

tion of TPA and hydrogen peroxide. The reaction was performed by
adding 2 ml of hydrogen peroxide into 1 ml of the reaction aliquot.
The mixture was heated at 90 /C176C for 30mins and the reading was
taken after the samples had cooled to room temperature. A calibra-
tion curve was plotted using the reading from standard solutions of
TPA (0.006, 0.03, 0.06, 0.12 mM) dissolved in 0.05 M NaOH
solution.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Modelling studies
The template for comparative modelling of AML was selected
through a BlastP search against the Protein Data Bank (PDB) data-
base. A phylogenetic tree was constructed to ﬁnd the available
templates with the closest evolutionary relationship to AML
(Fig. 1). AML was most closely related to a lipase from Streptomyces
exfoliatus sharing 75% sequence identity, which is, therefore, suit-
able as a template for modelling studies [22].
A comparative model of AML (262 residues, sequence 47–309)
was constructed using the selected Streptomyces exfoliatus (PDB:
1JFR) template with the SWISS MODEL server. The developed
AML model was evaluated through a variety of validation tools
including RAMPAGE, Verify3D, ERRAT and ProSA (see supplemen-
tary Figs. 1-4 and Table 1) and ﬁndings are summarised in Table 2 .
Ramachandran plots [13] assess the stereochemical quality of
the model, which compared favourably ( ~98.0% of residues in the
favoured region and 2% in the allowed region) with the template
structure. The structural integrity of the model was ﬁrst evaluated
using Verify3D, [23] which determines the compatibility of an
atomic model (3D) with its own amino acid sequence (1D). A Ver-
ify3D result of 97.3% indicates that there is a good folding quality
to the AML model. ERRAT [11] analyses the statistics of non-
bonded interactions between different atom types and plots the
value of the error function versus position. According to the ERRAT
plot of AML, 87.7% of the residues fall below the 95% rejection limit
of incorrect non-bonded interaction. Finally, ProSA [12] identiﬁes
errors in the 3D structure of proteins. The resultant Z-score of
AML and of the 1JFR template both fall within the range for simi-
larly sized native proteins and both energy proﬁle plots show a
good overall local model quality. In summary, the overall model
quality of AML is very close to the 1JFR template and has a similar
quality proﬁle to recent homologous models of lipases reported in
the literature [24,25].
Through sequence alignment wit h the template, the catalytic
triad and the AML oxyanion form ing residues were identiﬁed as
Ser178, Asp224, His256 and Phe110, Met179 respectively.
Ser178, Asp224, and His256 are the triad responsible for the
hydrolysis of the acyl group while the amide backbones of
Phe110 and Met179 help to sta bilise the enzyme-substrate
intermediate via H-bonding with the carbonyl oxygen of the
substrate [26].T h ec a t a l y t i ct r i a da n d the oxyanion residues
form part of the substra te binding pocket (see supplementary
Fig. 5 ). The alignment also showe d that the enzyme lacks a lid
domain, similar to the te mplate structure used [8]. The absence
of a lid domain has been reported in several plastic degrading
cutinases [27].
The AML model has the typical a/b hydrolase structure – with a
central b sheet surrounded by a-helices (see Fig. 2A). Furthermore,
a disulphide bond has been modelled between Cys289 and Cys305.
The location and the conformation of the functional residues were
investigated using the 3D model of AML. It can be seen that the
functional residues formed part of a potential substrate binding
pocket below the b-sheet (see Fig. 2 B & C).
The experimentally determined preference of AML for medium
chain length fatty acids ( Fig. 3 ) matches the known preference of
cutinases which tend to favour substrates with acyl chain lengths
of 4–8 carbons. This indicates that AML is closer to a cutinase type
lipase rather than an esterase or true lipase [28,29]. AML has a
binding site with a similar shape to a typical lipase binding site,
but with a smaller hydrophobic region for fatty acid chain binding.
To inspect how substrates of different length are predicted to
bind to AML, the docked poses of AML with p-nitrophenyl acetate
(C-2), p-nitrophenyl octanoate (C-8), and p-nitrophenyl palmitate
(C-16) were generated using ﬂexible docking in Biovia Discovery
Studio 4.0. The binding poses were visualised using PyMOL and
the ligand protein interactions are shown in a 2D map generated
with Biovia Discovery Studio ( Fig. 4 ).
The docked structures of AML with the C-8 and C-16 substrates
have their acyl groups bound to the predicted hydrophobic binding
site. The 2D interaction maps also showed that the carbonyl oxy-
gen of C-8 and C-16 form hydrogen bonds with the backbone
amide group of the oxyanion residues of AML (Phe110 and

distance model, and a maximum sequence distance of 0.4.

Met179) required for tetrahedral intermediate stabilisation during
catalysis [30]. The main hydrophobic residues that are predicted to
interact with the fatty acid chain of the acyl group are Gly109,
Phe110, Met179, Trp203, and Val226. In contrast, for p-
nitrophenyl acetate the acyl group is pointed towards the less
hydrophobic part of the binding pocket and instead has predicted
hydrogen bond contacts with His177 and Ser178.
p-nitrophenyl acetate has the acyl group pointed towards the
less hydrophobic part of the binding pocket. This resulted in a sub-
optimal interaction of the carbonyl group with the oxyanion resi-
dues and the catalytic His225, which is important for the release
of an alcohol group during the hydrolysis process [31]. This might
explain the experimentally low activity of AML observed towards
p-nitrophenyl acetate .

The main hydrophobic residues that interacted with the fatty
acid chain of the acyl group are Gly109, Phe110, Met179, Trp203,
and Val226. While Gly109 and Trp203 interact with C1 of the acyl
group, Phe110 and Met179 interact with C2 and C3 of the acyl
group and the position of their backbone amide is also important
for intermediate stabilisation. Val226 interacts with C4 (C-8 sub-
strate) and C5 (C-16 substrate), indicating that the mutation of
Val226, to a bulkier hydrophobic residue, could shift the substrate
preference of AML towards shorter acyl chains. Such engineering of
a lipase substrate binding site for short acyl length preference has
been previously demonstrated for Candida rugosa LIP4 [32] and
Candida antarticalipase A [33].
3.2. Plastics degradation
AML was found to be homologous to several plastic degrading
cutinases (see Table 3 ). The ability of AML to degrade polyesters
was tested on common, commercially- used, plastics as substrates:
aliphatic polyesters poly(butylene succinate), poly(caprolactone),
poly(lactic acid) and the aromatic poly(ethylene terephthalate).
3.3. Aliphatic polyester plastics
Poly(lactide; PLA) is composed of lactic acid monomers. It is a
widely used plastic and is the fastest growing market of all bioplas-
tics [34]. It is known to be quite resistant to biodegradation in the
environment [35]. Enzymatic breakdown of PLA by AML over a
short time period (6hrs) at moderate temperature (30 /C176C) was
not successful ( Fig. 5 ). This was somewhat surprising since the
extracellular enzymes of Amycolatopsis species have previously
been described as having PLA degrading activity [36]. Conversely,
under the same conditions, AML degradation of poly(caprolactone)
was more successful, with almos t 60% degradation observed
following 6 h of AML exposure ( Fig. 5 ). Poly(caprolactone) is a

developed AML model with their corresponding 2D interaction maps. The residues with predicted non-covalent interactions are shown as stick and surf ace models. The
ligands were displayed as white stick model while AML was shown in cartoon format . The 3D diagrams were generated using PyMOL v2.3.3 (DeLano Scientiﬁc , 2002) and the
2D interaction maps were generated using Discovery Studio Visualiser [17].

bioplastic extensively used in controlled release drug formulations
and is only degraded by a limited number of enzymes [37]. Of the
three aliphatic polyesters examined, AML was most successful in
the degradation of poly(1,4-butylene succinate) extended with
1,6-diisocyanatohexane (PBSc-D) under the conditions explored
(Fig. 5 ). poly(butylene succinate; (PBSc-D) is a petroleum derived
plastic which is considered among the more persistent plastics in
the environment [38,39]. This enzyme may be a useful tool for
bioremediation of this rapidly growing class of environmental
plastics.
The effect of degradation over time was also examined. Exten-
sive hydrolysis by AML was observed with PCL and PBSc-D as sub-
strates when the hydrolysis of polyester plastics was carried out
for an extended time period (22hrs) at a modest temperature
(30 /C176C): these polymers were degraded by 90 and 80% respectively
Table 4 ).
3.4. Strucutral and sequence analysis to predict PLA degradation
The mechanism of PLA degradation by a cutinase from T. alba
has been recently reported [40]. The cutinase ( T.alba cutinase
Est119) has a sequence similar to AML (61% sequence identity,
73% sequence similarity). In view of the observed lack of PLA
degradation by AML, its active site topology compared to Est119
was examined. The objective was to try to understand the differ-
ences between these related plastic degrading enzymes at a struc-
tural level.
The amino acid sequences of AML, Est119 and another PLA
degrading cutinase from Thermobiﬁda cellulosilytica, were aligned
to examine the difference in key substrate binding residues
between them ( Fig. 6 ). It was clear from this alignment that there
was signiﬁcant overlap in the key catalytic residues for these
enzymes. The structural differences were further explored by
superimposing the 3D model of AML on the crystal structure of
Est119 crystallised with bound PLA analogues ethyl acetate (EL)
and lactic acid (LAC; PDB: 6AID) [40]. Both structures were aligned
using PyMOL to compare the reported catalytic and substrate
recognition sites for PLA degradation (see Fig. 7 ).
As was found with the sequence alignment, it was evident that
the structures of these enzymes overlap with a high degree of sim-
ilarity (RMSD = 0.472 Å). However, when the wider substrate bind-
ing domain was considered ( Fig. 8 ) some subtle divergence was
observed. In particularTyr99 of Est119 aligned with Phe110 of
AML, and Ile217 with Val226. It is unclear why these differences
should account for such divergence in PLA degrading activity given
the largely similar nature of the residues. Kitadokoro and co-
workers postulated that Tyr99 of Est119 is important as it provides
the oxyanion hole to stabilize the esterase reaction [40]. Nonethe-
less, from this study we can conclude that relatively minor differ-
ences in the wider substrate binding site can give rise to signiﬁcant
differences in substrate speciﬁcity for plastics.
It was clear that under these mild conditions that AML showed
considerable activity towards PBS and PCL but showed no activity
toward PLA. While Amycolatopsis has been widely reported as hav-
ing polylactide degrading activity the main enzymes responsible
are reportedly proteases – not lipases [36]. Thus, our ﬁnding that
AML does not degrade PLA is supported by these studies that show
that the PLA degrading enzymes secreted by Amycolatopsis are pro-
teases [36,41].
Fig. 5. Degradation of PLA ( r), PCL ( d), and PBSc-D ( ▲) by AML. The degradation
was carried out with a ﬁnal enzyme concentration of 2.5 mg/ml AML with
incubation at 30 /C176C in 50 mM phosphate buffer (pH 8.0) in duplicate. A reaction
mixture incubated without any enzyme was used as a control ( /C2 ). The ratio of
undegraded polyesters was calculated using the ratio of A 660 after the incubation
period with the initial A 660.

3.5. Degradation of aromatic plastics
The most persistent plastics in the environment are the petro-
leum derived aromatic polyesters, such as PET. These are a signif-
icant problem as pollutants and an enzyme capable of degrading
this plastic is highly desirable [42]; several studies have attempted
PET degradation with varying degrees of success [43].
PET is known to be highly resistant to enzymatic degradation
and it is not easily prepared as an emulsion. Therefore, the same
analysis could not be used as for the aliphatic polyesters, instead,
degradation of the standard PET ﬁlm was examined via scanning
electron microscope (SEM). Degraded PET products (terephthalic
acid (TPA) and bis-(2-hydroxyethyl terephthalate; BHET)) in the
reaction buffer were explored using high performance liquid chro-
matography (HPLC) and ﬂuorometric analysis was performed to
detect the release of TPA following PET degradation.
Following an extended (96hrs) incubation of AML with PET ﬁlm,
at a moderate temperature (30 /C176C), there was no observable phys-
ical difference in the PET ﬁlm as determined by SEM ( supplemen-
tary Fig. 6 ). Similarly, no PET monomers (TPA or BHET) were
detected in the sample buffer after incubation as based on HPLC
(supplementary Fig. 7 ) and ﬂuorometric ( supplementary Fig. 8 )

literature: cutinase from Thermobiﬁda cellulosilytica (PDB ID: 5LUI) and Est119 from Thermobiﬁda alba AHK119 (PDB ID: 6AID). The key substrate binding residues were
highlighted in light grey with differences between the enzymes residues highlighted in dark yellow. The alignment was performed using the Clustal Om ega server ( https://

analyses. Therefore, it was concluded that AML was not capable of
observable PET degradation under these conditions. This seemed
somewhat surprising since some reports, indicated that PET
degrading enzymes (PETases) were cutinases with related struc-
tures to AML (see Table 3 ).
PET degrading enzymes are generally divided into two groups;
Type I and Type II based on their binding pocket sequence [44].
The important residues of cutinases involved in PET degradation
have been reported previously [44,45] and this permitted the
sequence of AML to be aligned with two known PET degrading
enzymes: PETase from Ideonella sakaiensis(49% sequence identity,
67% similarity; Type II) [45] and T.fusca cutinase (62% sequence
identity, 77% similarity; TfCut2, Type I) [28] with the key residues
highlighted ( Fig. 8 ). The sequence alignment revealed that AML
exhibits matching residues with PET degrading enzymes of Type
I. Type 1 enzymes have lower PET degrading activity than Type II
[44]. A structural alignment of AML with the structure of PETase
from Ideonella sakaiensis (PDB ID: 5XH3; with bound 1-(2-
hydroxyethyl) 4-methyl terephthalate [HEMT] – a PET analogue)
[45] and PET-degrading TfCut2 (PDB ID: 4CG1) [28] was conducted
to ascertain their structural similarity. The root mean square devi-
ations (RMSD) of the atomic positions with AML were 0.588 Å and
0.463 Å for PETase and TfCut2 respectively, indicating that there
was a high degree of structural alignment between the catalytic
residues of AML and the known PET degrading enzyme ( Fig. 9 ).
However, some residue differences between AML and the currently
known binding pocket features on the PET degrading enzymes
were observed (see Fig. 9 ). Residue differences include S178/
A131/S130 in catalytic residues; F110/Y58/Y60 in subsite 1 and
in subsite II, A112/A60/G61; H177/W130/H129 and F257/S209/
F209 for AML, PETase, TfCut2 respectively. Perhaps, the most sig-
niﬁcant of these is the F110 in AML, subsite I, which is replaced
by a Tyrosine in PETase and TfCut2. The more polar, albeit bulkier,
Tyrosine may play a speciﬁc role in intermediate stabilisation.
A recent paper closely examined the key residues for degrada-
tion of PET by a cutinase from Ideonella sakaiensis [44]. In a com-
parison between this enzyme and TfCut2 they showed that the
composition of residues in the PET binding subsites I and II could
reduce PET binding afﬁnity. Subsite I and II are binding grooves
to either side of the catalytic site where PET is bound in
extended form to present the scissile bond for hydrolysis. In
Fig. 8 , we showed that the catalytic triad for AML is the same
as for TfCut2. The subsite I binding site differs from that of
TfCut2 by having a Phenylalanine (Phe110) in place of a more
polar Tyrosine residue while subsite II has a bulkier alanine resi-

one of the main differences noted above when comparing PLA
degrading activity between AML and Est119 suggesting it may
be important in both PLA and PET binding. Whether these differ-
ences alone are sufﬁcient to account for the signiﬁcantly lower
PET and PLA degrading activity of AML is unclear given that
these are relatively minor changes. This could be explored by
appropriate mutagenesis studies. It is worth noting that the wild
type TfCut2 had relatively modest PET degrading activity which
was subsequently improved by removing bulky residues to
allow for binding of extended PET chains [28]. PETase also has
an extended section in the b8-
a7 loop when compared to AML
and TfCut2. This structural difference in the three enzymes,
due to the extended loop, was vi sualised via a surface plot gen-
erated using PyMOL ( Fig. 10 ). The extended loop creates an extra
groove, possibly for better binding of the polyester, [44] which
may partially explain difference s in PET activity. It is also worth
noting that enzymes capable of efﬁcient PET degradation are not
necessarily efﬁcient at degradation of aliphatic polyesters such
as PBS or PCL [19].
A report on the commercial application of cutinases in PET recy-
cling published during the study reported here identiﬁed leaf-
branch compost cutinase (LCC) as highly efﬁcient at PET hydrolysis
[61]. Interestingly, these workers found that when 11 key residues
in the ﬁrst contact shell for PET binding were mutated that activity
was abolished in most cases. This suggests that minor changes in
the conﬁguration of the PET binding site can dramatically inﬂuence

PET degrading activity which supports the observations noted in
our study.
In the latest update of the Lipase Engineering Database v4.0
(https://led.biocatnet.de/), [2] AML (Entry S#455987) is grouped
into a Homologous Family #49 with the lipase from Streptomyces
exfoliatus as the structural representative. The family has 945 pro-
tein entries with 1,099 sequence entries and 21 structural entries.
As the family also includes most of the reported polyester degrad-
ing cutinases and with all the members sharing > 60% sequence
homology, structural comparison (besides the substrate binding
site) reveals differences between the lipases/cutinases in their abil-
ity to degrade different plastic substrates. These include electro-
static and hydrophobicity variations [19,46] and subtle
differences in the extended binding groove [47].
4. Conclusion
Homologs of AML were found in several Amycolatopsis species
indicating that it is probably a key extracellular enzyme of these
organisms. Modelling of the 3D structure of AML revealed that
the enzyme lacked the lid structure seen with some lipases. This,
along with substrate speciﬁcity studies, suggested that this
enzyme is more appropriately named a cutinase. The catalytic triad
residues in AML were identiﬁed and homology with known plastic
degrading enzymes was observed.
When plastic degrading activity was examined it was clear that
the extracellular cutinase from A. meditarranei was capable of
hydrolysing PCL and PBSc-D but not PLA or PET. A previous report
identiﬁed that some Amycolatopsis species could degrade PLA, PCL
and PBS but speciﬁc enzymes involved were not isolated [48].
However, studies with Amycolatopsis orientalis spp. showed that
the extracellular PLA degrading enzymes of these species were pro-
teases and not lipases or cutinases [36]. Our studies support this

observation and show that a single extracellular enzyme is likely
responsible for the degradation of PCL and PBS by Amycolatopsis
spp. It is clear that Amycolatopsis species are capable of degrading
a wide range of polyesters and further exploration of this organism
in plastics remediation is warranted based on the ﬁndings of this
study.
Sequence comparison of AML with similar plastic degrading
enzymes showed remarkable similarities between these cutinases.
The most notable difference was where Phe110 was substituted by
a Tyrosine residue in the PLA and PET degrading enzymes exam-
ined. Further work is needed to determine if this residue alone
plays an important role in binding of PET and PLA.
The speciﬁc substrate preferences of AML may be particularly
interesting for enzymatic degradation of plastics where recovery
of speciﬁc monomers is required. Thus, these studies show that
PBS and PCL can be preferentially degraded even in the presence
of PET and/or PLA under relatively mild conditions. This is poten-
tially useful for degrading mixtures of plastics. Applications in con-
trolled release drug formulations can also be envisaged.
