Plastic poses a significant environmental impact due to its chemical resilience, leading to 
prolonged and degradation times and resulting in widespread adverse effects on global flora and 
fauna. Cutinases are essential enzymes in the biodegradation process of synthetic polymers like 
polyethylene terephthalate (PET), which recognized organisms can break down. Here, we used 
molecular dynamics and binding free energy calculations to explore the interaction of nine synthetic 
polymers, including PET, with Cutinase from Fusarium oxysporum (FoCut). According to our findings, 
the polymers poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET), poly(3-hydroxybutyrate-co-3-hydroxyhexanoate) 
(PHBH), poly(butylene succinate) (PBS), poly(butylene adipate-co-terephthalate) (PBAT) and 
poly(ε-caprolactone) (PCL) can bind to the Cutinase enzyme from F. oxysporum, indicating potential 
biodegradation activity for these polymers. PET exhibited the highest binding affinity (− 34.26 kcal/
mol). Besides PET, the polymers PHBH, PBS, PBAT, and PCL also demonstrated significant 
affinities for the FoCut enzyme, with binding values of − 18.44, − 29.71, − 22.78, and − 22.26 kcal/
mol, respectively. Additionally, analysis of the phylogenetic tree of cutinases produced by different 
organisms demonstrated that even though the organisms belong to different kingdoms, the cutinase 
from F. oxysporum (FoCut) showed biological similarity in its activity in degrading polymers with 
the cutinase enzyme from the bacterium Kineococcus radiotolerans and the fungus Moniliophthora 
roreri. Furthermore, the phylogenetic analysis demonstrated that the PETase enzyme has a very high 
similarity with the bacterial cutinase enzyme than with the fungal cutinase, therefore demonstrating 
that the PETase enzyme from Ideonella sakaiensis can easily be a modified bacterial cutinase enzyme 
that created a unique feature in biodegrading only the pet polymer through an evolutionary process 
due to its environment and its biochemical need for carbon. Our data demonstrate that bacterial 
cutinase enzymes have the same common ancestor as the PETase enzyme. Therefore, cutinases 
and PETase are interconnected through their biological similarity in biodegrading polymers. We 
demonstrated that important conserved regions, such as the Ser-Asp-His catalytic triad, exist in the 
enzyme’s catalytic site and that all Cut enzymes from different organisms have the same region to 
couple with the polymer structures.

Plastics are essential materials for modern society due to their distinct properties, including lightness, durability, 
versatility, and low production costs 1–3. However, their non-degradability poses a significant threat to the 
environment, primarily because synthetic polymers are chemically resistant and take a long time to degrade,

remaining for years, especially in oceans 4. The use of biodegradable polymers, both synthetic and natural, has 
emerged as a more sustainable alternative for plastic production, since pollution by non-biodegradable plastics 
affects everything from marine animals, interfering with their feeding behaviour, to humans with the presence 
of microplastics 5–7. The biodegradation of polymers occurs through the activity of enzymes produced by 
microorganisms such as fungi and bacteria, capable of secreting enzymes such as PETases and Cutinases8,9.
Cutinases (Cut), a type of serine hydrolase found in various organisms (e.g. Fusarium solani pisi10, Fusarium 
oxysporum11, Moniliophthora roreri 12, Saccharomonospora viridis 13, Thermobifida alba 14, Thermobifida 
cellulosilytica15, Thermobifida fusca16, Humicola insolens17, Kineococcus radiotolerans18), are capable of degrading 
cutin, a fatty acid polyester that forms the main component of plant cuticles. These enzymes have emerged as vital 
biocatalysts in the breakdown of synthetic polymers such as poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) 12, poly(lactic 
Acid) (PLA) 19, poly(3-hydroxybutyrate-co-3-hydroxyvalerate) (PHBV) 20, poly(butylene succinate) (PBS) 21, 
poly(butylene adipate-co-terephthalate) (PBAT) 22,23, poly(ε-caprolactone) (PCL) 12, poly(ethylene succinate) 
(PES)12. In 2022, Abokitse et al. demonstrated that the bacterium Kineococcus radiotolerans also produces a 
Cut capable of biodegrading polymers. Notably, F. oxysporu has so far only shown PET biodegradation activity 
among polymers.
The fungus Fusarium oxysporum is known to thrive in moist, warm environments. However, Fusarium genus 
can be quite versatile and adapt to a various environmental conditions, including dry conditions or aquatic 
habitats in certain cases24,25. In the Amazon, for example, the fungus is the leading cause of the death of black 
pepper plantations in Pará 26. Pará is one of the primary producers and exporters of black pepper in Brazil 27. 
Therefore, F. oxysporum, in addition to being a problem in the health sector as it causes the disease fusariosis, 
is also a problem for the economic sector of a region 24. Furthermore, this organism attacks other crops such as 
bananas28 and tomatoes29.
Therefore, this work evaluates synthetic polymers’ binding affinity the Fusarium oxysporum Cutinase (Cut) 
enzyme using computational methods such as Molecular Dynamics, Molecular Docking, and Binding Free 
Energy calculations, as employed in previous studies30–35. Overall, we provide insights into the potential use of 
this enzyme as a biocatalyst in the biodegradation of polymers other than PET.
Material and methods
Phylogenetic analysis protocol
We used the Molecular Evolutionary Genetics Analysis version 11 (MEGA11) 36 software. We selected some 
organisms that produce the Cut enzyme, fungi, and bacteria deposited in the PDB. We selected the FASTA 
sequence from the PDB of these Cut proteins as Halopseudomonas bauzanensis (8AIT)37, Fusarium oxysporum 
(5AJH)11, Fusarium vanettenii (1CEX)38, Fusarium solani (1CUS)39, Paraphoma sp. (7CY3), Humicola insolens 
(4OYY)40, Colletotrichum gloeosporioides (3DCN) 41, Aspergillus oryzae  (3GBS) 42, Malbranchea cinnamomea 
(5X88)43, Trichoderma reesei (4PSC)44, Saccharomonosphora viridis (4WFI)45, Saccharopolyspora flava (7QJP)46, 
Thermobifida cellulosilytica (5LUI)47, Thermobifida fusca (5ZOA), Thermobifida alba (3VIS)48. Two organisms 
were selected from recent studies and do not have the crystallized structure of the Cut enzyme deposited in 
the PDB, namely Moniliophthora roreri (GenBank: ESK97883.1) 12 and Kineococcus radiotolerans (GenBank: 
ABS05574.1)18. Additionally, we added the PETase enzyme from the bacteria Ideonella sakaiensis (6EQE)1. We 
performed a global alignment of the sequences using ClustalW . The phylogenetic tree was plotted using the 
Neighbor–Joining statistical method, using Bootstrap method with 10,000 replications.
Structural preparation of polymers and FoCut
The three-dimensional structure of the Cutinase hydrolase from Fusarium oxysporum ( FoCut) was acquired 
from the RCSB Protein Data Bank 49 using the PDB code 5AJH 11. This structure was determined by X-ray 
diffraction with a resolution of 1.90 Å. The nine polymer structures were designed in 2D (Table 1) using the 
MarvinSketch50 program (version 18.9) and subsequently converted and analyzed in the 3D model using the 
Avogadro51 program (version 1.2.0). The PET, PLA, PHB, PBS, PCL and PES structures were used a tetramer. 
PHBH and PHBV structure were used as a dimer. PBAT structure was used as a monomer. This difference of 
each ligand (tetramer, dimer or monomer) is related to the volume of each structure. Finally, 3D structures were 
optimized in the Gaussian0952 program using the Hartree-Fock53 method with the 6-31G* basis set.
Docking molecular protocol
We used the Molegro Virtual Docker (MVD) software (version 5.5) 60 for the molecular docking stage. MVD 
employs the MolDock heuristic search algorithm, which uses a piecewise linear potential (PLP) scoring function 
that includes hydrogen and electrostatic interaction terms60. Molecular docking was performed using a flexible 
docking approach61, where the active site residues of FoCut were considered flexible to ensure optimal coupling 
with the nine polymer structures. This strategy allowed for more interactions at the enzyme site, eliminating the 
need to apply a restriction force to maintain these interactions during the Molecular Dynamics step. Then, for 
the molecular docking protocol, we used the MolDock SE algorithm with the following parameters: number 
of runs = 10, space coordinates (X = −  15.35, Y = 13.52, Z = −  41.65), maximum iterations = 1500, maximum 
population size = 50, and grid resolution = 25.0 Å.
Molecular Dynamics (MD) protocol
Initially, we used the PROPKA 62 to determine the protonation states of the ionizable residues of FoCut. The 
nine polymers and the protein were submitted to the CHARMM-GUI web server using the CHARMM36 force 
field63–65, as applied in our previous work 34. The systems were solvated with water molecules using the TIP3P 
explicit solvation model66, within an octahedral box, with a radius of 12.0 Å (distance from the protein to the 
box), and Cl⁻ counter-ions to maintain the electroneutrality of the system. We prepared nine complexes: PEP–,

www.nature.com/scientificreports/
PLA–, PHB–, PHBH–, PHBV–, PBS–, PBAT–, PCL–, PES–FoCut. Then, the structural-energetic minimization 
step was performed in four stages. In the first step, we included only the counter-ions and water molecules. In 
the second step, we minimized only the hydrogen atoms of the protein structure. The third step included the 
hydrogen atoms of the entire complex (ligand–protein structure and water molecules). The final step involved 
minimizing the entire system. Then, all the systems were subjected to a heating step from 0 to 300 K using 200 ps 
of MD in a constant volume with a restraint weight of 5.0 kcal·mol⁻1·Å2 at the positions of the atoms (complex). 
Subsequently, all systems were equilibrated with 500 ps of MD with no restraints at a constant pressure of 1 bar. 
The temperature of the systems was maintained at 300 K using a Langevin thermostat with a collision frequency 
of 2 ps ⁻1, and the isotropic constant pressure was maintained at 1 bar using a Berendsen barostat. We used a 
cutoff of 10 Å for non-bonded interactions and the Particle Mesh Ewald (PME) method to calculate long-range 
electrostatic interactions. MD simulations were performed assuming a simulation time of 300 ns, conducted in 
triplicate (100 ns for each replicate). All MM simulations were carried out in AMBER2067 package. Additionally, 
we performed an MD simulation of FoCut without any polymer, assuming a simulation time of 1 μs.
Binding free energy calculations and per-residue free energy decomposition protocol
To evaluate the affinity of the nine polymers to FoCut, we employed the Molecular Mechanics with Generalized 
Born and Surface Area Solvation (MM/GBSA) approache 68,69 available in Amber20 67. We selected 10,000 
frames from the MD trajectory, corresponding to the entire 100 ns simulation of each replicate, to evaluate the 
contributions and the binding free energy (∆Gbinding) values throughout the simulation time. Subsequently, 
we performed a decomposition analysis to identify the central residues that contribute to the binding affinity of 
the polymer–FoCut complex.
The ∆Gbinding is calculated through Eq.  1, where the terms ∆EMM , ∆Gsol and T∆S represent the 
changes in the molecular mechanical energy of the gas phase (MM), free solvation energy, and conformational 
entropy after the binding state of the binder, respectively31,69–71.
 ∆Gbinding =∆ EMM +∆ Gsol − T∆S (1)
Therefore, ∆EMM  refers to the energy of molecular mechanics which can be described as the sum of 
intramolecular energy (internal, electrostatic and van der Waals energy)31,69–71. ∆Gsol represents the sum of all 
the electrostatic solvation energy (polar contribution) and all the nonpolar contribution between the solute and 
the solvent and right after the third term of the ∆Gbinding equation, T∆S, represents the temperature, T, and 
entropy, ∆S, of the system 72. In addition, the GB method has limitations in calculating entropy because, due 
to the high computational cost, changes in conformational entropy are ignored mainly since only the relative 
binding free energies of similar ligands are needed72.
Results and discussion
Phylogenetic analysis of organisms that produce Cutinases
The phylogenetic tree (Fig. 1) was developed from the alignment of cutinases present in 17 different organisms 
to evaluate the similarity of cutinases produced between species compared to cutinases already described in the 
literature as biodegrading polymers, such as Aspergillus oryzae, Moniliophthora roreri, Paraphoma sp., Humicola 
insolens, Saccharomonospora viridis, Thermobifida fusca, Fusarium solani, among others12,17,23,73–76.
The analysis of the phylogenetic tree showed the lineages of several organisms, both fungi and bacteria, that 
can produce the cutinase enzyme. Among the fungi, the species Fusarium oxysporum stands out, being the 
species studied in this work, belonging to the same genus as the species F. solani and F. vanettenii, which can be 
pathogenic to both plants and humans, causing diseases on plants’ roots and several diseases in humans such as 
pneumonia and other consequences due to contamination by toxins produced by the fungi77–79.
Among the bacteria, the genus Thermobifida, which are thermophilic bacteria capable of adapting to 
environments with high temperatures and have great potential for biodegradation, the species Thermobifida 
fusca is widely used in studies of cutinase production for biodegradation of polyethylene terephthalate16 tag. The 
species forms a clade with the species T. cellulosilytica and T. alba and are evolutionarily distant from the fungal 
species of the Fusarium.
The bacterial species Ideonella sakaiensis was also analyzed, and the organism is phylogenetically distinct 
from other cutinase-producing bacteria, but closer to other species as Halopseudomonas bauzanensis and 
Kineococcus radiotolerans. However, its grouping with those other bacteria may be due to a shared ability to 
degrade synthetic polymers, as I. sakaiensis produces the PETase enzyme.
Cutinases and PETases are distinct enzymes, but share similar catalytic mechanisms, which may indicate that 
the enzymes belong to the same family of cutinases 80. Furthermore, the phylogenetic analysis revealed that the 
PETase enzyme shares more similarity with bacterial cutinases than fungal cutinases. Moreover, Y oshida et al.81 
and Maity et al.82 indicated a significant similarity (> 52%) of the PETase enzyme with the cutinases produced by 
the thermophilic bacterium Thermobifida fusca. This suggests that the PETase enzyme from Ideonella sakaiensis 
likely evolved from a bacterial cutinase, acquiring a unique ability to specifically degrade PET polymers through 
an evolutionary process driven by environmental pressures and the organism’s biochemical need for carbon 
as a source of energy 1,80. Another point in PETase, this enzyme retains the ancestral fold of the α/β-hydrolase. 
However, unlike homologous cutinases, its active site is more favourable for the entry of the PET polymer since 
the active site cleft is in a more open form than in cutinases, which This is traumatic since the PETase enzyme has 
a high ability to degrade PET, demonstrated in computational and experimental studies1,34,81,83–85.
Our phylogenetic tree data indicate that the similarity between the genetic sequences of PETase and Cutinase 
is supported by enzymatic engineering 1. We demonstrated that a mutant version of the PETase enzyme, after 
introducing a double mutation inspired by the cutinase from T. fusca1, narrowed the binding site region for the

polymer. and exhibited greater affinity for PET, resulting in more efficient polymer degradation. Thus, our study 
broadens the possibilities for future research in protein engineering, focusing on guided mutations based on 
conserved regions of bacterial and fungal cutinases, aiming to enhance the catalytic activity of PETase for the 
degradation of PET and potentially other polymers. We established the phylogenetic similarity between PETase 
and bacterial cutinases and conducted a phylogenetic analysis to map cutinases experimentally confirmed to 
degrade synthetic polymers. Table 1 enumerates the polymers and the respective organisms either tested for 
degradation or demonstrated to exhibit this capability. The phylogenetic tree was examined to evaluate the 
proximity of these organisms and to determine the extent of similarity between the cutinase from Fusarium 
oxysporum and enzymes reported to possess polymer-degradation activity. Our findings reveal that, while 
the F. oxysporum cutinase does not exhibit a high degree of similarity to bacterial cutinases, it demonstrates 
considerable potential for degrading polymers beyond PET, as supported by experimental evidence (e.g., 
Thermobifida fusca, known to degrade PBAT). PET was utilized as the benchmark polymer for comparative 
analysis. We emphasized the structural resemblance between PETase and cutinase, particularly at their catalytic 
sites, illustrating that PET binds to the same region of the active site in both enzymes. This observation is 
significant, as both enzymes employ an identical catalytic mechanism involving the serine residue within their 
catalytic triad. The phylogenetic tree thus serves as a crucial framework for advancing research, facilitating the 
comparison of polymer-degrading organisms and investigating whether bacterial cutinases exhibit a broader 
capacity for synthetic polymer degradation compared to F. oxysporum.
The phylogenetic analysis shows that even though they are from different organisms, bacteria and fungi, 
these enzymes have structural similarity and, in addition, the cutinase from the bacteria K. radiotolerans has the 
same capacity to biodegrade PCL as does the cutinase from the organisms M. roreri , F. solani, K. radiotolerans, 
A. oryzae, M. cinnamomea, H. insolens, F. vanettenii 12,18,43,55–58. From a structural point of view, all cutinases 
from the 17 selected organisms have the Ser–His–Asp catalytic triad in common, in addition, they have at least 
one disulfide bond. Chemically and biologically, disulfide bonds can be correlated with the resistance capacity 
of cutinase to adverse conditions, from pH to temperature variations, showing that cutinase from different 
organisms that have adverse environmental conditions have different amounts of disulfide bonds between fungi 
and bacteria42,86. The cutinase of the filamentous fungus A. oryzae has an additional disulfide bond, like the 
fungi T. reesei and M. cinnamomea, which is crucial to improving the thermal stability of AoCut in the PCL 
polymer biodegradation process 42. Among the bacteria studied, the bacterium K. radiotolerans is the closest 
phylogenetically to fungi. Besides, it is also observed that bacterial cutinase has the affinity to biodegrade many 
more polymers other than PET—among the nine selected in this research—than fungal cutinase (Table 1).
Among the nine polymers studied, some fungal organisms are shown to be capable of biodegrading only one 
type of polymer. Fungi of the genus Fusarium are those most capable of biodegrading several synthetic polymers 
(such as PET, PBAT, PCL, PBS and PES) as well as M. roreri, which is capable of biodegrading three polymers 
(PET, PCL and PES) (Table 1). Phylogenetic analysis and MD simulations can be helpful for designing more 
active and thermostable proteins capable of degrading these polymers.

Biological similarity between PETase and FoCut
The Y oshida group showed that the bacterium Ideonella sakaiensis expresses two enzymes that are involved in the 
biodegradation of PET, the enzyme PETase and MHETase81,87. This PETase enzyme catalyzes the biodegradation 
reaction of PET by converting it into mono(2-hydroxyethyl) terephthalic acid (MHET) and releasing bis-
(hydroxyethyl) terephthalate (BHET) and terephthalic acid (TPA) as products.
In the proposed catalytic mechanism of polymer biodegradation by PETase, the carbonyl group attached to 
the first benzene ring is oriented toward the centre of the polymer-binding cleft, where the catalytic triad Ser160, 
Asp206, and His237 is located2,3,88. The essential residue Ser160 is responsible for the nucleophilic attack of the 
enzyme on the substrate and then the ester bond is cleaved with the participation of a water molecule, similar to 
the mechanism of the Cutinase enzyme2,89.
Here, we performed global align by ClustalW in MEGA 1136 software of the enzyme PETase (PDB ID: 6EQE1) 
and Cutinase (PDB ID: 5AJH 11) in order to identify the main conserved and semi-conserved residues (Fig.  2, 
panel A). Despite being from extremely different organisms, we identified that these enzymes have similarities 
in their structure, which provides insights into their ability to biodegrade the PET polymer. The Cutinase from 
F. oxysporum also has a catalytic triad of Ser121, Asp176 and His189 residues. Among the conserved residues 
are the catalytic residues of the IsPETase triad Ser160, Asp176 and His237 being Ser121, Asp176 and His189 for 
FoCut (Fig. 2, panel B and C).

www.nature.com/scientificreports/
Carrying out an analysis on the overlap of the IsPETase and FoCut proteins, we noticed that the active 
site region is the same for both (Fig.  2, panel D and E), which agrees with a previous contribution 34. Thus, 
we observed that the PET using the spatial coordinates of another work on the catalytic site of the IsPETase 
enzyme34, when superimposed, is in the same region in FoCut.
Structural analysis of the Cutinase protein from Fusarium oxysporum
MD simulations with a duration of 1 μs (1000 ns) enabled us to understand the enzyme’s behaviour without the 
presence of ligands in the active site. We observed that the enzyme hightly stable throughout the simulation, with 
an RMSD value of 1.09 Å (Fig. 3, panel A). A high number of hydrogen bonds between the protein residues was 
observed. Besides, the enzyme has two disulfide bridges between residues Cys172–Cys179 and Cys32–Cys110 as 
also observed in the homologous structure of Cut from Fusarium solani11,89,90. Furthermore, the PETase enzyme 
presents the same disulfide bonds in the F. solani cutinase enzyme responsible for maintaining the stability of 
the active site1,90.
The RMSF analysis show values below 3.0 Å (Fig. 2, panel B), indicating that the amino acid residues exhibited 
minimal fluctuations during the simulation, particularly in the catalytic site region. Only fluctuations in the N- 
and C-terminal regions were identified, such as Asn28, Ser29, and Gly30, with values greater than 1.5 Å. We also 
noted that Leu82, located in the alpha helix region at the top of the catalytic site, presented a fluctuation of 1.5 Å. 
This fluctuation was influenced by the absence of ligands at the site.
We noted that during the simulation, the Cut enzyme remained predominantly at 52.6% of the simulation 
time, with the active site region most exposed in the clustering analysis demonstrated by volume and surface 
region (Table 2). It is noted that the region of the loop referring to the active site of the enzyme between residues 
172–192 has movement (Fig. 3, panel C). This movement is seen with the overlap of the clusters from the highest 
to the lowest occupancy value (Fig.  3 and Table S1). Thus, the absence of a substrate in the active site of the 
enzyme causes it to remain in an open state.

Molecular Dynamics 
MD simulations were performed in triplicate to evaluate the obtained data statistically. The initial analysis 
focused on the behavior of the ligands in the enzyme’s active site. We observed that PET, PHBH, PBS, PBAT, 
and PCL remained in all replicates, as shown in Table 3. Therefore, only the complexes with these ligands, which 
remained stable across all replicates, were selected for the subsequent structural analyses.
The polymers PLA, PHB, PHBV and PES showed few strong interactions in the enzyme’s active site, 
which resulted in the ligands leaving the active site during the simulation. The enzyme cutinase from T. alba19 
biodegrades the PLA polymer. The cutinase of this organism, although they have the catalytic triad in common, 
the structure of the protein is not similar to that of the fungus F. oxysporum, presenting only one disulfide bond 
in contrast to two disulfide bonds in FoCut, which play a fundamental role in the stability of the protein and 
maintaining your active website. The polymer PHB and PHBH do not have data on biodegradation activity 
among the organisms used. In contrast to PHBH, the PHB polymer did not demonstrate strong interactions 
during the simulations and did not remain in the enzyme’s active site. The PHBV polymer showed only a single 
interaction with the Thr51 residue.
In RMSD analyses (Fig.  4), considering the last minimization step as reference to all replicates, PBS and 
PCL exhibited considerable fluctuations in some replicates due to the instability in the structure of the ligands. 
The RMSD value in replicate 3 of 3.38 Å (± 0.67) for the complex with PCL and 3.69 Å (± 0.97) for PBS is due 
to the structural change of the polymers, as their structures are mainly involved through single bonds between 
the C–C atoms and C–O with very few double bonds, the sigma bonds rotate, causing the ligand to change its 
conformation easily quickly. During the simulation, the structures of these polymers rotate entirely, losing their 
stretched position initially obtained by the docking stage. This is observed by the RMSD values referring solely 
to these two polymers, considering only the heavy atoms (C and O), in this replicates being 4.09 Å (± 1.38) and 
6.53 Å (± 1.38) for PCL and PBS respectively. This is justifiable due to the chemical structure of these polymers.
The PHBH structure remained stable across all replicates, which can be attributed to its smaller size than to 
the other selected polymers. We observed that the structural integrity of the PET complexes in replicates 1 and 
3 was maintained throughout the 100 ns of the MD simulations. In replicate 2, the increased RMSD value was 
due to a conformational change in the PET structure, a behaviour that has been observed in previous studies.34 
Similarly, in the PBS complex, the structural change in replicate 3 was responsible for the increased RMSD 
value.The PBAT complex showed stability across all three replicates. This polymer contains an aromatic ring 
in its structure, similar to PET. This structural similarity is a crucial factor in interactions with residues at the 
active site, which may explain the stability of this polymer in the enzyme. The system with PBS exhibited high 
movement in the RMSD graph due to its structure being predominantly composed of carbon–carbon sigma 
bonds, which undergo rotations. These conformational changes account for the fluctuations observed in the 
RMSD graph. In additional RMSD analyses, we observed the behaviour of only the ligand and protein in each 
of the studied systems (Figures S2 and S3). This analysis revealed that the protein remained stable throughout 
the simulation time, regardless of the ligand, across all replicates. This demonstrates that the desviations in the 
RMSD of the complexes are directly attributable to the ligands. Furthermore, an additional MD simulation 
analysis of only the protein further confirms the stability of this enzyme during the simulation.
All systems demonstrated that the enzyme remained stable, with fluctuations not exceeding 3.0 Å (Fig.  5). 
This is consistent with the RMSD analysis data, where we showed that the instability of a system is directly 
related to the ligand. The RMSF data indicate a similar fluctuation profile across all six best systems and across all 
replicates. A slight fluctuation was observed in the system with PCL in repetition 2, resulting in more significant 
fluctuations than the others.This fluctuation is attributed to a structural change in the ligand in this replicate, 
leading to weaker interactions and consequently greater fluctuation. None of the systems showed significant 
fluctuation for the catalytic triad residues Ser121, His189, and Asp176.
We applied the clustering methodology to each replicate individually, as well as to the entire set, to evaluate 
the ligand conformation in each replicate. We determined how the structure was maintained by identifying the 
most populous cluster (Table S2). The PET analysis demonstrated that in replicates 1 and 3 (with simulation 
time fractions of 43.5% and 50.5%, respectively). The PET presented a similar structure and in replicate 2 (with

46%) the single bonds between carbons rotated as demonstrated in another Molecular Dynamics study with 
PET complexed to PETase 34. Considering the 3 replicates together in total, the structure obtained is similar 
to that obtained in replicates 1 and 3 with a time fraction of 68.9% (Figure S5). For complexes with PBAT, the 
replicates did not show much similarity, even with the similar RMSD between the replicates. Each structure did 
not remain stable in the simulation with values below 40% of the simulation time fraction, with the total pose 
being 36.9%. The aromatic ring present in both PBAT and PET carries out pi interactions with protein residues 
in the catalytic site.
The interactions between the ligands with the amino acids of the catalytic site of the FoCut enzyme were 
computed through fingerprint analysis with the ProLif program, demonstrating that the main interactions that 
are carried out for the complex with PET in the three replicates are Leu82, Ala86, Leu183, Val185, Leu190. The 
first replicate presented more interactions with an occurrence greater than 0.5 with the residues of the site, which 
directly explains the stable RMSD during the simulation time.
Moreover, residues Tyr120 and His189 perform pi interactionts with the aromatic rings of both ligands (Fig. 6, 
panel B and D). For complexes with PBAT, the main residues that interact in the three replicates are Tyr120, 
Val185, Leu190. The same situation is present in PET, the most stable system in RMSD, which is consequently 
the one that performs the most fingerprint interactions in complexes with PBAT. We also highlight that both 
complexes are formed mainly through hydrophobic, van der Waals and pi interactions. Both interact with the 
critical residue His189, corresponding to a catalytic residue. Furthermore, the catalytic Serine in Cutinase from 
T. fusca is involved in the PBAT degradation mechanism22.
Complexes with PHBH carry out interactions with residues Ser43, Leu82, Gln122, Leu183, Val185, Leu190 
in all replicate (Fig. 7). However, the catalytic residue His189 in two replicates has an occurrence value greater 
than 0.5, in replicate 2 this value is the opposite (less than 0.5), but in the total calculation, this contribution 
appears as a strong interaction as well as Glu45 and Tyr120. Furthermore, in replicate 1, another catalytic residue 
interacts with the ligand, Ser121. The main interactions forming these complexes with PHBH are van der Waals 
and hydrophobic, with only a single hydrogen bond with the Ser43 residue.

Complexes with PBS are mainly formed by hydrophobic van der Waals interactions (Fig.  7). However, the 
polymer also performs an anionic interaction (Arg55) and two hydrogen bonds (Ser43, Arg55), with the Arg55 
residue only in replicate 1. The residues Ser43, Leu82, Tyr120, Ser121, Gln122, Leu183, Val185, Leu190 perform 
interactions of van der Waals and hydrophobic in the 3 replicates. Furthermore, residue His189 appears in 
two replicates and is also a essential interaction residue. In this way, we observed that PBS is one of the best 
ligands due to its high number of interactions and the high occurrence value of these interactions that the ligand 
performs with residues of the catalytic site.
PCL interacts with residues Ser43, Leu82, Tyr120, Val185, Leu190 in the three replicates to form PCL–FoCut 
complexes (Figure S5, panel C). The interactions involved in forming of this complex are predominantly van 
der Waals and hydrophobic, but the ligand performs hydrogen interactions with residues Ser43 and Leu82 in 
replicate 2. This demonstrates that during this replicate, the ligand was closer to these residues than in the other 
replicates, which justifies its having the lowest RMSD value. The absence of strong interactions in replicate 3 
causes the ligand to carry out more movements at the site than a system with more entries, which justifies the 
high RMSD value of this replicate. PCL complex in MrCut can be biodegraded by the enzyme 12. Our study 
identified the affinity of the ligand to interact with residues from the FoCut enzyme site of another organism. This 
demonstrates that Cutinase enzymes can function as biocatalysts in polymer degradation reactions regardless of 
the organism. This information provides insights into the critical amino acid residues of the catalytic site that are 
involved in forming the enzyme–substrate complex.
Through the interactions that polymers carry out in the active site of the enzyme, the key residues Ser43, 
Val185 and Leu190 are in the active site and contribute for the formation of all polymer– FoCut complexes 
studied. Where the Ser43 residue, as well as Gln122, is present in the region of the oxyanion hole95.

In the clustering analysis (Figure S6), PHBH presented similar structures in replicates 1 and 3 and in the total 
structure (considering all 3 replicates together). This demonstrates that the ligand remained predominantly in a 
similar conformation in the enzyme’s active site during all simulations (73.5%). The same is observed in the PBS 
structures in replicates 2 and total. This structure of the second replicate appears stable structure during 70.1% 
of the total simulation time of the three replicates together. For the system with PCL, the majority structure of 
replicate 3 is identical to the total structure of the replicates, however, replicates 1 and 2 are completely different, 
showing that the ligand can present these other two conformations due to its high number of sigma bonds that 
rotate during simulation. This conformational change demonstrates that the conformation of replicate 2 (with 
54.3% presence during the simulation time) performs strong interactions at the site, which demonstrates that it 
is a critical conformation that performs interactions with the catalytic residue Ser121 in addition to interaction 
with Leu190, which is a residue key in protein stabilization through the alpha helix95.
The analysis of the distance between the polymers, considering the representative pose of the clustering 
carried out with the three simulations together (Total Cluster, Figures S5 and S6) and the catalytic residues 
demonstrated that in some systems the catalytic Serine is considerably close to the carbon of the ester group in 
the polymer structure, enabling nucleophilic attack to cleave the polymer structure. The PBS polymers presented 
the smallest distance from the carbon of the ester group and Ser121. The PET polymer during the simulation 
approached Ser121, moving from an initial distance of 6.4 to 4.1  Å (Figure S1 and Fig.  8). PBAT presented 
a distance of 4.2 Å and PCL with 4.8 Å. The rotation of the C–C single bonds caused the PHBH polymer to 
lose interaction with residue Ser121, however, in replicate 1 this interaction is maintained firmly during the 
simulation. This shows that no matter how much the conformational change occurred in the total replicate, 
Ser121 aims to interact with this carbon of the Ester group of the polymer so that the nucleophilic attack occurs. 
This information serves as a starting point for elucidating the reaction mechanism of polymers biodegraded by 
FoCut and also of other Cutinase from organisms.
Polymers complexes binding affinities
The binding free energy data demonstrate that PET is the polymer with the highest affinity for the Cutinase 
enzyme (Table 4). Experimental methods, such as microscopy, have shown and confirmed the ability of the 
fungus Fusarium oxysporum to biodegrade PET-type polymers through the Cutinase enzyme 54. Among the 
nine polymers studied, five exhibit affinity for the Cutinase enzyme, with PET having the most escellent affinity 
at -34.26 (± 5.51) kcal/mol. In addition to PET, the polymers PHBH, PBS, PBAT, and PCL also showed high 
binding affinbity with the FoCut enzyme, with values of − 18.44 (± 4.41), − 29.71 (± 5.90), − 22.78 (± 5.36), and 
− 22.26 (± 6.56) kcal/mol, respectively. In 2021, it was discovered that Cutinase from M. roreri can biodegrade 
PES, PCL and PET polymers with degradation percentages of 59%, 43% and 31%, respectively, after 21 days 12. 
This demonstrates that MrCut1 can biodegrade polymers other than PET, with a greater affinity for the PES 
polymer. In the case of FoCut, the PES polymer showed little affinity and did not remain bound for the entire 
simulation, dissociating at approximately 80 ns. Therefore, the binding free energy value of -13.57 (± 8.63) kcal/
mol suggests that further studies are needed to explore the potential of FoCut to degrade this polymer. However, 
PCL and PET polymers showed a binding affinity with the FoCut enzyme. KrCut has demonstrated the ability 
to biodegrade PCL polymers and the synthetic polyester poly(1,3-propylene adipate) 18. As with KrCut, FoCut

also showed binding affinity with the PCL polymer, demonstrating that even though they are from different 
organisms, the MrCut1 and KrCut enzymes have the same affinity for PCL.
The system with PET exhibited the most favorable residues, which is consistent with its highest affinity 
value. The smaller the ΔG value and the greater the number of interactions, the more favourable residues are 
involved. The main residues contributing to the ∆G total value in the three replicates for PET are Leu82, Ala86, 
Leu183, Val185, and Leu190. In the complexes with PHBH, the residues that consistently contributed across 
the three replicates are Ser43, Leu82, Gln122, Leu183, and Leu185 (Figure S7). In the complex with PBS, most 
of the central residues contribute to the three replicates being Gly42, Ser43, Leu82, Tyr120, *Ser121, Gln122, 
Leu183, Val185 and Leu190. In the system with PBAT, only three main residues contribute to all replicates, 
Leu82, Val185, and Leu190. In the last system, the complexes with PCL, only two residues appear, contributing 
to all replicates Val185 and Leu190.
The amino acid residues Val185 and Leu190 were favorable in all replicates across all five systems (Figure 
S7), demonstrating their key role in complex formation through van der Waals and hydrogen interactions. These 
residues are part of the catalytic loop region (Fig. 3, panel C), confirming its importance in maintaining the polymer 
in the active site. These common residues in all systems across the three replicates indicate that all polymers 
remained in the same region of the enzyme’s active site. Additionally, the Leu82 residue, located in another loop 
region, is highlighted as crucial for maintaining the stability of the polymer complexes, as this region exhibits 
high fluctuation in the absence of polymers (Fig.  3). Furthermore, the Ser121 catalytic residues were favorable 
for at least one replicate of the complexes performing van der Waals interaction. As this movement only happens 
in these replicates, through fingerprint analysis we were able to visualize that some interactions carried out in 
these replicates are not carried out in the others due to the unique rotational movement of the single bonds in the

polymer structure during these simulations. This character is not shown in the other replicates, which suggests 
that it is unique and particular to these replicates in isolation, as in replicate 2 of the complex with PBS this residue 
contributes favorably.
Conclusion
Our phylogenetic analysis provided important insights into the biological similarity of enzymes that biodegrade 
polymers in different types of organisms. It demonstrated that although F . oxysporum cutinase is not closely related 
to KrCut and MrCut, they all can biodegrade polymers. Thus, these discoveries show that even though bacteria 
or fungi produce them, these enzymes have this biological similarity of biodegrading polymers. Therefore, our 
findings provide the critical information that FoCut is like Cutinase from several organisms such as Aspergillus 
oryzae, Moniliophthora roreri, Paraphoma sp., Humicola insolens, Saccharomonospora viridis, Thermobifida 
fusca, Fusarium solani. Furthermore, an overlap analysis demonstrate that both FoCut and IsPETase enzymes 
have the catalytic triad in the same region, which also justifies the similarity of the region in which PET was 
inserted through Molecular Docking, being similar to the IsPETase enzyme site region as already demonstrated 
in the literature. Furthermore, our data demonstrate that the polymers PET, PHBH, PBS, PBAT, and PCL can 
bind into Cutinase enzyme from Fusarium oxysporum, demonstrating the possibility of biodegradation activity 
of these new polymers in addition to PET (− 34.26 ± 5.51), which has already been reported in the literature 
as a polymer degraded by this enzyme, with binding free energy values equal to −  18.44 (± 4.41), −  29.71

(± 5.90), −  22.78 (± 5.36), and −  22.26 (± 6.56) kcal/mol, respectively. We therefore demonstrated, through 
computational simulations, the stability through the intermolecular interactions of these polymers in the active 
site, highlighting the importance of key residues such as Val185 and Leu190 that are involved in an opening 
loop—also called catalytic loop—responsible for causing the polymers remain in the active site. We highlight 
the Ser43 and Gln122 exclusion as one of the key residues important to coordinate the ester group region and 
keep the ligands close to the catalytic triad through the oxyanion hole. Furthermore, we highlight the polymer 
binding mode through predominantly vdW and hydrophobic interactions to form the polymer–FoCut complex. 
The cleavage mechanism of these polymers through the ester group, by the nucleophilic attack of the catalytic 
Serine, in their structures demonstrates the similarity between cutinases and PETases enzymes. Thus, our work 
provides a new perspective for using Cut enzymes, especially FoCut, as biocatalysts for polymer degradation 
reactions, providing insights into the possibility of enzymatic improvement to increase their enzymatic activity.
