ABSTRACT
Microplastics (MPs), defined as plastic particles ranging from 1 µ m to 5 mm, have emerged as pervasive con -
taminants in both terrestrial and aquatic environments, posing significant ecological and human health risks. 
Their sources are broadly categorized as primary, such as microbeads, microfibres, paints and pharmaceutical 
additives, and secondary, which result from the degradation of larger plastic products. This growing concern of 
MPs led to development of different mitigation techniques but the recent advancements in microbial biodeg -
radation present a promising approach to mitigating MPs pollution. Thus, microbial biodegradation could play a 
crucial role in developing sustainable solutions to tackle global MPs pollution. This review explores the potential 
of various microorganisms, including bacteria, fungi, and algae, in degrading MPs through enzymatic processes, 
thereby shortening the half-life of these pollutants. A detailed examination of the degradation mechanisms of 
commonly used polymers such as polyethylene, polystyrene, and polyvinyl chloride highlights the efficacy and 
limitations of microbial biodegradation. Despite the promising capabilities of certain strains, the overall weight 
loss rate of MPs remains quite low, typically ranging from 0 to 15%, necessitating further investigation into 
optimizing enzymatic activity and environmental conditions. Advancements in metagenomics and enzyme en -
gineering offer pathways to enhance degradation efficiency, potentially achieving up to 90% degradation within 
10 hrs under optimized conditions. This review underscores the need for comprehensive research to identify key 
microbial strains and enzymes involved, understand their degradation pathways, and investigate the influence of 
different environmental matrices on biodegradation processes.
1. Introduction
Over the past 150 years, plastics have progressively replaced tradi -
tional materials such as wood, glass, and metals, becoming an integral 
part of modern life. This widespread adoption is primarily due to their 
exceptional versatility, light weight, and durability ( Lebreton and 
Andrady, 2019 Fayshal, 2024 ). Unlike metals that are prone to rusting or 
glass that can easily shatter, plastics offer a more flexible and resilient 
alternative, making them suitable for an extensive range of applications. 
These characteristics have made plastics indispensable in numerous 
industries, including agriculture, where they are used in irrigation sys -
tems and packaging; construction, where they serve in insulation and 
piping; healthcare, where they are critical for medical devices, dispos -
ables, and packaging; and consumer goods, where they appear in 
everything from electronics to clothing ( Bundela and Pandey, 2022 ; 
Najahi et al., 2025 ).
The widespread use of plastic materials has resulted in the genera -
tion of vast quantities of plastic waste, yet current waste management 
systems remain insufficient to address this growing challenge ( Fayshal, 
2024 ). According to Geyer et al. (2017) , by 2015, merely 9 % of global

plastic waste had been recycled, 12 % was incinerated, and a staggering 
79 % was either landfilled or mismanaged. Ineffective disposal practices 
have led to the alarming emergence of MPs, plastic particles smaller 
than 5 mm which are now recognized as significant environmental 
pollutants. Due to their widespread presence and potential risks to both 
ecosystems and human health, MPs have attracted growing scientific 
and public concern ( Kumar et al., 2021 ). These particles are recognized 
as a major environmental concern due to their pervasive presence and 
potential harm to ecosystems and human health ( Belioka and Achilias, 
2024 ). MPs originate from two primary sources: primary MPs, which are 
intentionally engineered for use in products such as cosmetic microbe -
ads, textile fibers, and industrial abrasives and secondary MPs, which 
generated through the gradual degradation of larger plastic debris via 
physical, chemical, or biological processes ( Thompson et al., 2024 ).
Multiple anthropogenic activities contribute to the growing problem 
of microplastic (MP) pollution. Major sources include tire abrasion, 
which generates MPs through friction on road surfaces; laundering of 
synthetic textiles, which discharges microfibers into wastewater; and 
inadvertent emissions from industrial processes ( Veerasingam et al., 
2020 ). Alarmingly, it is estimated that 80 – 90 % of MPs present in 
aquatic environments originate from terrestrial sources, ultimately 
being transported via runoff and drainage systems into rivers, lakes, and 
oceans. These microscopic particles, often undetectable without 
instrumentation, are readily ingested by aquatic organisms, bio -
accumulate through trophic levels, and have even been detected in 
drinking water. Such findings underscore growing concerns regarding 
their persistent environmental presence and potential adverse effects on 
both ecological systems and human health ( Rakib et al., 2023 ).
In light of these challenges, addressing plastic pollution, particularly 
MPs, has emerged as a critical global priority. Effective solutions de -
mand improved waste management practices, innovative in mitigation 
technologies, and international collaboration to minimize plastic waste 
at the source. In addition, effective mitigation practices are essential to 
curb the MPs pollution. Various methods are used to degrade MPs, each 
with advantages and challenges ( Acharya et al., 2022 ). Thermal 
degradation involves heating MPs to high temperatures, breaking them 
down into smaller molecules, though this process requires substantial 
energy and can release harmful gases ( Hu et al., 2022 ). Hydrolytic 
degradation uses water to chemically break down MPs, while mechan -
ical degradation relies on physical forces like grinding or milling to 
reduce plastic size. Both methods are effective but often combined with 
other techniques to improve efficiency ( Sutkar et al., 2023 ). Advanced 
Oxidation Processes (AOPs) offer another approach, utilizing highly 
reactive species such as hydroxyl radicals to degrade MPs. AOP tech -
niques include photodegradation, where ultraviolet (UV) light breaks 
down MPs, and photocatalytic degradation, which uses catalysts like 
titanium dioxide (TiO
2
) to accelerate degradation under light exposure 
( Kim et al., 2022 ). Exposure to UV radiation can degrade MPs, both 
biological and non-biological methods have been reported to break 
down these particles, particularly those measuring up to 5 mm ( Sun 
et al., 2022 ). Although bioremediation is an effective approach, it pre -
sents several limitations. The process is often time-consuming, appli -
cable primarily to biodegradable compounds ( Alqahtani et al., 2023 ; Le 
et al., 2023 ). Moreover, scaling up biological treatment systems poses 
significant challenges. However, integrating biodegradation with other 
remediation methods has shown promising results ( Kumah et al., 2023 ; 
Shruti et al., 2023 ; Tse et al., 2023 ).
Biodegradation involves the use of microorganisms such as micro -
algae, bacteria, and fungi to break down MPs into less harmful sub -
stances. Approaches like bioaugmentation, which introduces specialized 
microbial strains into contaminated environments, have shown promise 
in enhancing the natural degradation process ( Tang, 2023 ). Composting, 
another biodegradation strategy, involves the use of microbial com -
munities in organic waste decomposition, promoting the breakdown of 
MPs alongside compost material. Microbial strains like Acinetobacter sp., 
Bacillus sp., and Pseudomonas sp. have exhibited significant capabilities 
in degrading various types of plastics, including polypropylene (PP), 
polyethylene (PE), and polyethylene terephthalate (PET) ( Wr ´obel et al., 
2024 ). Therefore, this review includes an overview of these combined 
approaches. Microorganisms like microalgae, bacteria, and fungi are 
acknowledged as economically feasible and environmentally friendly 
agents for the bio-deterioration of MPs. This review provides a 
comprehensive assessment of microplastic degradation processes. It 
outlines the definition, classification, sources, toxicity, physicochemical 
properties, and environmental persistence of microplastics to establish a 
foundational understanding of the problem. Additionally, paper ad -
dresses the key limitations and challenges, including environmental 
factors, scalability concerns, and the risk of secondary pollutants. The 
review further discusses emerging approaches and future perspectives, 
emphasizing advanced technologies, integrated strategies, and sustain -
able solutions aimed at enhancing degradation efficiency and mitigating 
long-term ecological impacts.
2. Definition and type of MPs
The term "microplastics" was first introduced in the 1990 by an Af -
rican researcher in the seminal paper "Plastic and other artifacts on 
South African beaches: temporal trends in abundance and composition." 
Since then, the term has achieved widespread global usage, broadly 
referring to small plastic particles. Although debates persist regarding a 
standardized definition, MPs are generally described as plastic frag -
ments ranging from 1 µ m to 5000 µ m in size ( Jaafar et al., 2020 ; Khalid 
et al., 2021 ). Based on size classification, plastic debris larger than 25 
mm is categorized as macroplastics, particles between 5 – 25 mm as 
mesoplastics, and those smaller than 100 nm as nanoplastics ( Ziani 
et al., 2023 ). MPs are further classified into two major types based on 
their origin: primary and secondary MPs. Primary MPs are deliberately 
manufactured at small sizes for use in personal care products (e.g., 
toothpaste, facial cleansers, and shower gels) and industrial applications 
such as abrasive agents in air-blasting processes and resin pellet pro -
duction ( Khalid et al., 2021 ; Nava and Leoni, 2021 ). In contrast, sec -
ondary MPs are generated through the fragmentation of larger plastic 
items due to various degradation pathways, including chemical pro -
cesses (e.g., UV exposure, freeze-thaw cycles), physical forces (e.g., 
wave action, turbulence), and biological mechanisms (e.g., microbial 
degradation) ( Khalid et al., 2021 ; Dong et al., 2021 ). The origin of all 
MPs ultimately traces back to the polymerization of monomeric units 
during plastic production.
3. Sources of MPs in the environment
MPs contamination stems from both primary and secondary sources, 
representing one of the most pressing environmental challenges of our 
time. Primary sources include cosmetic products, household goods, and 
drug delivery systems containing polymerized materials such as poly -
ethylene (PE), polyamide nylon (PN), polystyrene (PS), polyvinyl chlo -
ride (PVC), and polypropylene (PP) ( Rani, 2022 ). Within personal care 
items, MPs typically sized between 0.1 and 0.5 mm are prevalent as 
"microbeads" or "micro-exfoliants" ( Bermúdez and Swarzenski, 2021 ; 
Cozzarini et al., 2023 ). These materials require antioxidants and stabi -
lizers to prevent oxidative-thermal deterioration. Secondary MP for -
mation occurs through physical wear, hydrolysis, and biodegradation, 
with organisms facilitating decomposition through enzyme production 
( Yang et al., 2024 ). Notable contributors to the dissemination of sec -
ondary micro and nano-plastics include deliberate disposal of large 
polymer items into terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems, as well as in -
dustrial processes such as the thermal degradation of polystyrene and 
synthetic fibers ( Dimassi et al., 2022 ; Saadu et al., 2023 ). The wide -
spread proliferation of disposable plastic products, particularly those 
constructed from PE, polyester fibers, and PET, has resulted in excessive 
production levels of these materials. According to Thompson et al. 
(2024) , microplastics enter marine environments from multiple sources 
P. Yadav et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Current Research in Microbial Sciences 9 (2025) 100495

totaling 0.8 – 3 million tons annually ( Fig. 1 ). The largest contributors 
include synthetic textiles from washing machines (200,000 – 500,000 
tons/year, ~35 % of primary microplastics), tire wear particles (270, 
000 – 1,300,000 tons/year), and fragmentation of larger plastic debris 
(7.6 million tons of MPs input that eventually degrades). Smaller but 
significant sources include paint particles (15,000 – 100,000 tons/year), 
personal care products (8000 – 40,000 tons/year), and fishing gear 
abrasion. Land-based sources account for approximately 80 % of total 
marine plastic pollution, with sea-based activities contributing the 
remaining 20 % ( Thompson et al., 2024 ).
Each year, approximately 1 – 2 million metric tons of MPs are intro -
duced into the marine environment, posing a critical threat to oceanic 
ecosystems. The primary contributors include synthetic textile fibers 
(~35 %), tire and road wear particles (~28 %), and discarded or lost 
fishing gear (~10 %) ( Yang et al., 2021 ). Other significant sources 
encompass microbeads from personal care products, plastic pellet spills, 
and degraded paint particles. Collectively, these inputs underscore the 
pervasive and multifaceted nature of MPs pollution in marine systems.
3.1. Household and agricultural sources
Household waste encompasses diverse disposable materials 
including shopping bags, food packaging, printed materials, diapers, 
and organic waste. This category distinguishes between non-hazardous 
materials (food waste, paper, bottles) and hazardous waste (plastics, 
electronics, medical waste) containing toxic organic compounds, heavy 
metals, and ozone-depleting substances that pose flammability and 
explosive risks, necessitating specialized disposal procedures ( Dehghani 
et al., 2021 ; Kumar et al., 2023 ). Hazardous waste often contains toxic 
organic compounds, high levels of heavy metals, and ozone-depleting 
substances, posing potential risks of flammability or explosiveness and 
necessitating specialized collection, handling, and disposal procedures 
to minimize environmental contamination and protect public health 
( Chauhan et al., 2024 ). Effective management of both hazardous and 
non-hazardous household waste is therefore critical to ensure environ -
mental sustainability and reduce associated health risks.
Plastics have become essential in agricultural practices, serving 
various purposes such as irrigation, mulching, crop protection, silage 
covering, and packaging for seeds and fertilizers. Additionally, a notable 
portion of plastic is utilized in creating nets and coverings to safeguard 
crops from adverse weather conditions, wildlife, and insects ( Espí et al., 
2006 ). The global yearly consumption of agricultural plastics stands at 
approximately 6.5 million metric tons, resulting in a significant volume 
of agricultural plastic waste. While this accumulation presents a chal -
lenge in terms of pollution, it also offers an opportunity for consolidation 
and processing ( Lakhiar et al., 2024 ). Nevertheless, the recycling of 
agricultural plastic waste remains minimal, with recycling rates varying 
greatly between countries and contingent upon regional facility avail -
ability. A considerable portion of agricultural plastic waste is disposed of 
through burial in soil, uncontrolled burning in fields, or abandonment in 
open areas, leading to its eventual accumulation in landfills or adjacent 
water bodies such as rivers and canals ( Lanorte et al., 2017 ; Islam et al., 
2023 ).
3.2. Road dust and industrial contributions
Road dust is recognized as a major source of MPs, defined as plastic 
particles smaller than 5 mm ( Myszka et al., 2023 ). The presence of MPs 
in road dust raises environmental and health concerns, as they can be 
transported to aquatic ecosystems, contributing to widespread pollu -
tion. These MPs primarily come from various human activities. Vehicle 
tires release rubber and other materials through wear, significantly 
contributing to the MPs load, with studies finding between 102 and 303 
particles per gram of road dust. Road materials, such as bitumen in 
asphalt and road paint, also contribute, with carbon black a common 
additive in tires and bitumen identified as a key component of MPs in 
road dust ( Giechaskiel et al., 2024 ; 
¨
Ozen and Mutuk, 2025 ). Addition -
ally, plastic litter on roads breaks down into smaller fragments, further 
increasing MPs content. Research shows that MP concentrations in road 
dust vary with environmental conditions ( Premarathna et al., 2025 ). For 
instance, longer drying periods after rainfall lead to higher concentra -
tions, reaching up to 1530 MPs per gram over three days. Land use also 
impacts MP levels, with industrial areas showing concentrations as high 
as 2410 particles per kilogram ( Yang et al., 2023 ; Yamamoto et al., 
2025 ). Most MPs in road dust are small, often less than 400 µ m , posing 
health risks due to inhalation ( Kang et al., 2022 ; Tejano et al., 2025 ). 
MPs are transported through stormwater runoff, which carries them 
from roads to aquatic systems, and environmental factors like traffic 
volume, temperature, and wind influence their distribution.
Industrial plastic waste originates from large-scale manufacturing, 
processing, and packaging industries, including construction and de -
molition firms, electronics and electrical sectors, automotive manufac -
turers, packaging companies, as well as small and medium enterprises. 
The benefit of plastic waste from these sectors is its typically clean and 
uncontaminated nature and its availability in significant quantities. 
However, effective guidelines and regulations are imperative for the 
proper disposal and recycling of industrial plastics to ensure optimal 
utilization with minimal environmental impact ( Fayshal, 2024 ; Kibria 
et al., 2023 ). Municipal solid waste (MSW) is characterized by its het -
erogeneous composition, comprising a mixture of recyclable, biode -
gradable, and hazardous materials. Reprocessing and reshaping 
represent efficient strategies for managing homogeneous plastic waste, 
as opposed to disposing of or incinerating it alongside general MSW 
( Gaylor et al., 2013 ). Conversely, heterogeneous plastic waste,

containing mixed resins, presents challenges for reclamation due to the 
varying processing temperatures and pressures required for each resin 
type.
3.3. Medical and personal care products
Medical plastic waste (MPW) has increased substantially due to 
technological advancement and healthcare expansion, encompassing 
PPE, gloves, syringes, catheters, and medicine coverings ( Thacharodi 
et al., 2024 ). In 2018, China generated approximately 817,000 tons of 
MPW ( Ding et al., 2021 ), while the COVID-19 pandemic exacerbated 
this issue dramatically. Hubei Province saw 370 % increases during 
outbreak peaks ( Ding et al., 2025 ; Kleme ˇs et al., 2020 ). The COVID-19 
pandemic dramatically intensified this issue. For instance, UNICEF 
distributed over 200 million medical masks globally beginning in 
January 2020, significantly adding to the MPW burden ( Filip et al., 
2022 ). The discovery of various types of facemasks in the ocean, even 
within bird nests, has tragically resulted in the deaths of some birds due 
to entanglement in this debris. Amid the COVID-19 pandemic, the 
United States witnessed a substantial increase in medical mask usage, 
reaching 89 million, while the United Kingdom utilized nearly 24.37 
billion masks annually ( Wang et al., 2023 ). The growing volume of 
plastic waste poses a significant threat in terms of carbon dioxide 
emissions. China and Japan collectively employ approximately 14.8 
million facemasks daily ( Dey et al., 2023 ). The disposal of facemasks 
raises alarming biodiversity concerns, potentially harming the digestive 
systems of animals and causing internal blockages. The release of 
micro-particles from mask usage has surged to 1246.62 items, empha -
sizing the urgency of action ( Chen et al., 2022 ). Single-use plastics 
including facemasks may take over 450 years to decompose, releasing 
MPs during degradation and contributing to an estimated 1.56 billion 
masks entering oceans ( Benson et al., 2021 ; Jiang et al., 2023 ; Silva 
et al., 2020 ;). During the COVID-19 crisis, there was an increase in 
plastic burning to prevent contamination, resulting in adverse envi -
ronmental effects ( Filip et al., 2022 ; Jayasinghe et al., 2024 ).
PCPs play a major role in MPs pollution, especially due to the pres -
ence of microbeads. These tiny plastic particles are deliberately included 
for their exfoliating or cleansing benefits ( Sun et al., 2020 ). Commonly 
used polymers for these microbeads include PE, PP, PET, polymethyl 
methacrylate, various nylons, polyester, and polyurethanes ( Bharath 
et al., 2021 ). MPs can be found in a variety of personal care items such as 
facial cleansers, body washes, shampoos, conditioners, toothpaste, and 
cosmetics like makeup and sunscreens ( Bikiaris et al., 2024 ). Research in 
Sri Lanka identified low-density polyethylene and ethylene-propylene 
copolymer as prevalent types of MPs, with sizes ranging from 150 to 
600 μ m ( Gamage and Mahagamage, 2024 ). In India, microbeads were 
present in 45 % of products tested, with polyethylene being the most 
frequently used polymer ( Sun et al., 2020 ). Additionally, oral care 
products exhibited considerable MPs contamination, with toothbrushes 
showing the highest concentration of particles ( Protyusha et al., 2024 ).
4. MPs pollution and need for its mitigation
MPs have emerged as a pressing environmental concern, particularly 
within marine ecosystems. Their pervasive presence in oceans, rivers, 
and other aquatic environments stems from multiple sources, including 
the fragmentation of macroplastics, the use of microbeads in personal 
care products, and the release of synthetic fibers during textile laun -
dering ( Wu et al., 2018 ). Owing to their minute size, MPs are readily 
ingested by a wide range of marine organisms ranging from plankton at 
the base of the food web to larger fauna such as fish, seabirds, and turtles 
posing serious risks to biodiversity and food security ( Grattagliano et al., 
2025 ). This ingestion can severely affect their health and survival. One 
major concern is the blockage of gastrointestinal tracts caused by MPs, 
which leads to decreased food intake and starvation, particularly in fish 
and seabirds ( Fournier et al., 2021 ). This obstruction disrupts normal 
feeding behaviors and creates energy imbalances that hinder repro -
duction and growth. Research indicates that exposure to MPs can result 
in stunted growth and increased oxidative stress in marine organisms, 
damaging vital cellular functions and weakening immune systems 
( Bessa et al., 2018 ; Bharath et al., 2021 ; Koelmans et al., 2016 ).
MPs also act as vectors for toxic chemicals by absorbing persistent 
organic pollutants (POPs) and heavy metals from the environment. 
When ingested, these toxins can leach into marine organisms ’ tissues, 
leading to biochemical disruptions such as endocrine interference and 
reproductive issues ( Wang et al., 2018 ). Bioaccumulation occurs when 
toxins concentrate within an organism ’ s tissues, while biomagnification 
amplifies these effects as MPs move up the food chain, impacting larger 
predators and potentially humans who consume seafood ( Miller et al., 
2020 ). Humans can be exposed to MPs through ingestion, inhalation, or 
skin contact, leading to various health issues including inflammation 
and oxidative stress ( Castro-Castellon et al., 2022 ). The environmental 
impact of MPs is extensive; they disrupt nutrient cycling and introduce 
harmful pollutants into food webs. Addressing MPs pollution is crucial 
for protecting ecosystems, marine life, and human health ( Grattagliano 
et al., 2025 ). Additionally, it has economic implications for industries 
like fishing and tourism. Global regulations are increasingly advocating 
for sustainable practices to mitigate plastic waste, aligning with broader 
sustainability efforts ( Mitrano and Wohlleben, 2020 ). Fig. 2 . Shows MPs 
and their associated pollutants accumulate across aquatic organisms, 
causing physical damage and serving as carriers of toxic substances, 
which lead to bioaccumulation, trophic transfer, and potential ecolog -
ical and human health risks ( Amelia et al., 2021 ).
4.1. Mechanism of MPs degradation in environment
MPs biodegradation is a complex process influenced by both physi -
cochemical and microbiological factors across diverse environments. 
The biodegradation of MPs involves three primary phases: (a) the initial 
attachment of microorganisms onto the MPs surface, (b) the utilization 
of the MPs as a carbon source, and (c) the subsequent breakdown of the 
MPs itself ( Lucas et al., 2008 ). Upon entering aquatic environments, MPs 
interact with inorganic particles, microbes, and organic matter, 
providing surfaces for microbial colonization and biofilm formation, 
thus creating new ecological niches ( Sooriyakumar et al., 2022 ).
In the first stage, microorganisms attach themselves to MPs surfaces, 
causing changes in their surface properties like adhesion and hydro -
philicity ( Fig. 3 ). A diverse array of microorganisms such as fungi, 
protists, bacteria, and algae, can attach to MPs surfaces and leading to 
formation of biofilm ( Tsiota et al., 2018 ; Sooriyakumar et al., 2022 ). 
Biofilm formation is a key mechanism in MPs biodegradation as it fa -
cilitates the attachment of microorganisms to MP surface, promotes the 
production of degradative enzymes and generates organic by products 
( Zurier and Goddard, 2021 ). This is followed by the release of chemicals 
and monomers from the MPs due to microbial enzyme activity and 
cellular processes, which accelerates the degradation process in the 
second stage. This enzymatic breakdown results in the conversion of 
large polymers into smaller monomers and oligomers, which have 
reduced molecular weights ( Mohanan et al., 2020 ). Eventually, micro -
bial filaments and water infiltrate the MPs, facilitating their decompo -
sition and utilization by microorganisms. Through these stages, 
microorganisms adhere to the surfaces of polymers and enzymatically 
degrade them, obtaining energy for their growth in the process ( Elahi 
et al., 2021 ). This comprehensive interaction and breakdown mecha -
nism underscore the significant role that microorganisms play in the 
biodegradation of MPs in various environments.
5. Microorganisms in MPs degradation
Microorganisms with the ability to break down MPs have been 
identified in a variety of environments, such as soil, freshwater, and 
marine ecosystems, illustrating their potential for MPs biodegradation 
P. Yadav et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Current Research in Microbial Sciences 9 (2025) 100495

( Kothawale et al., 2023 ). These microorganisms, which includes algae, 
fungi, and bacteria, utilize specific metabolic pathways to degrade MPs 
( Jain et al., 2023 ; Yuan et al., 2020 ). A critical component of this 
degradation process involves enzymes that these microorganisms pro -
duce. For instance, certain bacterial species release extracellular en -
zymes capable of hydrolyzing plastic polymers into smaller, more 
biodegradable components ( Heris, 2024 ). Mishra et al. (2022) , have 
provided insight into the widespread occurrence of these microorgan -
isms in different ecological niches, highlighting their importance in 
tackling plastic pollution. Algae, for example, have been found to secrete 
oxidative enzymes that initiate the breakdown of synthetic polymers. 
Fungi also play a crucial role by secreting ligninolytic enzymes, which 
can degrade various plastic types ( Vingiani et al., 2019 ). Similarly, 
bacterial species are known to produce hydrolases, such as esterases and 
lipases, which target the bonds in plastic molecules, accelerating their 
breakdown into simpler monomers ( Cai et al., 2023 ). Choi et al. (2024) , 
has emphasized isolating these enzymes to explore their efficiency and 
to understand the molecular mechanisms of MPs degradation. The 
following sections provide a detailed explanation of the biodegradation 
pathways for MPs by bacteria, fungi, algae, and other microorganisms.

5.1. Bacteria
Bacteria are the predominant microorganisms found in soil, air, and 
water, known for their adeptness in breaking down pollutants. Bacterial 
strains are proficient in degrading MPs and have been unearthed across 
diverse habitats, spanning polluted soil, marine sediments, wastewater, 
compost, sludge, municipal landfills, mangroves, and regions charac -
terized by extreme climatic conditions ( Awasthi et al., 2020 ; Rajendran 
et al., 2022 ). Studies have identified Sporosarcina globispora and Ba -
cillus cereus isolates from mangrove sediments as promising candidates 
for PP degradation ( Helen et al., 2017 ). Similarly, Auta et al. (2017)
highlighted the MPs-degrading capabilities of Bacillus gottheilii and B. 
cereus across various MP polymers. B. cereus demonstrated weight re -
ductions of 1.6 % for PE, 6.6 % for polyethylene terephthalate (PET), 
and 7.4 % for polystyrene, while B. gottheilii exhibited reductions of 5.8 
% (PS), 6.2 % (PE), 3.6 % (PP), and 3.0 % (PET). More recently, Bacillus 
sp. Y-01, isolated from plastic-contaminated sites in the Yellow Sea, 
demonstrated the ability to utilize PP as its sole carbon source ( Arefian 
et al., 2020 ). In another study, Patil and Bagde (2012) observed partial 
mineralization of PVC to the extent of 8.87 % by Micrococcus sp. Simi -
larly, Giacomucci et al. (2019) demonstrated the PVC-degrading ability 
of Pseudomonas citronellolis and Bacillus fexus . However, their findings 
suggested that the biodegradation activity primarily targeted additives 
within the PVC MPs, with less emphasis on the polymer chains them -
selves. In a notable study, a marine bacterial strain, Alcanivorax borku -
mensis , characterized by hydrocarbonoclastic properties, was employed 
to demonstrate biofilm formation on films of low-density polyethylene 
( Davoodi et al., 2023 ). The biodegradation process was enhanced by the 
presence of pyruvate, yeast extract, and hexadecane, which facilitated 
microbial activity. The interaction of alkanes with plastic surfaces 
modifies the hydrophilicity of microbial cell membranes, promoting the 
introduction of functional groups such as carboxyl ( – COOH), hydroxyl 
( – OH), and carbonyl (C = O) ( Miho et al., 2018 ). These chemical modi -
fications increase surface reactivity and significantly accelerate the 
biodegradation of polyethylene ( Miho et al., 2018 ). Fig. 4 illustrates the 
sequential process of MPs degradation mediated by bacterial enzymes. 
The pathway begins with microbial assimilation, where bacteria colo -
nize the plastic surface. This is followed by bio-deterioration, involving 
structural changes and weakening of the polymer surface. Subsequently, 
bio-fragmentation breaks down large polymers into smaller oligomers 
and monomers. These intermediates undergo bio-assimilation, where 
microbial cells take them up and metabolize them. Finally, the process 
culminates in mineralization, leading to the conversion of MPs into 
inorganic compounds such as CO ₂ , H ₂ O, and biomass ( Mandal et al., 
2024 ). Notably, Bacillus spp. in combination with Pseudomonas spp. 
represent approximately 21 % of the bacterial taxa implicated in MPs 
degradation.
Exposure to Stenotrophomonas maltophilia LB 2 – 3 led to rapid mo -
lecular weight reduction and physical property alterations in polylactic 
acid ( Jeon and Kim, 2013 ). MPs like polyurethanes when cultured with 
Escherichia coli , exhibited degradation rates ranging from 1 % to 2 % 
after 72 h of incubation ( Habib et al., 2020 ; Jeyavani et al., 2021 ). 
Additionally, Microbacterium paraoxydans and Pseudomonas aeruginosa 
have exhibited an effective biodegradation of low-density polyethylene 
over a two-month period. Biofilms generated by AKS2 Pseudomonas sp. 
have demonstrated the ability to degrade PE by up to 5 % within 
forty-five days without prior treatment ( Montazer et al., 2020 ). Another 
notable strain, C208 Rhodococcus ruber , has shown a biodegradation rate 
of 0.86 % per week. Furthermore, bacterial consortia such as Bacillus sp. 
and Paenibacillus sp. have achieved a reduction in the dry weight of MPs 
by up to 15 % within sixty days ( Montazer et al., 2020 ). When evaluating 
the MPs degrading efficacy of Streptomyces sp. and Arthrobacter sp. 
strains isolated from agricultural soil, researchers found that the mi -
crobial consortium outperformed treatments with individual strains ( da 
Silva et al., 2024 ). Numerous studies have documented the biodegra -
dation of polypropylene by microbial strains such as Bacillus subtilis, 
Rhodococcus rhodochrous, Pseudomonas stutzeri, Bacillus fexus, and other 
isolates such as Achromobacter xylosoxidans which form biofilms ( Sutkar 
and Dhulap, 2025 ). For example, a study demonstrated that Rhodo -
coccus and Bacillus strains isolated from mangrove sediments achieved 
PE degradation efficiencies of 4.0 % and 6.4 %, respectively, after 40 
days of incubation ( Cai et al., 2023 ; Han et al., 2020 ). Moreover, Pseu -
domonas, Lysinibacillus fusiformis, and Chelatococcus have been linked to 
polypropylene degradation across diverse ecological settings ( Cai et al., 
2023 ).
Bacteria play a crucial role in bioremediation due to their diverse 
metabolic pathways, especially in the context of MPs degradation, as 
highlighted in this review. Among them, biofilm-forming bacteria like 
Rhodococcus ruber show promise for plastic degradation. Rhodococcus 
ruber produces laccase enzymes that aid in depolymerizing polyethylene 
by oxidizing its polymer backbone. Over an eight-week period, these 
bacteria developed biofilms on polyethylene surfaces and degraded 
approximately 7.5 % of the polymer ( Skariyachan et al., 2018 ). In a 
study conducted by Muhonja et al. (2018) , low-density polyethylene 
(LDPE) sheets with thicknesses of 30 and 40 µ m were exposed to pure 
bacterial cultures isolated from a dumpsite. The isolates belonged to 
several genera, including Cellulosimicrobium, Ochrobactrum, Bacillus, 
Lysinibacillus, Pseudomonas, and Brevibacillus. Following 16 weeks of 
incubation, Brevibacillus borstelensis and B. cereus demonstrated the 
highest LDPE degradation efficiencies, achieving weight loss rates of 
35.7 % and 20.4 %, respectively ( Du et al., 2024 ).
Generally, thinner sheets of LDPE demonstrated higher degradation

and (5) Mineralization.
P. Yadav et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Current Research in Microbial Sciences 9 (2025) 100495

rates, suggesting that sheet thickness significantly influences degrada -
tion rates. Kyaw et al. (2012) investigated the degradation of LDPE films 
using four bacterial strains: Pseudomonas syringae, Pseudomonas putida , 
and Pseudomonas aeruginosa . After 120 days of incubation, all tested 
bacteria facilitated degradation, with P. aeruginosa exhibiting the 
highest weight loss of 20.0 %. The degradation of PE by Pseudomonas 
strains was attributed to the enzymatic activities of alkane hydroxylase 
and reductase, pivotal in polyethylene depolymerization ( Jeon and Kim, 
2015 ). Furthermore, Rajandas et al. (2012) documented even more 
substantial degradation of LDPE by Microbacterium paraoxydans and 
P. aeruginosa .
For instance, Skariyachan et al. (2021) showcased the biodegrada -
tion of PE by a bacterial consortium comprising Pseudomonas and 
Enterobacter . Auta et al. (2018) identified biofilm-forming bacteria such 
as Bacillus sp., and Rhodococcus sp. which exhibited the capability to 
degrade PP. Following a 40-day incubation period, PP microparticles 
treated with Bacillus sp. and Rhodococcus sp. experienced weight losses 
of 6.4 % and 4.0 %, respectively, alongside the emergence of pores and 
irregularities on the PP surface. Aravinthan et al. (2016) conducted a 
study utilizing polypropylene particles treated with thermal and 
UV-irradiation. In their study, Aravinthan et al. (2016) employed two 
bacterial consortia Pseudomonas azotoformans with Bacillus flexus , and 
Bacillus subtilis with Bacillus flexus to evaluate PP degradation over a 
12-month exposure period. Although the study did not assess the 
biodegradation of untreated PP, notable degradation was observed in 
pretreated PP samples, with UV irradiation pretreatment yielding the 
most pronounced effects. The authors proposed that microbial degra -
dation of polypropylene likely occurred through the oxidation of 
short-chain polymer fragments, facilitated by the pretreatment process.
Other key genera involved include Exiguobacterium sp., Pseudo -
monas chlororaphis, and Ideonella sakaiensis ( Adithama et al., 2023 ). It 
is evident that bacteria sourced from diverse environments such as 
contaminated soil, microbiota, municipal landfills, wastewater, sewage, 
compost, and extreme habitats have demonstrated the ability to degrade 
MPs ( Martak et al., 2024 ). Both microbial consortiums and pure cultures 
have been employed in investigating bacterial-assisted MPs breakdown, 
with bacterial consortia being particularly noteworthy for their 
enhanced efficacy and community stability.
5.2. Fungi
The fungal kingdom encompasses a vast and diverse group of or -
ganisms, primarily consisting of saprotrophs, opportunistic parasites, 
and obligate parasites. Their exceptional adaptability allows them to 
colonize a broad range of habitats, from aquatic to terrestrial ecosys -
tems, and to persist under various climatic conditions ( Zhai et al., 2023 ). 
Fungi are capable of producing a wide spectrum of organic 
biosurfactants and extracellular enzymes including hydrophobins, 
which play a crucial role in the degradation of complex polymers into 
simpler monomers ( Dinakarkumar et al., 2024 ). This enzymatic activity 
not only enables fungi to access essential carbon and electron sources 
but also contributes to the breakdown and mineralization of persistent 
environmental contaminants. Additionally, fungi exhibit notable resis -
tance to toxic chemicals and heavy metals, further underscoring their 
potential in bioremediation applications ( Srikanth et al., 2022 ).
Several fungal isolates from an estuary displayed active MP degra -
dation capabilities. Proponents of bacteria highlight their rapid growth 
rates and superior adaptation to toxic conditions, suggesting they are 
more efficient degraders. Fungi can grow on a wide variety of substrates 
and are well-suited to the "plastisphere" due to their absorptive mode of 
nutrition. Their apical growth and ability to form biofilms enhance their 
degradation capabilities. Fungal cells secrete hydrophobic proteins, 
enabling them to utilize polymers in MPs as sources of carbon and en -
ergy ( Kasuya et al., 2009 ; Olic ´on-Hern ´andez et al., 2017 ). Fig. 5 illus -
trates the comprehensive mechanism of fungal-mediated plastic 
biodegradation. The process begins when fungi colonize the surface of 
plastic materials, forming biofilms that facilitate close interaction with 
the polymer. To break down these otherwise resistant compounds, fungi 
secrete a variety of extracellular enzymes, most notably hydrolases and 
oxidoreductases. These enzymes act synergistically to initiate 
bio-deterioration, weakening the polymer matrix, and promote frag -
mentation, whereby long polymer chains are cleaved into smaller olig -
omers and monomers. Once reduced to low-molecular-weight 
compounds, these products can be assimilated into fungal cells through 
transport systems and subsequently metabolized via central metabolic 
pathways. The process ultimately culminates in mineralization, result -
ing in the conversion of plastic-derived carbon into simpler, non-toxic 
end-products such as CO ₂ , H ₂ O, and fungal biomass ( Okal et al., 2023 ).
Like bacteria, fungi are widely distributed across diverse ecosystems 
and play a crucial role in the transformation and mobilization of envi -
ronmental chemicals through the secretion of a broad range of hydro -
lytic enzymes. Their strong biodegradation potential is largely 
attributed to a versatile enzymatic repertoire capable of catalyzing 
various reactions ( Olic ´on-Hern ´andez et al., 2017 ). Fungal intracellular 
enzymes, particularly those in the cytochrome P
450 
family, contribute to 
adaptation and detoxification processes by facilitating oxidation (e.g., 
epoxidases) and conjugation (e.g., transferases) reactions ( Esteves et al., 
2021 ). Additionally, fungi possess an extracellular enzymatic system 
that supports the breakdown of complex polymers and is divided into 
two functional subsystems. The first, a hydrolytic subsystem, produces 
hydrolases involved in the degradation of polysaccharides. The second is 
a nonspecific oxidative subsystem, which targets complex and recalci -
trant structures through the action of oxidoreductases. This subsystem 
includes enzymes such as dye-decolorizing peroxidases, laccases, 
Fig. 5. Illustrates the comprehensive mechanism of fungal plastic biodegradation.
P. Yadav et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Current Research in Microbial Sciences 9 (2025) 100495

manganese peroxidase, versatile peroxidases, lignin peroxidase, and 
select peroxygenases ( Gupta et al., 2023 ). These unique enzymatic ca -
pabilities position fungi as promising candidates for the biodegradation 
of MPs, particularly in environments contaminated with persistent 
polymeric pollutants ( Robinson, 2015 ).
They possess the capability to adhere to and reduce the hydropho -
bicity of MPs by catalyzing the formation of different chemical bonds, 
such as ester, carbonyl, and carboxyl functional groups ( Lai et al., 2025 ). 
Fungi are particularly adept at degrading complex-structured polymers, 
such as aromatic compounds, making them especially effective for the 
biodegradation of PVC ( Ibrahim et al., 2024 ). Recent research has 
delved into fungal-mediated degradation of MPs, highlighting their 
potential to utilize MPs as a carbon source. Noteworthy genera associ -
ated with the degradation processes of diverse polymers, including PE, 
PP, and PET, encompass Aspergillus niger, Zalerion maritimum , and Peni -
cillium simplicissimum Temporiti et al., 2022 ). These organisms play 
pivotal roles in mitigating the hydrophobic nature of polymers while 
catalyzing the formation of a diverse array of chemical linkages, 
including ester, carboxyl, and carbonyl functional groups ( de Oliveira 
et al., 2020 ; Temporiti et al., 2022 ). Several fungal strains such as 
Penicillium chrysogenum, Solani, Aspergillus tubingensis, Aspergillus fumi -
gatus, Pestalotiopsis microspore Cladosporium , and pseudocladosporioides 
have exhibited the capability to degrade polyurethane ( Okal et al., 
2023 ). Fungal species Aspergillus tubingensis and Aspergillus favus , iso -
lated from maritime coastal environments, have displayed the ability to 
degrade HDPE ( Okal et al., 2023 ). Recent investigations have shown 
promising outcomes with Mucor circinelloides and Aspergillus favus , both 
sourced from municipal waste, in the degradation of low-density PE. 
Treatment of MPs, such as PE, with substances like nitric acid and so -
dium hydroxide has been found to expedite degradation by Aspergillus 
niger ( Ekanayaka et al., 2022 ). However, employing physical pretreat -
ment methods, such as thermo-oxidization at 80 
◦
C for a duration of 
fifteen days, is necessary to impede the degradation of low-density PE by 
Penicillium pinophilum and A. niger ( Ekanayaka et al., 2022 ; Zeghal et al., 
2021 ; Zhai et al., 2023 ). Notably, fungi belonging to the Aspergillus 
genus exhibit remarkable efficiency in degrading LDPE, surpassing 
certain bacteria from genera such as Brevibacillus, Bacillus, Cellulosimi -
crobium, Pseudomonas, Ochrobactrum , and Lysinibacillus ( Zhang et al., 
2020 ).
Isolates of Aspergillus japonicus and A. niger, recovered from PE- 
polluted sites, demonstrated notable PE degradation capabilities, 
resulting in weight losses of approximately 8 % and 12 %, respectively 
( Alariqi et al., 2006 ). Zalerion maritimum, a marine fungus isolated 
from coastal waters, exhibited sustained growth in minimal media 
containing PE as the sole carbon source, highlighting its potential 
application in the bioremediation of MPs-contaminated marine envi -
ronments ( de Oliveira et al., 2020 ; Temporiti et al., 2022 ). In another 
study, Pestalotiopsis microspora was investigated for its ability to 
degrade polyurethane, which led to the identification of a serine hy -
drolase enzyme involved in PU breakdown — an important advancement 
in MPs degradation strategies ( Okal et al., 2023 ). Penicillium chrys -
ogenum NS10 and Penicillium oxalicum NS4 were identified by Ojha 
et al. (2017) as effective degraders of both LDPE and HDPE. Over time, 
further fungal colonization was observed, including genera such as 
Aspergillus, Alternaria alternata, Geotrichum candidum, Cladosporium 
spp., additional Penicillium spp., Ulocladium atrum, and Rhodotorula 
rubra ( Arif et al., 2024 ). Notably, fungal dominance on the plastic sur -
faces became more pronounced after approximately 56 weeks of expo -
sure. In their study, Webb et al. (2000) investigated polyvinyl chloride 
samples containing identical plasticizers through in situ assessments. 
They observed the earliest and most rapid colonization by Aureobasi -
dium pullulans, occurring within 25 to 40 weeks. This was followed by 
the colonization of Rhodotorula aurantiaca and Kluyveromyces sp., 
which appeared after 80 weeks of exposure. However, it is important to 
note that the study did not report any evidence or measurements related 
to the actual biodegradation of the PVC materials under investigation 
( Webb et al., 2000 ). While the studies mainly documented successful 
surface colonization, which serves as a pivotal precursor to subsequent 
biodegradation, they do not definitively establish biodegradation itself. 
Notably, biodegradation of polypropylene has been reported with 
Rhizopus arrhizus and Aspergillus niger , while Humicola insolens and 
Penicillium sp. have demonstrated efficacy in degrading polyethylene 
terephthalate ( Ronkvist et al., 2009 ).
5.3. Microalgae
Exploring algae species with robust biodegradation capabilities for 
polymeric compounds offers a promising avenue for MPs remediation. 
Microalgae thrive in photoautotrophic conditions and utilize atmo -
spheric CO
2 
as their sole carbon source for growth, thereby eliminating 
the need for inorganic or organic carbon sources ( Cheah et al., 2023 ). 
Microalgae demonstrate the ability to degrade polymeric materials 
through the actions of their toxins and enzymes, showcasing adapt -
ability across various environmental conditions and a minimal 
requirement for abundant carbon sources ( Renuka et al., 2021 ; Song 
et al., 2020 ). Within wastewater streams, they colonize plastic surfaces 
and produce enzymes that aid in plastic degradation, as well as in the 
enhancement of proteins and carbohydrates, thereby promoting growth. 
Recent SEM investigations have revealed that algal-driven colonization 
processes can induce degradation or fragmentation of polyethylene on 
sheet surfaces ( Lagarde et al., 2016 ). Notably, algae have demonstrated 
prolific growth on synthetic substrates like polyethylene surfaces in 
sewage water, with these colony-forming algae presenting minimal risks 
and toxicity concerns. The biodegradation process of MPs begins with 
algae adhering to surfaces through the synthesis of extracellular poly -
saccharide ( Sarmah and Rout, 2018 ). Evidence suggests that microalgae 
utilize the polymer as a carbon source, as indicated by the higher cellular 
content of carbohydrates and proteins observed in species growing on 
polyethylene surfaces ( Cheah et al., 2023 ; Chia et al., 2020 ). Previous 
studies have documented various degradation mechanisms, including 
corrosion, fouling, penetration, hydrolysis, and diffusion-mediated 
breakdown of leaching components and pigment coloring within poly -
mers ( Kumar et al., 2017 ; Chettri et al., 2023 ). The enzymatic biodeg -
radation process, particularly involving PETase, is susceptible to 
ambient temperature conditions and PET structure. Thermal treatment 
enhances plastic biodegradability by certain bacteria, amplifying the 
effects of enzymes on long-chain polymer molecules and ultimately 
facilitating their cleavage or degradation ( Zahid et al., 2024 ). Anabaena 
spiroides demonstrated significant potential in degrading LDPE, 
achieving a degradation efficiency of 8.19 %. Additionally, the green 
alga Scenedesmus dimorphus and the diatom Navicula pupula exhibited 
LDPE degradation rates of 3.75 % and 4.43 %, respectively. Freshwater 
cyanobacteria such as Oscillatoria subbrevis and Phormidium lucidum, 
which are easily isolated and widely distributed, were also found to 
effectively colonize polyethylene surfaces and induce LDPE biodegra -
dation without the need for pro-oxidant additives or pretreatment pro -
cedures ( Kumar et al., 2017 ; Sarmah and Rout, 2018 ). BPA, a common 
estrogenic component found in polymers, has been successfully 
degraded by various bacteria and algae strains, including Chlorella vul -
garis, Stephanodiscus hantzschii , and Micrococcus mexicanus ( Fikarov ´a 
et al., 2019 ). The growth of biofilms on polymer surfaces is often asso -
ciated with MPs degradation.
Cyanobacterial species within these biofilms, along with diatoms, 
play vital roles in photosynthesis. Notably, several cyanobacterial 
strains from genera such as Calothrix, Microcystis, Prochlorothrix, Pleu -
rocapsa, Leptolyngbya, Synechococcus, Rivularia , and Scytonema have 
demonstrated the ability to form biofilms on MPs-based polymers 
( Amaral-Zettler et al., 2020 ; Gupta et al., 2023 ). Moreover, advance -
ments in genetic engineering enable the synthesis and release of essen -
tial enzymes required for plastic degradation from mutant microalgal 
cell factories. For example, the genetic modification of the green 
microalga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii has enabled the production of PET 
P. Yadav et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Current Research in Microbial Sciences 9 (2025) 100495

hydrolase, an enzyme with the capability to degrade films consisting of 
terephthalic acid and polyethylene terephthalate ( Perozeni and Baier, 
2023 ). Similarly, effective genetic modifications in P. tricornutum have 
led to the production of PET hydrolase, exhibiting catalytic activity 
against both polyethylene terephthalate and its copolymers. With their 
straightforward cultivation and ability to utilize plastic monomers as 
carbon sources while synthesizing plastic-degrading enzymes, micro -
algae have emerged as promising candidates for MPs degradation ( Nabi 
et al., 2023 ). Advancements in genetic manipulation have paved the way 
for enhancing the degrading capabilities of algal strains, offering a 
potentially environmentally beneficial approach for biologically 
decomposing polyethylene terephthalate.
6. Enhancement of biodegradation of MPs
The biodegradation of polymers such as PE, PP, PS, and PVC poses 
significant challenges due to their lack of hydrolyzable functional 
groups. Enhancing MPs biodegradation can be achieved by optimizing 
biological and environmental factors that influence microbial activity 
and polymer breakdown. Pretreatment of plastics through physical or 
chemical methods improves surface properties, facilitating microbial 
colonization and enzyme access ( Mohanan et al., 2020 ). The initial 
breakdown and subsequent reduction in the molecular weight of these 
MPs in the environment are largely due to the synergistic action of 
abiotic and biotic factors ( Wei and Zimmermann, 2017 ). Genetic engi -
neering and microbial consortia further boost degradation efficiency, 
while optimizing environmental conditions enhances enzymatic per -
formance. The use of nanomaterials or biosurfactants also strengthens 
polymer – microbe interactions, collectively advancing sustainable plas -
tic waste biodegradation ( Mohanan et al., 2020 ). Various strategies have 
been investigated to enhance the biodegradation of MPs, as illustrated in 
Fig. 6 . Physical and chemical pretreatments are generally employed to 
disrupt the chemical bonds within the MPs structure, thereby facilitating 
easier biodegradation. Common chemical agents for surface pretreat -
ment include nitric acid, which oxidizes the polymer and introduces 
double bonds and carbonyl groups into the polymer backbone ( Artham 
and Doble, 2008 ). Ozone is also utilized to accelerate the aging of MPs. 
Physical pretreatment methods encompass irradiation and thermal 
treatment. UV-irradiation is commonly employed to initiate photooxi -
dative degradation of plastics, as its wavelengths promote the formation 
of free radicals and the subsequent cleavage of polymer chains ( Amanna 
and Rakshit, 2025 ). In a notable study by Roy et al. (2008) , a bacterial 
consortium comprising Bacillus pumilus, Bacillus cereus, and Bacillus 
halodenitrificans was utilized to biodegrade LDPE films that contained 
trace amounts of cobalt stearate as a prooxidant. The UV-induced 
oxidative pretreatment facilitated microbial colonization and 
enhanced the overall degradation efficiency of the polymer.
Prior to analysis, the samples were subjected to UV-B irradiation 
within the range of 280 – 315 nm. Following a two-week period, a sub -
stantial improvement in biodegradation was observed: untreated sam -
ples experienced a mere 0.25 % weight loss, while pretreated samples 
exhibited a notable 8.40 % reduction ( Zhang et al., 2025 ). Vimala and 
Mathew (2016) demonstrated that UV pretreatment of PE, combined 
with the application of a biosurfactant, enhanced microbial degradation, 
resulting in a 9.26 % reduction in polymer weight after 30 days. Simi -
larly, Esmaeili et al. (2013) employed a mixed microbial consortium 
consisting of Lysinibacillus xylanilyticus and Aspergillus niger to 
degrade LDPE films. Over a 126-day incubation period, the untreated 
LDPE samples exhibited a 15.8 % degradation, while UV-pretreated 
samples showed a markedly higher degradation rate of 29.5 %, under -
scoring the efficacy of photooxidative pretreatment in enhancing 
biodegradation.
Biological processes are intricately specific, relying on the enzymatic 
activity of microbial communities, optimal conditions for the growth 
and reproduction of microorganisms, and a balanced nutrient and sub -
strate ratio. Thus, to enhance bioremediation efficiency, techniques like 
bioaugmentation and bio stimulation are employed. Bio stimulation 
entails creating conditions conducive to microbial degradation of sub -
strates, often necessitating the external supplementation of deficient 
nutrients ( Tyagi et al., 2011 ). Each microorganism thrives within a 
specific C:N:P ratio, and adjusting this balance can greatly enhance 
biodegradation. Incorporating additives such as glucose, K
2
HPO
4
, 
KNO
3
, and NaNO
3 
can create these favorable conditions ( Chen and 
Chen, 2021 ). Additionally, microorganisms are sensitive to environ -
mental variables like acidity fluctuations, which can significantly in -
fluence their activity levels ( Joutey et al., 2013 ). Microbial activity relies 
heavily on maintaining optimal pH levels, which vary depending on the 
microorganism; bacteria thrive in neutral pH, whereas fungi prefer 
acidic environments ( Martinez-Toledo et al., 2018 ). Adequate oxygen 
availability is essential for maintaining the metabolic activity of aerobic 
microorganisms, while optimal temperature ranges vary across micro -
bial species. Together, these environmental factors significantly influ -
ence microbial growth, spatial distribution, and the overall efficiency of 
biodegradation processes ( Gonzalez and Aranda, 2023 ). Several micro -
bial genera are known for their ability to produce biosurfactants, which 
enhance the bioavailability of hydrophobic pollutants and facilitate 
degradation. These include Acinetobacter, Arthrobacter, Bacillus, Hal -
omonas, Enterobacter, Rhodococcus, and Pseudomonas ( Kuyukina 
et al., 2005 ).
Typically, microorganisms produce enzymes to break down primary 
substrates, their primary energy sources. However, these enzymes may 
also degrade secondary substrates like MPs polymers, although these 
often fail to effectively stimulate enzyme production. To enhance bio -
stimulation, co-metabolism strategies are employed, wherein primary 
substrates are introduced into contaminated environments to stimulate 
indigenous microorganisms to produce specific degradation enzymes 
( Goswami et al., 2018 ). This approach boosts microbial activity without 
the primary substrate itself being the target of degradation. Indigenous 
microbial communities, naturally present in polluted habitats, play a 
pivotal role in biodegradation processes due to their adaptation to local 
environmental conditions, making them especially effective in 
site-specific bioremediation efforts ( Semrany et al., 2012 ). Ibiene et al. 
(2013) successfully isolated Bacillus subtilis and Bacillus mycoides from 
mangrove soil in the Niger Delta and demonstrated their effectiveness in 
degrading both low-density and high-density polyethylene. In a related 
study, Auta et al. (2017) isolated Bacillus gottheilii and B. cereus from 
the same environment and utilized them to degrade a range of plastic 
polymers, including PE, PP, PS, and PET microparticles. These findings 
underscore the potential of indigenous microorganisms in plastic 
biodegradation. Moreover, increasing the concentration of native

microbial populations has been shown to significantly improve degra -
dation efficiency ( Matthies et al., 1997 ).
In cases where indigenous microbial communities lack the capacity 
to degrade pollutants effectively, the introduction of exogenous micro -
organisms known as bioaugmentation may be employed ( Tao et al., 
2018 ). However, this strategy presents several challenges. Exogenous 
strains must adapt to unfamiliar and often harsh environmental condi -
tions, which may necessitate modification of local parameters such as 
pH, temperature, and nutrient availability to ensure successful coloni -
zation. Prior laboratory cultivation is essential for optimizing the growth 
conditions and maximizing degradation efficiency within a limited 
timeframe. Nonetheless, the transition from controlled laboratory set -
tings to complex, variable field conditions can lead to reduced viability 
or even extinction of introduced species. Furthermore, exogenous mi -
croorganisms may outcompete native species due to traits such as rapid 
growth, high fecundity, and metabolic versatility ( Haque and 
Gazi-Khan, 2025 ). This competition may disrupt the structure, diversity, 
and ecological function of the indigenous microbial community, raising 
concerns regarding long-term ecological stability.
7. Future prospects and challenges
Although considerable progress has been made in elucidating mi -
crobial contributions to MPs degradation, multiple barriers constrain 
their translation into effective large-scale remediation strategies. Cur -
rent microbial degradation kinetics remain markedly slow under envi -
ronmentally relevant conditions, where fluctuating parameters such as 
temperature, salinity, pH, and co-contaminant load significantly 
modulate microbial activity, enzyme stability, and substrate accessi -
bility. Moreover, incomplete mineralization frequently leads to the 
accumulation of micro- and nanofragments or intermediate metabolites, 
many of which retain ecotoxicological properties. To date, only a narrow 
spectrum of bacterial and fungal taxa most notably Ideonella sakaiensis, 
Pseudomonas spp., Bacillus spp., Aspergillus, and Fusarium have 
demonstrated measurable plastic-degrading capacity, and their perfor -
mance is typically confined to controlled laboratory conditions. The 
limited diversity of characterized strains and enzymes with broad sub -
strate specificity represents a fundamental bottleneck, further restricting 
the ecological applicability of these pathways.
Addressing these limitations necessitates a multipronged research 
agenda. Protein engineering and synthetic biology should be leveraged 
to improve the catalytic efficiency, thermostability, and polymer selec -
tivity of key hydrolases and oxidoreductases, including PETase, MHE -
Tase, cutinases, and laccases. Omics-driven investigations (genomics, 
transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics) offer a powerful plat -
form to uncover novel catabolic pathways and enzyme systems from 
plastisphere-associated microbiomes, marine ecosystems, and extrem -
ophiles. The rational design of synthetic microbial consortia, integrating 
complementary metabolic functions, may provide synergistic capacity 
for complete mineralization. In parallel, hybrid remediation frameworks 
that integrate physicochemical pretreatments such as photothermal 
oxidation, catalytic activation, or plasma processing with microbial or 
enzymatic systems hold promise for substantially accelerating degra -
dation rates. Future efforts must also prioritize systematic ecotoxico -
logical evaluation of degradation intermediates and pilot-scale, in situ 
trials to assess scalability, resilience, and long-term environmental 
safety. Ultimately, realizing the potential of microbial pathways for MPs 
degradation will require convergence of biotechnology, systems 
biology, and environmental engineering, alongside robust ecological 
validation, to develop scalable, sustainable, and safe solutions for 
mitigating global plastic pollution.
8. Conclusions
Microplastic pollution constitutes a significant and escalating envi -
ronmental and ecological challenge, and microbial biodegradation 
represents a promising, sustainable strategy for its mitigation. Among 
microorganisms, bacterial taxa such as Bacillus, Pseudomonas , and 
Ideonella sakaiensis have demonstrated substantial potential due to their 
secretion of specific plastic-degrading enzymes, including PETase and 
MHETase. Fungal species, particularly Aspergillus and Fusarium , exhibit 
pronounced depolymerization capabilities via extracellular enzymatic 
activity, whereas microalgae such as Chlamydomonas reinhardtii and 
Chlorella vulgaris offer additional eco-compatible biodegradation path -
ways. Emerging evidence also highlights insect-associated gut micro -
biota (e.g., waxworms, mealworms) as novel bioremediation agents 
capable of initiating plastic depolymerization.
Despite these advancements, microbial degradation rates remain 
low, and efficiency is strongly governed by critical factors including 
polymer type and physicochemical properties, microbial community 
composition, enzymatic activity, and environmental parameters such as 
temperature, pH, salinity, and the presence of co-contaminants. While 
laboratory-scale investigations demonstrate feasibility, scaling these 
processes to field conditions presents substantial challenges, particularly 
in maintaining microbial viability, enzymatic stability, and effective 
polymer contact under heterogeneous environmental settings.
Future research should prioritize biotechnological enhancement of 
microbial and enzymatic performance, including protein engineering, 
directed evolution, and the design of synthetic microbial consortia to 
achieve complete polymer mineralization. Integrating microbial ap -
proaches with cost-effective bio-based plastic production and process 
optimization will be critical for sustainable, large-scale application. 
Additionally, in-depth characterization of microbial ecology, enzymatic 
pathways, and environmental interactions is necessary to inform the 
development of robust, scalable, and ecologically safe biodegradation 
strategies.
In conclusion, bacteria and fungi currently represent the most 
feasible and effective microbial candidates for microplastic biodegra -
dation. However, the successful translation of these biological strategies 
into practical environmental solutions will require a synergistic inte -
gration of advanced biotechnology, environmental optimization, and 
systems-level understanding of microbial-plastic interactions. The 
development of scalable, cost-effective methods for producing bio-based 
plastics and enhancing the capabilities of microbial strains will be 
crucial for the widespread application of this approach in mitigating 
MPs pollution.
