ABSTRACT: The degradation and recycling of plastics, such as
poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET), often require energy-intensive
processes with significant waste generation. Moreover, prevalent
methods primarily entail physical recycling, yielding subpar materials.
In contrast, upcycling involves breaking down polymers into
monomers, generating valuable chemicals and materials for alternative
products. Enzyme-catalyzed depolymerization presents a promising
approach to break down PET without the need for extreme conditions
and unstable or toxic metal catalysts, which are typical of traditional
recycling methods. However, the practical application of enzymes has
been hindered by their high cost and low stability. In this study, we
stabilized the enzyme Humicola insolens cutinase (HiC) by
encapsulating it within a mesoporous zirconium-based metal−organic
framework, NU-1000. HiC@NU-1000 exhibited a quantitative degradation of the PET surrogate, ethylene glycol dibenzoate
(EGDB), with greater selectivity than native HiC in producing the fully hydrolyzed product benzoic acid in partial organic solvent.
Additionally, the heterogeneous catalyst is also active toward the hydrolysis of PET and has demonstrated recyclability for at least
four catalytic cycles. The HiC@NU-1000 model system represents a promising approach to stabilize industrially relevant enzymes
under conditions involving elevated temperatures and organic solvents, offering a potential solution for relevant protein-related
applications.

INTRODUCTION
Plastic products have benefited our society with great
convenience due to their low production costs and high
stability. However, its extensive use leaves us with large
amounts of highly stable waste. Recent reports show that over
200 million tons of plastic waste are generated annually
worldwide, with less than 20% of plastic waste recycled
properly.
1
Leakage of plastic waste threatens the safety of food
and water sources.
1,2
Specifically, polyethylene terephthalate
(PET) makes up over 40% of single-serve beverage packing in
the United States, with over 90% of them ending up in
landfills.
3
With the accumulation of plastic waste, the pressure
to find efficient, cost-effective, and green methods of recycling
plastic also increases. However, most plastic recycling focuses
on mechanical recycling and energy recovery through
combustion, producing low-grade recycled products and
additional pollutants.
4,5
In contrast, chemical recycling, also
known as polymer upcycling, depolymerizes polymer building
blocks, such as the hydrolysis of PET into terephthalic acid
(TPA) and ethylene glycol (EG).
6
This method has great
potential in producing high quality recyclable products with
minimal waste.
7,8
However, the high stability of these polymers
makes their breakdown and chemical recycling challenging.
Homogenous metal catalysts for these processes can be highly
sensitive to water, oxygen, and metal salt contaminants and are
often difficult to be separated from the final products.
9
On the
other hand, heterogeneous catalysis processes often require
high temperature and pressure to soften the polymers and
increase contact with the solid catalysts, which often leads to
low selectivity and the formation of undesired byproducts.
8
Therefore, selective, air-stable heterogeneous catalysts that
operate at relatively low temperatures (150 °C or less) with

facile separation from the products would be highly desirable
for the application of polymer upcycling.
The use of enzymes as biological catalysts in polymer
upcycling can avoid high temperatures and harsh chemical
conditions typically required for upcycling.
6,10−12
This
environmentally friendly alternative approach to chemical
upcycling is particularly promising due to the catalysts’ high
efficiency and selectivity under mild reaction conditions.
Humicola insolens Cutinase (also known as HiC or Novozym
51032) has been reported as an efficient PET depolymeriza-
tion enzyme.
6,13,14
However, similar to many other bio-
catalysts, HiC suffers from low solvent tolerance and limited
thermal stability and is homogeneous, which makes catalyst
separation and recovery difficult.
15
At temperatures below the
boiling point of PET, dissolving or swelling the polymers in
organic solvent can maximize contact of the substrate with the
catalysts. However, PET is only soluble in a few solvents, many
of which denature proteins due to the disruption of
hydrophobic effects essential for protein folding.
16
Various techniques have been developed to stabilize
enzymes against denaturants, such as heat, mechanical forces,
various salt contents, and proteases. These techniques include
but are not limited to immobilization through cross-linking,
encapsulation through matrix entrapment or by micro- to
nanosized capsules, PEGylation, and protein engineering.
17
Among these methods, immobilization has been an effective
technique in improving the stability and recyclability of
enzymes with wide adaptability and minimal chemical
modification required on the protein.
13,17,18
To date, most
reported immobilization materials are amorphous solids such
as polymeric beads and porous silica,
19
which can be hard to
design, control, characterize, and systematically improve upon.
Metal−organic frameworks (MOFs),
20
on the other hand, can
be designed and optimized as hosts for protein encapsulation
due to their highly porous, crystalline, and modular nature
21
and have demonstrated great potential as single-molecule traps
for enzyme encapsulation.
22−24
The geometry and chemical
properties of the frameworks can be optimized toward the
encapsulation and catalysis of specific protein,

framework itself can also act as an anchor for additional
catalytic reactions.
25
Humicola insolens Cutinase (HiC, Novozym 51032) is an
enzyme which has shown great promise for PET hydrolysis
with high selectivity.
6,14
However, most existing systems are
homogeneous, making product separation and HiC recovery
challenging. To overcome this challenge, we chose to
encapsulate HiC (2.5 × 3.0 × 4.4 Å
3
, PDB: 4OYY),
26
with a
highly chemically stable Zr-based MOF NU-1000, which
contains mesopore sized 3.2 nm.
27,28
Building upon our
previous knowledge that enzymes can be stabilized against
denaturing organic solvent and heterogenized for multiple
rounds of catalysis via encapsulation in MOFs,
18
we developed
a robust, recyclable HiC-based biocatalyst (HiC@NU-1000)
for the hydrolysis of ethylene glycol dibenzoate (EGDB) as a
dimer representative for the larger PET molecule. Through
systematic investigation, we optimized the encapsulation
conditions for HiC, reaction conditions, and reaction solvent
balanced between substrate solubility and enzyme activity
(Figure 1). Through product quantification monitored by
1
H
NMR, we were able to demonstrate an active and recyclable
HiC@NU-1000 with superior catalytic properties compared to
the free HiC enzyme toward both EGDB and PET.
■
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Developing HiC Encapsulation and EGDB Hydrolysis
Conditions. NU-1000 was synthesized based on a reported
procedure (Figure S1).
27
Encapsulation conditions such as salt
concentration and pH of the solution have been shown to be
highly influential to the kinetics of protein intraparticle
diffusion and its encapsulation kinetics.
18,24,29
Therefore,
encapsulation of HiC in NU-1000 was first tested with Tris
buffer between 0 and 1000 mM at pH 7.5 (Figure S2). The
HiC encapsulation amount was determined by Bradford assay
(Figure S3), and we found that the 500 mM condition
appeared to yield the highest HiC loading while maintaining
uniform enzyme distribution and the structural integrity of
NU-1000 (Figure 2). We also observed that the addition of
glycerol enhances the encapsulation of HiC to up to 10 wt % at
525 μg of HiC in 5 mg of NU-1000 (Figure S2b).
Hydrolysis of EGDB catalyzed by HiC and HiC@NU-1000
was monitored by the formation of benzoic acid via
1
H NMR
after 48 h of reaction at 80 °C. Building upon existing HiC
catalysis under aqueous conditions (pH 8.5 with 10% glycerol,
10 μM HiC) at 80 °C,
30
we adjusted the aqueous phase to be
100 mM with 10% glycerol at pH 7.5 to minimize the adverse
effect of high pH and salt concentration on NU-1000. Similar
to problems faced with PET hydrolysis, EGDB catalysis is also
limited by its low solubility in aqueous solutions. At 80 °C, the
solubility of EGDB was determined to be ∼1.5 mg/mL in 100
mM Tris buffer with 10% glycerol, but a 2-fold increase in
solubility was observed in a 50:50 (DMSO-d
6
:100 mM Tris
buffer) mixture with 10% glycerol at ∼3.4 mg/mL, which is the
solvent condition we chose for all future reactions. This water/
DMSO mixture was found to be essential for the reaction. No
activity of HiC@NU-1000 was found under pure aqueous
conditions due to the low solubility and mobility of EGDB
(Figure S4). HiC was also found to be inactive under pure
organic conditions due to the lack of water required to perform
the hydrolysis reaction. Preliminary screening of the reaction

with an equal amount of free or encapsulated HiC
demonstrates the formation of three products: monohydro-
lyzed 2-hydroxyethyl benzoate, completely hydrolyzed product
benzoic acid, and ethylene glycol, all visible by
1
H NMR
spectroscopy (Figures 3 and S5). Chemical shifts of ethylene
glycol dibenzoate, 2-hydroxyethyl benzoate, and benzoic acid
were determined by monitoring the chemical shifts of each
individual standard under the same NMR solvent conditions
and the ratio between benzoic acid and ethylene glycol in the
product. The product ratio was determined by the protons in
the aromatic region. Mesitylene was used as an internal
standard to quantify the amount of starting material and each
product and to calculate the mass balance of the reaction
(Figure S6). Due to the small error from the complete mass
balance from the free HiC catalysis in triplicate, all product
distributions are reported with mass balance normalized to
100% for ease of comparison. HiC@NU-1000 catalysis was
first found to be missing over 20% of the substance based on
mass balance. We quickly realized that the benzoic acid
product can coordinate to the open metal site on the
zirconium node in NU-1000 through solvent-assisted ligand
incorporation (SALI),
31
resulting in an undercalculation of the
product yield. The missing product was found upon digestion
of the postcatalysis HiC@NU-1000 material in a weak base
(0.1 M NaOD/D
2
O)
32
(Figure 3C). A higher amount of
ethylene glycol dibenzoate starting material was consumed by
free HiC at 86%, but HiC@NU-1000 shows a higher benzoic
acid conversion at 64% compared with free HiC at 57%. The
higher consumption of starting material by the free enzyme is
likely due to its high availability without a diffusion limitation
from the MOF framework. On the other hand, high spatial
proximity between the HiC catalysts and the monohydrolyzed
product 2-hydroxyethyl benzoate within HiC@NU-1000 likely
results in a high local concentration of the catalyst and the
partially hydrolyzed 2-hydroxyl benzoate, leading to a more
complete hydrolysis into benzoic acid (Figure 3C).
Analysis of the Catalytic Contribution in HiC@NU-
1000. The size matching between the enzyme and MOF pore
can provide an unique stabilizing effect especially against
denaturing organic solvents,
18
and sometimes leading to
enhanced activity.
33
The hexagonal channel of NU-1000 (3.2
nm) and the dimension of HiC (2.5 × 3.0 × 4.4 nm
3
) share
comparable dimensions. To explore the contribution of the
pore confining effect toward HiC catalysis, HiC was also
encapsulated in NU-1003, an analog of NU-1000 sharing the
same topology but with a larger pore size (Figures S7 and
S8).
34
Results from comparing HiC@NU-1000 and HiC@
NU-1003 show a small improvement of HiC encapsulation
with a larger channel size but a slower conversion of the EGDB
starting material, especially into the completely hydrolyzed
product benzoic acid (Table 1, Figure S9). The hydrodynamic
size of substrate ethylene glycol dibenzoate in the reaction
solution mixture (50% DMSO and 50% 0.1 M Tris buffer with
10% glycerol) is measured to be 0.6 nm by dynamic light
scattering (DLS) (Figure S7b). Since the substrate is smaller
than any of the pores in NU-1000 and NU-1003 (Figure S7c),
its diffusion can occur throughout the particle in both
frameworks without significant impact from the pore size.
On the other hand, the decreased channel diameter in NU-
1000 has a more significant confinement effect on the HiC
enzyme, which only exists in the mesopore. HiC is a type of
cutinase, which contains a preformed oxyanion hole that does
not require interfacial activation to expose its active site.
35
The
lack of interfacial activation implies less conformational change
upon ligand binding, and its catalytic process does not undergo
significant conformational change. The faster hydrolysis
process found in HiC@NU-1000 compared with HiC@NU-
1003 demonstrates a favorable confining effect through size
matching between the enzyme and the host, which enhances
the HiC catalytic activity.
The Lewis acidic zirconium node, like the one on NU-1000,
is known to catalyze a selection of hydrolysis reaction, notably
the phosphonate ester bond in organophosphorus compounds
in the presence of base.
36
More recently, it was also found to
hydrolyze peptide bonds.
37
However, most hydrolysis of
carbon-based esters and PET requires prolonged heating
over 200 °C.
38
Despite our condition being much milder than
that of reported PET hydrolysis, we still performed control
experiments NU-1000 without HiC to quantify the catalytic
contribution from the MOF framework. NU-1000 showed up
to 56% of benzoic acid conversion (Figures 4C, S10, and S11).
To inhibit catalysis on the zirconium node, we capped all
open-metal sites with methylphosphonic acid (MPA) through
SALI
39
at 60 °C, and
1
H NMR confirmed the installation of
four ligands per node (Figures 4b and S12). We observed a
reduced amount of benzoic acid production from 56% with
NU-1000 to 39% with NU-1000−4MPA (Figures 4, S10, and
11). Since SALI was performed at a lower temperature (60 °C)
than the catalysis (80 °C), we suspect the lability of the MPA
ligands on NU-1000−4MPA leads to the incomplete inhibition
of hydrolysis catalysis. A lower MPA/node ratio at 2.5 MPA/
node from the postcatalysis NU-1000−4MPA confirmed our
hypothesis (Figures 4b and S12). Although the activity
contribution in HiC@NU-1000 is lower than that of free
HiC, HiC@NU-1000 shows a more complete hydrolysis to
benzoic acid, and the heterogeneous HiC@NU-1000 has the
potential to be recycled for multiple rounds of catalysis.
HiC@NU-1000 Recyclability and Its Activity toward
PET. In addition to the improved stability and selectivity,
protein encapsulation facilitated heterogenization of the
biocatalyst, extending its utility. To assess the recyclability of
HiC@NU-1000, four sets of HiC@NU-1000 (each containing
0.016 μmol of enzyme) and NU-1000 samples were prepared
to monitor their successive rounds of catalytic performance
(Round 1, Round 2, Round 3, and Round 4). Following each
48 h catalytic cycle, all HiC@NU-1000 and NU-1000 samples
were retrieved via centrifugation and rinsed with 1 mL of
water. One set of the MOF and composite samples was
subjected to digestion for product determination, while the
remainder was transferred to a new experimental vial with fresh
substrate for the subsequent catalytic round. The
1
H NMR
spectra of the postcatalysis supernatant and the MOF solution
after digestion were analyzed after each cycle, and the

conversion percentage of the starting material to benzoic acid
was quantified by comparing with a mesitylene standard
(Figures S13 and 14). The findings indicated that HiC@NU-
1000 maintained catalytic activity across four cycles, with the
hydrolysis of the ethylene glycol dibenzoate starting material
ranging between 55 and 74% in each round (Figure 4d).
After recycling experiments, we also examined the structural
integrity of the resultant materials. The composite particles
retained similar morphology and crystallinity (Figure S16) to
as-synthesized NU-1000. Furthermore, a leaching assay was
conducted to determine whether HiC had escaped from the
pores during the catalysis experiments. A Bradford assay was
conducted on the postcatalysis solution after each round of
catalysis, and minimal leaching was determined (less than 0.2%
per round) (Table S1).
Lastly, we tested free HiC and HiC@NU-1000 for its
hydrolysis on PET powder (semicrystalline, 300 μm) under
the same hydrolysis conditions on ethylene glycol dibenzoate.
Due to the low solubility of PET, the mass balance of the
reaction could not be calculated. However, we were able to
quantify the product using an internal standard, mesitylene.
HiC@NU-1000 was found to be active, converting 47% of the
monomer into terephthalic acid and 14% into bis(2-
hydroxyethyl) terephthalate
40
after 48 h at 80 °C while free
HiC was found to be not active (Figure 5). The significantly
enhanced activity of HiC@NU-1000 can be attributed to both
the enhanced stability and availability of the isolated HiC upon
encapsulation and the synergic effect from the HiC and Zr
6
node.
■
CONCLUSION
In this study, we showcased the encapsulation of Humicola
insolens Cutinase (HiC), a protein extensively studied for its
enzymatic PET depolymerization, to increase its catalytic
performance and recyclability in an organic/aqueous solvent
mixture. Our findings revealed that the zirconium node in NU-
1000 synergistically bolstered the hydrolysis of ethylene glycol
dibenzoate (EGDB), while the proximity between the
substrate and the HiC catalyst within the NU-1000 framework
facilitated a more thorough hydrolysis of the ethylene glycol
dibenzoate precursor to benzoic acid. Through recyclability
assessments, we observed that HiC@NU-1000 maintained its
activity over at least four catalytic cycles with minimal activity
loss upon composite recovery. Lastly, we found that HiC@

standard mesitylene and tabulated in (c). Additional TPA and BHET products were also found encapsulated in the NU-1000 pore observed
through base digestion of the MOF (Figure S15), which was neglected during the calculation of the yield due to their small amount and the
overlapping integrals.

NU-1000 was also active toward the hydrolysis of PET. MOF-
encapsulated enzymes hold promise for reducing industrial
expenditures through heightened enzyme stability and activity
and concurrently enhancing product yields. Our exploration of
enzyme encapsulation raises intriguing prospects for future
investigations in the field, particularly concerning the potential
utilization of the HiC@MOF composite in industrial PET
upcycling or analogous enzyme@MOF systems for other
pertinent biocatalytic processes in industry.
