Abstract: Plastic, a ubiquitous part of our daily lives, has become a global necessity, with
annual production exceeding 300 million tons. However, the accumulation of synthetic
polymers in our environment poses a pressing global challenge. To address this urgent
issue, fungi have emerged as potential agents for plastic degradation. In our previous
manuscript, ‘A Review of the Fungi That Degrade Plastic’, we explored the taxonomic
placement of plastic-degrading fungi across three main phyla: Ascomycota, Basidiomy-
cota, and Mucoromycota. In this review, we built upon that foundation and aimed to
further explore the taxonomic relationships of these fungi in a comprehensive and detailed
manner, leaving no stone unturned. Moreover, we linked metabolic activity and enzyme
production of plastic-degrading fungi to their taxonomy and summarized a phylogenetic
tree and a detailed table on enzyme production of plastic-degrading fungi presented here.
Microbial enzymes are key players in polymer degradation, operating intra-cellularly and
extra-cellularly. Fungi, one of the well-studied groups of microbes with respect to plastic
degradation, are at the forefront of addressing the global issue of plastic accumulation.
Their unique ability to hydrolyze synthetic plastic polymers and produce a wide range of
specific enzymes is a testament to their potential. In this review, we gather and synthesize
information concerning the metabolic pathways of fungi involved in the degradation of
plastics. The manuscript explores the diverse range of specific enzymes that fungi can
produce for plastic degradation and the major pathways of plastic metabolism. We pro-
vide a listing of 14 fungal enzymes (Esterase, Cutinase, Laccase, Peroxidases, Manganese
peroxidase, Lignin peroxidase, Oxidoreductases, Urease, Protease, Lipase, Polyesterase,
Dehydrogenase, Serine hydrolase, and PETase) involved in pathways for plastic degra-
dation alongside the relevant fungi known to produce these enzymes. Furthermore, we
integrate the fungi’s enzyme-producing capabilities with their taxonomy and phylogeny.
Taxonomic and phylogenetic investigations have pinpointed three primary fungal classes
(Eurotiomycetes, Sordariomycetes (Ascomycota), and Agaricomycetes (Basidiomycota)) as
significant plastic degraders that produce the vital enzymes mentioned earlier. This paper
provides a foundational resource for recognizing fungal involvement in the biodegradation

of synthetic polymers. It will ultimately advance fungal biotechnology efforts to address
the global issue of plastic accumulation in natural environments.

1. Introduction
Plastic, one of Earth’s most widely produced materials, is known for its durability and
adaptability. Plastics can be broadly categorized into synthetic and biodegradable types.
Synthetic plastics, derived from petrochemicals, and biodegradable plastics, manufactured
from natural compounds, serve different purposes. Plastics can be broadly categorized
based on their origin and degradability. In terms of origin, they can be classified as either
synthetic or natural. Seven major types of synthetic plastics (polyethylene terephthalate
(PET), high-density polyethylene (HDPE), polyvinyl chloride (PVC), low-density polyethy-
lene (LDPE), polypropylene (PP), polystyrene (PS), and various other plastics) are used
worldwide [1–3]. In terms of degradability, plastics can be further divided into those that
are degradable by natural physical and biological factors and those that are non-degradable
by natural forces, including biodegradable synthetic plastics.
The production and consumption of plastic are escalating annually, with global plastic
production reaching 400.3 million metric tons in 2022 [4]. In 2018, Europe alone produced
61.8 million tons of plastic. However, only 9.4 million tons of post-consumer plastic waste
were recycled during the same period [5–7]. This disparity underscores the inefficiencies
in current waste management systems, leading to the accumulation of plastic waste in
the environment. Approximately 109 million metric tons of plastic are estimated to have
accumulated in rivers globally, while about eight million tons enter oceans annually. Plastics
comprise approximately 80% of marine litter, with an estimated 30 million metric tons
of plastic waste already accumulated. Projections suggest this figure could escalate to
a staggering 150 million metric tons by the end of 2025 if we do not take significant
interventions. Without such actions, a terrifying 12,000 million tons of plastic waste could
reside in landfills or the natural environment by 2050, with annual accumulations reaching
339 million metric tons [8,9].
The environmental persistence of plastic wastes, due to their polymeric structure, high
molecular weight, and hydrophobic nature, is a global issue. Certain synthetic plastics
can persist for up to a millennium, and these properties also facilitate the breakdown of
plastics into microplastics. These microplastics infiltrate ecosystems and food chains, posing
uncertain but likely detrimental effects on biodiversity and human health. Consequently,
plastic pollution has emerged as a critical global environmental challenge [2,10].
Biodegradation, a crucial process, has been proposed as a sustainable and efficient
method for mitigating environmental plastic accumulation [2]. Elahi et al. [1] referred to
biodegradation as any physical or chemical alteration in a material caused by microbial
activity and harnesses microbial enzymes to facilitate the breakdown of synthetic poly-
mers. The biological degradation process involves three stages: microbial attachment to
the polymer surface, utilization of the polymer as a carbon source, and polymer degrada-
tion [11,12]. Microbial enzymes, which can act intra-cellularly or extra-cellularly, are central
to this process. Given synthetic plastics’ large size and hydrophobic nature, extra-cellular
enzymatic activity is particularly critical. This process, termed bio-fragmentation, reduces
polymer chains into smaller, water-soluble monomers that are subsequently metabolized
by microbial cells [13,14].
J. Fungi 2025, 11, 378 3 of 25
Among microorganisms, fungi have attracted significant attention for their capac-
ity to degrade synthetic plastic polymers. Compared to bacteria, fungi are often more
effective due to their ability to adhere to hydrophobic plastic surfaces and secrete robust
extra-cellular enzymes capable of breaking down recalcitrant hydrocarbons [15–17]. This
enzymatic capacity is closely linked to fungal genetic and phylogenetic characteristics,
highlighting the potential for exciting future discoveries and evolutionary insights into their
plastic-degrading capabilities. Such studies are essential for understanding and accelerating
plastic biodegradation within natural ecosystems.
Our previous review thoroughly examined the taxonomy and phylogenetic relation-
ships of major plastic-degrading fungal groups [ 2]. This paper extends that work by
investigating the enzymatic mechanisms and metabolic pathways fungi use to degrade
plastics, linking these processes to fungal taxonomy and phylogeny. Moreover, this study
integrates novel findings from recent research [18–20] to provide a comprehensive under-
standing of fungal contributions to plastic degradation. This comprehensive understanding
will keep you informed and identify avenues for future research.
2. Methodology
The information presented in this paper was derived from various sources, including
scholarly papers, digital databases, and personal communications. Data on the enzymatic
pathways of plastic-degrading fungi were collected primarily from Google Scholar, Re-
searchGate, PubMed, and Web of Science. An online literature search for different enzymes
for different plastic types, the respective metabolic pathways, and factors affecting plastic
biodegradation by fungi was carried out. The major keywords used during the search were
plastic-degrading fungi, fungal metabolism, plastic degradation, plastic biodegradation,
evolution of plastic-degrading fungi, metabolic pathways in fungi for plastic degradation,
fungal enzymes for plastic degradation, plastic biodegradation, and fungal diversity. Single
keywords or combinations were used during the search. Furthermore, we applied the
following selection criteria: studies published in peer-reviewed journals within the last
10 years, articles directly related to metabolic pathways of plastic-degrading fungi, and
research from reputable sources with a strong citation record. Additionally, we manually
screened the abstracts of the top 100 most relevant results based on title matching and
citation count.
The phylogenetic tree was obtained from Ekanayaka et al. [2]. Branches of the phylo-
gram were collapsed to show generic levels. Summarised data on the enzyme production
of fungi for plastic degradation were manually linked to the phylogenetic tree. Notes
on major fungal enzymes and major fungal genera recorded for plastic degradation are
provided. Discussions herein are based on the results of the literature review on enzymes,
related metabolic pathways of fungi for plastic degradation, and the evolution of enzyme
production of fungi to degrade plastics.
3. Results
3.1. Fungal Enzymes in Plastic Biodegradation
The biodegradation of plastic is affected by different factors, including the chemi-
cal structure of the polymer, environmental factors, microorganisms in the surrounding
environment, and their capabilities. Plastics are long-chain polymers with a high molec-
ular weight. Hence, the initial stage of biodegradation of plastics requires the structural
weakening of those polymers [ 21]. The chemical factors of polymer structure, such as
the molecular weight of monomers, hydrophobicity of the exposed area, melting tem-
perature, crystallinity grade and structure, elasticity, specific chemical groups, and glass
transition, are highly affected by its biodegradation rate [22,23]. Moreover, environmental
J. Fungi 2025, 11, 378 4 of 25
factors, such as UV exposure, temperature, pH, and salinity, influence the biodegradation
process [16]. Environmental factors can induce cracks and surface roughness in plastics,
resulting in molecular alterations [24]. Primarily, these factors lead to plastics oxidation
and introduction of carbonyl/carboxyl/hydroxyl groups to the polymer, diminishing its
hydrophobicity and consequently enhancing its biodegradability [25–27]. Fungi take on
a pivotal role when they proliferate on plastic surfaces, inducing further alterations in
the physical properties of plastics through crack expansion and pore size enlargement.
Moreover, microorganisms possess the ability to chemically degrade plastics by altering
factors such as the pH, acidity, and salinity of their immediate microenvironment [ 28].
Furthermore, they break down the plastics into shorter chains through depolymerization.
Fungal enzymes play a crucial role in this process. Fungal exoenzymes generate plastic
intermediates with altered properties, enhancing their cellular assimilation [29]. Once these
intermediates are formed and assimilated, intra-cellular enzymes come into play. Cells
utilize them as carbon sources, breaking them down into water and carbon dioxide or
methane to complete the mineralization process [28,30,31].
The primary categories of enzymes engaged in the biodegradation of plastics are hydro-
lases and oxidoreductases (Table 1). Fungal hydrolases such as lipases, carboxylesterases,
cutinases, and proteases have the ability to alter the surface of the plastic, thereby en-
hancing its hydrophilicity [ 32]. Oxidoreductases, including laccases and peroxidases,
participate in the breakdown of plastics into smaller molecules like oligomers, dimers, and
monomers [33,34]. Because of the robust carbon–carbon (C–C) bonds they possess, plastic
polymers like PE, PS, PP , and PVC require oxidation prior to undergoing the depolymeriza-
tion process [35,36].
Plastics can be classified into three groups based on the extent of their biodegradabil-
ity. These are (I) plastic polymers lacking pro-oxidants, (II) plastic polymers containing
pro-oxidants, such as oxo-degradable polymers, and (III) biodegradable polymers. The first
group may not be susceptible to enzymatic breakdown often because they lack functional
groups or enzyme-sensitive ester bonds. Consequently, mechanical and thermal degra-
dation are typically the primary modes of deterioration for this category. Conversely, the
second and third groups often possess appropriate functional groups or enzyme-sensitive
ester bonds, making them susceptible to photo-oxidation, thermo-oxidation, and enzymatic
degradation [37].

3.2. Major Fungal Enzymes for Plastic Biodegradation
3.2.1. Hydrolases (EC 3)
Hydrolases are one of the largest and most diverse enzyme families that catalyze the
cleavage of chemical bonds by utilizing water as a hydroxyl group donor, resulting in the
division of a large molecule into smaller, more biodegradable products [ 69–73]. Fungal
hydrolases are widely known to degrade plastic components that contain ester, amide, or
urethane linkages, such as PU, PET, PES, PBS, and PCL [28,36,41,42,63,72]. Hydrolases have
hydrophobic clefts near their active sites, facilitating attachment to non-polar, hydrophobic
plastic surfaces [74]. Thereby, they catalyze the hydrolytic cleavage of the plastic polymer
chain, resulting in smaller monomers or dimers, which are absorbed by the fungi as a
source of carbon and energy for their metabolism [75–77]. However, fungal hydrolases face
challenges in efficient plastic degradation, due to their limited penetration ability to highly
crystalline plastics and operational instability under industrial conditions [41,42,63].
Esterases (EC 3.1.1.x)
As hydrolases, esterases catalyze the hydrolysis of ester linkages in various poly-
meric substrates, leading to the breakdown of ester bonds and the formation of acid and
alcohol-based molecules with polar functional groups [69,70]. In numerous studies of plas-
tic biodegradation, cutinases and lipases, both forms of esterases, have been highlighted
as exceptional hydrolases capable of enabling the fungal breakdown of polyester-based
plastics such as PCL, PLA, PU, PRS, and PVC [33,38–42,63]. The mechanism of esterases
involves a catalytic triad (Serine, Histidine, and Aspartate/Glutamate), which facilitates a
nucleophilic attack on the carbonyl carbon of the ester bond, initiating chain scission that
leads to molecular weight reduction and increased susceptibility to microbial attack [78,79].
Broad substrate specificity and potential for functioning under mild environmental con-
ditions make them effective enzymes for plastic degradation [ 41,42,63]. Despite their
potential, their activity on high-molecular-weight, highly crystalline polymers remains
limited [41,42,63].
Cutinases (EC 3.1.1.74)
As extra-cellular serine esterases, cutinases possess the natural ability to hydrolyze
cutin [71–73]. Mechanistically, cutinases operate by catalyzing the hydrolysis of ester
linkages within plastics such as PCL, PET, PES, PBS, and PBSA, producing monomeric or
oligomeric byproducts such as terephthalic acid, ethylene glycol, and lactic acid[41–46,74,80].
Kinetic studies reveal that cutinases exhibit substrate specificity determined by their active
J. Fungi 2025, 11, 378 8 of 25
site architecture. For example,Humicola insolens cutinase demonstrates high catalytic effi-
ciency towards PET due to its open, active site, which facilitates substrate accessibility [81].
Lipases (EC 3.1.1.3)
Lipases are extra-cellular triacylglycerol acyl hydrolase enzymes that catalyze the
hydrolysis of ester bonds in triglycerols into glycerol and fatty acids. Due to the structural
similarities between lipid esters and synthetic polyester linkages, lipases have demonstrated
active degradation of PET, 3PET, PU, PBS, PBSA, PCL, and PBS by breaking down the
lengthy carbon chains [ 41,44,45,63–66]. Lipases possess a hydrophobic lid domain that
opens to expose their active site upon contact with hydrophobic, non-polar plastic surfaces,
facilitating effective binding and interaction with the substrate [76,82,83].
Polyesterases (EC 3.1.1.x)
Polyesterases represent a family of hydrolytic esterases that hydrolyze polyesters by
breaking down the ester bonds in the polyester backbone, effectively depolymerizing the
large plastic molecules into smaller fragments [ 75,84,85]. These are mainly known for
PET degradation, which often involves two types of polyesterases enzymes, PETase and
MHETase, converting PET into monomers [86]. PETase enzymes begin the initial hydrolysis
by directly attacking the PET and cleaving the ester bonds, releasing the intermediates
like mono-2-hydroxyethyl terephthalate (MHET) and bis-(2-hydroxyethyl) terephthalate
(BHET), which are then further degraded by MHETase enzymes into terephthalic acid (TPA)
and ethylene glycol (EG) [86]. Other than PET, polyesterases are known to be effective in
the degradation of PBT and PVC [84].
PETase Enzymes (EC 3.1.1.101)
PETases are a subclass of enzymes belonging to the polyesterases that catalyze the
hydrolysis of PET by breaking its ester bonds and converting it into intermediates like
MHET and BHET [ 86]. Initially, PETase enzymes were discovered from the novel bac-
terium Ideonella sakaiensis 201-F6, which utilized PET as a carbon source, minimizing
the natural degradation period of plastics from many years to days [86–88]. Structurally,
PETases possess an α/β hydrolase fold and relatively open active site, which facilitates
better attachment of bulky PET chains [86]. The PET monomer intermediates are formed
through nucleophilic attacks on the carbonyl carbon atoms of the ester bonds, and those
intermediates, especially MHET, can be further cleaved by MHETase into TPA and EG,
which is proven to work synergistically to degrade PET [86] completely.
Ureases (EC 3.5.1.5)
Ureases are nickel-dependent enzymes and members of the superfamily of amidohy-
drolases and phosphotriesterases that catalyze the conversion of urea into ammonia and
carbon dioxide [89–91]. Ureases contribute to the degradation of some specific plastics,
such as PUs containing urea and urethane linkages, effectively breaking down the polymer
chain and making it more susceptible to further microbial degradation [ 33,40,89,92,93].
It has been found that several enzymes, like proteases and esterases, also synergistically
incorporate with ureases for plastic degradation, where proteases hydrolyze urethane
and amide bonds, and ureases attack the urea linkages [93]. However, the role of ureases
is generally considered supportive rather than primary in plastic degradation, as their
standalone degradation efficiency is low [40,93].
Proteases (EC 3.4.x)
Proteases are a large class of hydrolases that can cleave protein peptide bonds, result-
ing in peptides and amino acids [94,95]. In addition to their primary function, proteases
J. Fungi 2025, 11, 378 9 of 25
such as cutinase-like enzymes (CLE) and metalloproteases like neprilysin (NEP) are found
to be functional in plastic degradation, especially focused on PET and PUR [16,96]. They
are known to follow different mechanisms in PET degradation, where CLEs use general
acid/base mechanisms, including acylation and diacylation processes, and NEP utilizes
either metal-bound hydroxide attachments or reverse protonation mechanisms [96]. The
activity of proteases can be enhanced by plastic surface modifications that increase hy-
drophilicity and by utilizing them in combination with ureases and esterases [96].
Serine Hydrolases (EC 3)
Serine hydrolases are a distinct, large, and diverse family of enzymes that contain a con-
served serine residue in their active site, which is pivotal in the hydrolysis of various bonds,
including peptide, ester, or amide bonds in diverse substrates [78,79]. This diverse family
is home to well-known enzymes like lipases, esterases, proteases, and amidases, which
have been studied for their plastic degradation abilities targeting the PEs and PUs [ 78].
They participate in plastic degradation by modifying the plastic surface, increasing the
hydrophilicity, and then breaking down the polymers through hydrolysis reactions [21,88].
As a collective group, they increase the hydrophilicity in plastic degradation by cleaving the
polymer chains and then introducing polar functional groups such as carboxylic acids and
hydroxyls, which are water-loving, making the plastic more susceptible to the attachment
of microbes and degradation [75–77]. However, serine hydrolases face difficulties efficiently
degrading high-crystallinity or crosslinked polymers [76,77].
3.2.2. Oxidoreductases (EC 1)
Oxidoreductases are a large family of enzymes with 22 subdivisions, including impor-
tant representatives such as laccases and peroxidases. The main function of oxidoreductases
is catalyzing oxidation and reduction (redox) reactions by transferring an electron from the
donor to an electron acceptor, incorporating many cofactors such as heme, flavin, and metal
ions [97,98]. Among fungi, oxidoreductases are most common in white and brown-rot
basidiomycetes involved in the oxidative degradation of lignocellulosic biomass [97]. Other
than this, oxidoreductases also play a crucial role in plastic degradation through oxidation
reactions, introducing oxygen atoms into the polymer structure, and therefore breaking
down the strong carbon-carbon bonds in recalcitrant plastic polymer backbone, especially
in PE, PVC, PP , and PS [53,55,57–62]. Also, introducing oxygen-containing groups like
carbonyls and hydroxyls by oxidation makes the plastic more susceptible to hydrolysis,
allowing synergic degradation with hydrolases [ 99]. Their effectiveness, however, can
be limited by enzyme inactivation due to reactive intermediates or lack of suitable redox
mediators in vitro [57–62].
Laccases (EC 1.10.3.2)
Laccases are copper-containing oxidases that can catalyze the oxidation of a wide
range of substrates, especially phenolic and non-phenolic substrates [ 100–102]. Even
though laccases do not directly participate in cleaving polymer chains, they can initiate the
depolymerization of plastics by attacking carbon–carbon and carbon–heteroatom bonds,
oxidizing the polymer chains, which reduces molecular weight and degradation of the
plastic including Nylon, PE, LDPE, PP , DBP , DEP , and BPA [29,51–55]. Laccases catalyze
the oxidation of plastics by reducing molecular oxygen to water, generating free radicals
to increase the surface polarity and render it more susceptible to enzymatic or microbial
degradation [21,76,103]. The substrate range and their efficiency on plastics can be enhanced
by the addition of redox mediators such as ABTS (2,2′ -azino-bis (3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-
sulphonic acid)) and HBT (1-hydroxybenzotriazole) along with the laccases [104]. However,
J. Fungi 2025, 11, 378 10 of 25
their activity is often limited by poor enzyme–plastic interactions and possible inactivation
under oxidative stress conditions [104].
Peroxidases (EC 1.11.1.x)
Peroxidases are oxidoreductase enzymes that catalyze the oxidation of organic and
inorganic compounds utilizing hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) as the electron acceptor [105].
A large number of predominant peroxidases have been identified in species of fungi,
including manganese peroxidases, lignin peroxidases, versatile peroxidases, and dye-
decolorizing peroxidases, with production contingent upon the substrate on which the
fungi are cultivated [106]. Key attributes of peroxidases include their lack of specificity
and their capability to oxidize substrates with elevated redox potentials [ 106,107]. Such
characteristics render these enzymes versatile in plastic degradation, oxidizing plastic
surfaces and generating reactive oxygen species (ROS) that can lead to random scission of
carbon–carbon and carbon–hydrogen bonds, particularly in PE, DBP , and BPA [21,54,55].
Some studies suggest that the plastic degradation by fungal peroxidases is closely connected
to the mechanism of their lignin catabolism [108,109]. For example, laccase and peroxidase
are actively involved in the depolymerization of hydrophobic plastics in an analogous
manner to lignin hydrolysis.
Manganese Peroxidases (MnP) (EC 1.11.1.13)
Manganese peroxidases are heme-containing, H2O2-dependent glycoprotein perox-
idases belonging to the family of oxidoreductases. The naturally occurring fungal MnP
plays a pivotal role in depolymerizing plant lignin, hemicellulose, and cellulose [110–112].
In addition to their primary role, MnPs have properties of plastic degradation, mainly PE,
Nylon, and LDPE, by oxidizing the plastic surfaces, thereby generating ROS to fragment
long polymer chains [ 21,48]. MnPs catalyze the oxidation of manganese (II) (Mn 2+) to
manganese (III) (Mn3+), which acts as a mediator to oxidize substrates [110,111,113]. The
released Mn3+ acts as an oxidant, attacking phenolic structures in the plastic, creating
phenoxyl radicals, and these radicals undergo several reactions, leading to the breakdown
of plastic into smaller, more biodegradable molecules [21,48]. Their main limitation lies
in their dependence on specific cofactors (Mn2+, H2O2, and organic acids) and potential
inactivation due to ROS accumulation [110,111].
Lignin Peroxidases (LiP) (EC 1.11.1.14)
Lignin peroxidases (LiPs) are heme-containing peroxidases that function as ligninolytic
enzymes, facilitating the H2O2-dependent oxidative depolymerization of lignin [114,115].
LiPs demonstrate relatively broad substrate specificity, with a diverse range of catalyzed
oxidative reactions, which are H2O2-dependent [116,117]. Possessing a high redox potential,
lignin peroxidases exhibit promise in partially depolymerizing plastics with aromatic
content, such as PE, PVC, and PCB, by generating ROS to initiate oxidative chain scission
for enhancing the accessibility of plastic surfaces to other enzymes [ 51,56,88]. However,
their instability in excess peroxide and limited production under non-ligninolytic conditions
are significant challenges for environmental applications [51].
Dehydrogenases (EC1)
Dehydrogenases are a large group of enzymes that belong to a subset of oxidore-
ductases, and they catalyze oxidation–reduction reactions using coenzymes such as
NAD+/NADP+ and flavins like FAD and FMN as electron acceptors [ 118,119]. Alco-
hol dehydrogenases can be considered the most studied type of fungal dehydrogenases,
and they are involved in the reduction and oxidation of alcoholic compounds and, therefore,
are mainly associated with ethanol metabolism and fermentative enzymes [120]. Dehydro-
J. Fungi 2025, 11, 378 11 of 25
genases are not primary agents of polymer degradation but play auxiliary roles in plastic
degradation pathways [121]. The initial oxidation and chain cleavage of PEA, PU, and
PES are carried out by several oxidative enzymes like laccases, and the resulting smaller
fragments are catabolized by dehydrogenases into monoesters, alcohols, aldehydes, and
fatty acids [67,121]. These are then incorporated into metabolic pathways of microbial cells
to facilitate the complete mineralization of these intermediates [121].
3.3. Evolution of Fungi to Produce Enzymes for Plastic Biodegradation: Enzymatic Adaptations
and Taxonomic Involvement
Fungi possess remarkable enzymatic capabilities that enable them to degrade complex
organic polymers. These abilities have evolved, equipping fungi to decompose recalcitrant
materials such as lignocellulose [122]. Interestingly, certain fungi have also adapted the
mechanisms used to degrade plant cell walls for the degradation of synthetic polymers
like plastics [123]. Evolutionary processes, driven by environmental pressures and the
presence of plastic waste in ecosystems, have promoted the emergence and enhancement
of plastic-degrading capabilities among several fungal genera [124].
Many fungal genera, including Aspergillus, Penicillium, Paecilomyces, Alternaria, and
Phanerochaete, have been reported to participate in plastic degradation. These genera exhibit
varied ecological strategies, including saprophytic, pathogenic, and endophytic lifestyles,
and they produce diverse extra-cellular enzymes such as laccases, manganese peroxidases
(MnPs), lignin peroxidases (LiPs), esterases, and cutinases [125]. These enzymes, originally
evolved for the degradation of plant-derived polymers, have been co-opted and adapted
for plastic biodegradation [126].
For example, species of Aspergillus and Penicillium, commonly found in soil and
decaying organic matter, have demonstrated the ability to degrade polyethylene (PE),
polystyrene (PS), and polyethylene terephthalate (PET). Their high enzymatic activity,
particularly of esterases and cutinases, contributes to the depolymerization of plastics
into simpler compounds [ 127,128]. Similarly, Paecilomyces variotii has been reported to
produce hydrolases and esterases capable of breaking down polyurethane (PU), indicating
a possible evolutionary adaptation to synthetic substrates [129].
Phanerochaete chrysosporium, a model white-rot fungus, is well known for its lignin-
degrading system and has also been studied for its potential to degrade plastics. Its
peroxidase and laccase systems, critical in lignin degradation, promise to oxidize and break
down synthetic polymers. The evolutionary expansion and diversification of its ligninolytic
enzymes have possibly allowed this fungus to interact with xenobiotic compounds such as
plastics [130].
Endophytic fungi like Alternaria have also demonstrated plastic-degrading potential,
possibly due to their capacity to adapt to host-derived complex substrates and environmen-
tal stresses. In these fungi, enzyme promiscuity, where enzymes evolve to act on a range
of structurally diverse substrates, may play a significant role in the initial steps of plastic
degradation [21].
Furthermore, basidiomycetous fungi such as Pleurotus ostreatus are increasingly recog-
nized for their contribution to plastic biodegradation, particularly through the secretion
of oxidative enzymes. Studies suggest that these fungi can fragment polyethylene and
polystyrene through the oxidative action of MnPs and laccases. Such abilities may be traced
to their evolutionary adaptation to wood degradation and oxidative stress responses [131].
Collectively, the ability of these diverse fungal taxa to produce plastic-degrading
enzymes is likely the result of evolutionary convergence, wherein different lineages have
independently developed similar enzymatic strategies to exploit plastic as a potential
carbon source [132]. The evolutionary history of these fungi suggests a flexible genomic
J. Fungi 2025, 11, 378 12 of 25
and metabolic framework that enables adaptation to emerging ecological niches, including
environments contaminated by plastic waste [21].
Various groups of fungi are engaged in the natural plastic degradation process. Based
on data reported by Ekanayaka et al. [ 2], fungi capable of degrading plastics are found
across three main phyla: Ascomycota, Basidiomycota, and Mucoromycota. The same
phylogram published by Ekanayaka et al. [2] was used in the present study, and branches
were collapsed to generic levels. Data on fungal enzyme production for plastic degradation
were manually linked to the phylogram (Figure 1).
Based on the phylogenetic analysis, the fungal classes Eurotiomycetes, Sordari-
omycetes, and Agaricomycetes exhibit the strongest tendency toward plastic degradation.
Within these classes, we observed six genera demonstrating a notable capacity to produce
numerous enzymes crucial for plastic degradation. These are Aspergillus, Penicillum, Pae-
cilomyces, Alternaria, Phanerochaete, and Pleurotus. Notes on each genus are provided below.

Eurotiomycetes). Index Fungorum summarizes over 1000 records for this genus [133]. 
The genus Aspergillus is able to produce diverse types of enzymes, such as amylase,

3.3.1. Aspergillus
Aspergillus belongs to the family Aspergillaceae (Eurotiales, Eurotiomycetidae, and
Eurotiomycetes). Index Fungorum summarizes over 1000 records for this genus [133].
The genus Aspergillus is able to produce diverse types of enzymes, such as amylase,
lipase, protease, cellulase, pectinase, phytase, and β-glucanase, which are applied in a wide
variety of industries, including food and dairy, textile, pulp and paper, leather, detergents,
and waste management [134–139].
Based on our results, the genus shows a polyphyletic nature. Aspergillus spp. show
promising applications in plastic degradation in producing a wide range of hydrolytic and
oxidative enzymes, including esterases, cutinase, laccase, lipase, manganese peroxidase,
J. Fungi 2025, 11, 378 14 of 25
lignin peroxidase, urease, protease, and dehydrogenases [ 2,21,83]. These enzymes are
involved in depolymerizing PET, PES, PEA, PU, PBS, PBSA, PCL, and PBS, resulting in
weight loss, surface cracking, erosion, and pore formation of these plastics [109,140].
3.3.2. Penicillium
The genus Penicillium belongs to the family Aspergillaceae (Eurotiales, Eurotiomyceti-
dae, and Eurotiomycetes). This is one of the largest genera within the kingdom of Fungi.
Index Fungorum summarizes more than 1400 records for this genus [133].
The genus Penicillium is recorded to produce enzymes like xylanase, pectinase, amy-
lase, peroxidase, laccase, and cellulase [141–144].
Based on our results, this genus also has a polyphyletic nature. One lineage of the
genus grouped close to Aspergillus, while the other one grouped close to the genus Ther-
momyces. Penicillium seems to be one of the most successful genera for plastic degradation,
displaying the capability of secreting a variety of enzymes, including esterases, cutinase,
laccase, lipase, manganese peroxidase, lignin peroxidase, urease, protease, and dehydro-
genase to biodegrade a panoply of plastic sources such as PUR, PVC, HDPE, LDPE, PHB,
PLA, and epoxy resins through a process involving both oxidative and hydrolytic mecha-
nisms [2,21,76,88,145]. It has been proved that P . simplicissimumcan degrade polyethylene,
without any additives or pre-treatments, solely using its laccases and manganese peroxi-
dases, but the degradation showed high efficiency when the polyethylene is pre-treated
with UV [60]. Also, P . brevicompactumwas found to colonize and degrade e-waste PCB
microplastics through chain scission and oxidation and achieved 75% mass loss within
28 days of incubation [146]. These findings reveal the potential of Penicillin in utilizing
sustainable plastic waste management and other biotechnological applications.
3.3.3. Paecilomyces
Paecilomyces belongs to the family Aspergillaceae (Eurotiales, Eurotiomycetidae, Euro-
tiomycetes, Pezizomycotina, and Ascomycota). Index Fungorum summarizes 151 records
for this genus [133].
Most members of Paecilomyces have been identified as thermophiles and thermotoler-
ants, and their known enzymes, such as chitinase, amylase, xylanase, hemicellulase, and
pectinase, have drawn much attention from a wide variety of industries because of their
thermotolerant properties [147–149].
Based on our results, the genus Paecilomyces can be separated into several lineages,
thus showing its polyphyletic nature. One lineage was grouped within the Eurotiomycetes,
while the others were grouped within the class Sordariomycetes. Paecilomyces farinosus
and Paecilomyces simplicissimum have been studied extensively for their ability to degrade
polythene substrates. They produce laccase, manganese peroxidase, lipase peroxidases, and
oxidoreductases, which are common among other plastic-degrading fungi. They are most
effective on biodegradable plastics such as PHB, Sky-Green, and PHBV films [2,150,151].
Segundo et al. [ 152] showed the possibility of Paecilomyces to reduce plastic waste and
produce electrical energy in microbial fuel cells, displaying the potential of Paecilomyces in
sustainable energy generation through their plastic degradation ability.
3.3.4. Alternaria
The fungal genus Alternaria encompasses diverse ascomycetous fungi commonly
found in soil, air, and decaying organic material. These organisms are widely recognized
for their ecological roles as plant pathogens and saprophytes and their significance in
industrial and medical mycology [153].
Emerging evidence indicates that species of Alternaria may contribute to the degrada-
tion of synthetic polymers. Recent studies have highlighted the ability of certain species
J. Fungi 2025, 11, 378 15 of 25
of fungi to degrade synthetic polymers such as polyethylene (PE), polypropylene (PP),
and polyurethane (PU) [154,155]. Species of Alternaria, known for their robust enzymatic
machinery and adaptability to diverse substrates, have been implicated in this process.
Enzymes such as cutinases, lipases, and esterases, commonly produced by Alternaria, are
hypothesized to play a role in breaking down plastic polymers. However, the specific mech-
anisms and extent of plastic degradation by Alternaria remain largely unexplored [156].
Furthermore, a recent study examines the potential of species of Alternaria in plastic
degradation. It critically examines the enzymatic pathways involved, the environmental
conditions that facilitate such activity, and the limitations of current research [157].
The genus Alternaria belongs to the class Dothideomycetes, and in our phylogeny, it
produces a stable lineage sister to Curvularia. Species of Alternaria produce lipase, laccase,
peroxidases, manganese peroxidase, lipase peroxidase, and oxidoreductases.
3.3.5. Phanerochaete
Phanerochaete belongs to the family Phanerochaetaceae (Polyporales, Incertae sedis,
Agaricomycetes, Agaricomycotina, and Basidiomycota). Index Fungorum summarizes
around 200 records for this genus [133].
Phanerochaete is considered an ecologically important genus that causes white-rot in
both softwood and hardwood [158], and P . chrysosporiumis regarded as the model organ-
ism for studies on wood and lignin degradation caused by white-rot species [ 159,160].
Also, these members are known to secrete extra-cellular non-specific enzyme complexes,
including Class II peroxidases and glyoxal oxidases [ 161,162], which have attracted the
attention of different industrial and biotechnological applications such as biofuel produc-
tion, biopulping, bioleaching, and degradation of environmental pollutants, synthetic dyes,
pesticides, and explosives [163–168].
Phanerochaete belongs to the Basidiomycota, and based on our results, this genus is
phylogenetically close to the genus Polyporus. Species of Phanerochaete produce peroxi-
dases, manganese peroxidase, lipase peroxidases, and oxidoreductases, which participate
in depolymerization and degradation of PS, PLA, PE, and phenolic resin through different
oxidation reactions [21,169–171]. Wu et al. [170] demonstrated that Phanerochaete chrysospo-
rium could act as an efficient biodegrader for PLA and PS, where they achieved a mass loss
of 34.35% and 19.71%, respectively, during 35 days of incubation.
3.3.6. Pleurotus
Pleurotus belongs to the family Pleurotaceae (Agaricales, Agaricomycetidae, Agari-
comycetes, Agaricomycotina, and Basidiomycota). Index Fungorum summarizes more
than 700 records for this genus [133].
Pleurotus can secrete a range of enzymes, including peroxidases, laccases, cellulases,
hemicellulases, and xylanases, which bring out the potential to be used in the bioconversion
of agricultural wastes into value-added products, biodegradation of organic pollutants,
toxins, industrial contaminants, and mycoremediation, especially concerning soil [172–178].
Their bioactive compounds also have potent anticancer, antibacterial, and antidiabetic
properties, which have huge potential applications in the biomedical and pharmaceutical
industries [179–181].
Based on our results, Pleurotus is a stable lineage sister to the genera Polyporus and
Phanerochaete. Pleurotus produces a variety of enzymes such as laccases, peroxidases, and
oxidoreductases, and these enzymes can break down complex plastic polymers such as PET,
PE, PS, and PVC by oxidation [182,183]. The potential plastic degradation of P . ostreatus
and P . pulmonarishas been displayed by several studies, both through visual and chemical
changes of the plastic. The visual changes included discolouration, wrinkles on the surface,
J. Fungi 2025, 11, 378 16 of 25
formation of holes, cracks, and crumbling, and for chemical changes, it was observed that
the additions of degradation products such as hydrocarbons, carboxylic acids, alcohols,
esters, and ketones [182,184,185].
4. Discussion
The growing concern regarding plastic accumulation in natural ecosystems has led to
a growing interest in the biological degradation capabilities of microorganisms, particularly
fungi, due to their capability in producing various enzymes and ecological adaptabil-
ity [1,2]. Our review consolidates current knowledge on the fungal enzymes involved
in plastic degradation and links these capabilities to fungal taxonomy and phylogeny.
The findings highlight specific fungal clades, namely Eurotiomycetes, Sordariomycetes,
and Agaricomycetes, as dominant groups possessing enzymatic machinery for plastic
biodegradation.
Key fungal enzymes, cutinases, lipases, esterases, laccases, peroxidases, and oxidore-
ductases, play a significant role in the breakdown of synthetic polymers. Filamentous
fungi mainly secrete these enzymes, and we identified some genera specific to this role:
Aspergillus, Penicillium, Paecilomyces, Alternaria, Phanerochaete, and Pleurotus. These enzymes
alter the polymer’s surface properties, later aiding depolymerization into smaller, metabo-
lizable units. Furthermore, those enzymes increase the hydrophilicity of plastics and enable
microbial assimilation [13,14]. Filamentous fungi, with their extensive hyphal networks
and secretion of surface-active compounds like hydrophobins, are particularly effective in
adhering to and degrading hydrophobic plastic materials [12].
By linking the enzyme-producing capability into fungal taxonomy and phylogeny in
the present study, it was revealed that genera such as Aspergillus, Penicillium, Phanerochaete,
and Pleurotus are strongly associated with the production of diverse enzyme types involved
in plastic degradation. These genera in varied ecological niches have likely adapted to
utilize synthetic polymers as supplementary carbon sources under nutrient-limited condi-
tions [3,15]. Many of the enzymatic functions described originate from ancestral pathways
associated with lignocellulose degradation, supporting the hypothesis that fungi have
adapted these pathways to act on synthetic polymers. However, most enzyme evolution
and activity assumptions remain speculative and require further empirical validation.
While these findings are promising, several constraints remain. Effective fungal plastic
degradation is influenced by environmental conditions such as pH, temperature, and
salinity, as well as the chemical complexity of the plastic itself [10,11]. Moreover, although
laboratory studies demonstrate the potential of fungal enzymes in degrading plastics, field-
level implementation is still limited by factors such as environmental variability, enzyme
stability, and plastic additives. Hence, further research is necessary to improve enzyme
stability and performance in diverse environments [13,14]. To enhance fungal degradation
efficacy, future work should focus on isolating robust strains, characterizing novel enzymes,
and applying molecular tools for genetic enhancement.
Many plastic-degrading enzymes share evolutionary origins with those involved in
natural polymer degradation, such as lignin and cutin [ 15]. For instance, cutinases and
laccases, enzymes originally evolved for plant biomass decomposition, have adapted to
degrade synthetic polymers like PET and PE [ 12,13]. This supports the hypothesis of a
metabolic shift in fungi driven by prolonged environmental exposure to plastic waste [2,6].
The specific genetic mutations and evolutionary pressures enabling plastic-degrading
capabilities are poorly understood [8]. Therefore, to validate the enzymatic potential of
fungi, future studies should prioritize functional characterizations, protein-level analyses,
and advanced molecular tools beyond commonly used techniques like FTIR and general
enzyme assays [2,12].

5. Conclusions
This paper consolidates existing information on the production of fungal enzymes for
plastic degradation and explores their connection to taxonomy and phylogeny. It highlights
the need for integrative approaches combining phylogeny, enzymology, and biotechnology.
Fungi, with their diverse array of enzymes tailored for decomposition, are the superior
decomposers within natural ecosystems. Filamentous fungi exhibit a specialized degrada-
tion process, leveraging their exceptional metabolic versatility, secretion capabilities, and
filamentous mycelial structure. Taxonomical and phylogenetic analyses have revealed that
three primary fungal classes (the Eurotiomycetes, Sordariomycetes, and Agaricomycetes)
significantly contribute to plastic degradation, producing relevant enzymes. Phylogenetic
analyses reflect four phylogenetic clusters relevant to those fungi. In addition, a few other
classes show a nascent capacity, indicating they are just beginning to develop this capa-
bility for plastic degradation. Our study has identified 14 key fungal enzymes crucial in
plastic degradation.
Identifying novel fungal enzymes and improving their functionality through bio-
engineering could lead to scalable bioremediation strategies that address global plastic
waste challenges.
