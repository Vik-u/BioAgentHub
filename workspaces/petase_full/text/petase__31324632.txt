ABSTRACT Plastics are widely used in the global economy, and each year, at least
350 to 400 million tons are being produced. Due to poor recycling and low circular
use, millions of tons accumulate annually in terrestrial or marine environments. To-
day it has become clear that plastic causes adverse effects in all ecosystems and
that microplastics are of particular concern to our health. Therefore, recent microbial
research has addressed the question of if and to what extent microorganisms can
degrade plastics in the environment. This review summarizes current knowledge on
microbial plastic degradation. Enzymes available act mainly on the high-molecular-
weight polymers of polyethylene terephthalate (PET) and ester-based polyurethane
(PUR). Unfortunately, the best PUR- and PET-active enzymes and microorganisms
known still have moderate turnover rates. While many reports describing microbial
communities degrading chemical additives have been published, no enzymes acting
on the high-molecular-weight polymers polystyrene, polyamide, polyvinylchloride,
polypropylene, ether-based polyurethane, and polyethylene are known. Together,
these polymers comprise more than 80% of annual plastic production. Thus, further
research is needed to signiﬁcantly increase the diversity of enzymes and microor-
ganisms acting on these polymers. This can be achieved by tapping into the global
metagenomes of noncultivated microorganisms and dark matter proteins. Only then
can novel biocatalysts and organisms be delivered that allow rapid degradation, re-
cycling, or value-added use of the vast majority of most human-made polymers.

ltogether, synthetic polymers are produced worldwide at a scale of at least 350 to
400 million metric tons annually (

.com/global-pet-resin-production-capacity , https://www.plasticsinsight.com/resin
-intelligence/resin-prices/polyamide/ , and https://www.plasticsinsight.com/world

economy are polyurethane (PUR), polyethylene (PE), polyamide (PA), polyethylene
terephthalate (PET), polystyrene (PS), polyvinylchloride (PVC), and polypropylene (PP)
(
Fig. 1). With an increasing production and use of plastics, it is estimated that 5 to 13
million metric tons of plastic enter the ocean every year, with negative consequences
for various ecosystems and for the health of humans and animals (
1–3). Regarding only
the Great Paciﬁc Garbage Patch, more than 1.8 trillion pieces of plastic with an
estimated weight of 80,000 tons have so far accumulated, with no end in sight (
4–7).
While a few reviews have recently been published focusing on the degradation of
single types of plastic, only a few articles have addressed plastic degradation on a more
global scale, addressing the degradation of several synthetic polymers (
8). Therefore,
the two main questions addressed in this review are as follows. (i) Which enzymes and
microorganisms are currently known to be involved in high-molecular-weight polymer

plastic degradation? (ii) What are the future challenges and technologies for identifying
better enzymes acting on a highly diverse range of synthetic polymers?
Intriguingly, the currently best-known route of plastic destruction involves exposure
to UV light together with mechanical disruption caused by waves and winds or
grinding on marine rocks and sediments, which eventually breaks larger plastics into
smaller pieces of micro- and nanoplastics (MP, with sizes of/H110215 mm, and NP, with sizes
of /H110210.1
/H9262m). So-called “weathering” and “photodegradation” are currently considered
the main forces for initial depletion of plastics, and they mainly result in a modiﬁcation
of the chemical, physical, and mechanical properties of the plastics (
9, 10). The resulting
particles have a much larger surface area, which makes them amenable to further
degradation (
11). Notably, MPs and NPs are a concern to our health, as it is expected
that they enter the food chain and end up in our intestines (12, 13). The fate of MPs or
NPs in human or animal intestines has yet to be determined.
Therefore, removal of plastics from the environment using microbial enzymes has
been a focus of recent research. The main challenge is that marine and terrestrial
displaced plastics are highly stable and durable. Plastics have mainly been introduced
since the 1960s and, given the relatively few decades since these human-made
polymers became available, nature has only had a very short time to evolve highly
active enzymes. Besides, many different types of plastics accumulate in the environ-
ment, and many of the frequently used plastics are mixtures containing additional
solubilizers and other chemical agents to alter the mechanical and physical properties.
These compounds are further targets for microbial biodegradation but may also

high-molecular-weight polymers (not the additives, plasticizers, etc.). For detailed references on the individual
enzymes, refer to the main text. For PA, PE, PS, PVC, and PP, no deﬁned enzymes that act on the polymer have been
identiﬁed at the level of amino acid or DNA sequences. For enzymes acting on dimers or oligomers and feeding
them into the different metabolic pathways, see the main text. For additional structural information on the
polymers we refer to ChEBI (

interfere with degradative enzyme activities. It is assumed that the larger polymers
are initially degraded by secreted exoenzymes into smaller subunits (multimers,
dimers) that can be incorporated into the microbial cells. Once in the cells, either
the oligomers or the degradation products of these are funneled through the
classical degradation pathways to yield energy and/or serve as building blocks for
catabolism or metabolism.
Within this framework, this review summarizes the main ﬁndings on microbial
degradation of the polymers listed above. The chemical structures and some properties
of these polymers are described in each of the following subsections. For a ﬁrst
overview on enzymes and microbes acting on the different plastics, see
Fig. 1 and 2.
In general, it is believed that the microbial degradation of human-made polymers is
a very slow process. This high resistance mainly stems from the high molecular weight
of the ﬁber, the strong C-C bonds, and the extremely hydrophobic surface, which is very
difﬁcult to attack by enzymes. Notably, polymers are high-molecular-weight molecules,
and they have amorphous and crystalline forms, which have different levels of degrad-
ability.

POLYMERS AND MICROBIAL DEGRADATION
Polyethylene terephthalate. Polyethylene terephthalate (PET) is mainly used for
production of PET bottles, PET foil, and ﬁbers in the textile industry. PET is a polar, linear
polymer of repeating units of the aromatic terephthalic acid and ethylene glycol. The
PET monomer is designated bis(2-hydroxyethyl) terephthalate (BHET) (
14). PET is a
thermoplast and partly crystalline. The annual production of PET exceeded 30 million
tons in 2017 (
https://www.plasticsinsight.com/global-pet-resin-production-capacity).
Currently, only a few bacteria and fungi have been described for the partial
degradation of PET to oligomers or monomers (8). All known PET hydrolases have
relatively low turnover rates. Intriguingly, the trait for PET degradation appears to be
limited to a few bacterial phyla, and most bacterial isolates with the potential for PET
degradation are members of the Gram-positive phylumActinobacteria (
15). The best
characterized examples originate from the generaThermobiﬁda and Thermomonospora
(16–23). The enzymes involved in the degradation (e.g., PET hydrolase and tannase,
MHETase) are typical serine hydrolases, e.g., cutinases (EC 3.1.1.74), lipases (EC 3.1.1.3),
and carboxylesterases (EC 3.1.1.1). These enzymes possess a typical
/H9251//H9252-hydrolase fold,
and the catalytic triad is composed of a serine, a histidine, and an aspartate residue (18,
24). They can also contain several disulﬁde bonds caused by cysteine residues, which
promote thermal stability and speciﬁc binding to PET, as shown by the example of
PETase from Ideonella sakaiensis 201-F6 (
25).
Also, for the bacteriumI. sakaiensis, usage of PET as a major energy and carbon
source has been described (25). In addition to the PET hydrolase, the I. sakaiensis
genome codes for a second enzyme that appears to be unique so far and which shares
high similarity to the group of tannases, capable of degrading mono(2-hydroxyethyl)
terephthalic acid. PET hydrolase as a secreted enzyme produces the intermediate
mono(2-hydroxyethyl) terephthalic acid (MHET). MHET is internalized by the cell and
hydrolyzed by MHETase. The resulting monomers are then used for bacterial metabo-
lism. I. sakaiensis is afﬁliated with the phylumBetaproteobacteria and belongs to the
order Burkholderiales.
The I. sakaiensis PETase three-dimensional (3D) structure was elucidated recently
(
26). The overall structure most resembles the structures of cutinases. Austin et al.
showed that a double mutation (S238F/W159H), which narrows the active site of the
enzyme and makes the protein even more like a cutinase resembling the enzyme from
Thermobiﬁda fusca, leads to an improved variant. The majority of the functionally
veriﬁed PET hydrolases contain a C-terminal disulﬁde bond, promoting thermal and
also kinetic stability (
27–29). The only exception from this so far is a para-
nitrobenzylesterase fromBacillus subtilis(30). An additional disulﬁde bond can be found
in I. sakaiensis PETase, as well as in structural models of the functionally tested PET
hydrolases described by Danso et al. (31). The structural data indicate that PETases bind
the polymer with the hydrophobic surface and the substrate-binding cleft. In total, 4
MHET moieties are bound to the protein (one to subsite I and three to subsite II),
whereby the ester bond to be cleaved is located between both subsites next to the
catalytic serine. The MHETase from I. sakaiensis that further hydrolyzes MHET to
ethylene glycol and terephthalic acid has been recently crystallized ligand free (2.05 Å)
and with a nonhydrolyzable MHET analogue bound (2.1 Å). The enzyme possesses a lid
domain that almost exclusively confers substrate speciﬁcity and activity toward MHET,
with a k
cat of 11.1/H110061.4 s/H110021 (32).
While the I. sakaiensis enzymes are the best-studied models, other enzymes and
organisms have been identiﬁed as potent PET degraders. Currently, four enzymes from
Thermobiﬁda species, one from Saccharomonospora, and one from the phylumTher-
momonospora are known to act on PET. These actinobacterial enzymes are often
Ca
2/H11001-dependent, especially in terms of their thermal stability (33), and they are partially
inhibited by their released hydrolysis products MHET and BHET (33). Therefore, efforts
have been made to overcome this limitation; one approach lies in the combination of
Minireview Applied and Environmental Microbiology

polyester hydrolases with other enzymes to improve substrate binding and catalytic
properties (26, 34, 35).
Besides the actinobacterial PET hydrolases, fungal cutinases showed activity on PET
substrates as well. The most prominent examples are cutinases of the phylaFusarium
and Humicola. The latter was also used together with the lipase CalB fromCandida
antarctica in order to circumvent the previously mentioned product inhibition by BHET
and MHET (34). While CalB completely converted to terephthalic acid, theHumicola-
derived enzyme was limited in the last reaction step and accumulated the intermediate
MHET.
Complementary to the above outlined activity-based approaches, a hidden Markov
model (HMM) motif-based large-scale global search of existing genome and meta-
genome databases has been developed for the presence of potential PET hydrolases
(
31). Using this approach,/H11022800 potential PET hydrolases were identiﬁed in bacterial
and archaeal genomes and metagenomes, and several enzymes were functionally
veriﬁed (e.g., PET2, PET4, PET6, and PET12). These ﬁndings imply that PET hydrolase-
encoding genes are globally distributed in marine and terrestrial metagenomes (
31).
Using an in silico genome mining approach, a cutinase fromPseudomonas pseudo-
alcaligenes (PpCutA) and a putative lipase fromPseudomonas pelagia (PpelaLip) were
identiﬁed as potential enzymes acting on polyesters in general. Further experimental
work using recombinant enzymes of PpCutA and PpelaLip veriﬁed the hydrolytic
activities of both enzymes on different types of polyesters, including the hydrolysis of
polyoxyethylene terephthalate (
36). In their study, the authors used structurally differ-
ent ionic phthalic acid-based polyesters with an average molecular weight ranging
from 1,770 to 10,000 g/mol and semicrystalline polyesters with crystallinity below 1% to
test and verify the microbial degradation. Notably, the identiﬁed organism belongs to
a biotechnologically important novel species within the genusPseudomonas, which
was designated Pseudomonas pertucinogena (
37).
In addition to the metagenome-derived PET esterases described above, colleagues
recently reported on the functional screening of metagenomes and the characteriza-
tion of selected enzymes. Among those were the metagenome-derived esterases
MGS0156 and GEN0105, which hydrolyzed polylactic acid (PLA) and polycaprolactone,
as well as bis(benzoyloxyethyl)-terephthalate. For MGS0156, 3D structural data at 1.95 Å
indicate a modiﬁed
/H9251//H9252-hydrolase fold with a lid domain and a highly hydrophobic
active site (38). The closest homologue to MGS0156 is an enzyme fromDesulfovibrio
fructosivorans with 70% sequence similarity.
In summary, PETases represent the best-explored and -studied class of enzymes with
respect to the hydrolysis of synthetic polymers.
Polyurethanes. Polyurethanes (PUR) can be synthesized by using different poly-
ether or polyester polyols. PUR is a polymer of organic units connected by carbamate.
The additional incorporation of aromatic ring structures has further impact on the
physical and chemical properties of the polymer. PUR is a widely used synthetic
polymer for the production of foams, insulation materials, textile coatings, and paint to
prevent corrosion (
39). With over 27 tons produced annually (2), it ranks ﬁfth among the
most often produced synthetic polymers.
To date, only bioactivities that act on the ester-based PUR have been reported (40,
41). Biodegradation was achieved by either bacteria or fungi. With respect to bacteria
capable of degrading PUR, Gram-negative Betaproteobacteria from the genus Pseu-
domonas have been most frequently linked with PUR activities. One of the ﬁrst enzymes
identiﬁed to act on PUR was the PueB lipase fromPseudomonas chlororaphis (42, 43).
This organism codes for at least one additional enzyme active on PUR, which was
designated PueA (
44). Both enzymes are lipases; PUR is degraded by the secreted
hydrolases, and the degradation is tightly regulated. Their respective genes are part of
a larger gene cluster encompassing seven open reading frames (ORFs) (
45). Pseudomo-
nas protegens strain Pf-5 uses a similar mechanism to degrade dispersions of the
polyester PUR. In this strain, however, it was shown that PUR degradation is tightly
Minireview Applied and Environmental Microbiology

regulated by mechanisms of carbon catabolite control and that both lipase genes,pueE
and pueB, appear to be essential for growth on PUR dispersions (46). In a similar
manner, Pseudomonas putidawas reported to degrade PUR at relatively high rates (47).
The bacterium needed 4 days to grow and consume the added colloidal PUR. Yet
another example comes fromComamonas acidovorans TB-35. This strain produces a
PUR-active enzyme that is an esterase and which was designated PudA (
48, 49). PudA
shows a hydrophobic PUR-surface-binding domain and a distinct catalytic domain, and
its surface-binding domain is considered to be essential for PUR degradation. PudA acts
as a 62-kDa monomer, and it releases diethylene glycol and adipic acid at an optimum
temperature of 45°C and an optimum pH of 6.5.
Within this context, it is perhaps notable that often enzyme activities that are
reported are based on clearing zones in agar plates. However, these assays are not fully
reliable. For instance, different enzymes from Pseudomonas spp. and Bacillus spp.
showed signiﬁcant esterase activities and partially or even completely cleared plates
containing colloidal PUR. However, only thePseudomonas sp. lipase signiﬁcantly de-
graded the added PUR based on nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and infrared (IR)
data (
50). Furthermore, there is strong evidence that someB. subtilis and Alicycliphilus
sp. isolates are able to degrade PUR (51–53).
In a recent publication, Schmidt and colleagues reported on microbial degradation
of PUR (i.e., Impranil DLN). The authors of this study employed the known polyester
hydrolases LC-cutinase, TfCut2, Tcur1278, and Tcur0390 in their assays and observed
signiﬁcant weight loss of the tested foils when incubated for extended time periods
(200 h) at a temperature of 70°C (
54). The observation that cutinases, otherwise known
to degrade polyethylene terephthalate, also act on PUR could be attributed to the
promiscuous nature of theThermobiﬁda-derived cutinases. Recent research on promis-
cuity of enzymes implies that lipolytic enzymes such as cutinases are very often highly
promiscuous and can convert up to 78 different substrates (
55).
While the list of PUR-active bacteria is steadily increasing, a larger number of fungi
have also been reported to degrade polyurethane (41). Notably, the authors of that
study identiﬁed a 21-kDa metallo-hydrolase fromPestalotiopsis microsporaas a respon-
sible enzyme in PUR degradation.
Additional studies identiﬁedFusarium solani, Candida ethanolica (56), and Candida
rugosa (57) as PUR degraders. While forC. rugosa, a lipase has been identiﬁed as the key
enzyme involved in PUR metabolism, no enzymes were yet identiﬁed forC. ethanolica
and F. solani. Other fungi reported belong to theCladosporium cladosporioidescomplex,
including the speciesCladosporium pseudocladosporioides, Cladosporium tenuissimum,
Cladosporium asperulatum, and Cladosporium montecillanum, and three others were
identiﬁed as Aspergillus fumigatus, Penicillium chrysogenum (58), and Aspergillus ﬂavus
(59). In the case ofA. ﬂavus, it is assumed that secreted esterases are responsible for the
degradation. However, no deﬁned enzyme has yet been linked to the observed
activities. In a similar study, it was recently reported thatAspergillus tubingensis colo-
nizes PUR and acts on the surface of ﬁlms made of PUR. However, no enzyme was
linked with the PUR activities (
60).
It is noteworthy that the above-mentioned PUR-active enzymes and organisms were
all acting on ester-linked PUR. However, to the best of our knowledge, no enzymes have
yet been described acting on polyurethane ethers.
Polyethylene. Polyethylene (PE) consists of long-chain polymers of ethylene, and it
is produced as either high-density (HD-PE) or low-density (LD-PE) polyethylene. PE is
chemically synthesized by polymerization of ethane and is highly variable, since side
chains can be obtained depending on the manufacturing process. Such modiﬁcations
mainly have inﬂuence on crystallinity and molecular weight. The polymer is most
frequently used in the packaging industry as one of the main packaging materials, and
more than 100 million tons of PE are produced globally per year (
2, 61)( Fig. 2).
Possible PE degradation has been afﬁliated with a surprisingly large number of
bacterial genera. Among those were Gram-negative species afﬁliated with the genera
Minireview Applied and Environmental Microbiology
October 2019 Volume 85 Issue 19 e01095-19 aem.asm.org 6
Pseudomonas, Ralstonia, andStenotrophomonas but also many Gram-positive taxa (e.g.,
Rhodococcus, Staphylococcus, Streptomyces, Bacillus, and others) (see references in Sen
and Raut [62] and Restrepo-Florez et al. [63]). In addition, fungal genera afﬁliated with
assumed PE degradation were reported; these included Aspergillus, Cladosporium,
Penicillium, and others (see references in references62, 63, and 64–69). In addition, a
few studies linked the PE-degrading microbes with the complex gut microbiomes of
invertebrates (
70, 71).
It is notable that in almost all the above-mentioned studies on PE-degrading
microorganisms, the authors reported on degradation of the polymers using commer-
cial polymers that possibly contained chemical additives, and degradation was deter-
mined by measuring weight loss and by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR).
Since weight loss and surface structure changes are most likely attributed to the
degradation of chemical additives, which often make up a signiﬁcant fraction of the
polymer, the results in these studies need to be veriﬁed using more advanced tech-
nologies. None of these studies reveled biochemical mechanisms and enzymes in-
volved in PE breakdown. Within this framework, a more recent publication identiﬁed a
Penicillium-derived laccase as potentially involved in PE breakdown (
72). Unfortunately,
no detailed biochemical characterization was performed, and no sequence of the
protein or the corresponding gene was deposited.
Polyamide. Polyamide (PA) is a polymer of repeating units of aliphatic, semiaro-
matic, or aromatic molecules linked via amide bonds. Since the monomers for making
this polymer can be very versatile, there are many different types of synthetic poly-
amides, with the most popular being nylon and Kevlar. Synthetic polyamides are mainly
used in textiles, automotive applications, carpets, and sportswear (
73).
Remarkably, proteins as well as natural silk are polyamidesper se. Based on this, it
should be expected that nature has evolved enzymes that act on these nonnative
polymers. However, to date, there is no microorganism known that is able to fully
degrade the intact high-molecular-weight polymer. In contrast, several studies are
available on bacteria acting on either linear or cyclic nylon oligomers with rather short
chain lengths. In one of the ﬁrst studies, different bacteria were described to grow on
various oligomers derived from nylon production (
74). In wastewater of nylon factories,
8-caprolactam, 6-aminohexanoic acid, 6-aminohexanoic acid cyclic dimer, and
6-aminohexanoic acid oligomers accumulate. These compounds can serve as the
carbon and nitrogen source for specially adapted bacteria. One of the ﬁrst bacteria
described growing on these mixtures of oligomers wasFlavobacterium sp. strain KI72,
which was later renamed Achromobacter guttatus KI72 and then recently named
Arthrobacter sp. strain KI72 (
74, 75). Nylon oligomer-degrading Arthrobacter isolates
code in their genomes for different hydrolases and several aminotransferases involved
in the initial degradation of the oligomers and the subsequent metabolism. In the case
of strain KI72, the respective genes are located on an accessory plasmid, pOAD2
(
76–78).
Three main enzymes are essential for the initial hydrolysis of cyclic and linear
6-aminohexanoate oligomers. The ﬁrst one is a cyclic-dimer hydrolase (NylA), the
second a dimer hydrolase (NylB), and the third an endo-type oligomer hydrolase (NylC).
NylC is a typical esterase, but its 3D structure also reveals motifs with
/H9252-lactamase folds
(79–87). Once the oligomers are hydrolyzed, the monomers are metabolized by differ-
ent aminotransferases. The draft genome ofArthrobacter sp. KI72 carries, among others,
two genes, designated nylD1 and nylE1, that are responsible for the secondary
6-aminohexanoate metabolism. The 6-aminohexanoate aminotransferase (NylD1)
catalyzes the reaction of 6-aminohexanoate to adipate semialdehyde. It uses
/H9251-ketoglutarate, pyruvate, and glyoxylate as amino acceptors and generates glutamate,
alanine, and glycine, respectively. The reaction relies on pyridoxal phosphate as a
cofactor. The second enzyme, the adipate semialdehyde dehydrogenase (NylE1), cata-
lyzes the reaction, leading from adipate semialdehyde to adipate. This enzyme requires
NADP
/H11001as a cofactor and is an oxidoreductase (88, 89).

More recently, diverse marine bacteria were reported to act on nylon. The authors
of this study reported a signiﬁcant weight loss over a time period of 3 months. In their
study, Bacillus cereus, Bacillus sphaericus, Vibrio furnissii, and Brevundimonas vesicularis
were identiﬁed as potential nylon degraders (
90). The genes and enzymes associated
with the nylon degradation, however, remain to be identiﬁed, and the possibility
cannot be excluded that the weight loss observed was primarily linked to the degra-
dation of chemical additives, as outlined above.
Rather than using the synthetic polymer, Oppermann and colleagues reported on 12
bacterial species capable of degrading the natural polymer poly-
/H9253-glutamic acid. The
high-molecular-weight polymer is synthesized by many Gram-positive bacteria as a
major component of capsules and slime. In contrast to the synthetic polymer, however,
it is a water-soluble molecule and is thus more easily accessible to microbial degrada-
tion (
91).
The only enzyme that has so far been reported to act on high-molecular-weight
nylon ﬁbers was classiﬁed as a manganese-dependent peroxidase and originated from
a white rot fungus. The activity of the native and puriﬁed enzyme, however, differed
from that of lignolytic enzymes. Nylon-degrading activity was quantiﬁed by measuring
the structural disintegration of nylon-66 membranes. The enzyme had a molecular
weight of 43 kDa and was dependent on the presence of lactate and other alpha-
hydroxy acids. Unfortunately, no gene or protein sequence was determined (
92).
While the ﬁrst reports were published in 1965 stating that, among others,Pseu-
domonas aeruginosais able to convert oligomeric nylon, further studies have conﬁrmed
that P. aeruginosa and evolved strain PAO1 are able to efﬁciently degrade
6-aminohexanoate linear dimers (74, 93). The main enzymatic activities were assigned
to a 6-aminohexanoate cyclic-dimer hydrolase and a 6-aminohexanoate dimer hydro-
lase. Other Pseudomonas species have, however, also been reported to utilize
6-aminohexanoate-dimers as a sole carbon and nitrogen source (
94).
Polystyrene. Polystyrene (PS) [poly(1-phenylethene)] polymer consists of styrene
monomers. PS is a widely used synthetic polymer for packaging industries but many
daily use articles (CD cases, plastic cutlery, petri dishes, etc.) are also produced from
this polymer (
95). In 2016, about 14 million tons were produced ( https://www
.plasticsinsight.com/global-pet-resin-production-capacity).
Unfortunately, there is no enzyme known today that can degrade the high-
molecular-weight polymer. However, a ﬁrst report was published recently by Krueger
and colleagues on the identiﬁcation of brown rot fungi able to attack polystyrol by
employing hydroquinone-driven Fenton reactions. In this preliminary study,Gloeophyl-
lum striatum DSM 9592 and Gloeophyllum trabeum DSM 1398 caused substantial
depolymerization after 20 days of incubation. The most activeGloeophyllum strains
caused almost 50% reductions in molecular weight (
96). In an earlier study, the white
rot fungiPleurotus ostreatus, Phanerochaete chrysosporium, andTrametes versicolorand
the brown rot fungusGloeophyllum trabeumwere afﬁliated with the depolymerization
of polystyrene when coincubation together with lignin was performed (97). While these
are ﬁrst and promising reports on the degradation of the high-molecular-weight
polymer, the enzymes involved in the depolymerizing reaction remain to be elucidated.
As already outlined above, weight loss may have been caused by the degradation of
chemical additives.
Similarly, several bacteria have been reported to form either alone or as members of
consortium bioﬁlms on polystyrene ﬁlms and particles, thereby degrading the polymer.
In these studies, mainly weight loss has been assayed. Unfortunately, in none of these
studies were enzymes linked to the assumed depolymerization (
98, 99).
While not a single bacterium is known to degrade the polymer, a larger number of
bacterial genera that are capable of metabolizing the monomer styrene as a sole source
of carbon are known. The biochemistry of styrene metabolism is well understood, and
for more detailed reviews, see references
98 and 100–103 and references therein.
Styrene degradation in bacteria is well studied inPseudomonas, Xanthobacter, Rhodo-

coccus, Corynebacterium, and others. It appears to be a widespread metabolism. Under
aerobic conditions, styrene is oxidized by two different pathways, namely, (i) attacking
the vinyl side chain and (ii) a rather unspeciﬁc aromatic ring, thereby forming primarily
the intermediates 3-vinylcatechol, phenylacetic acid, and 2-phenylethanol. These inter-
mediates are channeled into the Krebs cycle after ring cleavage. The degradation of the
vinyl side chain involves the action of three key enzymes, a styrene monooxygenase, a
styrene oxide isomerase, and a phenylacetaldehyde dehydrogenase (
104). The styrene
monooxygenase attacks the vinyl side chain to release epoxystyrene, which is then
subjected to isomerization to form phenylacetaldehyde. The latter is oxidized to
phenylacetic acid though the involvement of a dehydrogenase. In P. putida, the
phenylacetic acid is activated to phenylacetyl-coenzyme A (CoA) and then subjected to
/H9252-oxidation to yield acetyl-CoA, which is directly fed into the Krebs cycle. The respective
genes for side-chain oxygenation are frequently located in a single conserved gene
cluster, often designatedstyABC(D) (
105). Thereby, thestyA and styB genes code for the
styrene monooxygenase complex. The styrene monooxygenase is a two-component
ﬂavoprotein that catalyzes the NADH- and FAD-dependent epoxidation of styrene to
styrene oxide. StyA is the actual monooxygenase, and StyB functions as ﬂavin adenine
dinucleotide (FAD) reductase, which transfers the electrons from NADH to FAD
/H11001to
supply StyA with the required electrons (106). The styC gene codes for the styrene
isomerase (107), and styD is a phenylacetaldehyde dehydrogenase gene (108). The
expression of the conserved cluster is regulated through either a two-component
regulatory system or LysR-type regulators (
109–111).
The direct ring cleavage of styrene is initiated by a dihydroxylation of the aromatic
ring. This reaction is catalyzed by a 2,3-dioxygenase and followed by a 2,3-dihydrodiol
dehydrogenase. The two key products that are formed are styrene cis-glycol and
3-vinylcatechol. The latter can then be degraded by subsequent meta- or orthocleav-
age to form acrylic acid, acetaldehyde, and pyruvate. The pathway is rather unspeciﬁc
for the general degradation of various aromatic compounds, such as phenol or toluene
(
100–102).
The produced phenylacetaldehydes are of interest to different industries, as they
can be considered building blocks for the production of different ﬁne chemicals or
pharmaceutical compounds. They can serve as the starting material to synthesize
fragrances, ﬂavors, pharmaceuticals, insecticides, fungicides, or herbicides (
112). Recent
studies have also shown that Pseudomonas putida, Rhodococcus zopﬁi, and other
Gram-negative species can convert polystyrene (i.e., styrene oil) into the biodegradable
polymer polyhydroxyalkanoate or other valuable compounds. The approach involves as
a ﬁrst step the pyrolysis of polystyrene to styrene oil. The styrene oil is then converted
in a second step to polyhydroxyalkanoate or other compounds. While the overall
concept of this two-step process is intriguing, it may not be feasible on a large scale,
as the pyrolysis is a process that runs at 520°C and this is energetically very demanding
(
113–115).
Polyvinylchloride and polypropylene.Polyvinylchloride (PVC) and polypropyl-
ene (PP) are both important polymers produced at higher levels than the above-
named polymers. PVC is the third most frequently produced polymer, and only PE
and PP are produced at higher levels. PVC is composed of repeating chloroethyl
units and PP of repeating units of propane-1,2-diyl units (
116, 117). In sharp
contrast to their huge global production rate, hardly any reliable information is
available on microbial degradation of both of these important polymers. Only a very
few reports that describe the degradation of the polymers based on weight loss and
using mixed species microbial communities have been published (
118, 119). How-
ever, it is likely that these reports were in part misled by the degradation of the
chemical additives rather than the polymer. Consequently, no deﬁned enzymes or
pathways that are responsible for the degradation of either of these two high-
molecular-weight polymers are known.

MICROBIOMES OF INVERTEBRATES AS POSSIBLE SOURCES OF PLASTIC-
DEGRADING BACTERIA
Recently, it was reported that invertebrates can degrade different plastics (70, 71,
120–123). While these studies demonstrated that the insects perform a mechanical
grinding and shredding of the plastics, it has been critically discussed if, and to which
extent, the microbiomes associated with the different insects are capable of truly
degrading the synthetic polymers. In one of those studies, Yang and colleagues
provided convincing evidence that Tenebrio molitor L. (mealworms) digested Styro-
foam. The larvae lived over a month when fed on the Styrofoam. Within a 16-day
period, nearly 50% of the ingested Styrofoam carbon was converted into CO
2, and the
residual Styrofoam was found in the feces. Labeling studies using/H9251-13C- or /H9252-13C-
labeled polystyrol implied that the carbon compound was preferentially used to build
lipids (
71). One of the earliest reports on insects digesting plastics came from caterpil-
lars. In 2017, a Spanish team reported on the fast biodegradation of PE by larvae of the
wax moth (Galleria mellonella). The authors of this study presented evidence that larvae
of the wax moth produced holes in PE ﬁlms with considerable speed (
120). The ﬁndings
of this study were critically discussed later on, as the occurrence of ethylene glycol as
well as the correct usage of the FTIR method could not be immediately veriﬁed (
121).
Further work by a Chinese and United States-based research team identiﬁedBacillus sp.
strain YP1 as the polyethylene-degrading bacterium responsible for PE degradation in
Indian mealworms (
70, 122). A related study from the same group identiﬁed bacteria
afﬁliated with the generaCitrobacter and Kosakonia as main degraders for PE and PS in
the guts ofTenebrio molitor (123).
Thus, grinding of larger plastic pieces into smaller parts might offer a solution in that
it increases the surface area and thereby allows microorganisms to better attach to the
surfaces.
FUTURE CHALLENGES IN MICROBIAL PLASTIC DEGRADATION RESEARCH
The diversity of known enzymes and microbes acting on synthetic polymers is still
rather limited. Therefore, future work has to address the identiﬁcation of organisms
acting on the most dominant polymers. The main bottleneck lies in the initial break-
down of high-molecular-weight and highly robust polymers and their crystalline struc-
tures. Furthermore, the implementation of enzymes in processes that would allow the
degradation of plastic polluting environmental niches is a challenge for future gener-
ations of microbiologists. Since current cultivation technologies have not yet resulted
in the identiﬁcation of highly active enzymes for most plastics, the diversity of
noncultivated microorganisms (i.e., global metagenomes) and the so-called dark
matter proteins offer a promising source for the identiﬁcation of such biocatalysts.
Thus, the further development of smart search algorithms for mining metagenome
data sets is certainly a rewarding task. In parallel, the setup of reliable function-
based assays for the detection of high-molecular-weight-polymer-active enzymes is
important as well.
Since commercially available polymers and ﬁlms thereof are often used as
substrates, they contain additives, plasticizers, and other biodegradable impurities
(for example, phthalates), which are much more easily broken down than the actual
backbone. This therefore interferes with the results and frequently leads to the
identiﬁcation of false positives. Thus, the overall methodology linked to the analysis
of microbial plastic degradation needs to be standardized and optimized.
Similarly, the development of cellulosome-like structures (i.e., “plastosomes”) in
microbes to attack intact and crystalline ﬁbers would certainly be a worthwhile project.
Along these lines, the simple development of highly active enzymes for textile indus-
tries could already signiﬁcantly reduce annual plastic pollution and would perhaps be
one of the more realistic short-term goals.
Furthermore, using synthetic biology to generate microorganisms that would pro-
duce high-value compounds from plastic waste is a future challenge and would
contribute to an improved circular use of plastics. Monomers and oligomers formed

after the degradation could be used to build value-added products or even new
(biodegradable) polymers.
Lastly, obtaining plastic-active enzymes and implementing them in the production
of true biopolymers is a highly rewarding research task and would signiﬁcantly reduce
our global plastic problem.
