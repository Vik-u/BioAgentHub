Enzymatic PET depolymerization represents a promising approach for establishing a circular
economy for PET plastics. Nonetheless, limitations in enzyme activity persist as signiﬁcant challenges
to its industrial application. In this research, the backbone structure of theβ6-β7 loop for PET
hydrolase Bhr-PETase derived from thethermophilic bacterium HR29was reconstructed by
introducing double mutations (H218N/F222M), resulting in variant Bhr-NMT with high thermal stability
(T
m = 92.9 °C) and 87% increase in activity. Moreover, the loop reconstruction mutations are
transplanted into the engineered PET hydrolases LCC-ICCG and Kubu-PM12, resulting variants LCC-
ICCG-NM (Tm = 92.4 °C) and Kubu-PM12-NM (Tm = 92.9 °C). Under high substrate concentration
(165 g kg−1) and an enzyme loading of 0.5 mgenzyme gPET
−1, the designed variants Bhr-NMT, LCC-
ICCG-NM, and Kubu-PM12-NM achieve an overall conversion of 93%, 90%, and 94%, respectively,
outperforming the benchmark LCC-ICCG (85%). Notably, under reduced enzyme loading (0.3
mgenzyme gPET
−1), Kubu-PM12-NM still reaches an overall conversion of 91%, which is signiﬁcantly
superior to benchmarks Kubu-PM12 (83%) and LCC-ICCG (71%). Overall, the engineered PET
hydrolases demonstrate signiﬁcant potential for industrial PET waste recycling.
Plastics, prized for their thermal resistance, mechanical strength, and che-
mical stability, are extensively used worldwide; however, only ~9% are
recycled1. Among these materials, polyethylene terephthalate (PET) stands
out as one of the most widely produced synthetic polyesters, with an annual
production volume exceeding 82 million tons
2,3. However, the inherent
chemical recalcitrance of PET contributes to its persistence in the envir-
onment, leading to accumulation in oceans, soils, and even the food chain,
thus posing seriousecological threats
4,5. In response, global initiatives to
advance PET depolymerization technologies are focused on promoting a
sustainable circular economy for this material6,7.
Compared to chemical degradation methods8,9,e n z y m a t i cP E T
depolymerization operates under milder reaction conditions and yields
purer products, which facilitates PET recycling and promotes its industrial
applications
2,10– 12. In 2005, Müller et al. discovered that after incubating at
55 °C for three weeks, the cutinase TfH derived fromThermobiﬁda fusca
could degrade PETﬁlms by up to 17 µm, resulting in a weight loss of 54%13.
To accelerate the enzymatic PET degradation, reactions should be con-

thermophilic species can operate under moderate to high temperatures
without modiﬁcation19– 23, showing promising potential for further engi-
neering. Over the past 20 years, several cutinase variants have been devel-
oped, signi ﬁcantly improving the thermal stability and catalytic

engineered the variant LCC-ICCG, which degraded over 90% of PET within
10 h under industrial conditions, demonstrating the best productivity-to-
enzyme cost ratio among PET hydrolases27. Bhr-PETase, identiﬁed from the
metagenome of thermophilic bacterium HR2930, belongs to the cutinase
family and exhibits superior structural stability with a melting temperature
(T

hydrolases identiﬁed in nature. Furthermore, Bhr-PETase displays higher
PET hydrolytic activity at theTg of PET compared to other cutinases28,31,
thereby making it a promising template for protein engineering. In 2024,

(TurboPETase,Tm = 84 °C), which could nearly completely degrade PET
within 8 h under industrial conditions at 65 °C31. Although engineered
cutinases have sufﬁcient thermal stability, their limited activity requires
large enzyme quantities19,27,31,32 to achieve a 90% conversion at high PET
concentration levels (>15% w/v), constraining the economic feasibility of
enzymatic PET recycling for industrial applications33.
Enzymatic hydrolysis of PET is an interfacial catalytic process that
occurs at the solid-liquid interface34. In 1967, Flory et al. discovered that
amorphous PET exhibitsa unique structural conﬁguration35. In 1998,
Schmidt-Rohr et al. characterized the chain conformations of PET in the
glassy state using two-dimensionaldouble-quantum nuclear magnetic
resonance (NMR), revealing thatin amorphous PET, the gauche con-
formation accounted for 86%36. In 2016, Oda et al. discovered a PET
hydrolase, IsPETase (Tm = 46 °C), from a new bacterium, Ideonella
sakaiensis 201-F637, which exhibits a higher substrate preference for
amorphous PET, with a binding pocket structure that aligns more closely
with the gauche conformation. Guo et al. analyzed the crystal structures of
IsPETase, revealing that the tryptophan residue located in theβ6-β7l o o p
displays distinct conformational states
38– 40. Assuming IsPETase could
remain stable at 70 °C, its activity would likely exceed that of other PET
hydrolases, which has led to the discovery of numerous IsPETase variants
with enhanced thermal stability
30,41– 44.E v e nw i t haTm increase of 36.5 °C
over the wild type, the most thermally stable IsPETase variant, HOT-
PETase, still cannot maintain prolonged activity at PET’s glass transition
temperature (T

The enhanced catalytic efﬁciency of PET hydrolases enables shorter
reaction time and higher productivity, thereby optimizing the economics of
large-scale enzymatic PET depolymerization. In this study, we developed a
computational strategy to redesign thescaffold structure of PET hydrolases
tailored to the structural characteristics of amorphous PET. Utilizing the
highly stable Bhr-PETase, LCC-ICCG27,a n dK u b u - PM12 45 as templates, we
obtained variants with comparable thermal stability and signiﬁcantly
enhanced catalytic activity.

Polymer structural characteristics guided computational rede-
sign of PET hydrolase
The cleavage mechanism of PET polymer chains can be categorized into
exo-type and endo-type processes46. The computational redesign model for
PET hydrolases developed here focuses on the endo-type degradation of
amorphous PET. The template selected for redesigning was Bhr-PETase
(T
m = 95.6 °C), which was derived from thethermophilic bacterium HR29,
and its crystal structure was taken directly from the Protein Data Bank (PDB
ID: 7EOA). Our enzyme design strategy focuses on enhancing catalytic
activity by lowering the activation energy barrier of the transition state (TS)
complex formed between the PET model substrate and the enzyme
47,48.T h e
catalytic mechanism of PET hydrolasesfollows the classical four-step serine
hydrolase pathway (Fig.1b), and both the acylation and deacylation pro-
cesses require a higher activation energy barrier49. A QM/MM molecular
dynamics simulations study on the PEThydrolase revealed that acylation is
the rate-limiting step, with the acylation transition state (TS1, Fig.1b)
exhibiting the highest activation energy barrier50. Therefore, in this study,
the structure of TS1 was utilized to construct a computational model for
enzyme redesign, with the internal coordinates of the atoms in the tetra-
hedral intermediate derived from the calculations conducted by Moliner
et al.
49. The redesign of the PET hydrolase was performed using the com-
putational enzyme design tool PRODA developed in our laboratory47,48,51– 53.
To reﬂect the structural characteristics of amorphous PET polymers
and their translational, rotational, and conformational degrees of freedom
within the active site of the enzyme, a model substrate (Fig.1a) composed of
three PET monomers was constructedin accordance with the placement
rules derived from MD simulations andquantum chemical calculations by
Boyd et al. (Table S1)
16,54. The torsion angles of the four critical bonds
(Fig.1a) in the PET chain were deﬁned as follows. (1) Bond I (CA-CD-O-C),
which links ethylene glycol to the ester bond, has a dihedral angle set at 180°.

the ethylenic bond, has dihedral angles that range from 65° to 75° or from
−75° to−65°. (4) Bond IV (CD-O-C-C), the glycol linkage, exhibits dihe-
dral angles between 100° and 260°. Considering the catalytic geometric
constraints (Fig.1c and Table S2), 176,455 conformations were generated
using a previously developed small molecule placement tool

square deviation (RMSD) threshold of 0.3 Å, resulting in a rotamer library
of the TS with 4526 conformations.
Our enzyme redesign principle was to enhance the binding afﬁnity

55. All residues within 10 Å of
the substrate were selected as design sites (Table S13), where the amino acids
at 11 sequence change positions (G94, Y95, T96, A97, S101, H164, M166,
W190, F243, N246, S247) were varied among (YACFILMNQSVWGH). In
addition, 26 positions, including catalytic triads (S165/H242/D210), sur-
rounding the binding pocket, were subjected to side-chain conformational
optimization. The geometric constraints between the TS and catalytic
residues and the positions of redesigned sites relative to the substrate are
s h o w ni nF i g s .1c, 2a, respectively. Sequence optimization was performed
using the enzyme design tool PRODA
47,48, generating 80 sequences with
single mutation. Among these, 11 sequences exhibited binding energy lower
than that of the wild type, and 64 sequences showed reduced Van der Waals
repulsion with the TS compared to the wild type. More details of the
designed variants are presented in Table S3.
To eliminate false-positive sequences predicted by the energy calcu-
lations, 56 sequences underwent d ynamic evaluation using high-
throughput MD simulations
52,56. The criteria for sequence selection were:
(1) the calculated binding energy changeΔΔGbind < 0 kcal/mol or the total
energy changeΔΔGtotal ranked in the top 40 among all sequences; (2) the
Van der Waals repulsion changeΔΔGVDW-repulsion<0k c a l / m o l ;( 3 )d i v e r -
sity of mutations; (4) inspection of the computed binding geometries. To
evaluate each sequence within the extensive MD simulation data, we
developed four catalytic indicators based on the mechanism of serine
hydrolases, including the RMSD of the TS, the nucleophilic attack distance,
and the stability of the two oxyanion hole hydrogen bonds. The four cata-
lytic indicators were calculated as the averages of 10 × 1 ns MD simulations,
with the results presented in Fig.2b, c, and Table S4. More than 50% of the
sequences (30/56) appeared in theﬁrst quadrant of both Fig.2b, c, indicating
that these sequences outperformed thew i l dt y p ei na l lf o u rc a t a l y t i ci n d i -
cators. Eight sequences were ultimatelyselected for experimental validation
based on the results from the energy calculations and the MD simulations.
The selection criteria included the following: (1) all four catalytic indicators
were superior to those of the wild-type; (2)ΔΔG
VDW-repulsion<0k c a l / m o l ;
(3) diversity of mutations; (4) inspection of the binding conformations in the
trajectories of MD simulations.
The PET depolymerization activities of the variants were evaluated
utilizing bottle-grade post-consumer PET (Pc-PET) powder. All variants
were assessed at a substrate concentration of 0.16% (w/v), and the reactions
were conducted with an enzyme loading of 1 mg
enzyme gPET
−1 at 68 °C for
12 h. In addition, the thermal stability of the variants was evaluated by nano-
differential scanningﬂuorimetry (NanoDSF). The activities andT
m values
of the variants were presented in Fig.2d and Tables S8 and S9. The activities
of variant M1 (F243T,Tm = 95.9 °C) and M2 (F243I,Tm =9 5 . 6° C )w e r e
1.34 and 1.11 times greater than the corresponding values of the wild type,
respectively, consistent with the calculation results. In variants M1 and M2,
the Van der Waals repulsion between the residue at position 243 and
the PET decreased from 11.61 kcal/mol in the wild-type to 0 kcal/mol
(Fig. S1a, b), indicating that in the template Bhr-PETase, the Van der Waals
repulsion between the residue F243 and PET are primarily caused by the
side chain atoms rather than the backbone atoms. Because of the enhanced
thermal stability and activity exhibited by variant M1, it was chosen as a new
template for further design.

Loop reconstruction based computational enzyme redesign
Although the PET degradation activity of variant M1 was promoted, we
observed that there still exists serious Van der Waals repulsion between
the backbone of theβ6-β7 loop and PET (Fig.2e). Therefore, our further
design objective was to enhance the compatibility of theβ6-β7l o o pw i t h
the dominant conformation of amorphous PET through the following
two steps: (1) remodeling the loop to identify a backbone structure that
minimizes the Van der Waals repulsion with PET; (2) performing
sequence optimization to ﬁnd sequences capable of folding into the
remodeled structure. Theβ6-β7 loop (L187-T195) was remodeled using
the protein modeling tool Modeler
18, yielding a total of 50 distinct con-
formations (Fig.3a). Subsequently, the generated rotamer library for PET
model substrate was employed to conduct recapitulation57 calculations of
the enzyme-PET complexes for each of the 50 conformations (Fig. S2 and

Table S5). Among the 17 remodeled loops, the Van der Waals repulsion
between the residue W190 in theβ6-β7 loop and PET is lower than that
of the wild type (Fig. S2), but seven conformations exhibit folding
energies exceeding 100 kcal/mol, indicating signiﬁcant structural incon-
sistencies. For the remaining ten conformations, 5×5 ns MD simulations
were conducted for further validation. The distribution of Van der Waals
repulsion between the backbone atoms of residue W190 and the PET was
calculated to evaluate these conformations (Fig. S4a). Details of the MD
simulations method are shown in the supporting information (Fig. S3).
Loop10 exhibits the lowest and most concentrated Van der Waals
repulsion distribution (Fig. S4a), with a signiﬁcant reduction in Van der

(PDB ID: 7EOA), primarily due to a reduction in Van der Waals repulsion
between residue W190 and PET from 26.71 to 13.61 kcal/mol. Additionally,
the closest distance between the PET and the backbone atoms of residue
W190 increased from 2.7 to 4.2 Å (Fig.3b). Notably, compared to the wild
type, the folding energy of Loop10 increased from−134.17 kcal/mol to
6.29 kcal/mol, indicating signiﬁcant steric clashes between residues in the
β6-β7 loop and surrounding residues that prevent the current sequence
from folding into the intended remodeled conformation. Therefore, rede-
sign of the β6-β7 loop and adjacent residues is necessary to optimize
interactions among these residues.
A computational model for the redesign of theβ6-β7l o o pw a sc o n -
structed based on the structure of Loop10 and the generated rotamer library
for the PET model substrate. The design strategy for this section is to reduce
the folding energy of the sequence while maintaining its binding energy,
ensuring that the mutations enhance activity without negatively impacting
the thermal stability of the variant. All residues within 10 Å of the residue
W190 and 7 Å of the TS were selected as design sites, where the amino acids
at nine sequence change positions (T136, L137, H156, T157, F161, I169,
V177, H183, and F187) were variedamong (YACFILMNQSVWGH).
Among these residues, the remaining 24 residues were subjected to side-
chain conformational optimization. Based on the beneﬁcial mutation F243T
(M1), sequence optimization calculations were performed using our
enzyme design tool PRODA
47,48, resulting in 49 sequences with double
mutations (Table S6). To eliminate false-positive sequences and ensure the
diversity of mutations, high-throughput MD simulations were conducted
on all generated sequences (10 × 1 ns MD simulations). Four catalytic
indicators were calculated for each sequence (Fig.3c, d, and Table S7), and
ten sequences were selected for experimental validation. The selection cri-
teria were: (1) all four catalytic indicators were superior to those of M1; (2)
the folding energy of the variants was lower than that of M1; (3) diversity of
mutations; (4) inspection of the binding conformations in the trajectories of
MD simulations.
The activity and thermal stabilityof the ten variants were experi-
mentally evaluated, with the results presented in Fig. 3ga n d
Tables S8 and S9. TheT
m values of the variants M12 (F222I/F243T) and
M10 (F222M/F243T) increased by 0.9 °C and 2.4 °C, respectively, compared
to M1, although their activities decreased by 12.79% and 8.21%, respectively.
In contrast, variant M9 (H218A/F243T) exhibited a 3% increase in activity
relative to M1, but itsT
m value decreased signiﬁcantly by 13.1 °C. Mutations
in M9, M10, and M12 were concentrated at the 218 and 222 positions, while
mutations at other positions exhibited substantial decreases in both activity
and T
m compared to M1. Consequently, a redesign of synergistic mutations
at positions 218 and 222 was performed, resulting in the 102 sequences with
triple mutations via sequence opti mization calculations using the
PRODA47,48, all of these sequences exhibited folding energies lower than that
of M1 (Table S6). High-throughput MD simulations were conducted on all
102 sequences, and four catalytic indicators were calculated to evaluate their
catalytic performance (Fig.3c, d). Based on the criteria outlined in the
preceding paragraph, 13 sequences were selected for experimental
validation.
The experimental evaluations of activity and thermal stability for 13
variants are presented in Fig.3h and Tables S8, and S9. Among these,ﬁve
variants exhibited higher activity than M1, i.e., M20 (H218N/F222M/
F243T, Fig.3f), M21 (H218V/F222M/F243T),M22 (H218L/F222I/F243T),
M23 (H218S/F222M/F243T), and M24(H218S/F222L/F243T), with their
activities being 1.87, 1.59, 1.52, 1.48, and 1.38 times greater than the wild-
type, respectively. Analysis of the free energy of residues surrounding theβ6-
β7 loop revealed signiﬁcant clashes between residue F222 and adjacent
residues L172, H191, and I204 (ΔG
VDW-repulsion> 6.5 kcal/mol) (Fig.3b).
The mutation of phenylalanine to the moreﬂexible methionine on position
222 promotes better hydrophobic packing between the residue M222 and
the adjacent residues L172 and H191 (Fig.3e), thereby enhancing the
thermal stability of the enzyme. In the structure of Loop10, the Van der
Waals repulsion between residues H218and W190 is calculated at 8.54 kcal/
mol (Fig. 3b), while that between their backbone atoms is 0 kcal/mol,
indicating that the rigidity of the imidazole group in H218 restricts the
rotation of the side chain in W190 and indirectly hinders the binding of PET
to the enzyme. The mutation of the histidine to smaller side chain amino
acids (serine, alanine, threonine, asparagine, and leucine) resulted in a
reduction of the Van der Waals repulsion with W190, thereby enhancing the
enzyme’sa c t i v i t y .
Experimental assessment of highly active variant under industrial
conditions
Among the variants designed based on loop reconstruction, M20 (Bhr-
NMT) exhibited the highest PET depolymerization activity while main-
taining thermal stability (T
m = 92.4 °C) comparable to the wild-type. To
further investigate the feasibilityof applying Bhr-NMT under industrial
conditions, a series of experimental evaluations were conducted. First, the
PET hydrolytic activities of Bhr-NMT and the well-known engineered PET
hydrolase LCC-ICCG
27 were compared over a temperature range of
50 °C– 80 °C (Fig.4a). As the reaction temperature (68 °C, 72 °C, and 75 °C)
approached theTg of PET, variant Bhr-NMT showed markedly enhanced
degradation activity, achieving conversions of 67.9%, 68.8%, and 72.7%
within 8 h, equivalent to 1.22, 1.09, and 1.10 times higher than LCC-ICCG,
respectively. In the temperature range of 68 °C– 75 °C, Bhr-NMT activity
progressively increased with temperature, suggesting that it possesses ade-
quate thermal stability to maintain the structural integrity of its active site
even at 75 °C. The conversion of Bhr-NMT sharply decreased to 28.2% as
the temperature rose to 80 °C, corresponding with an increase in enthalpy in
its temperature-enthalpy curve (Fig. S15) that suggests the onset of sec-
ondary structure loss. At the optimal reaction temperature of 68 °C for PET
depolymerization, a series of evaluations of variant Bhr-NMT were con-
ducted in the pH range of 6.0– 10.0 (Fig. S5). The optimum pH of Bhr-NMT

MHET hydrolysis in the buffer underalkaline conditions. A time-course
activity comparison of Bhr-NMT and LCC-ICCG was conducted using
0.16% (w/v) Pc-PET concentration at 68 °C for 8 h (Fig.4b). The conversion
of Bhr-NMT at 4 h, 8 h, and 12 h was 49.5%, 71.7%, and 90.7%, respectively,
representing 1.24, 1.12, and 1.17 times higher than those of LCC-ICCG. For
amorphous Gf-PETﬁlms (Goodfellow,Φ6 mm), Bhr-NMT also exhibited a
faster degradation rate than LCC-ICCG, achieving 1.58 and 1.24 times
higher conversion at 12 and 24 h, respectively (Fig. S11). Although Bhr-
NMT exhibited the fastest catalytic depolymerization rate at 75 °C under
low PET concentration, studies have indicated that PET crystallinity
increases rapidly at 75 °C
27, limiting the overall PET conversion under
industrially relevant conditions.

To further investigate the effectiveness of enzymes in catalyzing PET
depolymerization under industrial conditions, Bhr-NMT and LCC-
ICCG were evaluated using amorphized PET powder (7.33% crystal-
linity) in a bioreactor under high PET concentrations. To ensure accurate
measurement of hydrolysis products, the reaction conditions were set as
follows: a substrate concentration of 165 g kg
−1 (representing the max-
imum solubility of terephthalate at 70 °C33) and an enzyme loading of
0.5 mgenzyme gPET
−1. The reaction was conducted in a 100 mM phosphate
buffer at 70 °C for 24 h, with the pH value maintained at 8.0 by the
addition of 5 M NaOH solution. The conversion of PET was determined
from the volume of NaOH solution added (Fig.4c) and the HPLC
analysis results of the products at various times (Table S10). Bhr-NMT
achieved 59% (3 h) and 92% (18 h) PET conversion, corresponding to
1.16 and 1.08 times enhancements relative to LCC-ICCG. Over 24 h,
Bhr-NMT converted 93% of PET into TPA, MHET, and EG, whereas
LCC-ICCG achieved 85% overall conversion. Under conditions of
reduced enzyme loading (165 g kg
−1 substrate concentration and
0.3 mgenzyme gPET
−1 enzyme loading), Bhr-NMT demonstrated a wider
performance margin compared to the benchmark LCC-ICCG, achieving
81% overall conversion in 24 h, whereas LCC-ICCG only reached 71%
(Fig. 4d and Table S11).
Transplant of loop reconstruction mutations to other PET
hydrolases
Considering the high homology of PET hydrolases, it was hypothesized that
the β6-β7 loop in other PET hydrolases may cause structural clashes with
PET. Transferring mutations that alter the loop structure (H218N/F222M)
to other PET hydrolases may enhance their catalytic activity. Therefore, two
engineered enzymes were selected as templates: (i) LCC-ICCG
27,av a r i a n to f
thermostable cutinase LCC, and (ii) Kubu-PM12 45, a variant of Kubu-P
derived from Kutzneria buriramensis DSM 45791. By introducing the
H218N/F222M mutations into these enzymes, we successfully constructed
the recombinant proteins LCC-ICCG-NM and Kubu-PM12-NM.
LCC-ICCG and Bhr-PETase share 92.6% sequence identity (Fig. S16),
which confers high structural similarity between these two enzymes. The
crystal structures of the two enzymes were aligned (Fig.5a), revealing a
backbone RMSD of 0.678 Å, along with an RMSD of 0.523 Å for the cata-
lytically relevant residues (catalytic triad and oxyanion hole residues).
Despite a low sequence identity (42.9%, Fig. S17) between Kubu-P
M12 and
Bhr-PETase, structural analysis revealed their sharedα/β hydrolase fold
with sixα-helices and nine antiparallelβ-strands. Structural alignment of the
two enzymes revealed an RMSD of 0.574 Å for catalytic residues and
0.977 Å for backbone atoms in theβ6-β7 loop (Fig.5b).

The H218N/F222M double mutations maximally preserve the
enzyme’s thermal stability. The protein melting curves (Fig. S15) demon-
strated that the designed variants LCC-ICCG-NM (Tm = 92.4 °C) and

50 °C– 75 °C, both variants exhibited higher catalytic activity compared to
their respective templates (Figs. S7 and S8). The PET conversions of the
variants increased progressively withrising temperature, indicating that
their binding pockets maintained structural integrity even at 75 °C. Time-
course PET depolymerization assays revealed that the designed variants
signiﬁcantly enhanced the hydrolysis efﬁciency of PET. After 4 h and 12 h,
LCC-ICCG-NM achieved 48% and 91% conversion (1.22 and 1.18 times
higher than LCC-ICCG, Figs. S9), while Kubu-P
M12-NM reached 50% and
91% (1.55 and 1.07 times higher than Kubu-PM12, Figs. S10 and S12).
To assess the performance of LCC-ICCG-NM and Kubu-PM12-NM in
catalyzing PET depolymerization under industrial conditions, evaluations
were conducted under high PET concentrations (temperature: 70 °C,
165 g kg
−1 of PET concentration, with an enzyme loading of
0.5 mgenzyme gPET
−1). Both LCC-ICCG-NM and Kubu-PM12-NM showed
superior PET depolymerization performance compared to their respective
templates. Kubu-PM12-NM exhibited the highest catalytic efﬁciency among
all PET hydrolases, reaching 73% conversion within 3 h (1.29 times higher
than Kubu-PM12), surpassing 90% conversion by 9 h, and achieving 94%
overall conversion after 24 h (Fig.5e). The variant LCC-ICCG-NM showed
improved catalytic performancewith 90% overall conversion (Fig.5c),
outperforming the template LCC-ICCG(85%). The performance advantage
of the engineered variants over their respective templates was further
enhanced under reduced enzyme loading (0.3 mgenzyme gPET
−1). Kubu-PM12-
NM still showed the highest degree of the PET depolymerization, reaching
65% conversion in 3 h and exceeding 90% conversion after 18 h. The overall
conversion of Kubu-P
M12-NM, Kubu-PM12, LCC-ICCG-NM and LCC-
ICCG was 91%, 83%, 82% and 71%, respectively (Fig.5e, f).
To further investigate the effect of the H218N/F222M double muta-
tions on PET degradation, the molecular weight of the PET substrate was
measured throughout the reacti o np r o c e s sc a t a l y z e db yK u b u - PM12-NM.
The initial molecular weight of the PET substrate was 52.7 kDa, which
decreased to 36.3 kDa after 6 h and further declined to 31.5 kDa after 24 h.
The reconstruction of theβ6-β7 loop aims to modify the backbone structure
of the PET hydrolase to enhance its compatibility with the dominant con-
formation of PET chains. In the initial phase, the high molecular weight of
the PET substrate maintains the structural characteristics of the amorphous
polymer (the torsional angle of the ethylenic bond (O-C-C-O) is ~−70°),
while the rapid decrease in molecular weight indicates that Kubu-P
M12-NM
primarily catalyzes the cleavage of inter-chain ester bonds (endo-type
degradation). The signiﬁcant enhancement in catalytic efﬁciency further
validates the effectiveness of our design strategy. As PET depolymerized and
the molecular weight of the substrate continuously decreased, it was
hypothesized that the torsion angle of the ethylenic bond would further
extend toward −180°. The change in the torsional angle reduces the
structural compatibility between the substrate and Kubu-P
M12-NM, leading
to a decline in its depolymerization activity. The structural mismatch also
resulted in the designed variants achieving an overall conversion of no more
than 40% for semicrystalline PET (Figs. S13 and S14).
It is noteworthy that the introduction of double mutations (H218N/
F222M) in LCC-ICCG signiﬁcantly enhances the expression levels of the
target protein inE. coli. The variant LCC-ICCG-NM achieved a protein
yield of 92 mg l
−1 during shakeﬂask cultivation, which was 3.3 times higher
than LCC-ICCG (Fig. S20). A fed-batch fermentation was conducted for
38 h in a 5 L bioreactor to produce LCC-ICCG-NM in recombinantE. coli
containing the target protein gene, resulting in a protein yield of 1.49 g l
−1
(Fig. S20). The method of heating fermentation products at 60 °C has been
demonstrated to yield pure target proteins effectively, and this simple
puriﬁcation method is well suitable for industrial applications. The activity
of the enzymes obtained through this method was comparable to those
puriﬁed through the Nickel-afﬁnity chromatography column (Fig. S21),
with 60.1% and 66.5% conversion in 8 h at 68 °C, respectively. Moreover,
Kubu-P
M12-NM showed a 1.5 times increase in shake-ﬂask protein yield
compared to its template Kubu-PM12, reaching 10 mg l−1. The increased
recombinant protein yield in the H218N/F222M variants was primarily due
to enhanced solubility, as evidenced by a signiﬁcant reduction in insoluble
aggregates in E. coli expressing LCC-ICCG-NM and Kubu-PM12-NM
compared to their respective templates (Fig. S19). Further genetic optimi-
zation of the expression system could potentially enhance the expression
levels of the designed variants
58,59.
Structural insights of loop reconstruction mutations
The crystal structure of the highly active variant Bhr-NMT was measured
and analyzed to verify whether theβ6-β7 loop conformed to our compu-
tational design (Table S16). An alignment of the overall structures of the
variant Bhr-NMT (PDB ID: 9KL9) and the wild-type Bhr-PETase (PDB ID:
7 E O A )w a ss h o w ni nF i g .6a. The RMSD of the atoms associated with the
catalytic residues (catalytic triad and oxyanion hole) and the Cα atoms in the
main-chain between the two proteins were 0.60 Å and 0.59 Å, respectively,
indicating that the mutations did not signiﬁcantly alter the residues at the
c a t a l y t i cs i t eo rt h eo v e r a l lb a c k b o n estructure of the protein. An alignment
of Bhr-NMT and Bhr-PETase at theβ6-β7 loop was shown in Fig.6b,
illustrating that the mutations caused a deviation in the position of the loop,
with an RMSD of 0.82 Å (L187-K194). In Bhr-NMT, the residue W190 is
positioned closer to theα5 helix compared to the wild-type, with a difference
of 0.9 Å in the distance of the NE1 atom of W190 between the apo-form of
the two enzymes. A repacking calculation based on the crystal structure of
Bhr-NMT was performed, with the computed binding geometries shown in
Fig. 6c. The backbone atom positions of residues N218 and M222 hardly
deviated (Fig.6b), while the minimum distances between PET and the side
chain and backbone of W190 in Bhr-NMT increased by 0.5 Å and 0.2 Å,
respectively, relative to the wild-type. The mutations shortened the distance
between theβ6-β7l o o pa n dt h eα5 helix, shifting the loop away from the
hydrolytic domain and expanding the enzyme’s binding pocket to enhance
PET polymer binding.
The crystal structures indicated that the hydrogen bonding network
of the side chain at position 218 was altered by the mutation. In Bhr-
NMT, residue N218 forms a hydrogen bond with residue P214 located in
the β7-α5 loop, whereas in the wild type, residue H218 forms a hydrogen
bond with residue H191 located in the β6-β7 loop. The hydrogen
bonding interactions of residue 218 in both enzymes during MD simu-
lations (Bhr-NMT: N218-P214: 63%, N218-H191: 13%; Wild-type:
H218-P214: 8%, H218-H191: 84%. Table S12) were consistent with those
observed in the crystal structure. Bhr-NMT possesses a larger binding
pocket compared to the wild-type, which provides greater spatial free-
dom for the rotation of theβ6-β7 loop, thereby facilitating improved
binding afﬁnity between the enzyme and PET. In Bhr-NMT, the
hydrogen bond between residue N218 and P214 effectively links theα5
helix and theβ7-α5 loop, playing a crucial role in maintaining thermal
stability comparable to that of the wild-type. Guo et al. reported that
residue W185, located in theβ6-β7 loop of IsPETase, exhibits greater
ﬂexibility than the corresponding tryptophan residues in other homo-
logous PET hydrolases, thereby enhancing its binding with PET
39. In the
crystal structure of IsPETase (PDB ID: 5XJH, chain B38), the side chain of
residue S214 forms a hydrogen bond with P210 located in theβ7-α5 loop
(Fig. 6d). MD simulation analysis of IsPETase showed that the distance
between residue S214 and theβ6-β7 loop was greater than that to the
β7-α5 loop, consistent with the trend observed in Bhr-NMT (Fig. S22).
The ﬂexibility of residues associated with theβ6-β7 loop structure in
both the Bhr-NMT variant and the wild-type enzyme was examined
through MD simulations (Fig. S23). In Bhr-NMT, the RMSD of residue
W190 was slightly greater than that inthe wild-type, consistent with the
ﬁndings of Guo et al.
39. Additionally, compared to the relatively stable H218
and F222 residues in the wild-type, the RMSDs of residues N218 and M222
in Bhr-NMT showed an overall increase. In the MD simulations, the
hydrogen bond linking theα5h e l i xa n dt h eβ7-α5 loop (N218-P214) in Bhr-
NMT was less stable than the hydrogen bond linking theα5h e l i xa n dt h e
β6-β7 loop (H218-H191) in the wild-type, resulting in increasedﬂexibility of
N218. Methionine has more rotatable bonds than phenylalanine, facilitating
a more favorable alignment of M222 with theﬂexibleβ6-β7 loop backbone
during PET binding. Furthermore, M222 establishes stable hydrophobic

stacking with the surrounding hydrophobic residues L172 and F196,
effectively maintaining the structural stability of the enzyme.
Discussion
Here, we developed a computational design approach based on the struc-
tural characteristics of PET polymersto modify the binding pocket of PET
hydrolase Bhr-PETase. Through the remodeling and reconstruction of the
β6-β7 loop, the variant Bhr-NMT (H218N/F222M/F243T) was successfully
constructed, exhibitingan activity 1.87 times higher than that of the wild-
type. Furthermore, the loop reconstruction mutations (H218N/F222M)
were successfully transplanted into the well-known engineered PET
hydrolases LCC-ICCG and Kubu-P
M12, resulting in the construction of the
variants LCC-ICCG-NM and Kubu-PM12-NM, which exhibit activities 1.22
and 1.55 times greater than their respective templates. Under large-scale
reaction conditions (165 g kg−1 substrate concentration and 0.5 mgenzyme
gPET
−1 enzyme loading), the variants Kubu-PM12-NM, Bhr-NMT, and LCC-
ICCG-NM exhibited higher catalytic activity, achieving overall conversion
of 94%, 93%, and 90%, respectively,whereas the benchmark LCC-ICCG

further reduced to 0.3 mg
enzyme gPET
−1, the designed variants showed a more
pronounced improvement in PET depolymerization efﬁciency compared to
the benchmarks. Among all PET hydrolases, Kubu-PM12-NM achieved the
highest overall conversion of 91%, while LCC-ICCG and Kubu-PM12
reached only 71% and 83%, respectively.
Although multiple mutations at residues H218 or F222 in Bhr-PETase
and LCC-ICCG have been previously reported19,31,60, the double mutation
H218N/F222M has not yet been found in either of these enzymes. More-
over, the double mutation H218N/F222M demonstrated the potential
generalizability for boosting the performance of PET hydrolases. The double
mutation was introduced into the LCC-ICCG (sequence identity: 92.6%)
and Kubu-P
M12 (sequence identity: 42.9%), resulting in designed variants,
LCC-ICCG-NM and Kubu-PM12-NM, which exhibited a signi ﬁcant
enhancement in activity. PET hydrolases always share characteristicα/β-
hydrolase domains and exhibit highly similar backbone conformations in

hydrogen bond with H218 ((H191) NE1-N (H218): 3.0 Å). In Bhr-NMT, the closest
distance between the side chains of residues W190 and N218 is 4.3 Å ((W190) NE1-

the β6-β7 loop. This structural convergence enabled the loop reconstructed
design strategy based on Bhr-PETase to be successfully applied to other PET
hydrolases, and the double mutation H218N/F222M will be introduced into
more PET hydrolases to further verify its transplant generality.
While the remodeled loop structure generated with the classical protein
modeling tool Modeler
18 was successful to produce highly active PET
hydrolases, the computational predictions still exhibit differences from
those in the crystal structure. In future studies, more accurate loop structures
may be generated by employing deep-learning based protein design tools,
such as RFdiffusion
61, ProteinMPNN62, and AlphaFold363.O u rc o m p u t a -
tional enzyme design strategy facilitates the screening and development of
efﬁcient PET hydrolases, advancing the industrialization of PET recycling.

The PET model substrate was constructed using the Polymer Builder
module of the molecular modeling tool CHARMM-GUI64.I n i t i a l l y ,f o u r
PET monomers (ethylene glycol terephthalate) were constructed using
CHARMM-GUI, with both termini capped by hydrogen atoms. Subse-
quently, using the molecular editing software Pymol, one terminal
2-hydroxyethyl terephthalate groupwas removed to generate a compound
comprising three PET monomers linked to an ethyl group, which was used
as the model substrate for computational enzyme design and MD simula-
tions in this study. The structure and atomic names for the model substrate
are presented in Fig. S24. The crystal structures of the wild-type Bhr-PETase
(PDB ID: 7EOA, the number of residue started from 36), IsPETase (PDB ID:

deposited into the PDB database (PDB ID: 9KL9). For the enzyme crystal
structures used, water molecules and other small molecules were removed
using PyMOL. Hydrogen atoms were added to all amino acids utilizing our

Table S13. A backbone-independent rotamer library comprising 11,810
original rotamers was used to model the side-chain conformations of the
designed positions. In addition, the crystal conformations in the design
positions of the template were included in the rotamer library. The rotamers
for serine, threonine, and tyrosine were expanded due to adopting different
conformations for the hydroxyl hydrogen atoms. The structure of the PET
model substrate in the transition state (TS) was modiﬁed by altering the
central ester bond’s atom to achieve a tetrahedral geometry, with the speciﬁc
internal coordinate for atoms obtained from the multiscale QM/MM MD
simulations by Moliner et al.
49. The atomic van der Waals parameters of the
PET model substrate were derived from the model molecules of the
CHARMM 22 forceﬁeld, and the charges for atoms were obtained from the
CGENFF website. The TS conformational library was generated and
screened based on the substrate placement rules (Table S1) and the catalytic
geometric constraints (Table S2), utilizing the small-molecule placement
approach in PRODA
47,48. The free energy of the enzyme-substrate complex
in the TS was calculated by the energy functions in PRODA, and the
sequences were optimized by the deterministic global optimization
algorithm.
Molecular dynamics simulation
All MD simulations were conducted using GROMACS version 2022.565.
The initial complex coordinates of designs were derived from the compu-
tational results of PRODA. The enzyme-PET complex structure was
embedded within a dodecahedral box whose size was determined by setting
the distance between the solute and the box to 10 Å. Approximately 8500
display water molecules were added within the box, with the water model
selected being TIP3P under the CHARMM36 forceﬁeld
66.T h ec h a r g eo ft h e
system was neutralized by adding an appropriate number of Na+ or Cl−
counter ions to the solvent box.
Each simulation was independently initiated with energy minimization
(EM) of the system using the steepest descent minimization algorithm. The
EM continued until the potential energy was negative, and the maximum
force Fmax did not exceed 1000 kJ mol
−1 nm−1. Next, the system was sub-
jected to position-restrained NVT simulations using the simulated
annealing method. For the 1 ns and 5 ns MD simulations, the temperature
was gradually increased from 0 to 343K throughout 200 ps. Subsequently,
the system underwent 200 ps of position-restrained NPT simulations. The
time step for both NVT and NPT was set to 2 fs. The velocity rescaling
thermostat was used for temperature control, and the Berendsen barostat
was employed for pressure control. The LINCS algorithm was used to
impose constraints on bonds and angles of the complex, and the Particle-
Mesh-Ewald method was used to model long-range electrostatic effects, and
short-range Van der Waals interactions were cut off at 12 Å, and the dif-
ferential equations of motion were integrated by a leap-frog algorithm. The
1 ns and 5 ns MD simulations were performed 10 and 5 times, respectively;
the time step was set to 2 fs for both; coordinates of all atoms in the system
were saved every 1 ps and 5 ps, respectively, with a total of 1000 frames
generated for each. Data generated from the MD simulations were extracted
and analyzed using the Python package Mdanalysis, while the interactions
between the enzyme and substrate were analyzed and visualized with
PyMOL software. More details are presented in the supporting information
(Table S14).
Loop remodeling
The β6-β7 loop in the wild-type Bhr-PETase crystal structure (PDB ID:
7EOA) was remodeled using the protein modeling tool Modeler 10.518. First,
water molecules and other small ligands were removed from the crystal
structure by PyMOL, and the Bhr-PETase sequence was extracted from the
PDB ﬁle. Next, residues L187 to T195 (L187, T188, P189, W190, H191,
T192, D193, K194, T195) in Bhr-PETase were designated for remodeling,
resulting in the generation of 50 distinct conformations. These conforma-
tions were then evaluated using the DOPE scoring method
18.
Sequence alignment
A global sequence alignment between PET hydrolases LCC-ICCG and Bhr-
PETase was conducted using the Needle tool from the EMBL-EBI bioin-
formatics platform (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ jdispatcher/psa/emboss_nee-
dle), yielding a pairwise alignment and calculating sequence similarity
between the two enzymes. The alignment results were then visualized using
the sequence alignment visualization tool ESPript 3.0 (https://espript.ibcp.
fr/ESPript/ESPript/), as shown in Figs. S16 and S17.
Chemicals
Bis(2-hydroxyethyl) terephthalate(BHET) and mono(hydroxyethyl) ter-
ephthalate (MHET) were obtained from Bide Pharmatech Ltd (Shanghai,
China). Terephthalic acid (TPA) was sourced from Maiklin Biochemical
Technology Ltd (Shanghai, China).
Gene cloning, plasmid construction, and site-directed
mutagenesis
The amino acid sequence of Bhr-PETase was obtained from the NCBI
database (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/, Bhr-PETase Genebank code:
GBD22443.1). The amino acid sequences of LCC-ICCG and Kubu-PM12
were sourced from Tournier et al.27 and Seo et al.45. Codon optimization and
gene synthesis were conducted by the Beijing Genomics Institution (Beijing,
China). All nucleotide sequences were subcloned between the NdeI and
XhoI restriction enzyme sites of the pET-22b(+) bacterial expression
plasmid, fusing a 6 × hexahistidine tag-coding sequence to the C-terminus

were generated through site-directed mutagenesis and veriﬁed using auto-
mated DNA sequencing technology. The amino acid sequences of
Bhr-PETase, Bhr-NMT, LCC-ICCG, LCC-ICCG-NM, Kubu-PM12,a n d
Kubu-PM12-NM were presented in Table S17.
Enzyme expression and puriﬁcation
The plasmids containing the genes for the PET hydrolases BhrPETase,
LCC-ICCG, Kubu-PM12, and their mutants were transformed intoE. coli
strain BL21 (DE3), and the strains were cultured on solid Luria-Bertani
(LB) medium with 100μgm l
−1 ampicillin at 37 °C for 14– 18 h. A well-
grown single colony was transferred to 5 ml of LB liquid medium con-
taining 100μgm l
−1 ampicillin to prepare a seed solution, which was then
incubated at 37 °C and 200 rpm for 7 h until the OD600 value reached a
1.6– 2.0. Then, 2 ml of the seed solution was transferred to 200 ml of LB
liquid medium containing 100μgm l−1 ampicillin and incubated under
conditions of 37 °C and 200 rpm until the OD600 reached 0.6– 0.8. For
LCC-ICCG, Kubu-PM12, and their variants, a ﬁnal concentration of
0.5 mM IPTG was added to the shakeﬂasks and incubated at 20 °C and
180 rpm for 16.5 h. For Bhr-PETase and its variants, 0.2% (w/v)
L-arabinose was added to the culture and incubated at 20 °C and 180 rpm
for 14.5 h. After centrifugation at 3819 ×g for 20 min at 4 °C, all cell
pellets were resuspended in lysis buffer (100 mM phosphate, 300 mM
NaCl, pH 8.0) and then subjected to a sonication cycle (4 s on and 6 s off)
at 60% power for 45 min. The periplasmic extracts were centrifuged at 4
°C and 5198 ×g for 15 min, and the supernatant was then further cen-
trifuged at 4 °C and 15292 ×g for 10 min to remove insoluble cell debris.
The clariﬁed lysate was loaded into a 25 ml HisTrap HP column, and
unbound proteins were washed out with the buffer (100 mM phosphate,
300 mM NaCl, 100 mM imidazole, pH 8.0), and the target proteins were
eluted with an elution buffer (100 mM phosphate, 300 mM NaCl,
400 mM imidazole, pH 8.0). The target proteins were centrifuged at
3819 ×g for 20 min at 4 °C triple times using a 10 kDa cut-off Amicon®
Ultra 15 ml Centrifugal Filter device from EMD Millipore Corporation
(Billerica, USA) to desalte. The puriﬁed protein was stored at 4 °C, and its
concentration was measured using Coomassie Brilliant Blue G250 from
Solarbio (Beijing, China) and a UV-1200 spectrophotometer from
Macylab Instrument Ltd (Shanghai, China). The presence and purity of
the target protein were detected using sodium dodecyl sulfate-
polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) (Figs. S18 and S19).
PET powder preparation
The microcrystalline post-consumerPET (Pc-PET, 10.61% crystallinity) for
evaluating the activity of the variants was obtained from commercial bottles
(body only; the neck and base were removed from the bottle) from the Coca-
Cola Company (China). PET bottles were cut into 10 × 10 mm pieces and
washed sequentially with water, 0.5%sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), and
ethanol. After drying, the PET pieceswere shredded into particles using an
AM500S high-speed rotary mill from Ants Scientiﬁc Instruments Ltd
(Beijing, China) equipped with a 0.5 mm trapezoidal hole sieve ring. During
operation, the machine generated substantial heat, causing internal tem-
peratures to exceed 200 °C. Upon opening, the PET powders were rapidly
cooled to ambient temperature (~25 °C),effectively lowering their crystal-
linity. The powders were sifted through 200, 355μm sieves, to obtain PET
powders with particle sizes of 200– 355 μm.
The amorphized Pc-PET (7.33% crystallinity) for PET depolymer-
ization bioreactor assay was obtained from commercial bottles from the
Coca-Cola Company (China). The PET bottles were initially washed with
water, followed by heating in a mufﬂe furnace at 290 °C for 15 min until
complete melting. After heating, the melted PET was rapidly cooled in an
ice-water bath to solidify. After drying, the PET pieces were shredded into
particles using CM101 high-speed cutting mill from Grinder Instruments
Ltd (Beijing, China), equipped with a 0.5 mm trapezoidal hole sieve ring.
The powders were sifted through 200, 355μm sieves to obtain PET powders
with particle sizes of 200– 355 μm.
PET depolymerization assay
PET depolymerization experiments with 0.16% (w/v) PET concentration
were conducted to evaluate the activity of the Bhr-PETase variants. 5 mg of
microcrystalline Pc-PET powder was soaked in 3 ml of 100 mM phosphate
buffer (pH 8.0), with 0.057μMo fp u r iﬁed enzyme (1 mg
enzyme gPET
−1)a t
68 °C for 12 h. Equal volumes of methanol were added to terminate the
reaction, and the supernatant was collected by centrifugation (10610 ×g,
3 min). Each sample was diluted 10-fold andﬁltered through a 0.22μm
Millexﬁlter. The contents of PET hydrolysis products (BHET, MHET, and
TPA) were quantitatively analyzed using HPLC (Fig. S26). Each indepen-
dent experiment was conducted in triplicate, with mean values and standard
deviations subsequently calculated.
PET depolymerization bioreactor assay
PET depolymerization experiments in a bioreactor with a 16.5% (w/v) PET
concentration were conducted to assess the catalytic activities of the PET
hydrolases Bhr-NMT, LCC-ICCG, LCC-ICCG-NM, Kubu-PM12,a n d
Kubu-PM12-NM at substrate concentrations relevant to industrial scale.

phosphate buffer (pH 8.0) in a three-neckedﬂask. The total system volume
was 50 ml, with an enzyme concentration of 2.23μM( 0 . 5m genzyme gPET
−1)
or 1.34μM. (0.3 mgenzyme gPET
−1). The three-neckedﬂask was placed in a
heat-collecting constant temperature magnetic stirrer ZNCL-G from
YUHUA Instrument Ltd (Henan, China) to agitate the reaction solution
and maintain the temperature at 70 °C. The pH of the reaction solution was
continuously measured using a pH meter FE28 from Mettler Toledo
(Zurich, Switzerland). A 5 M NaOH solution was added to adjust the pH to a
range of 7.8– 8.2, with the volume of NaOH solution added recorded. At 3, 6,
9, 12, 18, and 24 h, 1000μl samples were extracted and combined with an
equal volume of methanol to terminate the reaction. The samples were
diluted to a suitable concentration, centrifuged, andﬁltered through a 0.22
μmM i l l e xﬁlter. The concentrations of BHET, MHET, and TPA in the
diluted samples were quantitatively determined using HPLC. After the
reaction, the residual PET substrate was washed with water,ﬁltered through
a0 . 2 2μm membrane, and dried at 50 °C for 48 h for weighing.
HPLC method
The concentrations of TPA, MHET, and BHET were determined using the
CMB-20A system from Shimadzu Ltd (Kyoto, Japan) connected to an SPD-
20A UV/Vis detector and a SunFire™ C18 column (5 µm, 4.6 × 250 mm) at
254 nm, with quantitative analysis performed using a calibration curve
(Fig. S26). A volume of 10 µL from each sample was injected, and TPA,
MHET, and BHET were separated usingan eluent composed of acetonitrile
and 0.1% (v/v) formic acid in water. The acetonitrile concentration was
maintained at 5% for theﬁrst 5 min, then increased to 44% at 13 min, and
further raised to 70% at 18 min, remaining at 70% until 23 min.
Determination method for protein melting temperature
The protein melting temperature (Tm) of each enzyme was determined
using nano differential scanningﬂuorimetry (nanoDSF) with the protein
stability analyzer Prometheus Panta from NanoTemper (Munich, Ger-
many). During the measurement, the samples were heated from 25 °C to
110 °C at a rate of 2 °C min
−1.T h eTm value of each enzyme was analyzed in
triplicate, with mean values and standard deviations calculated accordingly.
Determination method for PET crystallinity
The crystallinity of microcrystalline Pc-PET, amorphized Pc-PET, amor-
phous Gf-PET (purchased from Goodfellow, product number ES301445),
and semicrystalline PET were assessed using differential scanning calori-
metry (DSC), as shown in Table S15. The sample (4– 6 mg) was placed in an
aluminum pan equipped with a solid sample lid. Next, the DSC 8000 system
from PerkinElmer (Massachusetts, USA), with an automatic liquid nitrogen
cooling system, was utilized to heat the sample from 30 °C to 300 °C at a rate
of 10 °C min
−1, hold at 300 °C for 1 min, and subsequently cool back to

Determination method for molecular weight of PET
The molecular weight of the PET was analyzed using gel permeation
chromatography (GPC) with an Agilent 1260 system from Agilent Tech-
nologies Ltd (California, USA) and a refractive index (RI) detector. The
mobile phase consisted of 1, 1, 1, 3, 3, 3-hexaﬂuoro-2-propanol (HFIP), and
the analysis was conducted at 35 °C with aﬂow rate of 1 ml min
−1.
Fed-batch fermentation ofE. colistrains
The fed-batch fermentation was applied to produce PET hydrolase LCC-
ICCG-NM in recombinantE. coli BL21 (DE3) with a 5 L bioreactor. The
strain was cultivated onto solid LB agar plates containing 100μgm l−1
antibiotics and incubated at 37 °C for 14 to 18 h. Well-grown individual
colonies were then transferred to 5 ml of liquid LB medium containing
100 μgm l
−1 ampicillin and grown at 37 °C, 200 rpm for 12 h until the
OD600 reached 3.0– 4.0. A 2 ml volume of the culture was inoculated into
50 ml of liquid LB medium to prepare a seed culture, which was grown at
37 °C and 200 rpm for 4 h until reaching an OD
600 of 1.5– 2.5. The initial
fermentation medium (2.0 L) was combined with 100 ml of seed culture
(5% v/v) and transferred into a 5 l mechanically stirred fermenter
BIOTECH-5JGZ from Baoxing Biological Equipment Engineering Ltd
(Shanghai, China). The stirring speed was maintained between 300 and
600 rpm, with a gasﬂow rate of 0.3– 0.6 vvm and pure oxygen enrichment
at 0%– 50%, ensuring dissolved oxygen levels remained above 5% of air
saturation during fermentation. A two-stage temperature control was
implemented, with the growth phase maintained at 37 °C for 0– 14 h and
25 °C for protein production in the remainder of the fermentation. The
pH was maintained at 7.0 by adding 5 M NH
4OH solution. The glucose
content was monitored using the glucose meter ACCU-CHEK from
Roche Diabetes Care GmbH Ltd (Basel, Switzerland). Protein expression
was induced by adding Isopropylβ-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) at
a ﬁnal concentration of 1 mM over 14 h, with a total cultivation time of
38 h. After fermentation, theE. coli broth was centrifuged at 3819 ×g for
30 min, and the pellet was resuspended in lysis buffer (100 mM phos-
phate, 300 mM NaCl, pH 8.0) and then subjected to a sonication cycle
(4 s on and 6 s off) at 60% power for 45 min. The lysate was centrifuged at
5198 ×g for 15 min at 4 °C to collect the supernatant. It was then cen-
trifuged again at 15,292 ×g for 10 min at 4 °C to remove insoluble cell
debris, getting the crude enzyme solution containing the variant LCC-
ICCG-NM. The crude enzyme solution was heated in a 60 °C water bath
for 2 h to remove contaminating proteins, followed by centrifugation at
15292 ×g for 30 min, obtaining the puriﬁed LCC-ICCG-NM in the
supernatant. The presence and purity of the target protein were detected
using SDS-PAGE.
Crystal structure determination
The designed PET hydrolase Bhr-NMT was concentrated to 4 mg ml−1 in
buffer containing 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 200 mM NaCl, and 5 mM
dithiothreitol. Crystals were grown using the hanging-drop vapor diffusion
method. Crystals of Bhr-PETase were grown at 18 °C by mixing an equal
volume of the protein (4 mg ml
−1) with a reservoir solution containing
2.5 M Sodium chloride, 100 mM imidazole, and Hydrochloric acid (pH 8.0).
The crystals appeared overnight and grew to a maximum size in ~2– 3d a y s .
The crystals were cryoprotected in a reservoir containing 20% glycerol
before being transferred to liquid nitrogen. All data were collected at
Shanghai Synchrotron Radiation Facility beamlines BL02U1, integrated,
and scaled using the Aquarium
68. The initial model of Bhr-PETase was used
from PDB: 7EOA. The structure of Bhr-NMT was solved by molecular
replacement and was reﬁned manually using COOT69.T h es t r u c t u r ew a s
reﬁned with PHENIX70 using non-crystallographic symmetry and stereo-
chemical information as constraints. Theﬁnal structure was obtained
through several rounds of reﬁnement. The data collection and structure
reﬁnement statistics are summarized in Table S16. The accession number
for the coordinate and structure factors reported in the present paper is PDB
ID: 9KL9.
Statistics and reproducibility
PET hydrolysis assay activities at low PET substrate concentrations were
obtained from the average of three parallel experiments. The feature values
for the 1 ns and 5 ns MD simulations were averaged over 10 and 5 repli-
cations, respectively.
