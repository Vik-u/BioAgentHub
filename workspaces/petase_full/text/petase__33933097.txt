Surface display as a functional screening 
platform for detecting enzymes active on PET

Abstract 
  Poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) is the world’s most abundant polyester plastic, and its ongoing accumulation in 
nature is causing a global environmental problem. Currently, the main recycling processes utilize thermomechanical 
or chemical means, resulting in the deterioration of the mechanical properties of PET. Consequently, polluting de novo 
synthesis remains preferred, creating the need for more efficient and bio-sustainable ways to hydrolyze the poly-
mer. Recently, a PETase enzyme from the bacterium Ideonella sakaiensis was shown to facilitate PET biodegradation, 
albeit at slow rate. Engineering of more efficient PETases is required for industrial relevance, but progress is currently 
hampered by the dependency on intracellular expression in Escherichia coli. To create a more efficient screening 
platform in E. coli, we explore different surface display anchors for fast and easy assaying of PETase activity. We show 
that PETases can be functionally displayed on the bacterial cell surface, enabling screening of enzyme activity on PET 
microparticles – both while anchored to the cell and following solubilization of the enzymes.

Introduction
Poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) is one of the most 
commonly produced plastics (with an annual manufac -
turing of over 30  million tons), appreciated for its low 
cost, robustness, and high durability. This highly inert 
polyester consists of repeating units of the aromatic 
building block terephthalate (TPA) linked to ethylene 
glycol (EG) [1]. The inherent non-degradable properties 
that make PET an excellent material, unfortunately have 
the huge environmental drawback of substantial accu -
mulation in landfills and in the ecosystem [2]. Increased 
build-up of plastic waste together with the fact that PET 
is produced from fossil feedstock call for efficient recy -
cling and remediation strategies. These are currently 
dominated by thermo-mechanical and chemical means, 
with drawbacks like downcycling and the use of hazard -
ous chemicals [3]. An environmentally friendly and less 
destructive recycling method is biodegradation, and 
recently, the interest in enzymatic PET degradation has 
increased tremendously [4].
The crystallinity and the limited accessibility to the 
ester linkages make PET unsusceptible to enzymatic 
hydrolysis, but a number of ester-cleaving enzymes 
have been reported active on the polyester [1]. The most 
promising candidates are classified as cutinases (EC 
3.1.1.74), but the turnover rates are only low to moder -
ate, reflecting that PET is an unnatural substrate for these 
enzymes [5]. A breakthrough in the field was the discov -
ery of Ideonella sakaiensis in 2016, a bacterium able to 
utilize PET as its sole carbon source by converting it into 
TPA and EG, which was further metabolized. The ini -
tial catabolic pathway by I. sakaiensis involves two novel 
enzymes. The initial hydrolysis step of PET is facilitated 
by an extracellular enzyme homologous to cutinases, but 
with an extraordinary capability to degrade PET, hence 
classified as a PETase (EC 3.1.1.101). The hydrolysis 
products, of which Mono-(2-hydroxyethyl)terephthalic 
acid (MHET) comprises a major part, are transported 
into the periplasmic space, and degraded to TPA and EG

by the second novel enzyme, classified as a MHETase (EC 
3.1.1.102) [6].
However, even with the PETase’s promising catalytic 
properties, problems with expression, purification and 
stability make it inadequate for industrial purposes [7, 8]. 
Several engineering efforts have resulted in a few cata -
lytically improved and more thermostable variants [7, 
9–12]. Examples of improved variants of the I. sakaien -
sis PETase are the Is PETaseAustin [9], and Is PETaseSon [7]. 
The improvements in activity towards PET were achieved 
using two different strategies. In Is PETaseAustin, the focus 
was to narrow the active site and to make it more cuti -
nase-like by introducing the double mutation S238F and 
W159H, whereas the triple mutation S121E, D186H and 
R280A in Is PETaseSon was centred around stabilizing 
loop regions, thereby improving the overall tempera -
ture stability. Irrespectively of the strategy, both variants 
were shown to clearly outcompete the wildtype PETase 
(IsPETaseWT).
Protein engineering efforts have all been done in E. 
coli, despite the complications imposed by the need for 
the release of intracellularly produced enzyme variants. 
Interestingly, only 2–3 mutations have been incorporated 
in the IsPETaseAustin, and IsPETaseSon variants. One could 
speculate if use of a more amenable system, circumvent -
ing the limitations imposed by intracellular localiza -
tion, would enable a more efficient protein engineering 
workflow for improving the Is PETase. As there is still no 
report of the PETase being successfully upscaled in an 
industrially relevant microbe, E. coli has remained the 
organism of choice, able to produce small amounts of the 
enzyme, albeit most of it ends up in inclusion bodies [8].
For large-scale production and screening of metagen -
omic samples for novel enzymes active on PET, there is a 
need for a robust and simple expression procedure. Bac -
terial surface display of enzymatically active proteins is a 
promising strategy to engineer whole-cell catalysts, but 
also to overcome the bottleneck of inefficient enzyme 
secretion and cytoplasmatic toxicity, enabling simplifi -
cation of production procedures as well as downstream 
processes. Since the first attempts in the late ’80s  , sur -
face display is steadily gaining popularity and has been 
explored in most industrially relevant microbial plat -
forms. Nonetheless, E. coli remains the most frequently 
used organism for surface display with a great variety of 
membrane anchors available [13]. Herein, we present a 
method for surface display expression of PETase variants 
using E. coli protein production strain BL21(DE3). This 
expression strategy allows for quick screening of the pro -
duced variants, where the lysis step and the formation 
of inclusion bodies are avoided. The procedure provides 
a convenient screening platform that could be applied 
to PETase variants in an industrially relevant organism 
suitable for integration into high throughput screening 
systems.
Methods
Construction of expression vectors
Genes encoding the three IsPETase variants (IsPETaseWT, 
IsPETaseAustin, IsPETaseSon) [7, 9, 11] were synthesized 
according to the published codon-optimized sequence 
from Austin et al., 2018 [9] (final sequences can be found 
in Additional file  1: Sequence list) and cloned scarlessly 
into vectors pKSD:LppOmpA-NB and pKSD:NB-C-IgAP 
[14] using uracil-excision (USER) based cloning [15] and 
primers 1–7 (Additional file  1: Table  S1) without their 
leader sequence and Met codon present. Sequences 
encoding TEV cleavage sites (ENLYFQ/G) were added 
in frame to either both sites of the enzyme sequence 
(IgAP module, STOP codon removed) or upstream of 
the N-terminus only (LppOmpA module, STOP codon 
intact) to enable cleavage from the surface anchor. We 
additionally added hexa-histidine tags C-terminally prior 
to the terminal TEV cleavage site (C-IgAP module) or 
STOP codon (LppOmpA module) for purification of the 
different IsPETase variants after TEV cleavage. Both the 
TEV cleavage sites and hexa-histidine tags were fused 
directly to the coding sequence without use of linker 
sequences.
Expression of surface‑displayed IsPETase variants
All pKSD expression vectors were transformed into 
BL21(DE3) competent E. coli (NEB) via heat shock and 
according to the manufacturer’s description. Expression 
cultures were cultivated at 37  °C in 500 ml Erlenmeyer 
shake flasks without baffles in a culture volume of 50 mL 
lysogenic broth medium supplemented with 50  µg/mL 
Kanamycin. Cultures were induced at an optical density 
of 0.3–0.5 at 600 nm via the addition of l-rhamnose (5 
mM final concentration) and subsequently incubated 
for 20 h at 30 °C or 60 h at 16 °C (as stated) shaking at 
250 rpm.
GFP binding assay to assess surface display efficiency
The nanobody:GFP binding assay was performed as pre -
viously described [14]. Surface display expression was 
terminated via centrifugation for 4 min at 2300g and cells 
were resuspended in 50 mM Tris buffer (pH 7.5). Puri -
fied GFP (for detailed purification protocol, see [14]) was 
added to a final concentration of 0.06 mg/mL and bind -
ing was allowed for 20 min at 30 °C while shaking at 250–
300 rpm. Post GFP binding, cells were washed twice in 50 
mM Tris buffer and 50 µL of washed cell suspension was 
mixed with 100 µL 50 mM Tris buffer and transferred 
into a 96-well microtiter plate (Sigma-Aldrich). Optical 
density at 630 nm and GFP fluorescence (excitation: 485

nm, emission: 528 nm) were measured in a SynergyH1 
plate reader (BioTek) in transparent or opaque microtiter 
plates (Sigma-Aldrich), respectively.
TEV cleavage
For TEV cleavage of the surface-displayed IsPETase vari-
ants, cells were harvested for 5  min at 4000  g, washed 
twice in 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) and subsequently 
resuspended in the same buffer (100 µL per ODU). 
Commercial TEV protease (Sigma-Aldrich) was added 
to the cell suspension resulting in a final concentration 
of 1 Unit/ODU and the reaction incubated overnight at 
4 °C, rotating at 10 rpm on a Blood Mixer Intelli-Mixer 
RM-2  S. Post incubation, cells were pelleted at 5000  g 
for 10  min and the supernatant was collected for activ -
ity analysis on para-nitrophenol (pNP)-acetate/butyrate 
and PET, and SDS-PAGE. Solubilized Is PETase variants 
were purified using His GraviTrap TALON (GE Health -
care Life Sciences) columns according to the manu -
facturer’s instructions. In short, the supernatant was 
applied to a Ni–NTA agarose column. After washing 
with 20 mM sodium phosphate buffer containing 500 
mM NaCl (buffer A) and 30 mM imidazole, the bound 
proteins were eluted with 300 mM imidazole in buffer 
A. Finally, the imidazole was removed using a PD-10 col -
umn (Amersham biosciences) equilibrated with 50 mM 
HEPES (pH 8) buffer. The Is PETaseAustin purified control 
was purified as described in [16].
p  NP‑acetate/butyrate activity assay
20 µL whole cells  (OD630 = 0.1) displaying IsPETase vari-
ants on the cell surface, supernatant of washed cells after 
TEV cleavage, and purified Is PETase (0.1  µg/mL) were 
incubated with 1 mM pNP-acetate or pNP-butyrate 
(Sigma-Aldrich) in 50 mM phosphate buffer (pH 7) 
for 5  min at 24  °C. The release of pNP was monitored 
at a wavelength of 405 nm in a SynergyH1 plate reader 
(BioTek). For pNP-acetate assays on whole cells, E. coli 
BL21(DE3) cells not harbouring any of the surface-dis -
play expression vectors were used as negative control 
(NC). Since His-tag purified Is PETases were stored in 50 
mM HEPES buffer (pH 8), the same buffer was respec -
tively used as negative control for the pNP-acetate assay 
on purified enzymes.
  Protein gels and western blot
For in-gel fluorescence, cells were resuspended after 
nanobody:GFP binding to a concentration of 0.05 ODU/
µL and 20 µL were mixed with 10 µL 2×Laemmli sam -
ple buffer and 0.5 µL benzonase nuclease (≥ 250 units/
µL, Sigma). 15 µL of the whole sample were loaded onto 
a 4–20% Criterion™ TGX™ gel (Bio-Rad) at non-denatur-
ing conditions and run for 30 min at 200 V. Fluorescent 
protein bands were visualized using UV light and a Gel -
Doc XR + imaging system (Bio-rad). Total protein was 
assessed afterwards by staining with Novex Simply -
Blue SafeStain. For Is PETase detection by western blot, 
samples were mixed with Laemmli sample buffer as 
described above, boiled for 5 min and separated via SDS-
PAGE (4–20% Criterion ™ TGX™ gel (Bio-Rad) at dena -
turing conditions). Total protein was transferred onto a 
nitro cellulose membrane using the iBlot ™ 1 gel transfer 
system (Invitrogen). Blots were blocked with TBS-1% 
dried skim milk powder and developed with sequential 
incubations of mouse anti penta histidine tag (α-His) 
antibody (Bio-Rad, MCA5995P) and horse radish peroxi -
dase (HRP) conjugated secondary goat anti mouse IgG 
(Sigma-Aldrich, M8642-1MG).
Activity measurement on suspended PET
Activity measurements of whole cell suspension 
 (OD630 = 0.1) surface-displaying PETase variants and 
free PETase enzyme (post TEV cleavage, corresponding 
roughly to a concentration of 0.01–0.1 µM) on a sus -
pended, semi-crystalline PET powder (Goodfellow Co, 
ES306031) were executed by adapting a plate reader-
based assay previously described [17]. In short, reactions 
were performed in sealed low binding 96-well plates 
(Greiner Bio-One ™ 655900), incubated at 40  °C, in 50 
mM sodium phosphate pH 8, at 1100 rpm in an Eppen -
dorf thermomixer for 4 h. PET concentration was 15 g/L 
and enzyme sample volume was 50 µL in a total volume 
of 250 µL. Reactions were quenched by centrifugation, 
the supernatant withdrawn, and formation of soluble 
products was detected by measuring the absorbance at 
240 nm.
Results and discussion
Selection of membrane anchors for IsPETase surface 
display in E. coli
To overcome the bottleneck of inefficient heterologous 
expression and secretion of Is PETase variants in sub -
stantial amounts for screening and characterization, we 
adapted a surface display system previously described 
[14] to enable activity screening of Is PETase variants 
without the need for secretion into the growth medium. 
The system developed by Wendel et  al. consists of both 
N- and C-terminal transmembrane anchors fused to 
the protein of interest. Sandwiched in between the 
membrane anchor and the protein of interest is a single 
domain camelid-derived antibody fragment (nanobody; 
NB) with high affinity for GFP [18], binding the fluoro -
phore in a stable complex, thus allowing visualization 
of the surface display module when exposed on the cell 
surface.

Two different membrane anchors were explored: (i) 
the C-terminal translocation unit of the Neisseria gon -
orrhoeae autotransporter IgA protease (C-IgAP) and (ii) 
a LppOmpA fusion protein consisting of the Lpp sig -
nal peptide followed by five transmembrane segments 
(residues 66 to 180) of E. coli outer membrane protein 
A  (OmpA) (Fig.  1). All three versions of the Is PETase 
(IsPETaseWT, IsPETaseAustin, and Is PETaseSon) were fused 
to the GFP-nanobody (part of the anchoring module) 
either C-terminally with a PelB signal peptide directly 
fused to the N-terminus of the enzyme, or N-terminally 
allowing a free C-terminus, resulting in a total mod -
ule size of 85 or 55  kDa, respectively. The two modules 
insert in antagonal orientation into the bacterial cell 
membrane. This way, IsPETase variants are oriented in 
opposite directions and can be translocated across the 
membrane without direct fusion to the signal peptide in 
the N-terminal LppOmpA module. In both cases, protein 
production is under the control of the rhamnose-induc -
ible  rhaPBAD promoter and successful display on the cell 
surface can be assessed upon GFP binding. This allows 
an easy and fast estimation of the relative surface display 
capacity. Furthermore, the introduction of TEV cleavage 
sites at both the N- and C-termini (C-IgAP module) or 
solely the N-terminus (LppOmpA module) along with a 
C-terminal histidine-tag prior to the TEV site allow the 
controlled release of the Is PETase variants into solution 
at any desired time point, as well as their subsequent 
purification.
The efficiency of the different transmembrane anchors 
for displaying the IsPETase was evaluated on whole cells. 
In short, this was done by isolating the cells post induc -
tion (expression at 30  °C), and quantifying the signal 
derived from the GFP bound to the surface-exposed 
nanobody. This has previously been shown to be an 
excellent proxy for measuring total surface displayed 
protein [14]. The LppOmpA anchor successfully dis -
played the Is PETase-containing surface display mod -
ules,  as confirmed via fluorescence measurement in a 
microtiter plate reader as well as via in-gel fluorescence 
of OD-normalized whole-cell samples after incubation 
with GFP (Fig.  2a). At non-denaturing conditions, con -
cise bands corresponding to a complex of the surface 
display module bound to GFP via the nanobody element 
[theoretical sizes 112 (C-IgAP) and 82 kDa (LppOmpA)] 
could be detected for the LppOmpA module, whereas 
no fluorescence appeared to originate from either the 
C-IgAP module or the unbound GFP (27 kDa). The addi -
tional bands on the native gel most likely stem from par -
tially denatured and incompletely or incorrectly folded 
LppOmpA modules containing the nanobody-GFP 
complex. Induced cultures were highly fluorescent com -
pared to non-induced ones, with cultures expressing the 
LppOmpA anchor module emitting significantly higher 
fluorescence than the C-IgAP cultures. This suggests 
that the N-terminal fusion construct is the most effi -
cient for signal peptide-free Is PETase expression. Fusion 
of the pelB signal peptide directly onto the enzymes’

N-terminus (C-IgAP module) was previously observed 
to be possible, but inefficient for IsPETase secretion [8] 
in line with our observations. A further advantage of the 
LppOmpA anchor module is the free C-terminus on the 
PETase, which readily allows fusion of tags or reporter 
proteins for downstream processing.
To investigate whether Is PETase enzymes displayed 
on the bacterial cell surface were correctly folded in an 
active conformation, we screened the six candidate con -
structs for activity on pNP-acetate, a standard chromo -
genic model substrate for esterases [19]. For the surface 
display modules that were N-terminally fused onto the 
LppOmpA fusion protein, and  in good correlation with 
the GFP binding assay, higher amounts of released pNP 
could be detected as a larger shift in absorbance (Fig.  2b). 
Identical results could be confirmed using the compa -
rable compound pNP-butyrate as substrate (Additional 
file  1:   Figure S1). Despite the high background activity 
of the BL21(DE3) strain on the pNP-acetate, a significant 
activity increase for all  the membrane-bound Is PETase 
variants post induction could be detected when com -
pared to non-induced cultures. Based on these observa -
tions, the LppOmpA anchor module was chosen for all 
further experiments.
Surface‑bound IsPETaseWT is active on PET microparticles
To eliminate the background activity detected for non-
producing E. coli cells on pNP-acetate, as well as, to 
investigate whether the surface-bound Is PETase pro -
tein was folded correctly and in an active state, we next 
assessed the activity of the Is PETaseWT towards PET 
particles. IsPETaseWT exhibits several fold lower activity 
towards PET than improved enzyme variants. This makes 
the wildtype enzyme an ideal candidate to test both base-
line sensitivity of the assay and suitability of a surface 
display strategy for detection of non-optimized PETases. 
To do so, cell-bound IsPETaseWT produced in BL21(DE3) 
harboring expression vector pKSD:LppOmpA-NB-
IsPETasewt (20 h post induction, expression at 30 °C) was 
prepared and surface display verified by activity towards 
pNP-acetate (Fig. 3a) and GFP fluorescence (Fig. 3b).
Suspended, semi-crystalline PET powder, was used 
as substrate and the formation of degradation product 
was detected via an increase in absorbance at 240 nm. 
As expected, no shift in absorbance (due to release of 
PET degradation products) could be detected for non-
induced cells not expressing the Is PETase surface display 
module (Fig.  3c). However, significant Is PETase activity 
on free PET could be detected for the surface-displayed

IsPETaseWT while still bound to the cell surface. The 
activity of the surface displayed PETase corresponded to 
the activity of 20 nM purified (free) Is PETaseAustin meas-
ured under the same conditions [16] and used here as a 
positive control. This showed that the Is PETaseWT was 
correctly folded and displayed in sufficient quantities for 
detection.
Surface display allows expression and activity assessment 
of different IsPETase variants
Having shown that the Is PETaseWT was correctly folded 
when surface-displayed, we next wanted to explore the 
correlation between the surface-bound Is PETase activ -
ity measured in the initial screening on p NP-acetate 
with the functionality of the free enzyme on its (actual) 
substrate PET. This was done by utilizing the TEV 
cleavage sites present in the anchor module to release 
all three surface-displayed Is PETase variants into the 
supernatant while removing the insoluble fraction by 
centrifugation. Measurements of the p NP-acetate activ -
ity in the soluble fraction clearly showed that all three 
PETase variants had been successfully released from 
the cell surface via TEV treatment (Fig.  4a). The back -
ground activity previously observed for the BL21(DE3) 
control strain was now absent, indicating that it could 
be caused by a native E. coli membrane-associated 
esterase. Solubilization of the Is PETase variants by 
TEV cleavage resulted in an approximate 10-fold loss 
in absolute activity. This was most likely a combina -
tion of inefficient solubilization and, more significantly, 
removal of the high E. coli background activity which 
accounted for 86–87% of the total activity prior to 
TEV cleavage (Fig.  4a). TEV-mediated enzyme release 
thus enables detection of false positive (non-produc -
ing or inactive) batches, as it decreases the amount 
of background activity for the non-expressing E. coli  
production strain significantly. Additionally, the rela -
tive abundance of the three Is PETase variants either 
prior or post TEV cleavage was similar, confirming 
that activity on p NP-acetate is not caused by unspecific 
activity of the E. coli background strain but derived 
from the surface-displayed Is PETase variants.
The three Is PETase variants chosen for surface dis -
play (Is PETaseWT, IsPETaseAustin and Is PETaseSon) have 
previously been characterized [7 , 9, 11], and therefore, 
provide an optimal test set of enzymes to verify the 
screening strategy explored here. While the Is PETase-
Austin variant (S238F and W159H) has improved PET 
degradation activity due to a narrowed binding cleft [9 ], 
Son et  al. implemented three point mutations (S121E, 
D186H and R280A) into the wildtype enzyme increas -
ing its thermal stability (Tm + 8.81  °C), meanwhile, 
further enhancing the enzyme’s PET degradation activ -
ity (14-fold at 40  °C) [7 ] compared to IsPETaseWT. As 
the variants have been evolved towards higher specific 
activity on PET and not pNP-acetate, it was expected 
that pNP-acetate is unsuited to resolve clear activ -
ity differences (Fig.  4a). Nonetheless, initial activity 
screening on pNP-acetate offers a fast and easy pre -
liminary screening step to select active enzyme variants 
and reduce sample size for downstream analysis.
We next purified the solubilized Is PETaseWT and 
IsPETaseSon using His-tag purification columns. The 
two PETase variants were chosen as they both appeared 
to be surface-displayed at similar levels as determined 
by GFP fluorescence (Fig.  4b). As a quality control, 
activity of the purified samples towards p NP-acetate 
was measured. As shown in Fig.  4c, background activity 
was significantly removed during purification, support -
ing the earlier notion that this resulted from a native E. 
coli esterase. Even though enzyme amounts post purifi -
cation were not in sufficient amount to be detected on

a SDS-PAGE, all Is PETase could be detected using His-
tag specific (α-His) antibodies via western blot (Fig.  4d). 
This was not surprising, as protein surface display suf -
fers from the bottleneck caused by the inefficient and 
competition-heavy bacterial membrane translocation 
machinery, as well as the spatial limitation of the cell 
surface itself [20].
Interestingly, enzyme activity on PET increased after 
purification even though absolute enzyme amounts 
decreased, indicating inhibition by other proteins or 
compounds released during cell lysis present in the 
unpurified supernatant or better accessibility of the 
smaller enzyme to the corrugated surface upon removal 
of potential steric hindrance of the large construct 
(Fig.  4d). This observation is supported by the pres -
ence of multiple proteins visible on the SDS-PAGE of 
IsPETase samples after TEV cleavage but prior to puri -
fication (Additional file  1: Figure S2). Activity on PET 
for the purified Is PETaseWT enzyme was compara -
ble to its activity in the TEV-cleaved but non-purified 
sample. In contrast, the purified Is PETaseSon exhibited 
a 2.5-fold increase in activity on PET compared to its 
non-purified sample, and a sevenfold higher activity 
compared to the purified wildtype enzyme. The latter 
corresponds well with the increased enzyme activity 
reported for Is PETaseSon [ 7] and supports the hypoth -
esis of optimized substrate binding/enzyme efficiency 
post purification. Comparing band intensities visible 
Fig. 4   Surface display and activity assessment of different IsPETase variants. a Activity of wt, Austin, and Son IsPETase variants expressed via the 
LppOmpA surface display module prior to and post TEV cleavage, hence release from the cell surface. To allow comparison of absorbance, values 
are relative to IsPETaseWT activity prior to TEV cleavage. Expression of all samples was performed at 16 °C. b Whole-cell fluorescence verification 
of surface-displayed IsPETase variants (wt, Austin, Son) prior to TEV cleavage. c Activity of IsPETaseWT and IsPETaseSon on pNP-acetate after His-tag 
purification. Buffer blank: 50 mM HEPES buffer. d Activity and detection of the previously described IsPETase variants expressed on the surface and 
subsequently cleaved off (TEV supernatant) and His-tag purified (purified). Activity of the released IsPETase variants on PET microparticles (upper 
half ) and detection of the His-tagged enzymes via western blot (lower half ) using an anti-His antibody. NC: Negative control BL21(DE3) cells

on the western blot (Fig.  4d), the apparent protein con -
centration of the Is PETaseSon variant was approximately 
half of Is PETaseWT. This, combined with the observed 
7-fold activity increase on PET, adds up roughly to 
the 14-fold higher activity previously reported for the 
variant. Looking at the TEV supernatant of Is PETase-
Son and Is PETaseAustin, a similar comparison of protein 
concentrations in the western blot and activity towards 
PET (Fig.  4d) would suggest a lower specific activity of 
IsPETaseAustin at the conditions used.
A future refinement would be to include purified sam -
ples of selected enzymes, thereby allowing an improved 
quantification of the total amount of surface displayed 
enzyme. A potential caveat is that enzymes with large 
differences in specific activity (as seen for the IsPETase 
variants in this study) could easily bias this analysis. In 
contrast, using GFP binding as a proxy for quantifying 
the amount of surface display enzyme functions inde -
pendently of enzyme specific activity. In summary, we 
show that an LppOmpA fusion protein can facilitate 
functional surface display of Is PETases and therefore 
easily be assayed whilst still bound to the cell surface, 
as well as after release into solution via the simplistic 
procedure outlined here. Two different surface display 
modules were investigated in this study, of which the 
spatial architecture of the LppOmpA module with the 
C-terminally positioned PETase resulted in the most 
optimal configuration. Further optimization of the cul -
turing/expression conditions, the TEV cleavage, and 
the production host strain can be explored for more 
efficient expression of the Is PETase variants in this 
set-up. Surface display can be used for rapid screening 
of novel PETase variants enabling a fast and simplis -
tic activity readout on PET. Moreover, the availability 
of the GFP nanobody allows assessment of expression 
independently from enzyme activity, which makes it 
well suited as initial screening tool for new enzyme 
candidates and allows for easy implementation into 
high-throughput screening workflows in both academic 
and industrial settings.
