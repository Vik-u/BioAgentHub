Summary
Polyethylene terephthalate (PET) is a mass-produced
synthetic polyester contributing remarkably to the
accumulation of solid plastics waste and plastics
pollution in the natural environments. Recently,
bioremediation of plastics waste using engineered
enzymes has emerged as an eco-friendly alternative
approach for the future plastic circular economy.
Here we genetically engineered a thermophilic anaer-
obic bacterium, Clostridium thermocellum, to enable
the secretory expression of a thermophilic cutinase
(LCC), which was originally isolated from a plant
compost metagenome and can degrade PET at up to
70°C. This engineered whole-cell biocatalyst allowed
a simultaneous high-level expression of LCC and
conspicuous degradation of commercial PETﬁlms at
60°C. After 14 days incubation of a batch culture,
more than 60% of the initial mass of a PETﬁlm (ap-
proximately 50 mg) was converted into soluble
monomer feedstocks, indicating a markedly higher
degradation performance than previously reported
whole-cell-based PET biodegradation systems using
mesophilic bacteria or microalgae. Ourﬁndings pro-
vide clear evidence that, compared to mesophilic
species, thermophilic microbes are a more promis-
ing synthetic microbial chassis for developing future
biodegradation processes of PET waste.
Introduction
Plastic pollution has become a global concern in recent
years as a result of the extensive production, use and
lack of proper recycling provisions and technologies. The
tremendous amount of virgin plastics with a total of over
8300 million metric ton (Mt) has been estimated to be
produced by humankind since 1950, out of which over
90% are derived from fossil hydrocarbons and 79% are
simply landﬁlled or carelessly disposed in the natural
environments (Geyer, et al. , 2017). Consequently,
humankind is facing a huge environmental crisis caused
by the highly recalcitrant plastic materials as their degra-
dation under natural conditions is extremely slow (Roch-
man, et al., 2013). As an application sector with the
shortest product life cycle length, plastic packaging con-
tributes considerably to the rapid accumulation of solid
plastic waste (PlasticsEurope, 2018). In addition to poly-
oleﬁns and polystyrene, polyethylene terephthalate

(PET) plays a pivotal role in the global packaging mar-
ket, especially for fresh food, water and soft drinks (Ellen
MacArthur Foundation, 2016). Moreover, PET con-
tributes more than 70% to the global production of syn-
thetic ﬁbres which are majorly used for the textile
industry (Geyer, et al. , 2017) and can end up as
microplastics pollution in the natural environments
(Deng, et al., 2019; Zhang,et al., 2019).
Polyethylene terephthalate is a colourless thermoplas-
tic material with a variety of excellent polymer process-
ing properties (Webb,et al., 2013). Despite the fact that
the backbone of PET consists of only ester bonds
formed between a diol (ethylene glycol, EG) and an
aromatic di-acid (terephthalic acid, TPA), only a few
hydrolytic enzymes have been reported to catalyse the
polymer chain breakdown, releasing TPA and EG as
monomer degradation products (Wei & Zimmermann
2017a,2017b). In 2016, Yoshida et al. identiﬁed at a
PET-bottle recycling site a bacterium,Ideonella sakaien-
sis, capable of degrading and completely assimilating
highly amorphous PET as a major carbon source at a
mesophilic temperature of 30 °C (Bornscheuer, 2016;
Yoshida, et al., 2016). When cultivated in a fed-batch
culture containing a low concentration of yeast extract,
this bacterium could completely degrade a small PET
ﬁlm (shown as approximately 60 mg with a dimension of
15 x 20 x 0.2 mm) within 42 days (6 weeks). Two key
enzymes involved in the hydrolysis of PET byI. sakaien-
sis were identiﬁed: an extracellular PETase (Han,et al.,
2017; Austin, et al., 2018) able to cleave the PET poly-
mers into the intermediates bis- and mono(2-hydrox-
yethyl) terephthalic acid (BHET, MHET respectively),
which could possibly be taken up by the cell and subse-
quently hydrolysed by the second enzyme, the intracellu-
lar MHET hydrolase (Palm, et al., 2019), into TPA and
EG (Yoshida, et al., 2016). Moreover, Yoshida et al.
(2016) also hypothesized a potential metabolic mecha-
nism of PET and its monomer TPA based on primitive
transcriptomic analysis. Very recently, Moog, et al.
(2019) genetically engineered the photosynthetic
microalgae Phaeodactylum tricornutum to resemble an
I. sakaiensis-like cell factory capable of secreting a sin-
gle-site mutant of PETase into the extracellular culture
medium. The cell-free culture supernatant has been
shown able to degrade the amorphous copolymer poly-
ethylene terephthalate glycol (PETG) following 7 days of
incubation at 30°C, as evidenced by scanning electron
microscopy (SEM) and high-performance liquid chro-
matography (HPLC) analysis towards the aromatic
degradation products. When the engineered diatom was
cultivated in a salt water-based environment at 21°Ci n
the presence of industrially shredded PET particles, the
secretory expression of the PETase variant and the
simultaneous degradation of PET could be successfully
veriﬁed by HPLC analysis. Thisﬁnding provided a proof-
of-concept of using engineered whole-cell biocatalyst in
plastic degradation. Compared to enzymatic hydrolysis
using puriﬁed free enzymes, the whole-cell biocatalysis
is a ‘one-pot’ strategy combining the enzyme production
and hydrolysis in a single step. The whole-cell biocata-
lyst can produce the functional enzymes and degrade
PET simultaneously under a consistent reaction condi-
tion. Thus, PET degradation based on whole-cell biocat-
alyst can show great advantages over using free
enzymes by omitting the time-consuming and material-in-
tensive protein puriﬁcation process (de Carvalho, 2017).
Nevertheless, the polymer properties of semi-crystalline
PET with a glass transition temperature (T
g)o f >70°C
require effective enzymatic hydrolysis at a temperature
signiﬁcantly higher than 30 °C (Wei & Zimmermann
2017a, 2017b; Wei,et al., 2019b). For instance, LC-cuti-
nase (LCC) isolated from a leaf-branch compost, which
was assumed to provide a thermophilic habitat for
microbes (Sulaiman,et al., 2012), was shown to have an
optimal temperature for PET hydrolysis at 70°C (Sulai-
man, et al., 2014; Wei, et al., 2019b), which is in the
range ofT
g for PET. At this temperature, the mobile amor-
phous fraction of PET polymers can be preferentially
accessed by hydrolases and converted to soluble oligo-
meric and monomeric feedstocks (Barth, et al., 2015;
Wei, et al., 2019a). High temperatures can not only pro-
mote plastic decomposition but also reduce the risk of
contamination. Therefore, although the plastic degrading
activity of natural thermophiles able to grow at>60°C has
not been reported so far, engineering thermophilic
microbes by employing thermophilic hydrolases is
regarded as a more promising strategy for the develop-
ment of future bioremediation processes for plastic waste.
However, compared to mesophilic microbes, ther-
mophilic microorganisms are usually difﬁcult to be genet-
ically manipulated due to inadequate genetic tools. One
exception is Clostridium thermocellum, a typical ther-
mophilic anaerobe with an optimal growth condition at
60°C (Ng, et al., 1977). C. thermocellum is considered
one of the most promising species for highly ef ﬁcient
and low-cost lignocellulose bioconversion (Lynd, et al.,
2005), and mature genetic manipulation platforms have
been constructed for this thermophile (Tripathi, et al.,
2010; Olson and Lynd, 2012; Mohr,et al., 2013, Olson,
et al., 2015; Zhang,et al., 2017). By using the developed
tools, C. thermocellum recombinant strains have been
constructed and employed as whole-cell biocatalysts in
lignocellulose sacchari ﬁcation and biofuel production
(Argyros, et al., 2011; Lin,et al., 2015; Liu,et al., 2019).
Thus, C. thermocellum has the potential to be used as
the microbial chassis for the degradation of plastic waste
at high temperature, e.g. with the secretory expression
of thermal stable PET hydrolase LCC.

Results
Construction of a recombinant C. thermocellum strain
expressing a secretory LC-cutinase
A thermophilic cutinase (LCC) was originally isolated from a
plant compost metagenome (Sulaiman,et al., 2012) and has
high activity in PET degradation at up to 70°C (Sulaiman,
et al., 2014; Wei,et al., 2019b). Thus, LCC was chosen to
be expressed inC. thermocellum. C. thermocellumis known
for its ability in the highly efﬁcient degradation of lignocellu-
lose by producing an extracellular multi-protein structure, the
cellulosome (Yoav,et al., 2017). Because the exoglucanase
Cel48S is the most abundant component in the cellulosome
of C. thermocellum(Liu, et al., 2018), the signal peptide
sequence of Cel48S was used for the secretory production
of LCC. In addition, a strong promoter from the constitutively
expressed gene Clo1313_2638 (Olson,et al., 2015) was
selected to obtain high-level expression of LCC inC. ther-
mocellum. As shown in Fig. 1A, the plasmid pHK-LCC was
constructed after PCR veriﬁcation and was then transformed
to C. thermocellumDSM1313 to construct the target strain
DSM1313::pHK-LCC.
Both the engineered strain and the wild type strain
DSM1313, which served as a negative control, were culti-
vated in GS-2 medium to investigate the expression and
secretion of the LCC protein. According to the Fast-Red
dye-based staining results (Fig. 1C), active LCC was visi-
ble as a violet protein band at approximately 28 kDa in the
supernatant of DSM1313::pHK-LCC, but not detected in
the corresponding cell lysate, indicating the produced
LCC protein was successfully secreted extracellularly in
the supernatant of the culture. In contrast, no LCC activity
was observed in either intra- or extracellular proteins of
the wild type strain. These results indicated the functional
expression of LCC as fully secretory protein byC. thermo-
cellum DSM1313::pHK-LCC.

release TPA and EG as monomeric feedstocks from
PET polymers (Wei & Zimmermann 2017a, 2017b)
which can potentially inﬂuence the growth ofC. thermo-
cellum. In our experimental set-up, we used 50 mg of
PET ﬁlms in an anaerobic glass tube containing a cul-
ture medium of 10 ml in total. Therefore, theoretical max-
imum yield of TPA and EG was estimated to be
25.9 mM according to the molecular mass of one repeat-
ing unit of PET of 192.2 g mol
/C01. Accordingly, we deter-
mined the cell growth in terms of optical density at
600 nm (OD
600) in the presence of 20-mM TPA, EG,
both of them, or PETﬁlms within theﬁrst 32 h cultivation
time. As shown in Fig. 2, C. thermocellum DSM1313
exhibited a similar shape of growth curve independent of
the presence of any PET-related compounds. Brieﬂy, a
lag phase was observed until 12 h after the inoculation
followed by a rapid growth until 20 h of cultivation time
with a maximum OD
600 of approximately 2.2. Afterwards,
there was a clear trend of gradually decreasing OD600
until 32 h to reach aﬁnal value in the range of 1.6– 1.8,
suggesting possible cell lysis without further addition of
any nutrient. Additionally, no signiﬁcant difference was
observed in the time courses of pH change during culti-
vation with or without amorphous PETﬁlms (Fig. 2).
Degradation of amorphous PETﬁlms using engineered
C. thermocellum whole-cell biocatalyst
The engineered C. thermocellum strain DSM1313::pHK-
LCC was used to degrade a PET ﬁlm with an initial
weight of approximately 50 mg. The incubation lasted
for 14 days at 60°C. The time course of PET weight
loss was shown in Fig. 3A. Evident weight loss can be
monitored even after 2 days of incubation with a
roughly continuously increasing trend until 14 days to
achieve a maximum weight loss of approximately 62%
(/C2531 mg).
Culture supernatants removed at an interval of 2 days
were subjected to HPLC analysis to identify the soluble
UV-absorbing degradation products. Retention times of
standards, as well as a calibration curve for the HPLC
analysis, were prepared using commercially purchased
pure TPA (Fig. S2). As shown in Fig. 3B, both TPA and
MHET were detectable in the culture supernatant after
more than 2 days of cultivation. Based on the molecular
mass of a PET repeating unit of 192.2 g mol
/C01, the
weight loss curve shown in Fig. 3A was converted into a
dashed curve exhibiting the corresponding amount of
UV-absorbing products released (Fig. 2B, Table S1),
which is in a good quantitative agreement with the deter-
mined sum of TPA and MHET. Slightly lower sum values
of the HPLC determined UV-absorbing degradation prod-
ucts were expected due to the presence of a small frac-
tion of di-ethylene glycol in the PET samples used in
this study, as described previously (Wei,et al., 2019a).
The change of pH was also determined in the culture
supernatant with a rapid drop in theﬁrst 2 days from 7.4
to 6.5 followed by a slower continuous decrease to
approximately 6.2 after 14 days of cultivation (Fig. 3C).
Because the pH is a logarithmic measure of the present
concentration of H
3O+, this result showed a good agree-
ment with the determined TPA amounts as indicated by
a high correlation coefﬁcient of 0.914 (data not shown).
As shown in Fig. 3D, the intensity of the LCC band
was considered to reﬂect the speciﬁc activity because
an equal amount of 10 µg of total protein was loaded
in each lane. Similar LCC band intensities were
observed in the culture supernatants after 1, 2 and
4 days of incubation, and the 8-day band still showed
88.2% intensity of that obtained with the 1-day band.
Correspondingly, the volumetric esterolytic activity in
the culture supernatant increased along with the cell
growth in the ﬁrst day of incubation (Fig. 2), maintained
its maximum value (1.01 U ml
/C01) in the second day of
the incubation, and gradually decreased to 0.39 U ml/C01
after 8-day incubation which was 38.9% of the maximal
activity (Fig. 3C), although maintained LCC speci ﬁc
activity was detected in the degradation system until
8 days (Fig. 3D). The decreased LCC activity might be
caused by the thermal deactivation or released pro-
teases from the lysed cells after long-term incubation.
In line with the degradation performance, as shown in
Fig. 3A-B, which was visible from the second day of
the cultivation, the decreased esterolytic activity in the
culture supernatant might also be contributed by the
Fig. 2. Cell growth and pH ofC. thermocellum DSM1313::pHK-
LCC. Cultivation was carried out at 60°C under the agitation of
200 rpm for up to 32 h. The cell growth in the presence of PETﬁlm
and its degradation products at a constant concentration of 20 mM
was determined by monitoring the optical density of cultures at
600
nm (OD600). Dashed lines indicate the pH values determined
along with the cell growth with or without PETﬁlms. Error bars indi-
cate the standard deviations determined from at least triplicate mea-
surements.

Figure 4 exhibited drastic changes in the surface mor-
phology of PET ﬁlms after 5-day cultivation in the pres-
ence of the engineeredC. thermocellum strain. Cavities
and holes appeared primarily as an initial sign for the
surface erosion, similarly to the SEM captures of biologi-
cally degraded PET ﬁlms shown in previous studies
(Ronkvist, et al., 2009; Moog, et al., 2019; Wei, et al.,
2019a). Afterwards, the discrete erosion holes developed
to a continuous rugged surface with increasing amounts
of irregular crevices as a result of further enzymatic
hydrolysis catalysed by the secreted LCC in the culture
supernatant until the ﬁnal cultivation time of 14 days. In
contrast to the SEM captures shown by Yoshidaet al.
(2016), which indicated clearly the I. sakaiensis cell
attachment to the surface of PET ﬁlms, engineered
C. thermocellum cells did not attach to the PETﬁlm sur-
face (Fig. S3).
Discussion
The genetically engineeredC. thermocellum constructed
in this study is theﬁrst thermophilic strain so far able to
express a thermophilic hydrolase (LCC) at 60°C. LCC
was assumed to have a thermophilic habitat since it was
ﬁrst isolated from the core of a leaf-branch compost
(Sulaiman, et al., 2012). Its optimal temperature for PET
hydrolysis was subsequently proved to be 70°C (Sulai-
man, et al., 2014; Wei, et al., 2019b), which is in the
range of T
g for PET. At such elevated temperature, PET

polymer chains in the mobile amorphous fraction will
gain higher ﬂexibility and thus can be more easily
accessed for enzymatic hydrolysis (Wei, et al., 2019a;
Wei, et al., 2019b). Indeed, thermostable enzyme and
variants have shown markedly better degradation perfor-
mance on various PET materials in comparison with
their mesophilic or less thermostable counterparts (Ronk-
vist, et al., 2009; Then,et al., 2016; Wei,et al., 2019b).
These thermostable PET hydrolases were so far
reported to be recombinantly expressed inE. coli (Her-
rero Acero, et al., 2011; Roth,et al., 2014), Bacillus sub-
tilis (Wei, et al., 2019a), B. megaterium (Yang, et al.,
2007), and Pichia pastoris (Gamerith, et al. , 2017;
Shirke, et al., 2018). But none of the host species can
survive near the optimal temperature of the recombinant
enzyme in the PET hydrolysis. Here, the constructed
C. thermocellum recombinant strain allowed the simulta-
neous expression of LCC and biodegradation of PET at
60°C approaching its optimal condition. Although the
highest bacterial growth was achieved within the ﬁrst
day of incubation (Fig. 2) and the maximum hydrolytic
activity in culture supernatant maintained in the ﬁrst
2 days of incubation (Fig. 3C), a continuous release of
degradation products and a nearly constant increasing of

and dried by lyophilization before analysis. Cavities and holes appeared as an initial sign for the surface erosion. The number of holes
increased along with the incubation time. From day 8, cracks and crevices appeared and became larger as a result of extensive enzymatic
hydrolysis.

Thermophilic whole-cell degradation of PET 379
the weight loss of PETﬁlms was observed until 14 days
of incubation as a result of enzymatic hydrolysis
(Fig. 3A-B).
Compared to PET biodegradation processes using
free enzymes which generally require time-consuming
and cost-intensive protein puriﬁcations, whole-cell biocat-
alyst based degradation processes pro ﬁts from the
advantages of low-cost and simple operation process
(de Carvalho, 2017). Selected mesophilic microorgan-
isms with a preferential growing temperature at lower
than 40°C have been used for the whole-cell catalysed
degradation of various PET materials. For example,
I. sakaiensis which can intrinsically express an extracel-
lular PETase and an intracellular MHETase have com-
pletely degraded a small piece of amorphous PET
material (with a size of 15 x 20 x 0.2mm shown as
60 mg) following fed-batch incubation at 30 °C after
42 days by completely exchanging the medium every
week (Yoshida, et al., 2016). This degradation perfor-
mance was signiﬁcantly better than using the puri ﬁed
recombinant PETase expressed in E. coli revealed in
the same study, suggesting that the presence of a
helper enzyme (MHETase) provided by I. sakaiensis
whole-cell system is favourable for accelerating the plas-
tic degradation rate. Recently, an engineered diatom
P. tricornutum that can produce a mutant of the
I. sakaiensis PETase has been reported to degrade
industrially shredded PET particles at 21°C as evidenced
by monitoring the PET monomer feedstocks in the cul-
ture supernatant by HPLC analysis (Moog,et al., 2019).
However, the releasing rate of degradation products by
the engineered microalga was markedly lower than the
former I. sakaiensis whole-cell biocatalysis, possibly due
to the less favoured temperature for PETase (optimum
at 40°C) (Yoshida, et al., 2016), a lower biodegradability
of shredded PET particles, as well as the lack of helper
enzyme such as MHETase.
Due to the available genetic tools that have been
developed previously (Tripathi, et al., 2010, Olson and
Lynd, 2012, Mohr, et al., 2013, Olson, et al., 2015,
Zhang, et al., 2017), the anaerobic thermophileC. ther-
mocellum was chosen as the chassis to construct a ther-
mophilic whole-cell biocatalyst for PET degradation in
this study. As an anaerobic microorganism, the growth
of C. thermocellum requires no aeration and less agita-
tion compared to aerobic microorganisms (Ng, et al.,
1977) and thus minimizing the operation cost. Using the
previously described pHK plasmid (Mohr, et al., 2013),
the modiﬁed C. thermocellum DSM1313::pHK-LCC strain
was shown to express functional LCC, and consequently
served as a whole-cell biocatalyst for PET degradation
at 60°C. Over 60% weight loss with an amorphous PET
ﬁlm of 50 mg was detected after a 14-day incubation,
corresponding to a degradation rate of> 2.2 mg day
/C01.
This is notably higher than that of previously described
mesophilic whole-cell systems (e.g. > 1.4 mg day/C01 for
I. sakaiensis biocatalysis) (Yoshida, et al., 2016). Addi-
tionally, both reported mesophilic whole-cell biocatalyses
were carried out using fed-batch cultures with regular
supplementation of nutrients at <7 days intervals
(Yoshida, et al., 2016; Moog, et al., 2019). By contrast,
in this study, theC. thermocellum whole-cell biocatalyst
was batch-cultivated anaerobically at 60°C in a 10-ml
tube without supplementation of nutrients and exchange
of medium. The nutrients initially provided were shown
to be adequate to guarantee an optimal cell growth up to
20 h, while the pH value decreased signiﬁcantly from 7.4
to 6.4 after one-day cultivation (Fig. 2) although the
release of TPA was not yet detectable (Fig. 3B). This
decreased pH was an undesirable condition for the
growth of C. thermocellum (Whitham, et al. , 2018).
Under these circumstances, the PET degradation ef ﬁ-
ciency was considered to be solely dependent on the
LCC proteins produced in theﬁrst day but without further
replenishment from day 2 to day 14. Moreover, due to
the cell lysis gradually occurring from 20 h after inocula-
tion, the expressed LCC proteins might be degraded by
the potentially released proteases (Zverlov,et al., 2005,
Schwarz and Zverlov, 2006). The PET degradation efﬁ-
ciency of the C. thermocellum-based whole-cell biocata-
lyst could be thus further enhanced using a fed-batch
culture with pH control.
Although the whole-cell biocatalysis strategy has the
advantage of simultaneous enzyme production and plas-
tic degradation compared to free enzyme-based
approach, the degradation performance of the secretory
LCC-based whole-cell biocatalyst was still not compara-
ble to that of puriﬁed recombinant LCC at 70°C so far
(Sulaiman, et al., 2014; Wei, et al., 2019b). This might
be explained by the less favourable temperature, i.e.
60°C, which was selected to match the growth condi-
tions of C. thermocellum, although 70°C was considered
a preferred temperature for LCC activity and polymer
chain accessibility. Besides, cutinase-catalysed PET
degradation has been shown to be strongly dependent
on the surrounding buffer conditions and ion strengths
(Barth, et al. , 2015; Schmidt, et al. , 2016). Further
improvements would focus on developing LCC variants
with improved PET hydrolytic activity and stability under
present conditions to enhance PET plastic degradation
efﬁciency. We detected the accumulation of MHET dur-
ing the PET degradation, which can act as an inhibitor
for LCC in the PET depolymerization as described
before (Barth,et al., 2016). Analogously, the construction
of a multi-enzyme system in C. thermocellum able to
coexpress LCC and other helper enzymes (e.g. the ther-
mophilic MHET-hydrolysing carboxyl esterase fromTher-
mobiﬁda fusca) would mitigate the product inhibition and

consequently further stimulate the PET degradation. For
constructing an engineered cell factory able to solely
feeding on PET, the introduction of, e.g. TPA or EG
metabolic pathways will be also of interest and envis-
aged in future works.
In conclusion, our study provides a proof-of-concept for
the more efﬁcient PET degradation using an engineered
thermophilic whole-cell biocatalyst. This is for sure a
promising strategy for the development of effective biore-
mediation processes of PET waste. Moreover,C. thermo-
cellum is characterized by its ability to efﬁciently degrade
cellulose by producing the cellulosome, an extracellular
multi-protein complex (Bayer, et al., 2008; Artzi, et al.,
2017). It is known that the cellulosome system employs
assembly modules (cohesin and dockerin) of the scaf-
foldins and enzymes to form the functional enzyme com-
plex and can interact with the cellulosic substrate using
speciﬁc carbohydrate-binding modules (CBM) (Boraston,
et al., 2004; Bayer,et al., 2008; Artzi,et al., 2017). Com-
pared to free enzymes, the cellulosome system enjoys
the advantage of synergistic interactions due to enzyme
proximity (Hong, et al., 2014; Yoav,et al., 2017). Indeed,
fusion of a CBM has been shown to notably increase the
degradation performance of PET using a homologous
enzyme to LCC (Ribitsch, et al., 2013). Thus, it is a
promising strategy and also of high scientiﬁc interest to
develop cellulosome-like enzyme complexes containing
assembled PET degrading enzymes harbouring CBM to
promote the overall efﬁciency of PET degradation. As
thermophilic PET hydrolases can also effectively degrade
synthetic PETﬁbres (Wei,et al., 2016), theC. thermocel-
lum-based whole-cell biocatalysis strategy is expected to
demonstrate great potential for application in the bio-recy-
cling of mixed textile waste containing both cellulose and
polyester fractions.
Experimental procedures
Bacterial strains and cultivation
The bacterial strains used in this study are listed in
Table 1. Escherichia coli strains were cultivated aerobi-
cally at 37 °C in Luria – Bertani (LB) liquid medium by
shaking at 200 rpm or on solid LB plate with 1.5% agar.
30 lgm l
/C01 chloramphenicol was added for screening.
C. thermocellum strains were grown anaerobically at
60°C in a modiﬁed GS-2 medium (Cui,et al., 2012) with
5gl /C01 cellobiose. 3 lgm l/C01 thiamphenicol (Tm),
20 mM TPA, and 20 mM EG were supplemented to the
medium when necessary. Due to the poor solubility of
TPA, a stock solution was prepared by dissolving 3.32 g
of TPA in 100 ml of 450 mM NaOH and this was
adjusted to pH 6.5 afterwards. The pH value of the GS-2
medium was adjusted to 7.4 after the addition of TPA
and EG. The growth curve of the C. thermocellum
strains was determined by monitoring the cell optical
density at 600 nm (OD
600) every 2– 8h .
Plasmid construction
The recombinant plasmid pHK-LCC was constructed
using the E. coli DH5a strain as the host for LCC
expression in C. thermocellum DSM1313. The gene lcc
encoding the mature LCC protein (AEV21261.1 omitting
the signal peptide) was synthesized with an optimized
encoding sequence to adapt the codon usage ofC. ther-
mocellum (Genewiz, Suzhou, China) as shown in
Fig. S1. The lcc sequence, a signal peptide (SP)
sequence of a cellulase Cel48S, and a constitutive pro-
moter of gene Clo1313_2638 (P
2638) were ampliﬁed with
the primer set lccF/R, sigF/R and proF/R, respectively,
with the synthesized construct or genome ofC. thermo-
cellum DSM1313 as the template, and were ligated
together as a whole construct ‘P
2638-SP-lcc’ using a
seamless cloning kit (Vazyme Biotech, Beijing, China)
following the principle of overlap PCR. Then, the vector
pHK (Mohr, et al., 2013) linearized by reverse PCR
using the primer set pHKF/R was ligated with the con-
struct ‘P
2638-SP-lcc’ by overlap PCR (Fig. 1). The homol-
ogy regions for overlap PCR were obtained from the
designed primers (Table 2). The insertion of the con-
struct was veri ﬁed by PCR using the primer seqF/R
(Fig. 1) and sequencing. A universal PCR condition was
used for all ampliﬁcation experiments, including a pre-de-
naturation step at 96 °C for 3 min, 35 reaction cycles
(95°C for 0.5 min, 55 °C for 1.5 min, and 72 °C for
1 min), and a complete extention step at 72°C for 5 min.
The constructed plasmid was stored at/C020°C for further
experiment.

Electrotransformation and screening of C. thermocellum
The pHK-LCC plasmid was transformed into E. coli
BL21(DE3) to remove theDcm methylation (Guss, et al.,
2012), and transformed into C. thermocellum DSM1313
as previously described (Hong, et al., 2014). Brie ﬂy,
100 llo f C. thermocellum competent cells and 10llo f
plasmid DNA were added to a 0.1 cm electroporation
cuvette. A series of 40 square pulses were applied, each
with an amplitude of 1.5 kV and a duration of 50 ms at
500 ms intervals. Cells were then recovered for 24 h at
51°C in 4 ml of fresh GS-2 medium before screening on
solid medium containing Tm. After growing on GS-2
solid medium for 5-7 days, the obtained colonies were
screened by colony PCR using the primers seqF/R and
sequenced. The colonies veriﬁed as the target recombi-
nant strain DSM1313::pHK-LCC were cultivated in GS-2
medium and stored at– 80°C for further experiments.
Whole-cell-based degradation of amorphous PETﬁlms
The whole-cell-based degradation of PETﬁlms was per-
formed according to previously reported PETﬁlm degra-
dation experiments using free thermophilic enzymes as
summarized by ((Wei & Zimmermann 2017a,2017b;). In
detail, amorphous PET ﬁlm with a thickness of 250lm
was purchased from Goodfellow Ltd. (Bad Nauheim,
Germany, product number ES301445), and cut into
small pieces with a size of about 29 0.8 cm
2 and an
initial weight of 49.77 /C60.52 mg. PET ﬁlms were
soaked in 75% ethanol overnight at room temperature
and air-dried under a sterile atmosphere before being
added to autoclaved GS-2 medium containing 5 g l
/C01 of
cellobiose. Each 10 ml culture with one PETﬁlm in an
anaerobic tube was inoculated with 1% (v/v) DSM1313::
pHK-LCC preculture. The wild type strain DSM1313 was
used as a negative control. The cultivation and degrada-
tion experiments were performed at 60°C under the agi-
tation of 170 rpm until 14 days. At least three tubes
were randomly chosen and removed from the shaker
every 24 h to extract the residual PETﬁlm, which was
washed sequentially using 0.1% SDS and 70% alcohol.
The weight loss of the PETﬁlm was determined gravi-
metrically after drying the residual PETﬁlms at 60°C for
at least 12 h (Ronkvist, et al., 2009; Sulaiman, et al.,
2014; Wei, et al., 2019b). Selected culture supernatants
were subject to esterolytic activity determination (see
below), pH measurement, and HPLC analysis towards
the UV-absorbing degradation products.
Esterolytic activity analyses
To analyse the secretory expression of LCC, SDS poly-
acrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) was carried
out by loading 10µg cell lysate or supernatant protein in
each lane followed by an esterolytic activity staining
using the Fast-Red TR salt (Meilunbio, Guangzhou,
China) as a dye and 1-naphthyl acetate (Solarbio, Bei-
jing, China) as a substrate as described previously (Bil-
lig, et al., 2010). For selected samples, the intensity of
protein bands with hydrolytic activities was calculated
using the Quantity One software (version 4.6.2; Bio-Rad,
Shanghai, China) as previously described (Li, et al.,
2018). For comparison, polyacrylamide gels loaded by
the same supernatant samples were partly also stained
with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. Esterolytic activity deter-
mination was also performed using p-nitrophenyl buty-
rate (p-NPB) as substrate according to a previous report
(Billig, et al., 2010) One unit of esterolytic activity was
deﬁned as the amount of enzyme required to hydrolyse
1 lmol of p-NPB per minute. To obtain cell lysates, cells
were harvested by centrifugation at 7000 g for 2 min at
room temperature, resuspended in fresh GS-2 medium
and lysed by ultrasonication. The protein concentration
was quantiﬁed by the Bradford method (Bradford, 1976).
HPLC
The UV-absorbing hydrolysis products released from PET
ﬁlms in the culture supernatant were analysed similarly as
described before (Eberl,et al., 2009; Barth,et al., 2015).
A Waters 1525 HPLC system (Waters Cooperation, Mil-
ford, CT, USA) equipped with a UV detector (2998 PDA)
and an Agilent Eclipse XDB-C18 column (Agilent Cooper-
ation, Santa Clara, CA, USA) was used with a constant
ﬂow rate of 1 ml min
/C01. The HPLC gradient elution
method was used with acetonitrile and phosphate buffer
(200 mM, pH 6.0) as the mobile phase. During the pro-
cess of gradient elution, the proportion of acetonitrile in
the mobile phase increased from 10% to 50% within
21 min and then decreased from 50% to 10% within
1 min. The culture supernatant was diluted with the
mobile phase to obtain results within the calibration range

followed by centrifugation to remove any precipitation.
The injection volume was 10µl. Separated products were
detected at a wavelength of 242 nm. Standard curves of
TPA were prepared in a concentration range from 0.05 to
1 mM using the TPA stock solution prepared as described
above.
Scanning electron microscopy
The surface morphology of PET samples was deter-
mined by SEM using aﬁeld emission scanning electron
microscope (S-4800; Hitachi, Tokyo, Japan) according to
a previously reported method (Hong, et al., 2014). The
PET ﬁlms were extensively washed with distilled water
and dried by lyophilization unless stated otherwise.

Fig. S1. Analysis of the lcc sequences. AEV21261.1_ma-
ture is the published LCC sequence omitting the signal
peptide (MDGVLWRVRTAALMAALLALAAWALVWASPS-
VEAQ). The sequence was optimized to adapt the codon
usage of C. thermocellum. Both sequences encoded the
same amino acid sequences except for the change of the
ﬁrst amino acid from Ser to Met

HPLC analysis of commercially purchased pure TPA (upper
panel) and PET hydrolysates of C. thermocellum
DSM1313::pHK-LCC (lower panel) before and after 14-day
incubation. The peak with the retention time of 2.3 min
refers to TPA. The peak with a longer retention time com-
pared to TPA may be the intermediate MHET (Yoshida,
et al., 2016, Salvador, et al., 2019).
Fig. S3. SEM analysis of PET ﬁlms after 3-day incubation
with the C. thermocellum whole-cell biocatalyst at 60 °C.
The PET ﬁlms were air-dried without washing. Medium
residuals were detected on the surface of theﬁlms but no
bioﬁlm formation was observed.
