Polyethylene terephthalate (PET), the most abundantly produced polyester plastic, can be
depolymerized by theIdeonella sakaiensisPETase enzyme. Based on multiple PETase crystal
structures, the reaction has been proposed to proceed via a two-step serine hydrolase mechanism
mediated by a serine-histidine-aspartate catalytic triad. To elucidate the multi-step PETase catalytic
mechanism, we use transition path sampling and likelihood maximization to identify optimal reaction
coordinates for the PETase enzyme. We predict that deacylation is likely rate-limiting, and the reaction
coordinates for both steps include elements describing nucleophilic attack, ester bond cleavage, and
the “moving-histidine” mechanism. Weﬁnd that theﬂexibility of Trp185 promotes the reaction,
providing an explanation for decreased activity observed in mutations that restrict Trp185 motion.
Overall, this study uses unbiased computational approaches to reveal the detailed reaction
mechanism necessary for further engineering of an important class of enzymes for plastics
bioconversion.
In 2016, Yoshida et al. reported the discovery of a soil bacterium,Ideonella
sakaiensis201-F61, that secretes a two-enzyme system for the extracellular
depolymerization of poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET). PET is the most
prevalent polyester manufactured today and a major plastic pollutant in the
environment. In the two-enzyme system, PETase acts directly on the solid
PET plastic to liberate bis-hydroxyethyl terephthalate (BHET) and mono-
hydroxyethyl terephthalate (MHET), wherein MHET is further cleaved into
ethylene glycol and terephthalic acid by the MHETase enzyme, providing
substrates forI. sakaiensiscatabolism
1–4. IsPETase is one of several microbial
polyester hydrolases with predicted5,6 and demonstrated5–9 ability to depo-
lymerize PET. Several successful engineering efforts of PETase, MHETase,
and related serine hydrolases have resulted from a combination of rational
engineering, directed evolution, and advanced computational
strategies
3,4,10–17, and some of these have demonstrated that increased
enzyme melting temperature can lead to improved PET hydrolysis
activity
11,14,15,18.
The active site of PETase (Fig.1) clearly indicates that it is a serine
hydrolase, with the canonical serine-histidine-aspartate (or glutamate in
some cases) catalytic triad, suggesting that PETase follows a two-step acy-
lation and deacylation mechanism
19,20. Ligand-bound crystal structures and
docking results from PETase structural studies have guided speculation
about the reaction mechanism, with conﬂicting hypotheses regarding the
interaction between Trp185 and the substrate (numbering based on the
structure published by Austin et al.)
10. Reported crystal structures assign the
side chain of Trp185 to three different conformations with molecular
dynamics (MD) simulations showing that Trp185 is highlyﬂexible
10,21,22.
Flexible docking results from Austin et al. suggest that Trp185 adopts
conformations different than those found in the crystal structures,ﬁnding a
parallel-displacedπ–π interaction between PET and Trp185 in wild-type
PETase, and an edge-to-faceπ–π interaction (see Wheeler and Bloom
23 for
examples) in a double-mutant PETase10,23. Joo et al. reported covalent
docking results wherein PET and Trp185 are oriented in what appears to be
a parallel-displacedπ–π interaction24. A hypothesis that emerged from Guo
and coworkers based on bound substrate and product analogs is that PET
adopts an edge-to-face (described as T-shaped)π–π interaction with Trp185
for the reaction
21,25. Following the reaction, the authors propose that the
product rotates to adopt a parallel-displaced (described as face-to-face)π–π
interaction with Trp185 that aids the leaving group’s departure from the
active site.
In serine hydrolases, more broadly, conﬂicting hypotheses have been
presented regarding the mechanism of proton transfer via the histidine of
the catalytic triad19,26–28. An NMR study of subtilisin suggested that the

reaction used a“ﬂipping histidine” mechanism (Fig. S1), wherein Nε2 of
histidine accepts a proton from the nucleophile, followedby a 180° rotation
of the imidazole ring and subsequent delivery of the proton from the Nδ1
position to the leaving group29. Other studies, however, have found evidence
of a“moving histidine” mechanism (Fig. S1), where the side chain of the
histidine uses a lateral translational motion to“shuttle”the proton from the
nucleophile to the leaving group via Nε2
27. The role of this histidine has been
proposed to include the interaction with the aspartate of the catalytic triad,
speciﬁcally in characterizing the hydrogen bond between the two. It has
been proposed that the reaction could use a double-proton transfer
mechanism in a“charge-relay” (Fig. S1), wherein aspartate abstracts a
proton from histidine followed by histidine abstracting a proton from the
catalytic serine
19,27. While some studies have found evidence of the double-
proton transfer, other studies have found evidence against the mechanism19.
QM/MM computational studies have undertaken to address some of these
questions
30–36 but have presented conﬂicting results, including the free
energy barriers, which is the rate-limiting step, and whether tetrahedral
geometries along the reaction pathway are metastable intermediates or
transition states, leaving open questions regarding the PETase reaction
mechanism.
In light of the open questions described above related to PETase
action and generally in serine hydrolase mechanisms, and further to
provide an accurate fundamental mechanistic understanding for future
enzyme engineering efforts, here we seek to elucidate the detailed PETase
reaction mechanism using unbiased quantum mechanical/molecular
mechanical (QM/MM) MD simulations
37. Speciﬁcally, we use transition
path sampling (TPS) and inertial likelihood maximization (iLMax) to
determine optimal mechanistic descriptions of the acylation and dea-
cylation reactions
38–40. TPS was employed as it requires no a priori
knowledge of the reaction mechanism, and iLMax allows for the
extraction of complex reaction coordinates (RCs) with high transmission
coefﬁcients that are capable of capturing subtleties of the reaction
mechanism that may not be revealed by preconstructed RCs
38,40,41. The
resulting RCs for each reaction step were validated as described below
and subsequently used to compute the free energies and rate constants of
the acylation and deacylation steps, enabling prediction of the rate-
limiting step, free of bias from a pre-assumed reaction coordinate. These
simulations also allow monitoring of interactions within the catalytic
triad and the Trp185 conformation along the reaction steps, to inter-
rogate key mechanistic questions raised from structural studies. From
these simulations, we predict that PETase employs the moving histidine
mechanism, and we ﬁnd no evidence of proton transfer between the
aspartate and histidine of the catalytic triad. Importantly, the simulations
indicate that the motions of Trp185 facilitate catalysis and provide a
likely molecular rationale for why mutations, such as S214H (Ser185 in
the study by Guo and coworkers), restrict the motion of Trp185, decrease
PETase activity
21,25.
Results
Elucidating the acylation reaction coordinate and estimation of
reaction rate
To set up a PETase system for QM/MM simulations, we began with a
Michaelis complex of a hydroxyethyl-capped PET dimer bound to PETase
from our prior docking simulations
10. The QM/MM equilibrated Michaelis
complex used for the TPS simulations is shown in Fig.1, with the catalytic
triad, Ser160, His237, and Asp206, highlighted. The nucleophilic Ser160 is
activated by catalytic residues His237 and Asp206 and is oriented to attack
one of the central carboxyl carbons in between the two aromatic rings of the
PET dimer. The oxyanion hole, comprising the backbone amines of Met161
and Tyr87, forms a hydrogen bond to the carboxyl oxygen of PET and
provides stabilization for charge accumulation during the reaction. The
Trp185 and Trp159 residues thatﬂank the catalytic triad aid in positioning
the PET ligand for attack via stabilizing aromatic interactions. Following
QM/MM equilibration with DFTB3
42, a putative transition state structure
was identiﬁed using theﬁnd_tsprocedure of ATESA, an automated aimless
shooting workﬂow43. Aimless shooting (AS) was then used to generate an
ensemble of 13,750 unbiased trajectories, of which approximately 40.5%
were reactive (i.e., connected the reactant and product states)40.
Through inspection of the reactive AS trajectories, illustrated in
Fig.2A-C, the reaction scheme proceeds through the following sequence: (1)
from the reactant state, Ser160 transfers a proton to His237 and attacks the
carboxyl carbon of the PET dimer; (2) the PET carboxyl carbon adopts a
tetrahedral TS conﬁguration with His237 at the midpoint of the proton
shuttle; and (3) the TS collapses, cleaving the scissile ester bond, with the
BHET leaving group accepting the proton from His237. The completion of
this reaction step leaves the system in the acyl-enzyme intermediate (AEI)
state (i.e., the product state of acylation) with a PET fragment (i.e., MHET)
bonded to PETase via Ser160.
The ensemble of unbiased trajectories from AS enables the extraction of
the acylation RC
38. The iLMax method was used to extract RCs from the AS
ensemble (see the section“Methods”for more details) as a linear combination
of collective variables (CVs)41. In total, 299 CVs (automatically selected by
ATESA43 with a cutoff distance of 5 Å from each reactive atom) were screened

atoms. ATESA was used to select an optimized linear combination of CVs

caption. A high-quality RC should exhibit apB histogram peaked near 0.5,
demonstrating that trajectories initiated from the putative TS region,
according to the RC, have a ~50% probability of evolving to either reactants or
products
40,44.T h epB histogram for the acylation RC, which shows results
from 10 simulations each for the 208AS points with RC values nearest to 0
(i.e., the predicted transition state), has a near-ideal shape, as shown
in Fig.2D.
The acylation RC includes contributions from differences in distances
that are critical to the reaction, namely those associatedwith bond breaking
and forming during nucleophilic attack, scissile ester cleavage, and proton
transfer. In addition, the RC accounts for the angle formed between the
proton that transfers from Ser160 to the BHET product, the oxygen to which
it bonds in the product state, and the carbon to which that oxygen is bound.
This angle increases slightly from roughly 2.1 to 2.2 radians during the
transfer of the proton to His237 and then decreases to the equilibrium value
of roughly 1.8 radians when the proton transfer is complete. The bond-
breaking and forming distances change in a concerted fashion (Fig.2F).
Note that RC values are dimensionless,and the scale is arbitrary. By con-
vention, negative values denote progress toward the reactant and positive
toward the product.
The free energy proﬁle of the acylation reaction step was measured
using umbrella sampling along the discovered RC (Fig.3). Although
tracking the CVs that constitute the RC suggests a single concerted step, the
free energy proﬁle reveals two additional features: an initial shoulder for
transfer of the proton from Ser160 toHis237, and a second shoulder on the
products side as the proton is transferred from His237 to the reaction

stabilizing proton transfer during the acylation step. The reactiveﬂux cor-
relation function was computed for the acylation RC along this path,
yielding the observed value of 1.00 for the transmission coefﬁcient (κ)
(Fig.2E)
45–47. Using the Eyring equation with the free energy of the acylation
TS (16.1 ± 0.6 kcal/mol), the transmission coefﬁcient, and 310 K system
temperature, the rate constant for the acylation step was estimated to be
k = 28.8 ± 17.9 s

located in the active site was incorporated into the QM region and the
system was QM/MM equilibrated once more with DFTB3

was then subjected to the same ATESAﬁnd_ts procedure as described
for acylation to locate a putative TS region43. AS was again used to

generate an ensemble of 19,000 unbiased trajectories, of which
approximately 39.6% were reactive.
Through inspection of the reactive AS trajectories, illustrated in Fig.4,
the deacylation reaction scheme proceeds through the following steps: (1)
from the AEI state, the catalytic water transfers a proton to His237 and attacks
the carboxyl carbon of the acylated PET fragment; (2) the PET carboxyl
carbon adopts a tetrahedral TS conﬁguration with His237 at the midpoint of
the proton shuttle; and (3) the TS collapses, cleaving the scissile ester bond
between MHET and Ser160, with Ser160 accepting the proton from His237.
The completion of this reaction leaves the system in the product state, with
Ser160 regenerated and MHET free to leave the active site.
A total of 182 CVs were screened using iLMax and the trajectory
ensemble from AS in the same way as described above for the acylation
reaction. As in the acylation step, the optimized RC for the deacylation
reaction prominently features the differences between key distances.
The selected deacylation RC was 1 :55 /C0 1:42 /C3 CV1 þ 1:39/C3
CV2 /C0 0:590 /C3 CV3, based on the CV deﬁnitions shown in Fig.4Fa n d

dating the RC found by iLM.

proﬁle has a shoulder on the left side of the transition state for the transfer of
the proton from the attacking water to His237, while the transition state
occurs when the water attacks the MHET carbon. The reactiveﬂux corre-
lation function was computed for the deacylation RC along this path, yielding
the observed value of 0.89 for the transmission coefﬁcient (κ)( F i g .4E)
45–47.
Using the Eyring equation with the free energy of the deacylation TS, the
transmission coefﬁcient, and 310 K system temperature, the rate constant for
the deacylation step was estimated to bek = 0.82 ± 0.10 s

is thus lower than that of the acylation step by about a factor of 35, conﬁrming
that deacylation is the rate-limiting step in the overall reaction.
Investigating the Trp185 conformational change
During QM/MM-based MD equilibration of the AEI to prepare the system
for the deacylation reaction, the Trp185 residue spontaneously underwent a
conformational change corresponding to the C-Cα-Cβ-Cγ dihedral angle
(χ1C) changing from−60° to+60°. We observed two distinct stable con-
formations at the AEI state of the acylation reaction that correspond to the
two conformations of Trp185. Based on these observations, we hypothe-
sized that the Trp185 conformational change occurs after the acylation step,
potentially altering the conformation of the AEI state for deacylation and
lowering the free energy of the AEI state.
To investigate this hypothesis, we performed umbrella sampling
simulations along the Trp185χ
1C dihedral in both the product and reactant
states of the acylation and deacylation reactions. The resulting free energy
proﬁles are shown in Fig.6. The reactant state occupying the energy basin on
the left side of the acylation step (Fig.6A) corresponds to the binding pose in
the prior docking work from which this study was initiated10.W eo b s e r v ea
very small preference (0.3 ± 0.1 kcal/mol) for the positive-angle state in the
products state relative to the reactant state for the acylation reaction, as well
as a small decrease in the barrier (roughly 0.4 kcal/mol) to transitions
between the two stable conformations.
In contrast, the conﬁg u r a t i o no ft h ea c t i v es i t ef o rt h ed e a c y l a t i o n
step very strongly favors the basinon the right (positive values of the
Trp185 dihedral) in both the reactant and product steps (Fig.6B). After
the deacylation reaction takes place, much of this preference is lost
compared to the reactants state (a change of 5.0 ± 0.1 kcal/mol), likely
owing to the release of the MHET product from Ser160 and its cor-
respondingly increased ﬂexibility. The differential preferences we
observe in the Trp185χ
1C dihedral before and after the deacylation
reaction may help facilitate product release and inhibit backward
reaction progress. Classical MD simulations of the product state were
used to monitor the distance between MHET and the Trp185 and
Tyr87 residues, as well as the side chain dihedrals of Trp185. As shown
in Fig. S2, MHET leaves the active site within 20 ns in 4 of the 10
simulations. Triplicate simulations 200 ns in length of the apo state of
PETase from prior work
10 were analyzed to examine whether the reset
of Trp185 χ1C to the −60° basin would occur spontaneously in the
absence of any substrate or product. This analysis indicates that the
Trp185 χ
1C dihedral stays in the +60° basin during apo simula-
tion (Fig. S3).

Investigating the interactions between Asp206 and His237 of the
catalytic triad
Serine hydrolases have been hypothesized to utilize a double-proton transfer
mechanism wherein an aspartic acid abstracts a proton from a histidine,
allowing histidine to act as a stronger base toward deprotonating the cata-
lytic serine
19,27. The umbrella sampling trajectories were reused to investigate
the role of Asp206 and His237 in thePETase mechanism. We measured the
distances between the proton and His237 Nδ1 and the nearby Asp206
carboxylate O, respectively, as a function of each reaction coordinate. As
shown in Fig. S4, Asp206 and His237 maintain a hydrogen bond throughout
both reaction steps, and His237 Nδ1 retains the proton throughout both
reaction steps, with the distance only ve r ys l i g h t l ys t r e t c h i n gd u r i n gr e g i o n s
of each reaction step where another proton is bound to His237’so t h e r
nitrogen (Nε2). Based on theseﬁndings, we predict that PETase does not
utilize the double-proton transfer mechanism.
The nature of how His237 transfers the proton from the nucleophile to
the leaving group is inherently tied to the interactions with Asp206, wherein
the ﬂipping histidine mechanism would require breaking the hydrogen
bond between the two, but not so for the moving histidine mechanism19,26–28.
As depicted in Figs.2 and 4 for the acylation and deacylation reactions,
respectively, a single proton is transferred via His237 Nε2 between the
nucleophile and leaving groups. Additionally, we measured the side chain
dihedrals C-C
α-Cβ-Cγ and Cα-Cβ-Cγ-Nδ1 of His237 (Fig. S5) and found that
the dihedrals are somewhatﬂexible to allow for the shuttling motion of
His237 in the proton transfer. However, neither dihedral changes in such a
way to suggest that His237ﬂips, which, taken collectively with the afore-
mentioned hydrogen bonding results, clarify that PETase uses the moving
histidine mechanism for proton transfer.
Examining the oxyanion hole and charge stabilization
Via hydrogen bonding interactions with their backbone amines, the oxya-
nion hole residues Met161 and Tyr87have been hypothesized to provide
stabilization of charge buildup on the PET carbonyl oxygen10,21,22,24.T h e
umbrella sampling simulations were again used to measure the distances
from the hydrogens on the backbone nitrogen atoms of Met161 and Tyr87
to the carbonyl oxygen of PET along the RC. As shown in Fig. S6, Tyr87’s
backbone amine maintains a hydrogen bond with PET throughout both
reaction steps, including the AEI state. Met161’s backbone amine is not
hydrogen bonded to PET until Ser160 attacks, at which point the PET
carbonyl oxygen moves fully into the oxyanion hole and within the
hydrogen bonding distance of Met161’sb a c k b o n ea m i n e .T h i sh y d r o g e n
bonding interaction is maintained until the product state of deacylation.
Additionally, we extracted the Mulliken charges at the reactant, product,
and transition states of both reaction steps to characterize the charge
buildup on the key heavy atoms. As shown in Fig. S7, the carbonyl oxygen of
PET initially adopts a charge of roughly−0.7 in both steps, building to−0.9

at the TS of the acylation step. The charge then returns to−0.7 at the AEI
and product states for the acylation and deacylation steps, respectively.
However, in the transition state of the deacylation step, there is no observed
charge buildup on this oxygen, and in fact, the charge on the carbonyl
oxygen approaches−0.6. This difference between the charges in the tran-
sition states is compensated by the relatively strong negative charge localized
on the attacking water oxygen in the deacylation step, compared to the
corresponding scissile oxygen in the acylation step, which accumulates
relatively little charge during the acylation reaction.
Revealing the PET and aromatic residue interactions
Guo and coworkers hypothesized that the aromatic ring of PET interacts
through an edge-to-faceπ-π interaction with Trp185 during the reaction,
changing to a parallel-displacedπ–π interaction at the product state to aid
the release of the leaving group
21,25. To test this hypothesis, we measured the
dihedral angle and distances between the planes of aromatic residues and
PET in the active site. As depicted in Figs. S8 and S9, the aromatic rings of
PET and Trp185 maintain angles and distances consistent with an edge-to-
face π-π interaction for the entirety of the acylation step
48. For the deacy-
lation step, the distance between Trp185 and PET increases slightly, and the
angle between them becomes appropriate for a parallel-displacedπ–π
interaction.
A ss h o w ni nF i g .7, Trp185 interacts with PET though both edge-to-
face and T-shapedπ–π interactions at different steps, with the distances
from Tyr87 and Trp185 to PET more equally spaced after the Trp185
conformational change, and Tyr87 interacting with PET through a parallel-
displaced π–π interaction
48. These residues compose an aromatic clamp
observed in PET-degrading cutinases,which may destabilize the substrate,
though the effect is not completely understood22,49.H e r ew eﬁnd that the
aromatic stabilization of PET for the acylation step has a little-to-no pre-
ference between the Trp185−60° and+60° basins (Fig.3). However, for the
deacylation step, the change in the aromatic interactions between Tyr87,
Trp185, and PET in the Trp185χ
1C +60° basin appears strongly favorable
(Fig. 6B). Overall, these observations are consistent with what Guo and
coworkers hypothesized, with the caveat that the parallel-displacedπ-π
interaction is favored during the deacylation reaction step (as opposed to
only during product release).
Tracking the geometry of the carboxyl carbon
Conﬂicting hypotheses have been previously presented with regard to
whether the tetrahedral conﬁguration belongs to a metastable intermediate
or a TS in serine hydrolases19,27.W eﬁnd that the carboxyl carbon of the PET
ester undergoes a hybridization state change fromsp2 to sp3 at the TS and
then back tosp2 for both reaction steps. To characterize this hybridization,

we measured the improper dihedral angles of the carboxyl carbon using the
same set of umbrella sampling trajectories as described above. The planarity
for each transition state is described by two improper dihedrals. For acy-
lation, the ﬁrst three atoms for each of these impropers were the PET
carboxyl carbon (taken as the central atom), the carboxyl oxygen, and the
carbon that connects to the adjacent aromatic ring. The fourth atom was
either Ser160 O
γ or the scissile oxygen of the PET ester. For deacylation, the
PET ether oxygen is replaced by the catalytic water oxygen. A planarsp2
conﬁguration corresponds to an improper dihedral near 0°, while an ideal
tetrahedralsp3 conﬁguration, as measured using the methyl group of alanine
residues, corresponds to absolute values of 30–35°. As shown in Fig. S10, the
substrate starts in a planar conﬁguration with the ether oxygen and changes
to a tetrahedral conﬁguration as it reaches the acylation TS. Correspond-
ingly, the new bond forming via the Ser160 nucleophilic attack also takes on
a tetrahedral conﬁguration at the TS. Neither of these improper dihedral
angles appears to plateau along the RC, but instead, they simultaneously
change complementarily to one another along the RC, with the acylation
reaction completing with the acylated ester formed via Ser160 in a planar
conﬁguration. A nearly identical scenario occurs for the deacylation reac-
tion. Thus, in both reaction steps, the tetrahedral conﬁguration is predicted
to correspond to the TS and not a metastable intermediate.
Discussion
The mechanism of the two-step PETase reaction was investigated using
QM/MM transition path sampling, allowing us to reveal mechanistic details
of the reaction without assuming an RCor having a priori knowledge of the
TS. We used thepB histogram test to validate the RCs obtainedap o s t e r i o r i
via iLMax,ﬁnding that a three-component RC is adequate to describe both
reaction steps. OurpB histogramsﬁt an ideal Gaussian distribution centered
on 0.5, and exceptionally high transmission coefﬁcients demonstrate the
advantages of iLMax compared to usingthe original likelihood maximiza-
tion method in this case50–52. The results we have obtained help answer
mechanistic questions posited by studies of other serine hydrolases; parti-
cularly the mechanism of proton transfer via His237, hydrogen bonding and
charge stabilization in the oxyanion hole, and hydrogen bonding between
His237 and Asp206
19,27. Prior theoretical studies have found that the tet-
rahedral conﬁguration in the acylation and deacylation reactions can cor-
respond to TS or metastable intermediates, leading to either one or more
dominant energetic barriers per reaction step53–67. We observe a single TS for
each reaction step, coinciding with the tetrahedral conﬁguration, which
further supports that both the acylation and deacylation steps proceed in a
concerted fashion in the PETase reaction.
Several computational studies have been undertaken to elucidate the
mechanism and energetics of ester hydrolysis inIsPETase
30–36. For example,
Jerves et al. computed free energy barriers via QM/MM umbrella sampling
as a function of the difference in distances for forming and breaking carbon-
oxygen bonds, concluding that both acylation and deacylation proceed via a
concerted mechanism (without a metastable tetrahedral intermediate), and
that acylation is rate-limiting
35. Boneta et al. follow a similar approach but
also include breaking and forming bonds that incorporate the proton
transfer, computing free energy surfaces that indicate the existence of a
metastable tetrahedral intermediate for both acylation and deacylation, in
accordance with the four-step mechanism they assume
34. Other studies
utilize more static calculations, such as ONIOM QM/MM, to calculate
reaction energetics for geometries predicted to be part of the reaction
pathway
30–33. A common feature in each of these studies is that the reaction
mechanism is assumed a priori, and subsequent energy calculations are
performed along an assumed, unveriﬁed reaction coordinate. However,
accurate determination of the reaction mechanism requires that the
mechanism (in the context of reaction rate theory, the “reaction
coordinate”
68,69)b ea no u t p u to ft h es i m u l a t i o n sr a t h e rt h a na ni n p u t .T h e
approach of Garcia-Meseguer et al., in their comparison ofIsPETase and
FAST-PETase13 improves on this approach by utilizing the adaptive string
method, allowing the underlying free energy surface to deﬁne the minimum
free energy path connecting reactants and products, yet the reaction
coordinate discovered in this manner still lacks the same degree of
mechanistic insight and remains unveriﬁed36. Computing energetics along
unveriﬁed reaction coordinates risks missing key features of the free energy
surface of the reaction40, and therefore cannot be assumed to accurately
resolve the important mechanistic questions raised above, such as double
proton transfer, moving vs.ﬂipping histidine, whether tetrahedral geome-
tries are metastable intermediates or unstable transition states, etc. Finally,
although some of these studies observed the wobbliness of Trp185, they did
not account for the motion of Trp185 between reaction steps, which we have
shown to be crucially important.
Another common feature of prior simulation work is that the
determination of the rate-limiting step is based on activation energies
without consideration of kinetic prefactors. Our sampling along the
unbiased and veriﬁed RCs discovered with transition path sampling
ﬁnds similar activation barriers of 16.1 and 18.2 kcal/mol for acylation
and deacylation steps, respectively, and these RCs then provide for
predictions of rate constants based on observed transmission coefﬁ-
cients from unbiased simulations. Likely because of different assumed
reaction mechanisms, prior computational work has yielded differing
results on the rate-limiting step. Our results indicate that deacylation is
rate-limiting with a reaction rate constant estimated as
k = 0.82 ± 0.10 s
−1. These results for the reaction rate constant are in
good agreement with the experiment. For example, Erickson et al. uti-
lized the Michaelis-Menten relationship to derive a value of
k
cat = 1.5 ± 0.5 and 0.8 ± 0.0 s−1 for amorphous PETﬁlm and crystalline
PET powder, respectively, at 30 °C70. Several other relevant kinetics
studies ofIsPETase and related enzymes have been performed at higher
temperatures71–73.
Our investigation of the PETase reaction mechanism utilized a PET
dimer as a substrate analog. PETase has been shown to act on a PET surface,

emphasize that there could be differences in chain conformation when
bound to a full PET chain and not just a fragment and that the sampled
conformations will also be dependent on temperature
76 and potentially on
pretreatment of the PET sample77. In addition, enzymes often affect the
energetics of reactions they catalyze by altering the distribution of chain
conformations in the active site of an enzyme to be different from that in
solution, melt, or crystal context. Open questions also remain regarding
whether PETase cleaves PET at the chain ends in an exo-fashion or internal
chains central to the polymer in an endo-fashion
10, although recent evidence
indicated that a homologousThermobiﬁda fuscacutinase can act via either
mode of action, depending on whether the PET substrate is amorphous and
mobile (facilitating exo-action), rigid amorphous, or crystalline (with the
latter two being mainly degraded by endo-type cuts)
78. Interestingly, the
synergistic MHETase enzyme has also recently been shown to act as an exo-
PETase, degrading PET from chain ends17. Inherent to these questions is

whether PETase processes along a chain or unbinds and rebinds to perform
the next reaction

A double mutant (S238F/W159H) PETase was generated in prior work
to convert the PETase active site into that resembling most cutinases,
showing enhanced performance over the wild type towards degrading PET
and poly(ethylene furanoate) (PEF)

show that binding PET/PEF into the wild type and double mutant PETases

highly ﬂexible residue facilitates the reaction via a reorientation between
reaction steps, providing an explanation for the experimentally observed
decrease in activity seen in mutations that hinder Trp185 motion, such as
S214H
21,25. Overlaying the reported crystal structures of I. sakaiensis
PETases with other PET-degrading and cutinase-like hydrolases (Fig.8)
clearly shows steric clashing between some conformations of Trp185 in the
IsPETase structures with His214 in the other hydrolases (Fig.8C). Trp185 in
this study adopts conformations differing from most of the reported crystal
structures ofIsPETase (Fig.8D), with the notable exception of chain C in
work from Fecker et al., which shows Trp185 in the same conformation we
ﬁnd in theχ
1C +60° basin22. A second assignment of the Trp185 position of
PETase was found in chain C from Fecker et al. and in theapo R103G/

match theχ

the reaction in the conformation seen in many of the crystal structures. The
exact nature of how or if the Trp185χ1C dihedral resets to the−60° con-
formation remains an open question. Our study has focused on a small
oligomer of PET and the enzyme in solution, where the reset may be a
matter of an inducedﬁt effect from a new PET substrate binding in the active
site; however, the entirety of the Trp185 motion may be different at the
interface of solid PET. Future work withIsPETase can provide additional
details regarding the role of Trp185 in other conformations during the
reaction.
The active sites ofIsPETase and other PET-degrading and cutinase-like
hydrolases bear a striking resemblance, with the catalytic triad, Trp185, and
oxyanion residues conserved between these structures. Notable mutations
such as S238F and W159H, which resemble many of the cutinase active sites,
have been shown to increase the performance ofIsPETase

similarity between theIsPETase and other hydrolase crystal structures
(Fig. 8), and the aforementioned mutations, it is likely that the mechanistic
insights gained from this study can be applied to the function of PET
hydrolysis in these other enzymes.
Conclusion
Polyester hydrolases derived from microbes hold promise in the biocatalytic
deconstruction of PET7, though several signiﬁcant challenges remain to
their industrial utilization8,9,81. Rational engineering efforts will likely be
aided by an enhanced understanding of the hydrolytic mechanism. Here we
have studied the PETase reaction mechanism via QM/MM simulations

show that the moving histidine mechanism is utilized for proton transfer,
and Asp206 supports His237 through hydrogen bonding. We have shown
that hydrogen bonding in the oxyanion hole stabilizes the PET carboxyl
oxygen, with the hydrogen bonds maintained during the AEI state, and that
Trp185 and Tyr87 provideπ-π stabilization to the PET substrate. Addi-
tionally, we have shown that the reorientation of the Trp185 residue
between reaction steps facilitates the reaction and that deacylation is the
rate-limiting reactive step compared to acylation by a small margin.
PETase is one of many enzymes in the serine hydrolase family,
including several that have been demonstrated to hydrolyze PET
1,5–9,82–85,
and the reaction mechanism we have studied here can likely be extended to
other enzymes in the family, particularly other PET-degrading cutinases like
the ones shown in Fig.8. The position of the Trp residues analogous to
IsPETase Trp185 in other PET-degrading cutinases is highly conserved.
However, in light of theﬁndings presented here, it may be of interest to
protein engineering efforts to study the effect of mutations that modulate the
ﬂexibility of this residue in other cutinases.
Methods
System preparation
A PETase structure bound to a hydroxyethyl-capped PET tetramer from
prior docking work was taken as an initial starting structure10.T h eP E T
tetramer was reduced to a hydroxyethyl-capped PET dimer by deleting two
PET units furthest from the PETase active site, with the ester bond to be
cleaved near the center of the dimer. This was done to eliminate any need for
QM/MM link atoms in the PET. PET dimer parameters for the CHARMM
General Force Field (CGenFF) were obtained from MATCH via the
CHARMMing web interface
86–88. PROPKA 3.1 was used to determine the
protonation state of titratable residues for PETase using a pH of 7.089,90.T w o
disulﬁde bonds were formed by patching Cys203 to Cys239 and Cys273 to
Cys289. The system was solvated witha 15 Å buffer of TIP3 waters in a cubic
box (~80 Å edge lengths) with a NaCl concentration of 0.10 M and made
electrostatically neutral with excess chloride ions. The resulting system size
was composed of 53,816 atoms.
The system was equilibrated classically in CHARMM version c43 using
the CHARMM36 protein forceﬁeld for the protein, CGenFF for the ligand,
and the TIP3 water model
86,91,92. The Langevin thermostat and barostat were
utilized with the temperature set to 310 K and pressure set to 1.0 atm,
respectively. SHAKE was used to constrain bond lengths involving hydro-
gen, and periodic boundary conditions were used
93. A 12 Å cutoff radius was
used for short-range interactions, and particle-mesh Ewald (PME) was used
for long-range electrostatic interactions
94. Classical simulations utilized a
2 fs timestep and Leapfrog Verlet integration. The system equilibration was
performed in two steps: (1) The protein–ligand complex was heldﬁxed and
energy minimized for 500 steps using the adopted basis Newton–Raphson
(ABNR) method. This was followed by 1 ns of classical simulation to allow
waters and ions to relax about the protein–ligand complex. (2) The
protein–ligand complex was released, and the entire system energy was
minimized with 500 steps of ABNR minimization. This was followed by 5 ns
of classical simulation to relax the entire system.
QM/MM simulations
Following classical simulations, the CHAMBER utility of ParmEd version
3.0.3 was used to convert the CHARMM coordinate, topology, parameter,
and protein structureﬁles to Amber formatted coordinate and topologyﬁles
for the Sander program of Amber
95,96. The Amber18 software97 was used to
carry out all QM/MM calculations with the Density-Functional Tight-
Binding semiempirical QM method with third-order expansion42 of the
DFT total energy (DFTB3) and the parameter set designed for DFTB3
organic and biological applications version 3.1 (3ob-3-1)
98 to describe the
QM region. An 8 Å cutoff was used for short-range, and PME was used for
long-range electrostatic interactions
94. Periodic boundary conditions were
used, the timestep was reduced to 1 fs, and SHAKE was applied only to
hydrogen in the MM region93. The Langevin thermostat and barostat were
speciﬁe dt h es a m ef o rt h eQ M / M Ms i m u l a t i o n sa st h e yw e r ef o rt h eM M
simulations.
The QM region for the acylation step was composed of the entire PET
dimer, side chains of catalytic residues Ser160, His237, Asp206, and side
chains of residues Trp159 and Ser238 with hydrogen QM/MM link atoms
placed between C
α and Cβ. The entire QM region for the acylation step
consisted of 104 atoms, including link atoms. The charge of the QM region
was set to−1 to account for the protonation state of Asp206. The system was
QM/MM energy minimized for a minimum of 2000 steps, then simulated
with QM/MM for 200 ps to equilibrate the system. Theﬁnd_ts procedure
automated by ATESA
43 was used to obtain initial putative transition state
structures by applying linearly increasing restraints to the atoms with bonds
that form or break between the reactant and product states and then
selecting intermediate simulation frames and verifying that they produced
reactive trajectories usingﬁve steps of aimless shooting each (using the
aimless shooting method described in the following subsection).
F o rt h ed e a c y l a t i o ns t e po ft h er e a c t i o n ,a nA E Ic o nﬁguration was taken
from an acylation AS reactive trajectory, and QM/MM was simulated for
100 ps. This system was brought back into CHARMM, where the BHET
product was removed, and a patch was written using PET ester parameters
to describe the Ser160 O
γ to PET carboxyl carbon bond classically. The
patch was used to simply satisfy CHARMM. However, the enzyme–ligand
complex was heldﬁxed to avoid simulation with these unveriﬁed para-
meters until the system could be made QM/MM again. The enzyme–ligand
complex was re-solvated and neutralized, with waters and ions classically
minimized and equilibrated stepwise like the acylation step. In this way, we
preserve the QM description of the enzyme–ligand conﬁguration between
reaction steps. This system was then converted to work with Amber, as
described previously.
The QM region for the deacylation step included the acylated PET
fragment, side chains of catalytic residues Ser160, His237, Asp206, and side
chains of residues Trp159 and Ser238 with hydrogen QM/MM link atoms
placed between C
α and Cβ. The system was QM/MM energy minimized
until reaching the default convergence tolerance and then equilibrated for
200 ps. A nucleophilic water molecule that was naturally present in the
active site was incorporated into the QM region, and the system QM/MM
equilibrated for another 100 ps. Theﬁnal QM region consisted of 75 QM
atoms, including the hydrogen link atoms. This system was subjected to the
same ﬁnd_ts procedure using ATESA as described above for the acylation
step
43.
Aimless shooting
The ﬂexible-length AS variant of TPS, as automated by ATESA43 was
used to ﬁnd the best putative TSs from the ensemble generated from
umbrella sampling40,99. AS works by assigning random velocities to the
atoms of the putative TS based on the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution
of the system temperature. The system is propagated from the putative
TS forward with the assigned velocities (V0)a sw e l la sbackwards from
the putative TS using the reverse of the assigned velocities (−1V0). If one
direction of the trajectory leads to reactants and the other direction leads
to products, then the trajectory is considered reactive
40. A putative TS
that generates a high percentage of reactive trajectories is likely a good TS
guess. During the forward portion of the trajectory, a new conﬁguration
is saved at a randomΔt between 1 and 10 fs, and if the trajectory is
reactive, this new conﬁguration is used as the starting point for the next
AS step
40.I nt h i sw a yt h ec o nﬁgurational space about the TS is thor-
oughly explored. This AS method does not require any a priori knowl-
edge of the TS conﬁguration; however, initiating AS with a putative TS
conﬁguration will reduce the rate of rejected trajectories, and this initial
biasing was removed by excluding early trajectories that are collected
from analysis by measuring the autocorrelation of each CV and rejecting
early trajectories with statistically signiﬁcant correlations in any of them
at theα = 0.05 level, as automated by ATESA
40,43.

For the acylation step, the putative TS conﬁguration was used to
initialize 16 independent AS sampling schemes each in both the forward and
backward directions, and their results were combined40. The reactant basin
was deﬁned as: PET fragment C–Ser160 O < 1.8 Å, Ser160 H–Ser160
O > 1.4 Å, Ser160 H–PET fragment O < 1.2 Å, and PET fragment O–PET
f r a g m e n tC>2 . 4Å ,w h i l et h ep r o d u c tb a s i nw a sd eﬁned as PET fragment
C–Ser160 O > 2.4 Å, Ser160 H–Ser160 O < 1.2 Å, Ser160 H–PET fragment
O > 1.4 Å, and PET fragment O–PET fragment C < 1.8 Å.
For the deacylation step of the reaction, theﬁve putative TS conﬁg-
urations underwent 5 independent AS sampling schemes, each in both the
forward and backward directions, and their results were combined
40.T h e
reactant basin was deﬁned as water O–MHET C < 1.5 Å, water O–water
H>1 . 2Å ,M H E TC–Ser160 O > 1.6 Å, and water H–Ser 160 O < 1.1, and
the product basin was deﬁned as water O–MHET C > 1.6 Å, water O–water
H<1 . 1Å ,M H E TC–Ser160 O < 1.5 Å, and water H–Ser 160 O > 1.2.
Likelihood maximization
Key distances, angles, dihedrals, and differences in distances between
reactive atoms, collectively known as CVs, were measured for the AS con-
ﬁgurations. Instantaneous rates of change for each CV were also recorded
for each conﬁguration. The outcome of forward trajectories, CVs of AS
conﬁgurations, and CV rates of change were used in an iLMax routine to

two_line_testfunctionality of the likelihoodmaximization script associated
with ATESA
38,39,41,43. This method automatically identiﬁes the desirable
number of CVs to include in the RC and optimizes for the maximumﬁtt o
the observed fates of the trajectories of both the CVs and their associated
rates of change in order to increase the observed transmission coefﬁcient.
Additional details for this method are supplied in the Supplementary
Methods.
Committor probability histogram test
The pB histogram test was used to validate the quality of the RCs obtained
from iLMax44. Given a putative TS conﬁguration, thepB is a measure of the
likelihood that the TS will evolve to products when assigned random
velocities from the Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution
44.Ag o o dT Sc o nﬁg-
uration should exhibit an equal probability of evolving to products as it does
reactants. Thus, an idealpB histogram should appear as a Gaussian dis-
tribution centered onpB =0 . 544. For the RCs obtained from iLMax, a value of
RC = 0 is associated with the TS. The RC values were computed for the
ensemble of all shooting points from AS and a cutoff threshold on the
absolute distance of the RC value from zero was selected so as to include
roughly 200 conﬁgurations. Using ATESA’s committor_analysisoption
43,
each of these conﬁgurations was used as the starting points of 10 simulations
using random velocities to initiate each trajectory. Evaluation of trajectory
end points used the same basin deﬁnitions deﬁned for AS. The fraction of
the 10 trajectories that evolved toproducts was used to construct thep
B
histogram for each RC.
Potential of mean force
The potentials of mean force (free energy proﬁles) along the reaction
coordinate for each step and for the C-Cα-Cβ-Cγ dihedral angle of Trp185
were evaluated using umbrella sampling, also automated by ATESA43.F o r
sampling along the RCs, the RC was divided into evenly spaced windows of
width 0.25, in the range [−10, 10] for the acylation step and [−8, 8] for the
deacylation step. These ranges were selected arbitrarily so as to extend
somewhat past the values of the RC observed at the endpoints of simulations
committing in both directions during aimless shooting. Initial conﬁgura-
tions for simulations beginning ineach window were harvested from
reactive trajectories from aimless shooting, andﬁve independent simula-
t i o n si ne a c hw i n d o ww e r er u nf o r~ 2 0 , 0 0 0s t e p se a c hw i t hh a r m o n i c
restraints of weight 50 kcal/mol-unit
2,w h e r e“unit”is the dimensionless unit
of the RC. These simulations were performed using the same simulation
settings and QM regions as the aimless shooting simulations. Sampling
along the acylation RC was done with ATESA’s pathway restraints option in
use to constrain sampling to the observed ensemble of reaction pathways
from aimless shooting (see atesa.readthedocs.io for details)
43. For sampling
along the dihedral angles, no QM method was used, and windows in the
range [−75, 75]° spaced 5° apart were similarlyﬁlled withﬁve independent
simulations each. In this case, because initial coordinates in each window
were not already available, the restraints increased linearly from 0 to their
ﬁnal value of 50 kcal/mol-degree
2 over 1000 2-fs steps to equilibrate the
coordinates in the appropriate position for the restraints and then run for an
additional ~35,000 steps each. Theﬁrst 1000 steps were omitted before
analysis in this case. Potentials of mean force were constructed from
umbrella sampling data using the multistate Bennett acceptance ratio
(MBAR) as implemented in ATESA using only the subset of the sampling
data that had decorrelated from the initial conﬁgurations
43,100.
Rate constant
To compute the rate constant (κ) for the reaction requires the transmission
coefﬁcient (κ), the free energy of the TS (ΔG‡), and absolute system tem-
perature, and is computed using the Eyring equation from Transition State
Theory:
k ¼ κ ðkBT=hÞeð/C0 ΔGz=kBTÞ
where kB is the Boltzmann constant,h is the Planck constant, andT is the
absolute temperature of the system101. κ was calculated from committor
analysis simulations as the plateau value of the function:
κðtÞ¼ _q0 /C3 θ qtðÞ
/C0/C1/C10/C11
1
2 _q0
/C12/C12/C12/C12/C10/C11
where t is the timestep of the simulation,qtðÞ is the value of the reaction
coordinate at timestept, _q0 is the initial rate of change of the reaction
coordinate for a given simulation,θðÞ is the Heaviside step function, and
angle brackets indicate the average over each committor analysis
trajectory
69.
Product state simulations
Ten product state conﬁgurations were taken from separate deacylation
reactive trajectories. These QM/MM systems were converted from Amber
to CHARMM via ParmEd for classical simulation. The CHARMM36
protein forceﬁeld was used to describe the protein (converting the water
hydrogen on Ser160 back to its classical description), CGenFF was used to
describe MHET (with the OH from water completing the carboxylic acid),
and the TIP3P water model was used. The systems were minimized using
100 steps of ABNR minimization toﬁx any discrepancies between QM and
MM geometries. The systems were made NVT for use with domdec, and
brieﬂy heated back to 310 K using a 1 fs timestep for simulation. The
thermostat, cutoffs, integrator, and SHAKE were used as described for the
purely classical simulations described prior. Coordinates were saved every
2 ps for analysis. Center of mass distances between the six-membered rings
of Trp185 and MHET, as well as between Tyr87 and MHET, were mea-
sured. The coordinates wrapped from PBCs were unwrapped using the
unfold option within the CHARMM merge trajectory command to measure
t h ed i s t a n c eM H E Th a dd i f f u s e df r o mt h ea c t i v es i t e .
