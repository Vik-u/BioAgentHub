Abstract 
Accumulating evidence indicates that microorganisms respond to the ubiquitous plastic pollution by evolving plastic-degrading 
enzymes. However, the functional diversity of these enzymes and their distribution across the ocean, including the deep sea, remain 
poorly understood. By integrating bioinformatics and artificial intelligence-based structure prediction, we developed a structure- and 
function-informed algorithm to computationally distinguish functional polyethylene terephthalate-degrading enzymes (PETases) from 
variants lacking PETase activity (pseudo-PETase), either due to alternative substrate specificity or pseudogene origin. Through in vitro 
functional screening and in vivo microcosm experiments, we verified that this algorithm identified a high-confidence, searchable 
sequence motif for functional PETases capable of degrading PET. Metagenomic analysis of 415 ocean samples revealed 23 PETase 
variants, detected in nearly 80% of the samples. These PETases mainly occur between 1,000 and 2,000 m deep and at the surface 
in regions with high plastic pollution. M etatranscriptomic analysis further identified PETase variants that were actively transcribed
by marine microorganisms. In contrast to their terrestrial counterparts—where PETases are taxonomically diverse—those in marine
ecosystems were predominantly encoded and transcribed by members of thePseudomonadalesorder. Our study underscores the
widespread distribution of PETase-containing bacteria across carbon-limited marine ecosystems, identifying and distinguishing the
PETase motif that underpins the functionality of these specialized cutinases.

Introduction 
Due to exponential growth in plastic production and poor waste 
management practices, over 150 million tons of plastic waste 
have been delivered to the ocean since 1950 [
1, 2], where it 
harms marine life, from small invertebrates to whales [ 3, 4]. 
Plastic polymers, such as polyethylene terephthalate (PET), are 
derived from oil hydrocarbons and ar e designed to be durable
in the environment [
5, 6], which makes them mainly resistant 
to microbial degradation. However, a newly evolved plastic-
degrading enzyme, PET hydrolase (PETase), was discovered in 
2016 in the b etaproteobacteriumIdeonella sakaiensisisolated
from a bottle-recycling facility in Japan [
7]. This hydrolase— 
which retains the ancestral α/β-hydrolase fold but exhibits a 
more open active-site cleft than homologous cutinases—has 
presumably evolved spontaneously following massive exposure to
PET -rich waste [
8]. This PETase catalyzes the hydrolysis of PET to 
monomeric bis(2-hydroxyethyl) terephthalate (BHET) and then to 
mono(2-hydroxyethyl) terephthalate (MHET), which is ultimately 
broken down into non-hazardous monomers, terephthalate (TPA)
and ethylene glycol by an additional enzyme, the MHET hydrolase

(MHETase). I. sakaiensis possesses both enzymes (PETase and 
MHETase) that likely act synergistically to depolymerize PET and
use it as a primary carbon and energy source [7]. However, I. 
sakaiensis PETase (IsPETase) showed low degradation efficiency
for crystalline PET [9–12], suggesting that this specific variant 
is not yet fully optimized for this anthropogenic substrate [13]. 
Indeed, it has been shown that introducing just five key point 
mutations significantly enhances the activity of IsPETase by
several orders of magnitude [
9], while the selection of two 
preferred mutations via comparison with homologous protein 
sequences led to enzymatic pr operties that outperformed most
of the other variants reported so far [ 14]. These findings, 
among others, support the idea that given sufficient time and 
continued exposure to PET, microbial populations ma y naturally
evolve more efficient PET -degrading enzymes [
13, 15]. Such a 
process is also influenced by environmental physicochemical 
factors, such as temperature and pH, which contribute to 
shaping the intrinsic properties of the e nzymes (including
stability and specificity), as well as their adaptation and overall
performance [
16, 17]. 
Despite being an emerging pollutant in our oceans, plastic 
also creates unique ecological niches by physically supporting 
microbial colonization, fostering the dev elopment of character-
istic microbial communities dominated by bacteria, fungi, and
diatoms [
18–23]. These microorganisms colonize plastic particles 
as novel habitats and, in some cases, actively contribute to their
degradation, using plastic-derived compounds as “food” [18, 20]. 
However, whether these microbial communities have sponta-
neously evolved plastic-degrading activities due to exposure to 
such synthetic polymers is poorly understood. Considering that 
the first PETase was detected in a bacterium associated with a PET
bottle recycling facility [
7], it is plausible that also the accumula-
tion of PET in marine environments promotes a similar process 
by driving spontaneous modifications of micr obial alpha/beta
hydrolases into PETase enzyme variants (e.g. mutations of cuti-
nases/lipases) [8]. This hypothesis is supported by the fact that 
the vast population of prokaryotes in the global ocean—estimated 
to be 1029 cells distributed among 1010 different operational taxo-
nomic units [24]—would provide enough population size, genetic 
diversity , and growth rate for gene mutations [25] t h a t c o u l d 
create novel functional PETases [3]. Therefore, given the generally 
oligotrophic nature of ocean environments [26], microorganisms 
encoding for a functional PETase would have a selective advantage 
by accessing an additional carbon and energy source [27, 28]. 
A recent global assessment detected the presence of PET hydro-
lase genes in 31 of the 108 marine surface water samples anal-
ysed (<2 m depth) [29]. Additionally , 1598 sequences homolo-
gous to IsPETase were detected from marine ecosystems across 
the entire water column, including the deep sea [30]. However, 
given that plastic pollution in our oceans is a relatively recent 
phenomenon, it is reasonable to expect the presence of “inter-
mediate” PETase forms—enzymes that show structural features 
indicative of adaptation to PET but lack the catalytic efficiency 
needed for effective PET degradation under environmental condi-
tions. Additionally , many hydrolases with structural and sequence 
similarity to bona fide PETases may instead be adapted to other 
substrates. Therefore, to comprehensively assess the diversity 
of PET -degrading enzymes within bacterial communities across 
the oceans, we need to accurately distinguish genes that encode 
functional PETases from those that produce structurally similar 
enzymes (here defined as pseudo-PETase) without significant 
catalytic PETase activity . The accurate identification of functional 
PETase variants at a large scale would provide more confident 
insight into the interplay between microbial functional evolution
(i.e. mutational refinement) and environmental selective pressure
(i.e. presence of PET as a substrate) in ocean microbial com-
munities. More specifically , it could help understand the com-
petitive advantage that efficient PET -degrading variants confer
to microorganisms in exploring novel ecological niches where
PET may serve as a primary carbon and energy source [
31]. To 
this end, we developed a computational approach for PETase 
identification based on protein motifs that can efficiently pre-
dict a functional PETase from sequence alone and assign dif-
ferent levels of PETase efficacy to these sequences. We applied
this method to identify PETase candidates in publicly available
metagenome datasets from theTaraOceans [
32] and Malaspina 
Expedition [33] samples. Our functional predictions were further 
verified experimentally by assessing PETase activity (i) in vitro 
using heterologously expressed enzymes and (ii) in vivo through 
microcosm experiments with marine bacterial isolates. We also 
evaluated the expression of predicted functional PETase variants
in metatranscriptomic datasets (i.e.metaTfromTaraOcean [
34]) to 
determine whether such genes are actively transcribed and likely 
translated, as transcription and translation are tightly coupled
in prokaryotic systems [
35]. Our results showed that PETases are 
limited compared to pseudo-PETase genes that likely serve func-
tions not related to PET degradation. Yet, PETases are primarily 
encoded and transcribed by members of the order Pseudomon-
adales and phylum Gemmatimonadota across the global oceans, 
with the highest abundance observed in bacterial communities 
of bath ypelagic and surface waters in areas with elevated plastic
concentrations. These findings support that encoding PETases can
be advantageous for survival and proliferation in PET -exposed
environments [
36] and enhance our understanding of the diver-
sity and prevalence of the PET biodegradation capacity in marine
microorganisms.
Materials and methods
Data collection and KAUST Metagenomic 
Anal yses Platform-based annotation
Metagenomes publicly available from two global expeditions— 
theTaraOceans [ 32] and Malaspina Expedition (Malaspina 
Deep [MD] and Malaspina Profile [MP]) [ 33, 37, 38]—were 
used for further analyses. The metagenomic datasets were 
retrieved from ENA (PRJEB40454 and PRJEB1787) and [ 37, 38], 
including 243 metagenome samples from the Tara Oceans 
and 172 metagenomes from the Malaspina Expedition. The 
415 metagenomes were obtained fr om samples collected
along the entire water column, from the surface to 4,000 m
depth (
Supplementary Data S1 ), encompassing 206 locations
(Supplementary Fig. S1 ). The downloaded metagenomes were 
processed through quality control, metagenomic assembly , full-
length gene prediction, and clustering of genes across samples to 
produce a unique set of genes, referred to as gene catalogs, which
we annotate using the KAUST Metagenomic Analyses Platform
(KMAP) [
39]. KMAP investigates the taxonomic affiliation of every 
gene using Least Common Ancestor estimation through BLAST 
against the UniProtKB database. Briefly , a gene catalogs of non-
redundant gene clusters was prepared from the metagenome 
datasets, where each cluster contained nucleotide sequences 
with≥95% sequence identity over≥90% of their length. We
pre-processed the individual samples for quality control and
validation of the pairs using bbduk (
http://jgi.doe.gov/data-and-
tools/bb-tools/). The metagenomic assembly was carried out 
using MEGAHIT version 1.2.9 [40] with default settings, except
Identifying functional marine PETases | 3
for the minimum contig size kept at 500 bp, and gene prediction 
was performed using Prodigal version 26.3 with the “-c” option 
to prevent partial genes. We performed gene clustering through 
the Cluster Database at High Identity with Tolerance (CD-HIT) 
program version 4.8.1 to obtain a unique, non-redundant set of
genes across samples (95% nucleotide identity and 80% overlap of
the shorter sequence). For per-sample gene abundance estimates,
read mapping was performed against gene catalogs using bbmap
(
http://jgi.doe.gov/data-and-tools/bb-tools/) options ambig = toss 
idfilter = 0.9 tossbrokenreads to obtain fragments per kilobase per 
million mapped reads (FPKM) values. Tara Oceans’ micr obial gene
catalog was already available, and it had 40 million genes [39]. 
Two gene catalogs from the Malaspina Expedition, i.e. MP and 
MD gene catalogs, produced a non-redundant set of 32 and 11 
million genes, respectively . Putative PETase genes were identified 
from KMAP annotations based on the presence of the PF01738 
dienelactone hydrolase (DLH) family domain—a characteristic 
feature of PETases—identified using InterProScan. We established
additional bioinformatic filters based on the sequence, functional,
and 3D structural data derived from confirmed and functionally
tested PETase enzymes [
8, 41–45] (PDB accessions 4CG2, 4 EB0, 
4WFI, 5XJH, 5YNS, 5ZNO, 6EQD, 6EQE, 6EQF , 6EQG, 6EQH, and 
6KY5) and form ulated these filters as five motifs (M1–M5) with
increasing stringency (
Fig. 1 and Supplementary Data S1 ). In 
addition, to determine whether PETase variants could be secreted 
extracellularly—an essential prerequisite for PET -degrading 
activity in the environment—signal pe ptide prediction was
performed using the SignalP 6.0 web server [
47]. This tool employs 
protein language models (LMs) to identify N-terminal signal 
peptides and their pro bable cleavage sites in each amino acid
sequence.
Phylogenetic analysis of polyethylene 
terephthalate h ydrolase from oceans
A protein sequence set of the 75 non-redundant PETase-related 
genes obtained through querying KMAP wa s combined with theI.
sakaiensisPETase gene (IsPETase) [7] and its eight homologs [29]; 12 
seed sequences from the DLH domain were included as outgroup. 
The alignment of sequences was performed using hmmsearch 
version 3 with the DLH domain as a query . The resulting alignment 
was converted into fasta format, and a phylogenetic tree was built
using the Randomized Axelerated Maximum Likelihood (RaxML)
method [
48] with 100 bootstraps and using model PROTGAM-
MAAUTO. To identify closer taxonomic affiliation at the species 
level, we compared each PETase protein sequence using BLAST 
in NCBI’s re ference sequence database (RefSeq). The top 10 full-
length protein sequences were downloaded and clustered using
CD-HIT [
49], considering a 99% identity threshold. The selected 
sequences were aligned, including IsPETase, and a phylogenetic 
tree was built using the Mafft alignment software web server at
https://mafft.cbrc.jp/alignment/server/index.html. 
Efficiency scoring and homology modeling
A scoring system was developed to rank the candidate PETases, 
eight known PET hydrolases, and 12 seed sequences containing 
the DLH domain. This scoring was made by comparison to the 
PETase sequence from IsPETase, considering some of the key 
residues that are known to contribute to the activity and sta-
bility ofIsPETase, as well as variants and mutations that have
been experimentally tested and yielded either an increase or
decrease in its ability to degrade PET (
Supplementary Table S1
and Data S2). The scoring was then performed with the following 
considerations: given the difficulties in predicting how the pres-
ence of additional varying residues in the sequence with respect 
to IsPETase might affect the performance of the experimentally 
tested mutations as reported in the literature, the scoring was 
applied as a count or sum of the number of positive mutations 
(i.e. enhancing PETase activity) minus the number of negative 
mutations (i.e. inhibiting PETase activity). Additionally , a higher 
weight was given to the residues composing the catalytic triad 
and the PETase-specific disulfide bond, and a higher penalty 
for their absence. Based on this, PETases were binned into lo w,
medium, and high efficiency . After several rounds of scoring
different parameters, such as the number of mutations/key amino
acids considered and the weights given to each residue, the rank-
ing of the analysed sequences was robust. High-confidence struc-
tural models were produced for PETases with M3, M4, and M5
motifs with AlphaFold2 [
50] to support and inform the scor-
ing process. The minimum obtained pLDDT score was 83, with 
75% of models having a score higher than 90 (average = 92). The 
models were produced in the Ibex computer cluster at KA UST,
allocating 16 CPUs, 2 V100 GPU cards, and 128GB of RAM. The
structural analysis of potential PETases is described in detail in
Supplementary Result S1. 
Cloning, expression, and purification of 
recombinant polyethylene terephthala te
hydrolase variants
Sequences for all constructs tested in vitro with a C-terminal 
8xHis-tag were codon-optimized for expression in Escherichia coli, 
synthesized by TWIST Bioscience, and sub-cloned in the pJEx411c 
vector with kanamycin resistance. The recombinant protein 
expr ession constructs included a periplasm-targeting signal
peptide identified by SignalP 6.0 that was cleaved off (if present in
the sequence,
Supplementary Table S2) to obtain only the desired 
PETase sequence. Protein constructs were transformed into 
Rosetta-Gami B (DE3) cells of the E. colistrain. Cells were grown
at 37◦C until ODλ= 600 reached 0.6. Cultures were induced with 
0.5 mM IPTG and grown at 20 ◦C for 18 hours. Cells were p elleted
using centrifugation at 9000 rpm for 10 min at 4◦C and stored at
−80◦C. Cell pellets were resuspended in a binding buffer (50 mM 
Tris–HCl, 200 mM NaCl, pH 8.0) and lysed using ultrasonication 
at 35% amplitude for 12 min (1 second on, 1 second off). The 
cell lysate was centrifuged at 27000 rpm for 20 minutes, and the 
supernatant was collected and applied to the His-Trap affinity 
column (Cytiva) using a binding buffer. The column was washed 
with 3 column volumes of binding buffer, and the proteins were 
eluted using 50 mM Tris–HCl, 200 mM NaCl, 500 mM imidazole, 
pH 8.0. Further purification was performed with the MonoQ ion-
exchange column (Cytiva) using a low salt buffer (50 mM Tris–
HCl, 50 mM NaCl, pH 8.0) and a high salt buffer (50 mM Tris–
HCl, 1000 mM NaCl, pH 8.0). Proteins were then applied to size
exclusion chromatography using a Superdex 200 10/300 column
(Cytiva) in SEC buffer (20 mM HEPES, 200 mM NaCl, pH 7.5). Purity
was checked using SDS-PAGE (
Supplementary Fig. S2A), and all 
proteins were stored at −80◦C upon flash-freezing using liquid 
nitrogen.

in 20 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, and 200 mM NaCl in the presence and 
absence of Ca 2+. The scan temperature ranged from 25 ◦C t o 
95◦C . All proteins were tested at 10μM, and the fluorescent dye 
SYPRO Orange was used at a final concentration of 5X. Purified 
enzymes were incubated with increasing concentrations of para-
nitrophenol (pNP)-acetate (Sigma-Aldrich) in 45 mM Na 2HPO4-
HCl (pH 7.0), 90 mM NaCl, and 10% acetonitrile at 30 ◦C. pNP
production was monitored continuously at 405 nm as previously
described [
7]. pNP production without the enzyme was also 
calculated and subtracted from the values measured in the 
presence of the enzymes as a baseline. The activity was calculated 
using the Michaelis–Menten equation using non-linear fitting to 
calculate the initial catalytic rate, and data were plotted using
GraphPad Prism 9.0.
Enzymatic functional assay with polyethylene 
terephthalate film and pol yethylene
terephthalate granules
Transparent PET films with 0.1 mm thickness (300×300 mm) and 
PET granules were ordered from Sigma-Aldrich. PET films were 
cut into 8 mm diameter using a hole puncher and washed with 
MilliQ water, followed by 20% ethanol, 1% SDS, and finally with
MilliQ water. Purified enzymes were incubated with the PET films
in 50 mM glycine-NaOH (pH 9.0) as described [
7]. The reaction was 
terminated by diluting the tube with 18 mM phosphate buffer 
(pH 2.5) and heating it to 85 ◦C for 15 min. After the reaction, 
both PET films and PET granules were washed and air-dried
for scanning electron microscopy (SEM) imaging, as mentioned
above. The samples were then mounted on a 3.2 mm SEM sample

stage with carbon tapes and coated with 8 nm platinum/pal-
ladium using a Cressington Sputter coater. SEM imaging was 
performed under vacuum using a Zeiss SEM. The electr on beam
intensity was 5 kV , and images were taken at 2500×at a 10μM 
distance .
Screening of marine Halopseudomonas (formerly 
Pseudomonas) strains for polyethylene 
terephthalate film degradation in microcosm
experiments
An initial PCR-based screening of the PETase gene conducted on 
the marine heterotrophic bacterial culture collection (MARINHET)
[
52] ( Supplementary Method S1 ) allowed the identification of 
six PETase-positive isolates. Among them, the ISS-721, ISS-
1225, and ISS-1242 strains were selected to screen their PET 
degradation activityin vivo. The genome of the three strains
was sequenced (
Supplementary Method S2 ) and anal ysed
(Supplementary Result S2 ). Average Nucleotide Identities (ANI) 
comparison between complete genomes from isolates and closer 
species revealed that the isolates belong toH. pachastrellae[ 53, 
54], with ISS-1242 forming a separate sub-cluster from ISS-1225
and ISS-721 (Supplementary Fig. S3 ). Glycerol stock of the three 
strains ISS-721, ISS-1225, and ISS-1242 were recovered on Zobell 
Marine Broth (MB) 2216 medium (HiMedia; composition: 5 g 
peptone, 1 g yeast extract, 0.1 g C

0.08 g KBr, 34 mg SrCl 2, 2 2 m g H3BO3, 4 m g N a2SiO3, 2.4 mg 
NaF , 1.6 mg NH 4NO3, 8 m g N a2HPO4) a t 2 4◦C f o r 2 4 h . A s 
initial screening, the PET degradation ability was tested by using 
different liquid media in the presence and absence of C-sources: 
(i) modified MB without C (mMB, the medium contained all 
components except yeast extract and peptone), (ii) modified 
MB with only 0.01% of yeast extract (mMB+C), (iii) Red Sea 
water (SW), and (iv) SW with the addition of 0.05% of yeast 
extract and 0.25% of peptone (SW+C). Each bacterial strain 
was grown overnight in MB medium, and cell concentration was 
determined using a Thoma Chamber. An appropriate amount of 
culture was collected to inoculate 10
6 bacterial cells per flask 
containing 300 mL of medium and six pieces of PET film. The 
PET films (0.1 mm thick, Sigma-Aldrich GF09063581) were cut 
into 96×24 mm (film weight, 0.3157±0.0016 g), incubated in 
70% ethanol for 5 min, rinsed with sterile water, and finally 
dried for 24 h at 50
◦C. Additional flasks not inoculated with 
bacteria and supplemented with PET f ilms were used as controls.
Flasks were incubated on a shaker (100 rpm) for 37 days at
25
◦C±1 ◦C. The microcosms were refreshed every 10–14 days
by substituting 2/3 of the volume with a fresh medium by
letting the medium settle for 1 hour before taking out the
solution. It allowed the introduction of fresh nutrients and energy
sources, keeping enough bacterial cells in each microcosm for
further generations. The procedure was done for all replicates,
including the negative controls. The PET films were extracted
from the flasks at different times, washed with 70% ethanol
for 5 minutes and dried in a hot-air oven at 50
◦Cf o r1h .T h e
degradation of the PET films was evaluated in terms of weight
loss and expressed as a percentage:W
0-Wf /W 0 × 100, where 
W0 and Wf are the initial and final weights of the PET films (g), 
respectively . Based on the initial results (Supplementary Fig. S4), 
further characterization of the PET degradation/deterioration 
dynamics mediated by strains was performed in SW by adding 
0.05% yeast extract and 0.25% peptone (SW+C), following the 
same protocol. T wo independent incubations of 85 and 64 days 
were performed in triplicate. In the last experiment, we also 
included an additional microcosm set as a control, in which we
inoculatedE. coliBL21 DE3 grown in Luria–Bertani (LB) medium.
The obtained cells were inoculated in flasks filled with minimal
M9 medium instead of seawater, following previously described
procedures.
Scanning electron microscopy of polyethylene 
terephthalate films co-cultivated with bacteria
To evaluate the ISS-1242 strain’s adhesion to the surface, the 
PET films were collected after 21 days of incubation. The sam-
ples were removed fr om the media and immediately fixed in a
solution of 2.5% glutaraldehyde EM quality in 0.22
μm f i l t e r e d 
autoclaved seawater. Post-fixation was performed in 2% osmium 
tetroxide for 1 hour, and dehydration was performed in 30–50– 
70–90–100% graded ethanol for 15 min for each step, followed by 
CO
2 critical-point-drying by using EM CPD300 (Leica, Germany) 
dryer. Palladium coating was performed using a K575X sputter 
coater (Quorum Technologies, UK) with a final thickness of 5 nm. 
Analysis of the PET films’ surface was further conducted at 
60 days; samples were washed in 1% SDS, distilled water, and 
then 70% ethanol and air -dried overnight before being placed on
a support with carbon tape. The samples were then coated with
palladium, as described above. Microscope images were collected
with Teneo VS SEM (Thermo Fisher Scientific, US) at the Imaging
and Characterization Core Lab of KAUST, using an electron beam
intensity of 5 kV .

For both in vivo and in vitro PETase activity assessment, high-
performance liquid chromatogra phy (HPLC) analysis was per-
formed [
55]. Standards of BHET and TPA were obtained from
Sigma Aldrich (Supplementary Fig. S5 ). The analysis of samples 
was performed on an Agilent 1260 HPLC (Agilent Technologies, 
Santa Clara, CA) equipped with a G1315A diode array detector 
(DAD). Each sample and standard were injected using a vol-
ume of 20 μL onto a Phenomenex Luna C18 column, 5 μm, 
4.6×150 mm (Phenomenex, Torrance, CA) at 25◦C. DAD detection 
at a wavelength of 240 nm was performed for each analyte. 
PET monomers were calculated using a standard curve for
BHET. Raw data were obtained and plotted using GraphPad
Prism 9.0.
Assessment of M5-polyethylene terephthalate 
hydrolase abundance and distribution in ocean
metagenomes
To assess the relative abundance of functional PETase variants, 
i.e. defined as those sequences containing the M5 motif
(hereafter referred to as M5-PETase; see Results, Fig. 1 and 
Supplementary Data S1 ), we mapped the metagenomic reads 
from the Tara Oceans, MP , and MD datasets to the M5-PETase 
corresponding DNA sequences . Mapping was performed using
BBMAP from the BBTOOLS package (https://archive.jgi.doe.gov/ 
data-and-tools/software-tools/bbtools/) [ 39]. This allowed us 
to quantify M5-PETase abundance in terms of Fragments Per 
Kilobase of gene per Million mapped reads (FPKM), a metric 
that accounts for sequencing depth, gene length, and paired-end 
sequencing biases. To further control for differences in microbial 
community size across samples, M5-PETase FPKM values were 
normalized by the FPKM o f therecAgene. We then aggregated
therecA-normalized FPKM values for all the M5-PETase variants
across each sample to assess the cumulative PETase functional
potential of the total microbial community [
34]. Geographical

distribution and cumulative abundance of M5-PETases across 
oceans were visualized in maps using QGIS. Following the same 
approach, we assessed the presence of MHETase-like genes, i.e. 
mono (2-hydroxyethyl) terephthalate hydrolase, an enzyme that 
facilitates the degradation of PET by-product after PETase activity . 
We utilized KMAP annotation of theTaraOceans and Malaspina
Expedition (MP and MD) gene catalogs derived from KEGG BLAST
to obtain the lists of genes assigned with MHETase-like KEGG KO
ID (K21105).
Assessment of M5-polyethylene terephthalate 
hydrolase transcription in global ocean
metatranscriptomes
To explore the expression of PETase genes fulfilling the M5 
motif (M5-PETase), we utilized a global ocean metatranscriptome
(metaT) dataset [
34] comprising 187 metatranscriptomic samples. 
We first used our M5-PETase sequence (12.M5, Supplementary 
Data S1) as a query against the metaT database at the Ocean
Gene Atlas portal ( https://tara-oceans.mio.osupytheas.fr) t o 
identify related genes. The resulting gene set was tested with 
the M5 motif using PHI-BLAST. Expression values w ere obtained
for each sample from themetaTgene profile (
www.ebi.ac.uk/ 
biostudies/files/S-BSST297/OM-RGC_v2_gene_profile_metaT.tsv. 
gz), showing gene transcript expression calculated as gene 
length-normalized insert count (MOCAT option profile), i.e. 
mean number of reads per base. We further applied the same 
normalization strategy used for the metagenomic data and 
normalized the relative abundance of these transcribed genes 
to that of recA. Similarly , we assessed the presence of MHETase
transcripts, using as query MHETase-like sequence against the
metaTexpression table. Taxonomic affiliation of these expressed
genes was available from [
34]. 
Correspondence between plastic concentrations 
and M5-polyethylene terephthala te hydrolase
abundance
The plastic concentration (in g/km 2) recorded during the ocean 
surface survey conducted by the Malaspina Expedition (http:// 
scientific.expedicionmalaspina.es/#!/n/malaspina-digital/s209) 
and by other 24 expeditions [56] was taken into consideration 
to assess whether a correspondence between plastic abundance 
and M5-PETases genes or transcripts abundance was present. 
For each plastic sample, the closest metagenomes from the Tara 
Oceans and Malaspina Expedition used in this study or metatran-
scriptomes frommetaT within a 5
◦ radius (∼550 km) were selected. 
When multiple metagenome samples were collected at the same 
location, they were all assigned to the same plastic sample. 
Multiple plastic samples could match with one metagenome 
sample when this was the only one located within a 5
◦ radius 
of the said set. Plastic samples that did not have metagenome 
samples closer than a 5
◦ radius were discarded. Since the plastic 
abundance data were obtained from ocean surface samples, 
only metagenomes and metatranscriptomes from samples not 
deeper than 10 m were included in the analyses. Applying
these thresholds returned 816 records of association between
plastic and metagenomes and 506 records of association between
plastic and metatranscriptomes. For each sample, the sum of
the M5-PETase variants’ abundance retrieved from metagenomes
and metatranscriptomes was then reported. We examined the
linear relationship of plastic concentration with M5-PETase-
gene and M5-PETase-transcript abundance to assess whether
samples containing plastic exhibited significantly higher M5-
PETase abundance using the non-parametric Mann–Whitney test.
Phylogenetic comparison of M5-polyethylene 
terephthalate hydrolase sequences from marine
and terrestrial ecosystems
To compare the distribution of M5-PETases between marine 
and terrestrial ecosystems, we first performed a search using
our 12.M5 variant ( Supplementary Data S1 ) in the ocean 
gene atlas database [ 57] with BLAST database selection for 
metatranscriptomic catalog (metaT, prefix “OM-RGC v2”) and 
the phylogenetic option to include similar sequences from 
NCBI’s reference sequence database (RefSeq, prefix “WP”). The 
resulting sequences were subjected to the M5 motif. Additionally , 
we searched NCBI’s metagenomic proteins database using M5 
Motif and PHI-BLAST (prefix “GB”). The M5-compliant sequences
obtained, includingI.sakaiensis wild-type PETase (IsPETase),
were aligned to produce a Maximum Likelihood phylogenetic
tree using PhyML (
https://ngphylogeny .fr/). We also explored the 
Universal Protein Resource (UniProt) with DLH domain-containing
protein sequences (PF01738), https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/ 
entry/pfam/PF01738/protein/UniProt/, yielding approximately 
89,000 sequences. The sequences were subjected to the M5-PETase 
search, and those positive were assessed for taxonomic affiliation 
available from UniProt. To further explore the distribution of 
M5-PETases across diverse environments, we utilized the EBI 
metagenomic proteins database. The IsPETase sequence was used 
as a query to identify homologous sequences. These resulting hits 
were then subjected to the M5 motif detection. A heatmap was 
produced based on the taxonomic information and the count of 
M5-PETases across sample types. This analysis was also used
to identify the earliest known protein sequences containing
the M5-PETase motif. Metadata—such as collection date and
annotation—were extracted from the respective databases to
determine the earliest occurrences of DLH domain-containing
protein sequences containing the M5 motif.

Bioinformatic motifs discriminate potential 
functional polyethylene terephthalate h ydrolase
in the global oceans
We based our exploration of marine PETases on metagenome 
datasets established from tw o global ocean expeditions, the
TaraOceans [ 32] and the Malaspina Expedition [ 33, 37, 38], 
encompassing 415 samples from 206 locations across the Indian, 
Pacific, and Atlantic Oceans ( Supplementary Fig. S1 ). These 
publicly available metagenomes were used to prepare a gene 
catalog of 83 million non-redundant gene clusters, where each 
cluster contained nucleotide sequences with ≥95% sequence 
identity ov er≥90% of their length. The gene catalogs were
annotated using the KAUST Metagenomic Analyses Platform
(KMAP) [
39] and screened for sequences similar to theI. sakaiensis
PETase [7] (IsPETase EC 3.1.1.101)-like enzymes. Specifically , we 
searched for genes encoding enzymes that contain the DLH 
domain, a generic α/β-hydrolase fold found in over 80,000 
protein sequences in the UniPro tKB database. The DLH domain-
containing sequences search identified 75 representative gene
clusters in our metagenomic catalogs (
Supplementary Data S1 ). 
Although these sequences contain a DLH domain, they may 
not necessarily be PETases. Following our motif ranking, w e
formulated filters as five motifs (M1–M5) with increasing
stringency (
Fig. 1A and Supplementary Fig. S6). The first motif, M1, 
only queries for a short and promiscuous PETase-associated motif 
derived from helix-4 that carries the catalytic serine. M2 improves

the M1 filter by adding a search for a conserved four glycine motif 
(GGGG) that is required for embedding the helix-4 into the protein 
core and by adding two signatures, one for the aromatic clamp 
of PET substrates and one for the catalytic aspartic acid. Motif 
M3 adds the previous signatures for the entire catalytic triad 
(including the histidine), and M4 includes the [PG]-G-[YF] motif 
that defines an additional aromatic clamp and oxyanion hole 
upstream in the catalytic triad. M5 strictly defines the residue
after the catalytic serine as a methionine (oxyanion hole) and
adds a conserved DxDxR (Y) xxFxC sequence requirement. The
M5 motif ensures correct pseudo-PETase packing of the final
helix to the core and includes one of the two cysteines that
form a stabilizing internal disulfide bond [
29]. Among these 
motifs, M3–M5 contain the complete catalytic triad (Ser, Asp, 
and His residues) and define the sequence- and structure-guided
minimum and maximum residue distances between individual
motifs (
Supplementary Figs S7 and S8). When searching for these 
motifs within our 75 PETase candidate genes, we identified 4, 3, 16, 
29, and 23 representative sequences that contained (up to) the M1,
M2, M3, M4, or M5 motif, respectively (Supplementary Data S1 ). 
Signal peptides for extracellular translocation (required for 
PETase to access the extracellular plastic) were detected in 22 
out of 23 M5-PETase sequence variants, wher eas their presence
was variable in sequences with lower motif ranking (M1–M4)
(
Supplementary Table S2). 
We further computed a RaxML–based bootstrapped p hylo-
genetic tree [48] with the 75 PETase candidates, the IsPET ase
sequence [7], eight terrestrial homologs reported in the UniProt
database [29], and 12 non-PETase DLH domain core sequences 
from the Pfam database as an outgroup (Fig. 1B). The resulting 
phylogenetic tree identified the 12 non-PETase DLH domain core 
sequences as a parental group for the candidate PETase genes, 
hereafter defined as clade I. All the other clusters represent
six additional taxonomic clades that differentially contain
the five motifs (
Fig. 1B). Specifically , clade II is dominated by 
Oceanospirialles (M3 and M4), clades III and IV include a mixture 
of taxa but are dominated by Flavobacteriales (M2–M4), clade V 
contains GemmatimonadotaandGammaproteobacteria(M1–M5), and
clade VI contains previously defined homologs ofIsPETase from
land microorganisms [
29]. The clade VII is formed by the original 
IsPETase sequence along with several sequences belonging to the 
Pseudomonadales order within the Gammaproteobacteria class; all 
contain the M5 motif except three sequences that were identified
as M2, M3, and M4, respectively (
Fig. 1B). 
In addition to the motif filters, we established a theoretical 
PETase “efficiency score” (see Materials and methods) based 
on the presence of residue substitutions that were previousl y
identified as enhancing PETase activity in engineered laboratory
variants of theIsPETase [
58] ( Supplementary Table S1 and 
Data S2 ). The substitutions increase the hydrophobicity of the 
ligand binding site and reduce the steric hindrance around 
the active site to facilitate substrate accumulation near the
binding cleft (
Supplementary Result S1 ). This score is non-
overlapping with the residues probed by the M1–M5 filters and 
is expected to reflect the efficacy , rather than capability , of 
using hydrophobic polymers such as PET as a substrate. By 
ranking the 75 PETases representatives from ocean metagenomes,
we found that the highest efficacy scores (scores 9–11;
Fig. 1C 
and Supplementary Data S2 ) were only achieved by sequences 
from Pseudomonadales, all but two (one M4 and one M2) of 
them were identified as M5 in our structure-based motif 
search. All the other sequences had eff icacy scores lower
than four and belonged to the M1–M4 motif classes, with
the exception of the M5-PETases encoded byGemmatimonadota
bacteria (
Supplementary Data S2 ). The latter has the back 
of the ligand binding site formed by glutamic acid and his-
tidine rather than alanine/tryptophan as inIs-WT (A89 and
W159)/PseudomonadalesM5, negatively affecting PETase activity
[
44]. 
M5-polyethylene terephthalate hydrolase have 
polyethylene terephthalate-degrading activityin
vitro
We tested the catalytic activity of PETase motif candidates in vitro. 
We recombinantly produced 11 ocean DLH genes, with motifs 
ranging from M1 to M5. We also produced the IsPETase (Is-WT) 
and its catalytically impaired S160A mutant (Is-S160A) as positive
and negative controls, respectively (
Supplementary Data S3). All 
recombinant proteins were purified to>90% ( Supplementary 
Fig. S2A). The obtained proteins of the IsPET ase and ocean DLH 
variants with M5 and M4 motifs sho wed melting temperatures
(T
m) between 47–51◦C( Supplementary Fig. S2B ), whereas the 
Tm of all M1–M3 enzymes range between 31 ◦C a n d 4 2◦C. The 
apparent molecular weight on SDS PAGE gel and AlphaFold 
modeling confirmed that the lower stability of the M1–M3
enzymes is explained by truncations compared toIs-WT
(
Supplementary Fig. S2A). The generic p-nitrophenol acyl esterase 
activity assay showed positive activity for all the M5-DLH variants 
tested, although their degradation efficiency was 25–50% lower
thanIs-WT (
Fig. 2A and B). Degradation and structural alterations 
of PET substrate were also observed for both PET films and 
granules, on which M5 enzymes produced characteristic scr atch
marks that progressively deepened and widened over time (
Fig. 2C 
and D). This enzymatic activity led to the release of PET monomers 
and by-products, including terephthalic acid (TPA) and mono(2-
hydroxyethyl) terephthalate (MHET) (Fig. 2C–F; molecular weight 
standards in Supplementary Fig. S5 ). On the contrary , neither 
Is-S160A nor any M1–M4 enzymes sho wed activity in this assay
(Supplementary Fig. S9). DLH variants demonstrating activity in 
in vitro functional assays all contained the M5 motif and belonged
to clade VII in the phylogenetic tree (Fig. 1B), i.e. PETase_10.M5, 
PETase_12.M5 and PETase_15.M5 assessed in this study (Fig. 2)a n d 
PETase_02.M5 previously tested [46]. Thus, we concluded that only 
the M5 variants were functional PET ases (hereafter M5-PETases).
In vivo polyethylene terephthalate degradation 
by bacteria encoding a full M5-pol yethylene
terephthalate hydrolase gene
To validate M5-PETase activity in vivo, we conducted proof-
of-concept experiments by assessing PET film degradation in 
microcosms inoculated with bacterial isolates from the marine
culture collection of heterotrophic bacteria (MARINHET) [ 52]. 
Based on initial PCR-based screening, we identified six positive
strains (Supplementary Table S3 ), of which three were selected 
to assess their PETase motif from genome sequencing and 
capabilities to degrade PET: ISS-721 isolated from 4,000 m 
depth in the South Atlantic (Malaspina Expedition), and ISS-
1225 and ISS-1242 captured from surface w ater (5 m) in the
North Atlantic (TaraOceans). All three isolates were identified
asPseudomonasspp., recently reclassified asHalopseudomonas
spp. [
54] (Supplementary Fig. S3). Analysis of bacterial assembled
genomes (Supplementary Method S1) revealed that only ISS-1242 
encodes a complete M5-PETase motif, identical to PETase_12.M5
fromH. pachastrellae( Fig. 1B), including both a complete catalytic 
fold and a secretion signal peptide (Supplementary Result S2
and Figs S10 and S11). In contrast, the other two strains possess

Microcosm experiments showed that PET film degradation 
varied among the three inoculated strains and occurred only 
when an additional carbon source (peptone and/or yeast
extract) was supplied (
Supplementary Fig. S4). This is consistent 
with the absence of a MHET ase gene in the selected strains
(Supplementary Result S2 ), which is required to facilitate the 
assimilation of PET by-products. Only strain ISS-1242—which was 
predicted through genome analysis to encode a functional M5-
PETase—exhibited a significant reduction in PET weight compared
to negative controls without bacterial inoculation (2.7%±0.5%
at 85 days,
Fig. 3A, Supplementary Fig. S12 ), with the highest 
degradation efficiency observed when using f iltered/autoclaved
seawater (Supplementary Fig. S4 ). In contrast, PET degradation 
by ISS-721 and ISS-1225 was negligible (< 0.5% over 85 days), 
with a non-significant differentiation from the negative controls

ISS-1225 vs control: t= 1.7, df = 4, P= .15). Such minor and 
inconsistent variations in PET film weight may be attributed to 
factors unrelated to PETase enzymatic activity , including, among 
others, nonspecific microbial metabolism (e.g. acidification of the 
medium), mechanical abrasion due to agitation, or the activity 
of other ester ases with broader substrate specificity . Microcosms
inoculated withE. colishowed no PET degradation activity with
values comparable to negative controls (t= 1.7, df = 4,P= .16;
Supplementary Fig. S12). HPLC confirmed the degradation of the 
PET film with the formation of mainly TP A, whereas MHET was
present in low quantity (Fig. 3B). The PET -degrading strain ISS-
1242 colonized the PET film surface, forming small and sep arate
colonies without creating a homogeneous biofilm (Fig. 3C), as pre-
viously observed for other marine degraders [59]. Magnifications 
at single-cell resolution revealed that bacteria were anch ored
to the PET film ( Fig. 3D), resulting in surface alteration with 
irregularities, erosion, deposits, cavities, and fissures ( Fig. 3D) 
compared with control films (Supplementary Fig. S13). 
The in vivo functional assay revealed that only bacteria encod-
ing enzymes with the complete M5 motif—along with a sig-
nal peptide enabling extracellular secretion—exhibited signifi-
cant PET -degrading activity , confirming the results ofin vitro
assays (
Fig. 2) and the overall motif ranking to determine func-
tional PETase variants proposed.
Distribution and abundance of M5-polyethylene 
terephthalate h ydrolase in the global ocean
We analysed the distribution patterns and prevalence of M5-
PETase variants across 415 marine metagenomes. To ensure 
comparability across samples and account for variations in 
microbial load, the relative abundance of M5-PETase genes was
calculated as FPKM and normalized against the FPKM of the
single-copy housekeeping generecA(
Supplementary Data S4). The 
M5-PETase variants were affiliated with the order Pseudomonadales 
(18 variants) and the phylumGemmatimonadota(5 variants)
(
Supplementary Data S1 ) and were detected in 323 samples
(Supplementary Data S4 ). The combination of these variants 
per sample defined such a differential distribution acro ss
geographic locations and along depth (mapped inFig. 4A), with a 
maximum toward the ocean interior at the base of the permanent
thermocline (1,000–2,000 m depth,Fig. 4B and C). At 11 sampling 
locations covering multiple depths, the cumulative abundance 
of M5-PETase variants increased significantly with depth (mixed-
effect model: slope for depth = 0.4,P= .0032;Fig. 4A). In the upper 
ocean (<200 m), the abundance of M5-PETase variants was highest 
near South America, South Africa, India, French Polynesia, and 
the Red Sea, while in deeper waters their prevalence peak ed
between the Atlantic and Indian Oceans at depths of 200–1,000 m
and>1,000 m (
Supplementary Fig. S14). This distribution was 
primarily associated with the presence of M5-PETases encoded 
by Gemmatimonadota and Pseudomonadales in the first portion 
of the mesopelagic ocean (100–1,000 m) and at depths below 
2,000 m, respectively , while both taxonomic groups contribute
to the abundance of these enzymes between 1,000 and 2,000 m
(
Supplementary Fig. S15). Whereas a unique bacterium does not 
necessarily encode both PETase and MHETase enzymes (as also 
shown in our isolates), MHETase genes were detected in 411 sam-
ples (
Supplementary Fig. S17and Data S5), of which 324 also har-
bored M5-PETase genes. This suggests that although the full PET 
degradation pathway may be distributed across different taxa, the 
metabolic potential for PET breakdown is present in co-occurring
microbial communities, i.e. the same metagenome sample.

abundance, at the same six depth lay ers, including only samples where M5-PETases were detected. M5-PETase normalized abundance and prevalence
across metagenome samples from different filter size ranges are reported in
Supplementary Fig. S16. 
When comparing M5-PETase abundance with plastic concen-
tration, a significant relation was detected (n= 816,P=2×10 −16, 
R2 = 0.09;Supplementary Fig. S18and Data S6A). This relationship 
was further confirmed by a 10-fold higher M5-PETase abundance 
associated with samples wher e plastic was detected (Mann–
Whitney test:P=1 0×10 −13, mean±SE M5-PETase abundance: 
absence of plastic = 0.0021±0.0003 FPKM [n= 283] vs presence of 
plastic = 0.028±0.004 FPKM [n= 533]). Some regions showing a 
high abundance of M5-PETases, such as Southern Africa and the 
eastern coast of South America (South Atlantic Gyre), coincide
with areas previously identified as microplastic accumulation
hotspots [54–56]. Besides this relationship, we also searched for 
publicly available marine metagenomic datasets collected prior 
to the widespread production of plastic to investigate whether 
the emergence of M5-PETase variants may have coincided with 
the rise in global plastic pollution. Although no metagenomic
datasets predating the 1990s were available, we identified M5-
PETase sequences in the oldest accessible marine metagenomes
from 1990 (
Supplementary Data S7 ). The identified amino acid 
sequence originates from Moraxella sp. TA144, a bacterium
isolated from Antarctic seawater [60]. This enzyme, annotated 
in UniProt as a triacylglycerol lipase (entry P19833), was recently
Identifying functional marine PETases | 11
reported to degrade highly crystalline synthetic polymers [ 61]. 
While this evidence does not establish when M5-PETases first 
evolved, it suggests that homologous enzymes with PET -degrading 
potential were already present in ocean micr obial communities
before the functional characterization ofI. sakaiensisin 2016
[
7]. This finding supports the hypothesis that marine bacteria 
may have independently repurposed ancestral hydrolases for 
PET degradation to exploit novel carbon and energy sources, i.e.
plastic, accumulating in marine environments.
Do marine microbial communities transcribe 
M5-polyethylene terephthala te hydrolase genes?
In addition to demonstrating the functionality of three M5-
PETase variantsin vitro(Fig. 2) and confirming the activity of one 
variantin vivoas for ISS-1242 ( Fig. 3), we investigated whether 
and to what extent these genes are actively transcribed in marine 
microbial communities. Since transcription represents the first 
step of gene expression, its detection serves as a proxy for 
assessing the potential functionality and ecological relevance 
of M5-PETases in marine ecosystems. Transcriptional acti vity
from metatranscriptomic data (metaTdataset) supports that M5-
PETases are not only present in oceanic microbial communities
as silent genes but are also actively transcribed (
Supplementary 
Fig. S19). Specifically , six M5-PETase gene variants—including 
the PETase_12.M5 encoded by Pseudomonas strain ISS-1242— 
were found in 86 samples out of the 187 included in themetaT
dataset, with a range of 1 to 4 (median = 1) variants per sample
(Supplementary
Data S8A ). In addition, such variants were 
transcribed in 35 other samples from the metaT dataset beyond 
those represented in theTaraOceans metagenomic gene catalog
[
33]. Interestingly , we found transcripts for MHETases in 163 ocean
samples (Supplementary Data S8B), of which 113 samples also 
showed transcriptional signatures for M5-PETase, supporting the 
existence of a metabolic continuum for PET degr adation at the
microbial community level throughout the seawater column.
Taxonomic analysis further confirmed that transcribed PETase 
genes primarily originated from bacteria of the Pseudomonadales 
order, including genera such as Pseudomonas and members of the 
family Moraxellaceae. We also detected M5-PETases transcribed in 
samples from the Antarctic by members of the Oceanospirillales 
order, such as Oleispira antarctica. If we consider the depth 
prof iles explored by metatranscriptomic datasets (no deeper than
800 m), it is evident that transcription of M5-PETases was mainly
detected at the surface, with the exception of samples in the
Pacific Ocean (
Supplementary Fig. S19 ). Yet, when comparing 
M5-PETase transcript abundance with plastic concentration, a 
significant relation was detected (n= 506,P=1×10 −5, R 2 = 0.04;
Supplementary Fig. S20 and Data S6B ). This relationship was 
further confirmed by a 10-fold higher M5-PETase transcripts 
abundance associated with samples where plastic was detected
(Mann–Whitney test:P=1 0×10
−13, mean±SE PETase transcripts 
abundance: absence of plastic = 0.002±0.001 [n= 192] vs presence 
of plastic = 0.02±0.005 [n= 314]).
Are ocean M5-polyethylene terephthalate 
hydrolase different from those encoded by
terrestrial microorganisms?
The metagenomic and metatranscriptomic analyses conducted 
on datasets from the Tara Ocean and Malaspina Expedition 
revealed that M5-PETase variants are primarily affiliated with
thePseudomonadalesorder (
Fig. 1B). We thus questioned whether 
this taxonomic pattern represents a distinct signature of ocean-
derived PETase variants or reflects a broader trend observed 
across diverse ecosystems, including terrestrial environments. 
To investigate this question, we retrieved and analysed PETase 
sequences matching the M5 motif across multiple publicly avail-
able repositories and databases, e nsuring coverage across a wide
range of environmental settings. Phylogenetic analysis revealed a
stark difference in the distribution of M5-PETases between terres-
trial and oceanic ecosystems (
Supplementary Figs S21 and S22). 
While Pseudomonadales (i.e. Pseudomonas spp. and Halopseudomonas 
spp.) dominate the M5-PETase representation in marine envi-
ronments, terrestrial ecosystems exhibit a broader taxonomic 
diversity , with Actinobacterota (among others, Streptomyces, Actino-
planes, Actinokineospora, Saccharothrix, Nocardiopsis, Thermobifida, 
Actinomadur a),Betaproteobacteria(PiscinibacterandRoseateles), and
Gammaproteobacteria(Pseudomonas,Halopseudomonas,Vibrio,a n d
Ketobacter) encoding such gene variants (
Supplementary Data S9). 
Although taxonomic analysis supports a distinct divergence 
in M5-PETase between ocean and land environments, this 
taxonomic confinement is associated with the stringent motif 
criteria. When expanding the analysis to include DLH genes with 
motifs M1–M4, a broader taxonomic distribution also emerged in
marine environments, includingPlanctomycetota,Flavobacteriales,
Oceanospirillales,Phycisphaerales,Zetaproteobacteria,a n dCandidatus
Marinibacteria (
Supplementary Data S1). Considering that M1–M4 
represent DLH enzymes that cannot degrade PET (as sho wn by the
in vitroassays inSupplementary Fig. S9), our results support that 
although genes encoding pseudo-PETase enzymes are widespread 
across various bacterial taxa, only Pseudomonadales have primarily 
used these a s a basis to develop PET -degrading M5 variants in
marine environments.
Discussion 
In this study , we developed a motif-based classification system 
to distinguish functional PETases from non−/pre-functional vari-
ants or pseudo-PETases that utilize different substrates. The iden-
tified PETase-defining M5 motif incorporates structural elements 
essential for efficient substrate recognition and catalysis. The 
functionality of the M5 motif was experimentally confirmed, as 
only PETase variants containing this specific motif had measur-
able PET degradation activity , achieving 25%–50% of the efficacy
observed for theIsPETase (Is-WT).
The M5 motif imposes strict structural and functional con-
straints, requiring not only the presence of the full catalytic 
triad but also specific amino acid residues essential for substrate 
binding and enzyme stability . These features make the M5 motif a 
far more selective criterion than the broadly defined DLH domain, 
which has been widely used in previous studies to search for 
potential PETases. This stringenc y results in a more restricted but
functionally relevant set of sequences. For instance, applying the
Hidden Markov Model (HMM)-based search method for putative
PET hydrolases proposed by Danso and colleagues [
29] t o o u r 
dataset of 75 sequences containing DLH domain, we identified 
37 candidate sequences, including all 23 that met our M5 motif 
criteria, as well as an additional 14 sequences with lower motifs .
While this non-stringent search approach can expand the pool
of potential PETase-encoding genes and increase the observed
taxonomic diversity (see M4 variants in
Supplementary Data S1), 
it also introduces uncertainty about functional capacity . The fact 
that only genes encoding enzymes with a complete M5 motif 
exhibited PET -degrading activity indicates that many proteins 
containing the DLH domain resembling PETase sequences at the 
structural level are likely adapted to act on different substrates
or perform other biological functions. Indeed, the DLH domain is
12 | Alamet al.
part of a broad family of α/β-hydrolases known to act on a range 
of substr ates, including lactones, esters, and other xenobiotics
[62]. Without the specific structural refinements encoded by the 
M5 motif—such as the conserved catalytic triad and substrate-
stabilizing residues—these pr oteins do not possess the biochemi-
cal features necessary for effective PET degradation.
The application of this stringent criterion to ocean meta-
genomes resulted in a restricted taxonomic distribution, with 
M5-PETase variants primarily detected within the order Pseu-
domonadales and the phylum Gemmatimonadota. H o w e v e r , i f w e 
extend our analysis to a broader dataset of 80,000 DLH domain-
containing sequences from UniProt—spanning ecosystems 
beyond the marine environment—we retrieved 379 compliant 
sequences (compar ed to 505 putative PETase sequences identified
via HMM search) that span a wider range of bacterial taxa, such as
ActinomycetesandBetaproteobacteriafrom terrestrial ecosystems,
as well asGammaproteobacteria/Pseudomonadalesin both marine
and non-marine ecosystems [
63–65]. This demonstrates that our 
filtering approach does not inherently exclude PETases from 
diverse taxonomic groups but rather captures those sequences 
that most closely conform to the structural requirements for 
PET degradation. It also highlights a clear compositional shift 
in the microbial communities harboring functional M5-PETase
variants, depending on the ecosystem, with marine environments
predominantly enriched inPseudomonadales, whereas terrestrial
systems exhibit broader taxonomic representation [
29, 63, 64]. The 
observed prevalence of M5-PETase genes and transcripts within 
Pseudomonadales can be explained by a combination of biological 
and environmental factors that contribute to their ecological
success in marine ecosystems [ 66] and in degr ading plastics
[67]. A key factor is their high genetic adaptability in response 
to environmental pressures facilitated by a rapid mutation rate
and horizontal gene transfer [68]. Another contributing factor is 
the pre-adaptation of Pseudomonadales, particularly Pseudomonas 
species, to organic pollutants. The structural similarity between 
PET -derived compounds, synthetic polymers and aromatic 
hydr ocarbons may have facilitated the development of pseudo-
PETase enzymes in different variants [
69], likely via functional 
con vergence.
In addition to the in vitro functional assay , microcosms 
inoculated with marine bacteria encoding M5- and non-M5-
PETases were used to validate the predictive power of the 
motif-based classification. Beyond providing proof-of-concept 
for our classification framework, the in vivo assays revealed 
ho w the M5-PETase-encoding ISS-1242 strain degraded and
altered PET films but did not use such substrate as the sole
carbon source, asI. sakaiensisdoes [
7]. A possible reason may 
be the absence of the MHETase-like gene, which enables them 
to use PET as an alternative carbon and energy source to grow
[
70]. A bioinformatics scan failed to detect potential MHETase-
like genes in the genomes of the three isolates, even though 
the y were detected inPseudomonasfrom marine metagenomes
(search in NCBI,
Supplementary Table S 4). However, the extended 
presence of MHETase-like genes in marine microbial communities 
from samples of the Ta raOceans and the Malaspina Expedition
(
Supplementary Fig. S17 and Data S5 ) suggests that plastic 
degradation in the oceans may rely on consortia of microor-
ganisms with synergistic activities distributed over different 
bacterial classes in the same habitat. The composition of these 
communities is indeed dynamic and can vary based on several
factors, such as the type of plastic, location, and surrounding
environmental conditions [
71–73]. Their associated microbial 
guild is consistently dominated by heterotroph members of 
Pseudomonadota (formerl yProteobacteria,s u c ha sGammaproteobac-
teriaandAlphaproteobacteria)[
21], with a particular a bundance of
Pseudomonadales[ 20] that alone have been reported to degrade 35
different plastic types [64]. Beyond their functional role in plastic 
degradation, the microbial colonization dynamic and succession 
of PET and PET -derived substrates as the sole carbon source 
revealed that se veral taxonomic groups are pioneers, whereas
Pseudomonasare only middle or late colonizers [
69, 74], possibly 
because they lack the capacity to grow only by using PET in a 
relatively short time, as observed in our experiments. Thus, 
PETase-containing bacteria may utilize PET a s an expanding
resource in the deep ocean, where organic substrates are notably
diluted [
26], even if effective degradation and depletion of this 
“unusual” carbon source (and other plastics) d epend on the
collaborative presence of diverse bacteria [74, 75]. 
The widespread presence of PETase genes and their tr anscripts
(mRNA) across oceans (Fig. 4 and Supplementary Fig. S19), com-
bined with the acute carbon limitation in bathypelagic waters [26], 
suggests that exposure to plastic [76] may trigger the spontaneous 
evolution of this metabolic trait in ocean microbiomes. How-
ever, we acknowledge that other environmental factors, such as 
temperature and pH, may shape the distribution and expression 
of such enzymes, their intrinsic properties, and overall perfor-
mance. Co-occurring stressors such as heavy metal contamina-
tion, hydrocarbon pollution, or eutrophication-related shifts in 
nutrient availability and oxygen levels can indeed significantly
influence microbial community composition and functional gene
dynamics. These factors may act synergistically or antagonisti-
cally with plastic pollution, potentially selecting microorganisms
with broader metabolic versatility , including those capable of
degrading PET.
While the naturally occurring PETases remain far from match-
ing the catalytic eff iciency of engineered high-performance vari-
ants [9, 14, 42], their functional validation (M5 motif confirmed 
in vitro and in vivo) and transcriptional activity (as detected by 
metatranscriptomic analyses) provide strong evidence that expo-
sure to plastic-derived substrates is shaping microbial metabolic 
pathways across oceans. However, a major limitation is the lack 
of DNA-derived datasets from ocean samples collected prior to 
the widespread introduction of plastic pollutants. Although we 
searched publicly available metagenomic archives for such his-
torical data, the oldest accessible datasets date back only to the 
early 1990s—by which time pseudo-PETase sequences, including 
M5-compliant variants, were already detectable. This prevents us 
from directly assessing whether the emergence or enrichment 
of PET -degrading M5-DLH domain enzymes was a consequence 
of exposure to plastic pollution. Future efforts to re trieve and
sequence well-preserved, archived marine samples from the pre-
plastic era could offer unprecedented insight into the temporal
dynamics, emergence, and potential anthropogenic selection of
functional M5-PETases. Such data will help determine whether
motifs like M5 evolved as a direct response to plastic introduction
or if they represent pre-existing enzymatic adaptations co-opted
under new environmental pressures.
