ABSTRACT
The widespread consumption of PET worldwidehas necessitated the search for environment‐friendly methods for PET degradation and
recycling. Among these methods, biodegradation stands out as a promising approach for recycling PET. The discovery of duo enzyme
system PETase and MHETase in 2016, along with their engineered variants, has demonstrated significant potential in breaking down
PET. Previous studies have also demonstrated that the activity of the enzyme PETase increases when it is immobilized on nanoparticles.
To achieve highly efficient and complete PET depolymerization, we immobilized both FAST‐PETase and MHETase at a specific ratio on
magnetic nanoparticles. This immobilization resulted in a 2.5‐fold increase in product release compared with free enzymes. Addi-
tionally, we achieved reusability and enhanced stability of the enzyme bioconjugates.
1 | Introduction
Polyethylene terephthalate (PET) is a widely used thermoplastic
for packaging, constituting up to 67% of the total packaging
plastic in the US (Benyathiar et al.2022). Due to its resistance to
chemical and mechanical changes, it is a significant challenge
to manage PET waste efficiently (Malik et al.2017). The two
major ways of recycling and upscaling PET are through
chemical and mechanical recycling (Smith et al.2022). Chem-
ical recycling is achieved through solvolysis or pyrolysis where
PET is degraded to its monomers of ethylene glycol (EG) and
terephthalic acid (TPA) (Cao et al.2022). These processes are
economically unfeasible and involve harsh reaction conditions,
leading to the release of harmful toxins into the environment
(Rahimi and García2017; Sinha et al.2010). On the other hand,
mechanical recycling reshapes PET into other desirable shapes,
but this can only be done for a limited number of cycles before
the polymer loses mechanical strength and cannot be used
further (Schyns and Shaver2021).
An environmentally friendly and cost‐effective alternative is the
biodegradation of PET using enzymes as biological catalysts to
degrade PET into its monomers (Taniguchi et al.2019; Wei
et al. 2022). Among these enzymes, PETase exhibits high
activity at room temperature, making it ideal for PET degra-
dation at mild reaction conditions (Yoshida et al.2016). Fol-
lowing the discovery of PETase in 2016, there have been many
mutations of PETase showing better activities and thermo-
stabilities, (Lu et al.2022; Son et al.2019; Cui et al.2021) within
which FAST‐PETase exhibited the best performance with 10
times better activity than wildtype PETase at 30°C. Moreover,
PETase, along with MHETase, shows a synergistic effect in
degradation of PET to monomers TPA and EG (Knott et al.
2020). The presence of MHETase, even small ammount, is

crucial for efficient complete depolymerization of PET (Knott
et al. 2020).
One of the major obstacles to commercialize the enzyme system is
the enzyme aggregation and instability at higher concentration
(Shirke et al.2018). Reports indicate that at concentrations ex-
ceeding 150 nM, PETase begins to aggregate, resulting in reduced
enzymatic efficiency (Gercke et al.2021). To overcome these chal-
lenges, enzyme immobilization has emerged as an attractive alter-
native to solve the enzyme aggregation and instability problem
(Maghraby et al.2023;R o t he ta l .2016;Z a n u s oe ta l .2021;T s a ie ta l .
2013). Magnetic nanoparticles, withinall different supporting plat-
forms for enzyme immobilization (Maghraby et al.2023), have
advantages such as being biofriendly and easy separation (Bilal et al.
2018; Schwaminger et al.2019a;L e o n ge ta l .2020). Immobilization
of single enzyme PETase on nanoparticles including cobalt phos-
phate nanoflowers and iron oxide nanoparticles has shown
increased PET degradation efficiency (Schwaminger et al.2021;J i a
et al.2021). However, these system has not achieved complete PET
degradation due to the limitations of the single‐enzyme approach.
In this work, we propose a novel approach of immobilizing both
FAST‐PETase and MHETase on iron oxide nanoparticles in
appropriate ratio to maximize PET degradation and achieve
complete depolymerization of PET to TPA and EG. These bio-
conjugates, formed through the electrostatic interactions
between his tag on the enzymes and the nanoparticle,
(Schwaminger et al.2019b) enhances the efficiency of the PET
degradation system. Additionally, the bioconjugates exhibit
improved stability and reusability, demonstrating the potential
of the immobilization system for plastic waste management.
2 | Experimental Section
2.1 | Expression and Purification of Proteins
pBbE8k‐FAST PETase was constructed and transformed on
E. coli NEB5α and then on E. coli SHuffleT7 for expression.
pET21a‐MHETase was constructed and transformed onE. coli
NEB5α and thenE. coliC41(DE3) for expression. The enzymes
were expressed and then purified using the hexa‐histidine tag
with Ni‐NTA column.
2.2 | Immobilize MHETase and Fast PETase
on MNPs
Varying concentrations of the enzyme mixture(0.1–0.3 g/L) were
added to 1 g/L magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs, iron oxide nano-
particles, 15 nm, Sigma Aldrich) and incubated at 25°C with
shaking at 250 rpm for 2 h. There are two approaches to addition of
enzymes on the MNPs, simultaneous and sequential. The simulta-
neous approach involves addition of both enzymes at the same
time, while the sequential approach involves addition of MHETase
at t = 0 h and then addition of FAST‐PETase att =1h . T h e M N P‐
enzyme nano‐bioconjugates are separated using a Magnet. The
supernatant was analyzed for quantifying the protein through DC
Protein Assay (Biorad). The DC protein assay is a colorimetric assay
for protein concentration measurement based on the Lowry assay.
This assay primarily consists oftwo steps leading to color devel-
opment, the reaction between protein and copper in an alkaline
medium, and the subsequent reduction of Folin reagent by the
copper‐treated protein. This resultsin the formation of a charac-
teristic blue color, which can be recorded using absorbance at
750 nm. A 10% SDS‐PAGE Gel is also run with the supernatant to
visualize the enzyme immobilized on the MNPs. The nano‐
bioconjugates were washed thrice with PBS and stored in PBS
at 4°C.
2.3 | Enzyme Activity on PET Film
PET film (Goodfellow ES301445) was washed with 70% Ethanol.
1 μM (0.029 g/L) total enzyme was incubated with the PET film to a
final volume of 300 uL reaction medium (pH 7.5 50 mM NaH
2PO4,
100 mM NaCl, 10% (v/v) DMSO) for 96 h at 30°C and 250 RPM.
Samples were collected at 96 h, and heat treated at 85°C for 20 min
to denature and inactivate enzymes in the solution. The samples
were passed through 0.22μm spin filters before HPLC analysis. The
TPA concentration was then determined through HPLC analysis at
2 4 0 n m .S a m es t e p sa r ef o l l o w e df o rbioconjugates as well, where
nano‐bioconjugates (NBCs) are added to achieve a final enzyme
concentration of 1μM.
2.4 | Reusability and Stability
The MNPs were separated from the reaction medium using a
magnet. They were washed thrice with PBS (pH 7.4) and stored at
4°C. pNPA (para‐Nitrophenyl acetate) was used as a substrate for
the determination of activity of the bioconjugates and free enzyme
for reusability and stability. Forthe assay, a final concentration of
2m MpNPA and 5% (v/v) DMSO was used with a 200μLf i n a l
reaction volume of PBS (pH 7.4) (Zhu et al.2022). The assay is
conducted in a 96 well plate and the absorbance is monitored at
405 nm for 10 min with 30 s intervals.
3 | Results and Discussion
3.1 | Immobilization of Enzymes on MNPs
PETase and MHETase have shown a synergistic effect in the
complete depolymerization of PET to its monomers of TPA and
EG (Knott et al.2020). The presence of MHETase, even small
amount, is crucial for efficient complete depolymerization of
PET. However, the concentration of MHETase has mininal
impact on the depolymerization performance of the two en-
zyme system (Knott et al.2020). With the mutant varient FAST‐
PETase, we observed a similar behavior, achieving optimal
product yield at a molar ratio of 20:1 between FAST‐PETase and
MHETase. At MHETase concentrations lower than this, the
product release began to decline (Supplementary Fig.1).
Aiming to maximize PET degradation, we sought to immobilize
the enzymes on nanoparticles at the optimal ratio of 20:1. Given
the relatively minor ratio of MHETase, we employed two
immobilization strategies to maximize enzyme loading at this
ratio: a simultaneous method, where both enzymes were added
1398 of 1609 Biotechnology and Bioengineering, 2025
together, and a sequential method, where MHETase was added
before FAST‐PETase.
The immobilization of FAST‐PETase and MHETase onto nano-
particles was verified qualitatively using SDS‐PAGE analysis
(Supplementary Fig.2) and quantitatively using protein concen-
tration DC Assay. The analysis of the supernatant before and after
magnetic beads immobilization indicated the successful enzyme
binding onto the nanoparticles Figure (1b). We explored enzyme
concentrations ranging from 0.1to 0.3 g/L for both immobilization
methods. While sequential addition showed no advantages at the
lower concentration of 0.1 g/L, it displayed increased enzyme
loading at 0.3 g/L, likely due to reduced competitive binding, steric
hindrance of enzymes, or aggregation that happens at higher
enzyme concentration as compared to simultaneous addition.
MHETase is two‐fold higher in molecular weight as well as 1.8‐fold
larger in dimensions when compared to FAST‐PETase, which is
one of the factors resulting into steric hindrance (Knott et al.2020).
At an initial concentration of 0.3 g/L, enzyme loading for sequential
addition (~0.2 g/L) wasapproximately double that of simultaneous
addition (~0.1 g/L). Notably, sequential addition resulted in a higher
proportion of MHETase on the nanoparticles, as evidenced by SDS‐
PAGE analysis of the supernatants (Supplementary Fig.2). Since
highest enzyme loading was observed for the initial total enzyme
concentration of 0.25 g/L and sequential addition was favored for
higher percentage of MHETase immobilization, we used these
conditions for the subsequent activity assays.
3.2 | Activity on PET Film
Bioconjugates, formed using sequential addition with an en-
zyme concentration of 0.25 g/L, were tested for enzyme activity
on PET films by high ‐performance liquid chromatography
(HPLC) analysis of depolymerization products. TPA were ana-
lyzed using HPLC traces at a wavelength of 240 nm (UV)
(Supplementary Fig.3). The peak areas were quantified against
a TPA calibration curve (Supplementary Fig. 4). Comparing
bioconjugates to an equivalent free enzyme system, the bio-
conjugates released approximately 8 mM of TPA, significantly
higher than the 3 mM observed from the free enzyme system
(Figure 2). This enhanced activity is likely due to the increased
stability of enzymes, which prevents aggregation above a con-
centration of 150 nM, as well as the synergy between FAST‐
PETase and MHETase from close proximity, which has shown
to be beneficial (Knott et al.2020).
Notably, since the bioconjugates have both FAST‐PETase and
MHETase, we observed complete depolymerization of PET to
TPA without detecting reaction intermediates like BHET or
MHET in the chromatogram of HPLC traces (Supplementary
Fig. 3). Furthermore, we observed a product release of 8 mM
TPA after a 96 h incubation of PET film at 30°C.
3.3 | Recyclability
We further tested the recyclability of the bioconjugates through
magnetic separation. Instead of PET depolymerization, we used
para‐nitrophenyl acetate (pNPA), an alternative substrate for

esterase, which upon hydrolysis, yields para‐nitrophenol – a
compound detectable by its yellowish‐green color and quanti-
fiable at 405 nm absorbance. Through successive cycles, we
found that the bioconjugates retain over 80% of their initial
activity for the first four cycles, with a subsequent decline to
50% activity after cycle 4, remaining active up to cycle 10
(Figure 3a). Control samples washed with PBS (pH 7.4) showed
the same decline trend in activity, suggesting that the activity
loss was not due to enzyme deactivation or substrate inhibition,
but potentially from agglomeration and deagglomeration of the
bioconjugates during magnetic separation (Figure 3a)
(Schwaminger et al. 2021). Despite some loss of activity, the
bioconjugates demonstrated significant reusability for up to ten
cycles, with minimal effort required for magnetic separation.
3.4 | Stability of Bioconjugates
The stability of bioconjugates was assessed by comparing the
activity of enzymes between bioconjugates and equivalent free
enzymes, both stored at 4°C. To measure enzyme activity post‐
storage, pNPA assay was used. The bioconjugates containing
both FAST‐PETase and MHETase showed stability for more
than a week without any significant loss (Figure 3b). Con-
versely, the free enzymes, stored at the same temperature,
showed a gradual decrease to approximately 40% of their initial
activity after a 12‐day period.
4 | Conclusion
The immobilization of enzymes onto inorganic scaffolds has
proven effective to enhance enzyme activity. In our study fo-
cusing on degrading PET using dual‐enzyme system, we opted
to immobilize FAST‐PETase and MHETase onto iron oxide
nanoparticles. These two enzymes work in synergy to com-
pletely depolymerize PET to its monomers. Through sequential
addition, we successfully immobilized these enzymes on the
iron oxide nanoparticles, ensuring an excess of FAST‐PETase
enzyme. This sequential addition approach not only facilitated
efficient immobilization but also improved the total enzyme
loading on the nanoparticles compared with simultaneous
addition. This two‐enzyme system on nanoparticles exhibited a
2.5‐fold increase in TPA formation compared with free enzyme
system. Furthermore, we demonstrated the reusability of the
enzyme bioconjugates using simple magnetic separation.
Additionally, the enzyme bioconjugates showed enhanced sta-
bility when stored at 4°C compared to the free enzyme. Overall,
we achieved complete depolymerization of PET using our en-
zyme bioconjugates, along with additional advantages of reu-
sability and stability through immobilization on nanoparticles.
This work could apply to other multi‐enzyme systems with non‐
equimolar requirements to enhance activity through
immobilization.
