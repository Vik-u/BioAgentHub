The large-scale preparation of Polyehylene terephthalate (PET) hydrolysing enzymes in low-
cost is critical for the biodegradation of PET in industry. In the present study, we demonstrate
that the post-translational glycosylation ofPichia pastoris makes it a remarkable host for the
heterologous expression of PETase from Ideonella sakaiensis 201-F6 (IsPETase). Taking
advantage of the abundant N- and O-linked glycosylation sites inIsPETase and the efﬁcient
post-translational modiﬁcation in endoplasmic reticulum, IsPETase is heavily glycosylated
during secretory expression withP. pastoris, which improves the speciﬁc activity and ther-
mostability of the enzyme dramatically. Moreover, the speciﬁc activity ofIsPETase increased
further after the bulky N-linked polysaccharide chains were eliminated by Endo- β-N-
acetylglucosaminidase H (Endo H). Importantly, the partially deglycosylatedIsPETase still
maintained high thermostability because of the remaining mono- and oligo-saccharide resi-
dues on the protein molecules. Consequently, the partially deglycosylatedIsPETase was able
to be applied at 50 °C and depolymerized raw, untreated PETﬂakes completely in 2 to 3 days.
This platform was also applied for the preparation of a famous variant ofIsPETase, Fast-
PETase, and the same result was achieved. Partially deglycosylated Fast-PETase demon-
strates elevated efﬁciency in degrading postconsumer-PET trays under 55 °C than 50 °C, the
reported optimal temperature of Fast-PETase. The present study provides a strategy to
modulate thermostable IsPETase through glycosylation engineering and paves the way for
promoting PET biodegradation from laboratories to factories.

P
olyehylene terephthalate (PET) is one the most used and
synthesized plastics 1. It is widely used in the textile,
packaging, and bottle producing industries due to their high
durability, elasticity, strength, and resistance to chemicals. On the
other hand, the same characteristics caused serious problems in
the natural degradation of PET
2.E fﬁcient, low-cost, and eco-
friendly methods for the degradation of PET is in urgent need
considering the increasing consumption and accommodation of
PET in the environment. In 2005, Muller et al reported the
biodegradation of PET with a PETase-like enzyme secreted by
Thermobiﬁda fusca for the ﬁrst time3. Since then, many PET
hydrolysing enzymes were identiﬁed and PET is by far the most
studied polymer in terms of biodegradation4. Among these PET
hydrolysing enzymes, PETase derived fromIdeonella sakaiensis
201-F6, bacterium is able to use PET as the main carbon source5.
However, this enzyme is thermosensitive and loses most of its
activity within 24 h at 37 °C, which is unfavorable for the reaction
since PET has a glass transition temperature (Tg) of 76 °C6. Based
on the structure and the catalytic mechanism of IsPETase7,8,
rational design and computational learning were carried out to
improve its activity and thermostability. Among them, three
outstanding variants were generated, namely ThermoPETase9,
DuraPETase10 and Fast-PETase11. Especially the recent reported
Fast-PETase, which bearing 5 mutations in comparison with
wild-type IsPETase, is capable of depolymerizing untreated,
postconsumer-PET from 51 different thermoformed products
almost completely in 1 week. These remarkable achievements
implied a bright prospect for the industrial biodegradation of PET
in the near future. To transform the biodegradation of PET from
laboratory to industry, large-scale preparation of enzymes under
low-cost is crucial. The methylotrophic yeastPichia pastoris(also
known asKomagataella phafﬁ) is a commonly used workhorse in
producing heterologous proteins for industries 12,13. With the
tightly regulated AOX1 promoter, efﬁcient secretory expression,
and the high-density fermentation technique, the yield of het-
erologous proteins can reach >20 g/L14. Moreover, the post-
translational glycosylation of P. pastoris tends to increase the
expression yield of the target proteins further because the gly-
coproteins are more resistant to proteinases, hence, facilitates the
accumulation during the fermentation15. Plenty of examples have
proved it is powerful in the large-scale preparation of bio-
pharmaceuticals and industrial enzymes14.
In the present study, we prepared the recombinantIsPETase
with P. pastoris GS115 as the host. Taking advantage of the gene
dosage effect of the multicopy expression strategy, the yield of the
target protein reached approximately 1.2 mg/mL with the high-
density fermentation of 5-L fermentors. Moreover, we discovered
the post-translational glycosylation ofP. pastoris makes itself an
excellent system for the preparation ofIsPETase. The potential
glycosylation sites in IsPETase were glycosylated during the
secretory expression on varying degrees. Meanwhile, the high-
level expression may prolong the retention time of the target
protein in endoplasmic reticulum, leading to long polysaccharide
chains. Therefore, the recombinant IsPETase (referred to as
IsPETase-Pp) was heavily glycosylated, which promoted the
folding and stability of IsPETase-Pp, leading to higher speciﬁc
activity and thermostability than IsPETase expressed with
Escherichia coli as the host (referred to asIsPETase-Ec). More-
over, the bulky N-linked glycan side chains of hyperglycosylation
were removed easily with a glycohydrolase, Endo- β-N-
acetylglucosaminidase H (Endo H, EC3.2.1.96) also prepared
with P. pastoris in order to eliminate their blockage on the
accessibility of the gigantic PET polymer toIsPETase. The speciﬁc
activity of IsPETase-Pp enhanced further after the partial degly-
cosylation (referred to as partial-deglyco IsPETase-Pp) and
increased more than 60-fold in comparison with IsPETase-Ec.
More importantly, partial-deglyco IsPETase-Pp still maintained
high thermostability because of the modulation of the remaining
mono- and oligo-saccharide residues to the protein molecules.
Due to the elevated speci ﬁc activity and thermostability, the
partially deglycosylated IsPETase-Pp was able to be applied on
depolymerization of raw, untreated PETﬂakes completely in 2 to
3 days at 50 °C. Furthermore, this platform was also applied for
the preparation of Fast-PETase and the same result was achieved.
The recombinant Fast-PETase was heavily glycosylated and the
partially deglycosylated Fast-PETase (referred to as partial-
deglyco Fast-PETase- Pp) demonstrated elevated ef ﬁciency in
depolymerizing postconsumer-PET trays at 55 °C, which was 5 °C
higher than the optimal temperature of Fast-PETase expressed
with E. coli
11.
Results
The yield of the recombinant IsPETase increasing with the
copy numbers of the target gene. The recombinant P. pastoris
GS115 strains bearing 1 to 4 copies ofIsPETase gene were con-
structed and named as GS115-IP-1, GS115-IP-2, GS115-IP-3, and
GS115-IP-4, respectively. The target gene in these strains was
expressed with shake- ﬂask fermentation. The yield of the
recombinant protein reached 0.13, 0.25, 0.48 and 0.60 mg/mL
after 5-d induction, respectively. This result indicated that the
expression level of the recombinantIsPETase increased with the
gene dosage. SDS-PAGE of the fermentation supernatant indi-
cated only smears were detected after 5-d induction (Supple-
mentary Fig. 1a). Since it is the typical pattern caused by post-
translational glycosylation ofP. pastoris, we stained the gel with
glycoprotein staining kit and the result proved our deduction
(Supplementary Fig. 1b). The polysaccharide chains ofIsPETase-
Pp were removed with Endo H prepared in the present study
(Supplementary Fig. 2). Obvious bands were observed after the
treatment, which proved IsPETase-Pp was deglycosylated by
Endo H successfully (Supplementary Fig. 1c). Glycoprotein
staining also indicated the target protein was deglycosylated
(Supplementary Fig. 1d). It is worth noting that the size of the
deglycoprotein was slightly larger than the predicted molecular
weight due to the remaining N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) at
N-linked glycosylation sites after Endo H treatment and O-linked
glycans.
The characteristics of partial-deglyco IsPETase-Pp. The opti-
mum temperature of partial-deglyco IsPETase-Pp was 50 °C
(Fig. 1a), which was higher than the previous report
5. Moreover,
partial-deglyco IsPETase-Pp displayed elevated thermostability in
comparison with the previous report 16. It remained approxi-
mately 90% of its activity after 2-h incubation at 50 °C. Its activity
decreased dramatically at 60 and 70 °C, retaining less than 20% of
the activity after 2 h (Fig.1b).
Preparation of IsPETase with the high-density fermentation.
The ingredients and cultivation conditions of the shake- ﬂask
fermentation is completely different from the large-scale fer-
mentation in industry. Moreover, previous reports indicated
high-level expression caused stress to the host cellular secretary
pathway and the retaining time of the recombinant protein in the
endoplasmic reticulum or the Golgi complex is extended, which
in turn, causes the glycosyltransferase to elongate the poly-
saccharide chains and inhibit the catalytic activity ofIsPETase-Pp.
In order to investigate the glycosylation of IsPETase under
industrial condition,IsPETase-Pp was prepared with high-density
fermentation using GS115-IP-4. The expression level of IsPE-
Tase-Pp increased signiﬁcantly compared with the shake-ﬂask
fermentation and reached maximum after 5 days, with a yield of

approximately 1.20 g/L (Supplementary Fig. 3). Glycosylation
staining indicated the target protein was heavily glycosylated
(Fig. 2a, b). After the Endo H treatment, three main bands were
observed (Fig. 2c, d). The result of MS indicated the two lower
bands were IsPETase while the top band was a dihydrolipoyl
dehydrogenase of P. pastoris (Supplementary Table 2).
The catalytic activity and thermostability of partial-deglyco
IsPETase-Pp. The catalytic activity of IsPETase-Pp with or
without the Endo H treatment were investigated (Fig.3a). The
result indicated the fermentation supernatant barely had any
activity because several metal ions in the cell culture, especially
Fe3+ inhibited the catalytic activity of this enzyme dramatically
(Supplementary Fig. 4). After ultraﬁltration with a Millipore 10-
kDa cut-off membrane, the activity of the enzyme increased
obviously. Next, we treated the samples with Endo H and the
activity increased dramatically. Notably, the activity of the sample
treated with Endo H after ultraﬁltration was slightly higher than
the sample treated prior to ultraﬁltration. But it was less ther-
mostable after 1-h incubation at 55 °C. Therefore, either order is
suitable for deglycosylation of IsPETase-Pp. Meanwhile, IsPE-
Tase-Pp was treated with another important glycohydrolase,
PNGase F prepared in the present study (Supplementary Fig. 5).
The result indicated the size of the product is smaller than partial-
deglyco IsPETase-Pp using Endo H because PNGase F removes
the whole N-linked glycans (Supplementary Fig. 6). The activity
of IsPETase-Pp increased after the PNGase F treatment. But the
activity and thermostability were lower in comparison with the
Endo H treatment (Fig.3a).
Meanwhile, we optimized the processing time of Endo H.
IsPETase-Pp was treated with Endo H (ﬁnal concentration of
667 nM) for 0.5, 1 and 1.5 h. The result indicated 0.5-h treatment
demonstrated the highest initial activity (Fig.3b). The thermo-
stability of the samples was also investigated. Although the
thermostability of the sample with 0.5-h treatment was weaker
than the other two after incubated at 55 °C for 30 min, the
residual activities at 2 h were similar, which implied 0.5-h
treatment was enough. Taking all these results together,
IsPETase-Pp after ultra ﬁltration was deglycosylated with
667 nM of Endo H for 0.5 h at 28 °C from now on. It is worth
noting, Endo H only partially deglycosylatedIsPETase-Pp under
this condition and the product was a mixture ofIsPETase bearing
heterogeneous glycan side chains.
After treated with Endo H under the above-mentioned
condition, the target protein was puriﬁed with Ni-NTA resin
and its Tm value was identiﬁed with CD spectrum. Tm of partial-
deglyco IsPETase-Pp was 62.05 °C (Supplementary Fig. 7), which
is higher thanIsPETase-Ec in the previous report17. Because the
optimal temperature of partial-deglyco IsPETase-Pp was 50 °C,
the thermostabilities of partial-deglycoIsPETase-Pp at 40, 45 and
50 °C were investigated. The result indicated that the enzyme was
very stable at 40 °C and maintained full activity after 12 h. The
protein remained approximately 60% of the activity after 12 h at
45 °C. At 50 °C, the enzyme retained more than 40% of its activity
after 6 h (Fig.4a). On the contrary,IsPETase-Ec lost almost full
activity within 1 h under the same conditions. The result of SDS-
PAGE was consistent with the data of the residual activities
(Fig. 4b).
The kinetics of partial-deglyco IsPETase-Pp. The speci ﬁc
activity of IsPETase-Pp increased from 20.6 U/mg to 62.4 U/mg
after deglycosylation (Table 1), which was signiﬁcantly higher
than IsPETase-Ec (approximately 1.8 U/mg). This result indicated
that post-translational glycosylation promoted the proper folding
of the protein besides the thermostability. It is reported that the
main hydrolytic products ofIsPETase-Ec were TPA and MHET,
which is consistent with our result. However, the major product
(above 90%) of partial-deglycoIsPETase-Pp was TPA (Table1).
To investigate whether partial-deglycoIsPETase-Pp has elevated
catalytic activity to converse MHET to TPA, the kinetic para-
meters of partial deglyco- IsPETase-Pp and IsPETase-Ec with
MHET and BHET as the substrates were investigated. Although
the catalytic turnover of partial-deglyco IsPETase-Pp was
approximately 3.1-fold higher than IsPETase-Ec, the afﬁnity of
partial-deglyco IsPETase-Pp with BHET was approximately 2.7-
fold lower, leading to a similarkcat/KM for both enzymes. On the
contrary, the catalytic turnover of partial-deglyco IsPETase-Pp
was 2.4-fold higher thanIsPETase-Ec, causing an approximately
3-fold increase in kcat/KM for partial-deglyco IsPETase-Pp
(Table 2, Supplementary Fig. 8). The higherkcat/KM of partial-
deglyco IsPETase-Pp explained why most of the hydrolytic pro-
duct was TPA.
Analysis of the glycosylation modi ﬁcation in IsPETase-Pp.
There are 8 potential N-linked glycosylation sites in IsPETase
(Supplementary Fig. 9). These sites scatter on the surface of
IsPETase and locate on the coils linkingβ-sheets and α-helixes.
These features facilitate the N-glycosylation of the proteins and
explain the heavy glycosylation of IsPETase. The glycan mod-
iﬁcation in IsPETase-Pp was investigated with MS/MS. The

N-linked modiﬁcation sites and main types of the polysaccharide
chains are listed in Supplementary Table 3 and 4. The result
indicated that N-linked glycosylation was detected with all eight
potential sites. Five out of the eight potential glycosylation sites,
N114, N138, N212, N264 and N288 showed high signal while the
signals of N190, N205 and N277 were much weaker (N stands for
Asn), which was detected when N-linked glycan score was set as 0
(Supplementary Table 3A and 4A). The degree of glycosylation
was different with each site (Supplementary Table 3B and 4B).
Notably, Asp206 next to Asn205 belongs to the catalytic triad of
IsPETase. Since the signal of N205 was weak (Supplementary
Table 4C, Supplementary Fig. 10), we proposed the effect of
glycosylation to the hydrolytic center was slight, which implied
the glycosylation inhibited the catalytic activity of the enzyme
through shielding the enzyme molecules from the substrate rather
than blocking the catalytic site. Meanwhile, the result also
demonstrated that there are 19 O-linked glycosylation sites on
IsPETase-Pp (Supplementary Table 5). For O-linked glycosyla-
tion, oligosaccharides are attached to Ser or Thr residues through
glycosidic linkages. Therefore, the pattern was more complex.
However, O-linked glycans were relatively shorter (Supplemen-
tary Table 5C) and the ratio of glycosylated protein were lower in
comparison with N-linkage (Supplementary Table 5B), hence the
shielding effect was much weaker, and explained why Endo H
treatment was enough to recover the activity of the protein.
Based on the result of MS/MS, we constructed the three-
dimensional structure of the glycoprotein at GLYCAM-Web
(Supplementary Fig. 11). Although the protein is covered with

than the other facets.
Expression of Fast-PETase withP. pastoris GS115. Recently, an
IsPETase variant, Fast-PETase with much higher thermostability
and activity was generated11. We chose this variant to test the
generalizability of this PETase preparation strategy. There is no
overlapping between the glycosylation sites (including O- and N-
linked) and the mutation sites in Fast-PETase (Supplementary
Fig. 12). The result of SDS-PAGE indicated that Fast-PETase-Pp
was also heavily glycosylated with either the shake-ﬂask (Sup-
plementary Fig. 13) or high-density fermentation (Fig.5a). With
the high-density fermentation, the yield of the target protein
reached 0.4 mg/mL using single copy of the Fast-PETase gene.
The variant barely had any activity even after the ultraﬁlitration
and its activity was elevated signiﬁcantly after Endo H treatment
(Fig. 5b). In addition, partial-deglyco Fast-PETase-Pp demon-
strated high thermostability. It retained above 80%, 70% and 60%
of the catalytic activity after incubated at 50, 55 and 60 °C for
12 h, respectively. Its thermostability decreased dramatically at
65 °C and retained only 10% of activity after 12 h. At 70 °C, the
full activity was lost within 3 h (Fig.5c).
Depolymerization of the raw, untreated postconsumer-PET.
The ability to depolymerize postconsumer-PET, such as con-
tainers and bottles is the primary need in practice. Therefore, the
recombinant IsPETase and Fast-PETase were applied to degrade
commercial raw, untreated postconsumer-PET. The PET trays
were purchased online randomly. The percentage crystallinity of
the black and white trays are 13.34% and 9.04%, respectively
(Supplementary Fig. 14). The experiments were carried out at
50 °C. Partial-deglycoIsPETase-Pp retained approximately 40%
and 20% activity after 6 and 12 h at 50 °C. Therefore, fresh
enzyme was added every 12 h. Partial-deglyco IsPETase-Pp
depolymerized a hole-punched blackﬂake in 2 days and a white
ﬂake in 3 days (Fig.6a). The result of HPLC indicated PET was
degraded in an almost linear speed and the major product was
TPA (Fig. 6b). Just as its name stated, partial-deglyco Fast-
PETase-Pp degraded raw PET even faster. In 2 days, a whiteﬂake
or a black ﬂake was completely degraded with replenishing
enzyme once. In addition, a black tray of 5.4 g was depolymerized
in 3 days with partial-deglyco Fast-PETase-Pp at 50 °C (Fig.6c).
Moreover, partial-deglyco Fast-PETase- Pp demonstrated even
higher efﬁciency at 55 °C in comparison with 50 °C (Supple-
mentary Fig. 15), which is consistent with the result of the
thermostability assay. Neither enzyme displayed visible degrada-
tion to commercial PET water bottles in 2 days.
Discussion
The glycosylation of proteins is common in yeasts. In this post-
translational modiﬁcation process, proteins are passed into the
endoplasmic reticulum cotranslationally and glycosylated, fol-
lowed by sending to the Golgi complex for further processing,
and then are either targeted to various organelles, become plasma
membrane components, or secreted into the periplasm
15. Pre-
vious reports indicated the covalent binding of glycans to the
protein surface increase solubility of the protein and its resistance
to proteolysis. The glycans also enhance the thermodynamic and
kinetic stability of the target protein18. However, quantiﬁcation
and generalization of these effects and the molecular components
that dictate the capability of the attachments to modulate protein
characteristics are still lacking19.I n P. pastoris, majority of the
oligosaccharide modiﬁcation belong to N-linked glycans and only
a small portion is O-glycosidic linkage in most of the
glycoproteins20. To date, the O-linked glycans in this organism is
still ambiguous21. On the other hand, more information was
gained about the N-linked glycans. In most cases, N-linked gly-
cosylation happens on an Asn residue as part of the consensus
sequence Asn-X-Ser/Thr (where X is any amino acid except Pro).

Previous reports also indicated that occupied glycosylation sites
tend to be located inﬂexible regions of the protein. Moreover, it is
hypothesized that the greater stabilization effect is achieved when
the attached glycan is located at a moreﬂexible region (e.g. a
loop) of the protein while a signiﬁcant destabilization occurs if
the glycosylation site is located at a highly structured region22.
Seven out eight of the N-linked glycan sites in IsPETase are
located on the loops of the protein surface. These theories
explained why IsPETase was heavily glycosylated andIsPETase-
Pp displayed signiﬁcantly higher speciﬁc activity and thermo-
stability in comparison with IsPETase-Ec. The glycosylation of
another famous PET hydrolyase, LCC (Leaf and branch compost
cutinase) also led to improved stability to native state aggregation
and increased the temperature for thermal induced aggregation
by 10 °C when expressed withP. pastoris23. The enhanced activity
of deglycosylated BurPL-DM and IsPETase expressed using P.
pastoris has been reported previously24, but the increase is not as
obvious as the present study. It is likely the ingredient and con-
dition of the high-density fermentation facilitated the glycosyla-
tion of IsPETase and improved its characteristics more
signiﬁcantly.
The reasons why the partially deglycosylatedIsPETase-Pp has
higher hydrolytic activity than IsPETase-Pp are complex. The
N-linked glycan on Asn205 is likely to affect the enzymatic
activity because Asp206 residue belongs to the triad ofIsPETase.
However, Asn205 happened to be occupied at very low level. The
reason is unknown. But it implied it is not the main reason for the
inhibition. On the other hand, the bulky N-linked glycans could
block the interaction between the substrate with the enzymes.
Consistent with this hypothesis,IsPETase-Pp couldn’t be puriﬁed
with Ni-NTA af ﬁnity chromatography while partial-deglyco
IsPETase-Pp was capable to be puriﬁed under the same condi-
tion. Therefore, we don’t suggest to improve the catalytic activity
by simply eliminating the glycan side chains attached to Asn205
through site-directed mutagenesis. Previously, we developed a
method to remove N-linked polysaccharide side chains from the
enzymes in the supernatant of the high-density fermentation with
Endo H directly
17. Because commercial Endo H is very expensive
and unsuitable for the large-scale deglycosylation of industrial
enzymes, we usedP. pastoris to prepare Endo H. Without pur-
iﬁcation, this recombinant endoglycosidase is able to remove
N-linked polysaccharide side chains from glycoproteins in the

supernatant of the high-density fermentation ofP. pastoris. In the
present study, we used this strategy to enhance the activity of the
recombinant IsPETase. IsPETase-Pp still retained high thermo-
stability after the long polysaccharide chains were removed. There
is a GlcNAc residue left after the Endo H cleavage. The remaining
monosacharides are the key. Previous reports indicated that the
ﬁrst two to three saccharides of large glycans often contribute
almost all the stabilization effect25. Our previous study with a
chitosanase demonstrated glycosylation with a single N-linked
site increased the thermostability of the enzyme signiﬁcantly26.
Therefore, it is rational to found increasing thermostability with
the partially deglycosylated IsPETase-Pp bearing short oligo-
sacharides. We tried to remove the polysaccharide side chains
with PNGase F, an amidase which cleaves between the innermost
GlcNAc and Asn residues and moves almost all N-linked oligo-
saccharides from glycoproteins. The result indicated the poly-
saccharide side chains were cut off efﬁciently while the activity
and thermostability of the deglycoprotein were decreased in
comparison with the Endo H treatment. The previous report
indicated that mutating the glycosylation sites of a protein,
ribophorin I in vivo reduced the ef ﬁciency of folding and
increased degradation27. Therefore, we proposed that both post-
translational glycosylation ofP. pastoris and partial deglycosyla-
tion with Endo H are equally important in the preparation of the
recombinant IsPETase. This is also another reason why we didn’t
mutate Asn205.
Another main concern with the large-scale preparation of
industrial enzymes is the yield of the target protein. Previously,
IsPETase was expressed in E. coil with a novel fusion tag,
carbohydrate-binding module 66 (CBM66) to improve the solu-
ble expression, and the titer of the recombinantIsPETase reached
370 mg/L28. IsPETase was also expressed with microalgaes as
host, such as P. tricornutum and C. reinhardtii and the recom-
binant protein can be detected with western blot29. Meanwhile,
secretory expression ofIsPETase withB. subtilisor E. colias hosts
were performed12,30– 32 and the target protein were detected with
SDS-PAGE after highly concentrated. In the present study, we
constructed expression vectors bearing 1-4 tandem expression
cassettes to improve the yield ofIsPETase with gene dosage effect.
The preliminary result displayed a trend that the expression of
IsPETase increased with the copies of the target gene. Increasing
the yield of the target protein through multicopy replicons is an
efﬁcient strategy commonly used in P. pastoris heterologous
expression33. Further study about the coordination of the gene
copies and mRNA/protein level is in need in order to maximize
the gene dosage effect. In addition, the condition of the high-
density fermentation will be optimized further to improve the
yield of IsPETase in the future.
In summary, we provided a strategy for the large-scale pre-
paration and modulation ofIsPETase and its variants. This work
paved the way for promoting biodegradation of PET from
laboratories to factories.

C-termini to facilitate the puriﬁcation (Supplementary Table 1, pET21b-CL8-
IsPETase, Addgene ID 195565). The coding sequence of PNGase F (Supplementary
Table 1) was cloned into pET28a (pET28a-CL7-PNGase F, Addgene ID 195563). A
CL7 tag35 fused to its N-termini to improve its solubility and a 6×His tag fused to
its C-termini for afﬁnity puriﬁcation.
The recombinant plasmids were veriﬁed by Sanger sequencing, followed by
transforming intoE. coliBL21(DE3). To induce the expression of the target genes,
the transformants were incubated at 37 °C to OD600 of 0.6-0.8, and then induced
with 1 mM of Isopropyl-β-D-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) at 18 °C for 24 h. Cells
were collected and resuspended in lysis buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl; 150 mM NaCl;
1 mM PMSF, pH 7.5) with lysozyme to aﬁnal concentration of 1 mg/mL. Samples
were ultrasonicated to break the cells, followed by incubating with HRV 3 C at
18 °C overnight to remove the CL8 tag. Next, the samples were centrifugated at
13,000 rpm for 10 min and the supernatant was applied to Ni-NTA beads for
afﬁnity puriﬁcation. The column was washed twice with 2 column volume of wash
buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl; 150 mM NaCl; 20 mM imidazole, pH 7.5). One column
volume of elution buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl; 150 mM NaCl; 100 mM imidazole, pH
7.5) was used to recover the target protein. The sample was then collected and
dialyzed with a Millipore 10-kDa cut-off membrane at 4 °C to remove ions and
salts, followed by resuspending with storage buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl; 150 mM
NaCl, pH 7.5).
The construction of yeast expression vectors and the transformation ofP.
pastoris GS115. IsPETase coding sequence including the signal peptide region was
optimized based on the usage preference ofP. pastoris and cloned into
pHBM905BDM vector for secretory expression (Supplementary Table 1,
pHBM905BDM-IsPETase, Addgene ID 195561). The multicopy expression vectors
bearing 2, 3, and 4 copies of theIsPETase expression cassettes were constructed
with the bio-brick method as previously reported
36. To express Fast-PETase
(Supplementary Table 1), the ORF of Fast-PETase generated through overlapping
PCR withIsPETase ORF as the template, followed by cloning into pHBM905BDM
(pHBM905BDM-Fast-IsPETase, Addgene ID 195561). To generate the recombi-
nant P. pastoris strains, the recombinant plasmids were linearized withSalI and
transformed intoP. pastorisGS115 by electroporation (7000 V/cm, 25 mF, 400Ω;
Life technologies cell porator, USA). Transformants were selected on MD plates
(without histidine). The recombinants were identiﬁed with whole-cell PCR.
The shake-ﬂask fermentation. The Transformants were incubated for 2 days at
28 °C in 50 mL of BMGY medium before pelleting the cells by centrifugation (4000
× g, 5 min) and replenishing with 50 mL of BMMY. To induce the expression of the
target protein, methanol was added to aﬁnal concentration of 1% (v/v) every 24 h.
The supernatant was harvested after 5 days of induction by centrifugation at 4 °C
and 10000 × g for 5 min.
The high-density fermentation. Fed-batch fermentation was performed accord-
ing to the InvitrogenPichia fermentation process guidelines (USA). The recom-
binant P. pastoris strain was inoculated into individualﬂask containing 200 mL of
BMGY, and the culture was incubated at 200 rpm, 28 °C for 24 h. The cell culture
was then transferred into 5-L fermentors containing 3 L of BSM medium (BG-4,
Baoxing, China). During the early stage of the fermentation, the culture was
maintained at 28 °C, pH 5.8, with 30% dissolved oxygen (DO). After approximately
18 to 24 h, the glycerol was exhausted, and the DO was increased to 100% rapidly.
To continue the cell growth, 50% (v/v) glycerol supplemented with PTM1 trace
salts (12 mL/L) was added to the cultures at a speed of 12 mL/h/L, and the DO was
kept above 20%. When the wet weight of the cells increased to approximately
180 g/L, the expression of the target gene was induced with methanol. The fer-
mentation conditions were adjusted to 25 °C at pH 5.5, and the DO was set to
20– 30%. Meanwhile, methanol with PTM1 trace salts (12 mL/L) was fed to the cells
at a rate of 3 mL/h/L. After 2 h, the rate was increased by 20% per hour until it
reached 7 mL/h/L. This condition was maintained until the end of the
fermentation.
Deglycosylation of the recombinant proteins. Deglycosylation of glycoproteins
was carried out as previously described with modiﬁcation
17. Brieﬂy, the super-
natant of the cell culture was collected after 5-day induction with methanol and
dialyzed using a Millipore 10-kDa cut-off membrane device. Next, the protein
concentration in the supernatant was determined using the Bradford kit (Beyotime,
China). Bovine serum albumin was used as the standard. And then, the recom-
binant Endo H was added at aﬁnal concentration of 667 nM. The mixture was
incubated at 28 °C for half an hour. The digestion of PNGase F was carried out at a
ﬁnal concentration of 2.67μM and incubated at 37 °C for 2 h.
SDS-PAGE and glycoprotein staining. The samples were separated via sodium
dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) using 12% (w/v)
polyacrylamide gels, followed by staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue G-250.
Glycoprotein staining was performed as described in the Glycoprotein Staining Kit
(Beyotime, China). Equal amount of each sample was loaded onto two 12% (w/v)
poly-acrylamide gels. Following SDS-PAGE, the gels were stained with Coomassie
brilliant blue G-250 and the Glycoprotein Staining Kit, respectively.
Mass spectrum (MS). Samples were loaded on a 12% (v/v) polyacrylamide gel for
SDS-PAGE, followed by staining with Coomassie brilliant blue G-250. The gel slice
including the target band was cut out and digested with trypsin overnight at 37 °C,
followed by analyzing with Q Exactive
TM HF mass spectrometry. The electrospray
voltage was 2.0 kV. The m/z scan range was 350 to 1800 for full scan, and intact
peptides were detected in the Orbitrap at a resolution of 60,000. The result of MS
was processed with Proteome Discoverer 2.4 software, and searched against
Komagataella phafﬁ database.
Analysis of the glycan side chains ofIsPETase-Pp and structural modeling of
the glycoprotein. The supernatant from the high-density fermentation was col-
lected and dialyzed with a Millipore 10-kDa cut-off membrane at 4 °C to remove
ions and salts, followed by resuspending with 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5). The
sample was sent to Genecreate (China) for the Glycosylation analysis. The sample
was incubated with DTT (10 mM) at 74 °C for 30 min, followed by adding 20 mM
of IAA to block the free sulfhydryl groups of cysteine residues. Extra IAA was
neutralized with DTT, followed by digestion with multiple enzymes. After the
treatment, the product was centrifuged at 1,2000 rpm for 2 min and the super-
natant was lyophilized. The sample was separated with HPLC and analyzed with
tims TOF Pro2 mass spectrum. The data were collected with CID method and
analyzed with PEAKS GlycanFinder software.
The three-dimensional structure of the glycosylatedIsPETase was constructed
at GLYCAM-Web (www.glycam.org) and theﬁgure was illustrated with UCSF
chimera software.
Far-ultraviolet circle dichroism (CD). Far-ultraviolet CD was performed with
Chirascan V100 circle dichroism spectrometer (Applied Photophysics, UK). The
protein was puriﬁed and adjusted to a concentration of 0.25 mg/mL with Tris-NaCl
buffer (pH 7.5). The sample was scanned within wavelength of 190~245 nm from
20 to 100 °C with an interval of 10 °C. The thermal melting curve was monitored at
222 nm from 20 to 80 °C with an interval of 5 °C. The melting temperature was
estimated using simple two-state model of OriginPro 8.0 software (OriginLab
Corporation USA).
Analysis of PET-hydrolytic activity using granular PET. The enzyme activity of
IsPETase was measured as previously described
7. Brieﬂy, 200 µL of the diluted
enzyme sample was mixed with 3 mg of amorphous PET (percentage crystallinity
of 25.7%) in 50 mM glycine-NaOH buffer (pH 9.0) to aﬁnal volume of 1 mL,
followed by incubating at 30 °C for 6 h. The reaction was terminated by heating at
85 °C for 10 min, and the mixture was centrifuged at 14000 g for 1 min, followed by
analysis with HPLC. The activity of Fast-PETase was analyzed with the same
method except the buffer was changed to 100 mM KH
2PO4 buffer (pH 8.0). TPA
and MHET released from the PET depolymerization was quantiﬁed with HPLC. A
Prominence Ultra Fast Liquid Chromatograph (Shimadzu) equipped with an GL
Sciences InertSustain C18 column (4.6 × 250 mm, 5 µm). The mobile phase was
methanol with 20 mM phosphate buffer (pH 2.5) at aﬂow rate of 0.8 mL/min. The
elution condition was 0– 25 min with 25– 85% (v/v) methanol linear gradient. The
efﬂuent was monitored at a wavelength of 240 nm. A standard curve was plot using
TPA and MHET. All of the experiments were carried out in triplicate. One unit of
enzyme (U) was deﬁned as the amount of enzyme causing the release of 1 µg of
TPA and MHET at 30 °C for 1 h.
Analysis of the thermostability ofIsPETase and Fast-PETase. To analyze the
thermostability ofIsPETase from the shake-ﬂask fermentation, the supernatant was
collected after 120 h and dialyzed with a Millipore 10-kDa cut-off membrane at
4 °C and the protein concentration in the protein was determined using the
Bradford kit (Beyotime, China), followed by digestion with Endo H for half an
hour. Next, 0.1 mg of the enzyme was incubated in 1 mL of 50 mM glycine-NaOH
buffer (pH 9.0) at 50, 60 and 70 °C for 2 h (sampling every 0.5 h), followed by
determining the residue activity. To analyze the thermostability ofIsPETase from
the high-density fermentation, the supernatant was collected and dialyzed with a
Millipore 10-kDa cut-off membrane at 4 °C, followed by treated with Endo H for
half an hour. Next, 0.4 mg of the enzyme was incubated in 1 mL of 50 mM glycine-
NaOH buffer (pH 9.0) at 40, 45 and 50 °C for 1, 3, 6, 9, and 12 h, followed by
determining the residue activity. To analyze the thermostability of Fast-PETase, the
supernatant was collected and dialyzed with a Millipore 10-kDa cut-off membrane
at 4 °C, followed by treated with Endo H for half an hour. Next, 0.4 mg of the
enzyme was incubated in 1 mL of 100 mM KH
2PO4 buffer (pH 8.0) at 50, 55, 60, 65
and 70 °C for 3, 6, 9, and 12 h, followed by determining the residual activity.
Enzymes without treatment was used as the negative control. All of the experi-
ments were carried out in triplicate.
Kinetic analysis. To obtain kinetic parameters for MHET and BHET, a pseudo-
one-substrate kinetic model was used as described previously
30. The kinetic
parameters were determined from three independent initial rate measurements
performed with the same batch of puriﬁed enzymes. The protein concentration was
determined using the Bradford kit (Beyotime, China). For parital-deglyco IsPE-
Tase-Pp, the concentration of MHET and BHET were 0.08 mM to 3 mM. The
reaction was carried out at 30 °C for 2 h in 50 mM glycine-NaOH buffer (pH 9.0).

For IsPETase-Ec, the concentration of MHET and BHET were 0.08 mM to 1.5 mM
and 0.06 mM to 2 mM. The reaction was carried out at 30 °C in 50 mM glycine-
NaOH buffer (pH 9.0) for 3 and 1 h, respectively. The initial rate was measured by
measuring the released TPA using HPLC. Initial rate data wereﬁtted to a
Michaelis-Menten equation, and theKM and kcat values were calculated from the
slope and y-intercept of the double-reciprocal plot.
Depolymerization of the raw, untreated postconsumer-PET. Hole-punched
postconsumer-PET ﬂake (6 mm in diameter, approximately 7 mg) from a black and
a white PET tray (Jiaduofu, China) were used as the substrate. The crystallinity of
these PET trays were determined with differential scanning calorimeter (DSC). The
temperature of the samples (6– 9 mg) were increased from 30 to 350 °C at 5 °C/min
and held at 350 °C for 1 min, followed by cooling from 350 to 30 °C at−5 °C/min
and holding at 30 °C for 1 min in a DSC 200F3 Maia (NETZSCH). The percentage
crystallinity was determined on theﬁrst heating scan using the enthalpies of
melting and cold crystallization. The equation used to calculate percentage crys-
tallinity within the PETﬁlm was the following:
%crystallinity ¼
ΔHm /C0 ΔHcc
ΔH
/C20/C21
´ 100%
ΔHm is the enthalpy of melting (J/g),ΔHcc is the enthalpy of cold crystallization
(J/g), andΔH is the enthalpy of melting for a 100% crystalline PET sample, which is
140.1 J/g10. ΔHm and ΔHcc was calculated using the NETZSCH Proteus software
package.
To test the activity of the partial-deglycoIsPETase-Pp, 0.8 mg of enzyme was
added to a PETﬂake in 2 mL of 50 mM glycine-NaOH buffer (pH 9.0) and
incubated at 50 °C. The supernatant was collected every 12 h to determine the
released monomers and fresh enzyme solution was replenished to the vessel. To
test the activity of the deglycosylated Fast-PETase-Pp, 0.8 mg of enzyme was added
to a PETﬂake in 2 mL of 100 mM KH
2PO4 buffer (pH 8.0) and incubated at 50 °C.
The supernatant was collected every 12 or 24 h to determine the released
monomers and fresh enzyme solution was replenished to the vessel.
To test the deploymerization of untreated PET containers with recombinant
PETases, a black or a white PET tray was squeezed as a whole piece into a DURAN
bottle containing 15 mg enzyme in 250 mL of 100 mM KH2PO4 buffer (pH 8.0) and
incubated at 50 °C or 55 °C. Fresh enzyme solution was replenished every 24 h until
most of PET was deploymerized.
