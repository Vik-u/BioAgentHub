Polyethylene terephthalate (PET) is a commodity polymer known to globally contaminate
marine and terrestrial environments. Today, around 80 bacterial and fungal PET-active
enzymes (PETases) are known, originating from four bacterial and two fungal phyla. In
contrast, no archaeal enzyme had been identiﬁed to degrade PET. Here we report on the
structural and biochemical characterization of PET46 (RLI42440.1), an archaeal promiscuous
feruloyl esterase exhibiting degradation activity on semi-crystalline PET powder comparable
to IsPETase and LCC (wildtypes), and higher activity on bis-, and mono-(2-hydroxyethyl)
terephthalate (BHET and MHET). The enzyme, found by a sequence-based metagenome
search, is derived from a non-cultivated, deep-sea Candidatus Bathyarchaeota archaeon.
Biochemical characterization demonstrated that PET46 is a promiscuous, heat-adapted
hydrolase. Its crystal structure was solved at a resolution of 1.71 Å. It shares the core alpha/
beta-hydrolase fold with bacterial PETases, but contains a unique lid common in feruloyl
esterases, which is involved in substrate binding. Thus, our study widens the currently known
diversity of PET-hydrolyzing enzymes, by demonstrating PET depolymerization by a plant cell
wall-degrading esterase.

T
he global use of synthetic and fossil fuel-derived polymers
on a multi-million-ton scale for over eight decades and the
lack of concepts for recycling have led to an unprecedented
accumulation of plastics of diverse sizes and blends in all ecolo-
gical niches including the deep-ocean
1– 5. Plastic litter serves as a
carrier for many microorganisms that can attach to their surface,
constituting the so-called plastisphere 6– 8. Many studies have
described the microbial communities colonizing most commodity
polymers such as polyethylene (PE), polypropylene (PP), or
polystyrene (PS), but also polyethylene terephthalate (PET) or
polyamides (PA), through 16 S rDNA amplicon or metagenomic
sequencing, and less often by FISH or DGGE analysis8– 11. Most
studies focused exclusively on bacterial lineages, while only a few
identiﬁed eukaryotes or archaea in addition (see Jacquin et al.12).
While it has been speculated that some of these attached
microorganisms might potentially be involved in the degradation
of the polymers, it is more likely that most of them will simply use
the plastics as a biocarrier or metabolize the additives but are not
able to break down the polymers themselves13,14.
Nevertheless, in recent years, several studies have identiﬁed
microbial enzymes that are able to degrade some of these syn-
thetic polymers, including PET, polyurethane (PUR), PA, and a
few others from mainly renewable sources 13,15. To date,
approximately 200 enzymes have been described to act on these
polymers (PAZy database 16), most of them being esterases,
amidases, and oxygenases. Many of these proteins have low
conversion rates, show promiscuous activity, or are only active on
oligomers. Even though some Euryarchaeota ( e.g., Thermo-
plasmatales) and TACK-archaea ( e.g., Thaumarchaeota, Cre-
narchaeota) have been found to colonize plastic particles of
various sizes17,18, no plastic-active enzyme of clear archaeal origin
had been identiﬁed to break down a synthetic polymer19,20.
In the case of PET, most degrading enzymes derive from
bacteria, including Actinomycetota21– 23, Pseudomonadota24– 26,
Bacillota27,28, and recently Bacteroidota29 and Chloroﬂexota30.
The best characterized bacterial enzymes include the IsPETase
from Ideonella sakaiensis 26 and the Leaf-branch Compost
Cutinase22 (LCC). Few enzymes have been identiﬁed in fungi
(Eukarya), includingCandida antarcticaCalB, Humicola insolens
HiC, and Fusarium solani FsC31. These enzymes share some
common features: They are cutinases or esterases, their catalytic
triad comprises Ser-Asp-His, the active site is fairly exposed to the
solvent, and they are deprived of any lid domain. Furthermore,
aromatic (Trp, Phe, Tyr) and Met residues within the catalytic
pocket contribute to the binding of PET and the formation of the
oxyanion hole
13,32,33.
Within this work, we describe and characterize PET46 (NCBI
accession RLI42440.1), an enzyme from archaeal origin that
hydrolyzes PET polymer. The enzyme is encoded in the
metagenome-assembled genome (MAG) of the Candidatus
Bathyarchaeota archaeon B1_G2, a member of the TACK group
that was found at the Guaymas Basin 34. The experimentally
established crystal structure of the protein is similar to bacterial
PET-degrading enzymes but reveals several unique features.
These include differences in the amino acid composition in and
around the active site compared to its bacterial and eukaryotic
counterparts. Furthermore, the enzyme’s structure shows high
homology to feruloyl esterases, and aﬂexible lid domain covers its
active site, which is not a common trait for PETases. These
ﬁndings add to the scaffold diversity of PET-active enzymes and
strongly suggest that more enzymes could be able to degrade PET,
which possibly have not yet been discovered by strict sequence
and structural homology searches.
Results
Proﬁle Hidden Markov Model (HMM) search identiﬁes the
archaeal PETase PET46 . Previous research identi ﬁed PET
esterases in bacteria and two fungal phyla (Fig.1). Since hitherto
no archaeal PETase had been described, we asked whether
archaeal esterases might as well be capable to hydrolyze PET. To
address this question, we performed global database searches
using publicly available microbial genomes and metagenomes
from NCBI’s non-redundant database using a previously pub-
lished HMM-based search approach
25,35.
We selected PET46 as a putative archaeal PET-degrading
esterase (Fig. 1) based on bit score, sequence length, and initial
Fig. 1 PET-degrading enzymes in Archaea, Bacteria and Eukarya.The amino acid sequence of PET46 was included in a sequence similarity network (SSN)
analysis with other published PETases from Archaea (circles), Bacteria (triangles), and Eukarya (squares) collected in PAZy16. Edges connecting two nodes
indicate a BLASTp e-value < 0.01, and color indicates the percentage identity. The enzymes PET46, IsPETase and LCC, compared in depth in this study, are
highlighted. *Note: In the study by Erickson et al.60, the source organisms of enzymes 101–307 are not detailed and only deﬁned as “environmental
sample”. Taxonomic afﬁliation was derived from the best BLASTp hit from the NCBI nr-database if seq. id. > 95%. All-against-all BLASTp results are found
in Supplementary Data 2.

3D model analysis. Its sequence originates from a recently
identiﬁed TACK archaeon found at a deep-sea marine sediment
from the Guaymas Basin (Gulf of California, Mexico). The host
strain Candidatus Bathyarchaeota archaeon B1_G2 has not yet
been cultivated, but is part of a genome reconstruction
project
34,36. PET46 is encoded on a short 3,316 bp contig
(QMYN01000264.1) by a 786 bp ORF coding for an alpha/beta-
hydrolase (RLI42440.1) with 262 aa and a predicted molecular
weight of 29.4 kDa (Supplementary Fig. 1). The other ORFs in the
contig code for a tRNA-deacylase and two ribosomal proteins
(Supplementary Fig. 1). PET46 showed only low sequence
similarity to bacterial PETases16. The best hit with a BLASTp
score of only 41.6 (query cov. 82%, seq. id. 26%) was the type I37
PETase Est1 fromThermobiﬁda alba (Fig. 1).
Amino acid sequence and structural analyses imply that PET46
is a feruloyl esterase. For an initial characterization, the PET46
amino acid sequence was subjected to a more detailed bioinfor-
matics analysis. Thereby, we identiﬁed a predicted G-x-S-x-G
motif which is a common trait of α/β serine hydrolases38.
Amongst others, we identiﬁed conserved domains of dipeptidyl
aminopeptidase/acylaminoacyl peptidase (DAP2), acetyl xylan
esterase (AXE1), dienelactone hydrolase (DLH) and lysopho-
spholipase (PldB, Supplementary Fig. 1). A BLASTp search
against the non-redundant database results in 89 hits (query cov.
> 80%, seq. id > 40%), from which only 24 are archaeal homologs,
exclusively from the TACK-group. Most of them derive from
Bathyarchaeota, and only three hits are related to the phylum
Thermoproteota/Crenarchaeota. Interestingly, 65 homologs were
found in Bacteria, especially in Firmicutes/Bacillota (Supple-
mentary Fig. 1).
For further characterization, we produced PET46 wildtype
(WT) heterologously inE. coliBL21(DE3) carrying an N-terminal
6xHis-tag (Supplementary Fig. 2). The recombinant and puriﬁed
protein was used for crystallization and additional
biochemical tests.
Crystals of PET46 were obtained by sitting-drop vapor
diffusion after 3– 4 weeks. The best PET46 crystal grew in space
group P 6
1 2 2 and diffracted to a resolution of 1.71 Å (Table1).
We could unambiguously model the protein chain in the electron
density between residues 1– 269. The ﬁnal model was reﬁned to
Rwork/Rfree values of 15.23/17.27 and deposited to the PDB with
accession ID 8B4U (Supplementary Data 1). All data collection
and reﬁnement statistics are reported in Table1.
One monomer is present in the asymmetric unit (ASU), which
shares the common fold of theα/β-hydrolase superfamily, with
the core of the enzyme being composed of eight β-strands
connected by sevenα-helixes (Supplementary Fig. 3). In addition,
a lid domain composed of threeα-helixes and two anti-parallelβ-
strands is present (Leu141-Val186). The active site is composed of
the catalytic triad Asp206, His238, and Ser115, as inferred from
structure homology to otherα/β-hydrolases (Fig.2). A phosphate
ion and two ethylene glycol molecules were present near the
active site (Supplementary Fig. 3), likely coming from the protein
buffer, crystallization solution, and cryoprotectant.
Despite a low sequence identity of only 20% and 21%,
respectively, the structure of PET46 overlays the well-studied
IsPETase from Ideonella sakaiensis (PDB 6EQE) and LCC (PDB
4EB0) with 1.8 Å Cα-RMSD (Fig. 2a and Table 2). The largest
difference is the medium-sized lid comprising 45 aa in PET46
(Leu141-Val186, Fig. 2a). Further structural differences around
the active site are found in the enlarged loop betweenβ4 andα3
(Loop 1; Asp68-Glu78; deep blue in Fig.2a), which folds back to
the outside, and the shorter loop betweenβ10 andα10 containing
the catalytic His (Loop 2; Arg234-Arg242; magenta in Fig.2a).
Loop 2 in IsPETase also contains one Cys that forms a disulﬁde
bridge, which LCC and PET46 lack. Three out of four residues
needed to form the oxyanion hole and the aromatic clamp are
conserved or have equivalent properties as in IsPETase, LCC, and
others PETases13. Nevertheless, the lack of an equivalent to
Trp185 in IsPETase or Trp190 in LCC suggests that PET46
adopts a distinct substrate-binding pattern, probably involving
the lid domain in the formation of the aromatic clamp (Fig.2b).
To answer this question, we constructed the chimera
PET46ΔA140-P187::IsW185-T189 (from now on PET46 Δlid),
where we substituted Ala140-Pro187 with the homologous
Trp185-Thr189 minimal loop of the IsPETase. By this, we
included the Trp185 involved in the formation of the aromatic
clamp, which is missing in PET46 (Fig.2b). The produced mutant
was veriﬁed by sequencing and SDS-PAGE, leading to a reduction
in size of 5 kDa (Supplementary Fig. 2).
We further compared the structure of PET46 to all published
bacterial and eukaryotic PETase crystal structures (Table 2).
Additionally, we performed searches against all crystal structures
in the PDB. From this database, the best hits obtained were the
feruloyl esterases GthFAE fromGeobacillus thermoglucosidasius
(PDB 7WWH) and Est1E from the rumen bacteriumButyrivibrio
proteoclasticus (PDB 2WTM) together with the cinnamoyl
esterase LJ0536 fromLactobacillus johnsonii (PDB 3PF8; Fig.3a
and Table 2). All hits derive from Firmicutes. Feruloyl esterases
are also known as ferulic acid esterases (FAEs). They are involved
in plant biomass degradation and cleave e.g., cinnamic, p-
coumaric or ferulic acid, thus decoupling plant cell wall
polysaccharides and lignin
39. Using ethyl cinnamate (EC) as a
model substrate, we could detect enzyme-mediated H+ release
derived from ester hydrolysis (Supplementary Fig. 4). These
aromatic acids esteriﬁed to long polymers may be analogous to
MHET units at the end of a PET chain (Fig. 3b and

Supplementary Fig. 4). FAEs are believed to be secreted enzymes,
even if no apparent N-terminal signal peptide is present40. In the
case of PET46, no obvious secretion signal is detected. Since FAEs
form a protein family with tannases, to which the MHETase from
I. sakaiensisbelongs41, we also included its structure (PDB 6QZ4,
Table 2) in our structural analysis.
PET46 and all three FAEs shared the highest structural
similarity. Even Loop 1 and Loop 2 are highly conserved, but
some variations are observed at the lid domain (Fig.3b, Table2,
and Supplementary Fig. 5). PET46 and GthFAE share the G-L-S-
M-G motif, similar to the bacterial PETase´s G-W/H-S-M-G. The
other two FAEs have G-H-S-Q-G, similar to eukaryotic PETase´s
G-Y-S-Q-G. We analyzed the crystal structures of Est1E and
LJ0536 co-crystallized with ferulic acid (FA; PDB 2WTN) or
ethyl-ferulate (EF; PDB 3QM1) and identiﬁed up toﬁve positions
in the lid that could be involved in substrate binding, including
four aromatic Tyr, Phe, or Trp residues42,43 (1– 4 in Supplemen-
tary Fig. 3a). The only conserved aromatic position in the lid of all
FAEs is PET46’s Phe178 (3 in Supplementary Fig. 3a); Phe in
GtfFAE and Tyr in the other two (Fig.3b, Supplementary Fig. 5).
Overall, PET46 and FAEs build a cluster that is most similar to
the cluster formed by bacterial PETases (Fig.3a). The archaeal
PETase is structurally most similar to the metagenomic bacterial
PETase LipIAF5-2 (PET225, Table 2). We then proceeded to
characterize PET46 biochemically to conﬁrm PETase activity.
PET46 is a promiscuous feruloyl esterase that hydrolyzes
MHET, BHET, 3PET, and PET polymers. We tested PET46 for
its activities on bis-(2-hydroxyethyl) terephthalate (BHET) and
mono-(2-hydroxyethyl) terephthalate (MHET). Subsequently, we
assayed activities on PET trimer (3PET) and polymers, both
powder and foil. This clearly showed that PET46 can break down
plastic PET and the not fully hydrolyzed degradation products.
PET46 WT can degrade both BHET and MHET. In less than
30 min, all BHET (150 µM in 200 µL) was converted to MHET
and terephthalic acid (TPA) in a 4:1 ratio. After 1 h of incubation,
50.99 µM TPA were measured. Incubation with the same amount
of MHET for 1 h resulted in 51.5 µM TPA released (Fig.4a),
implying that MHET degradation occurs at the maximum rate
independent from the starting substrate. PET46Δlid could release
up to 70.53 mM MHET from BHET, but we did not detect
MHET degradation within 1 h incubation (Fig.4a). Thus, the lid
may be involved in efﬁcient substrate binding and catalysis.
To better understand the BHET-degrading ability of PET46, its
crystal structure was applied in docking experiments with this
substrate. Two main clusters of docked poses were obtained,
covering 83% and 12% of all solutions, and two smaller clusters
containing 4% and 1% (Supplementary Fig. 6). For both main
clusters, the smallest distance between the substrate’s carbonyl
carbon and the hydroxyl oxygen from the catalytic serine is below
3.1 Å, indicating a plausible orientation of the substrate’s ester
group towards the catalytic nucleophile (Supplementary Fig. 6).
We found that for both main clusters, the backbone amides of
Phe39 and Met116 form an oxyanion hole that potentially
stabilizes the transition state during ester hydrolysis (Supple-
mentary Fig. 7). Furthermore, we compared the potential binding
poses of BHET within PET46 to the binding pose of ethyl-ferulate
(EF) within the crystal structure of the cinnamoyl esterase LJ0536
S106A mutant (PDB 3QM1). The docking pose identiﬁed in the
second cluster is very similar to the position of the EF, especially
with respect to the positioning of the carbonyl moiety
(Supplementary Fig. 8). Likewise, this cluster adopts an analogous
position as in the crystal structures of IsPETase and LCCICCG co-
crystallized with HEMT 44 and MHET 45 (5XH3 and 7VVE;
Fig. 2b). Thus, we propose that as the most probable.
We asked if any other position was involved in substrate
accommodation or product release. Based on the docking results,
we identiﬁed two amino acids, Ala46 and Ala140, near both
predominant docking poses that might be relevant for the
substrate accessibility and binding (Supplementary Fig. 6).
Introducing the larger substitutions A46V and A140I should
thus impact the catalytic activity. We further identiﬁed Lys147,
which possibly interacts with docked poses from the second-
largest cluster. Variant K147A abolishes this interaction and
Fig. 2 The crystal structure of PET46 resembles the crystal structure of the IsPETase and LCC - with unique features.All three proteins have theα/β-
hydrolase fold and the same catalytic triad, but PET46 (coral orange; PDB 8B4U) contains a lid domain (bright green) that is not present in the IsPETase
(sky blue; PDB 6EQE and 5XH3 in complex with HEMT - cyan) nor LCC (olive green, PDB 4EB0 and 7VVE in complex with MHET). Other structural
differences are present in Loop 1 (deep blue) and Loop 2 (magenta), containing the active site’s Hisa. The bacterial and the archaeal enzymes present the
typical residues of Ser-hydrolases at the catalytically active positions (Ser, His and Asp), but PET46 lacks a Trp associated with PET binding and formation
of the aromatic clamp in the IsPETase and LCC. IsPETase is the only enzyme containing a disulﬁde bridge close to the active siteb. Due to high similarity
between IsPETase and LCC, and for clarity, only PET46 and IsPETase are shown in“a”. *5XH3 and 7VVE are inactive mutants.

widens the binding groove (Supplementary Fig. 6). Note that the
lid of PET46 has potentially adopted a non-optimal conforma-
tion/orientation for substrate binding. Therefore, docking into the
rigid crystal structure might underestimate the potential impor-
tance of theﬂexible lid for ligand binding.
We then proceeded to incubate PET46 WT and all the
constructed variants (including PET46Δlid) on 3PET at 60 and
70 °C (optimal temperature range, see next chapter) and 30 °C
as a mesophilic control. At the two highest temperatures, we
observed a similar activity pattern, where PET46 WT, K147A,
and A46V degraded all the 3PET to MHET and TPA within the
ﬁrst 3 h (Fig.4b). PET46 A140I performed slightly worse, while
PET46Δlid could only convert half of the 3PET after 72 h
incubation (Fig. 4b). Interestingly, A46V produced 3.2 times
more products at 30 °C than the WT enzyme during theﬁrst
24 h. In all experiments, we were not able to detect any BHET.
Together with the previously obtained BHET and MHET
degradation activities, and the fact that PET46 is a FAE, we
assume hydrolysis happens at the polymer chain end (exo-
activity), where 3PET is quickly cleaved to MHET units, which
are subsequently converted to TPA and ethylene glycol (EG).
This method of action has been proposed and experimentally
shown recently for another 3PET-degrading esterase 46,
although their structures diffe r substantially (Supplementary
Fig. 5d).
Finally, we assayed PET46 WT on semi-crystalline PET
powder and amorphous ﬁlm. We could not detect any activity
on PET foil. Surprisingly, incubation of 3 µM enzyme
(1 mg mL−1) with semi-crystalline PET powder released up to
1,624.14 µM aromatic products (TPA, MHET and BHET) in
200 µL after three days at 60 °C, more than 99.1% being TPA
(Fig. 5a and Table3). This corresponds to 3.38% total conversion.
We compared the archaeal enzyme to the best-characterized
IsPETase and LCC WT enzymes at their respective temperature
optima (30 and 50 °C; Fig.5a and Table 3). At 30 °C, PET46
released virtually no aromatic products, while incubation of PET
powder with IsPETase resulted in 1,299.97 µM products (96.2%
TPA and 2.71% conversion). Since we did observe activity on
3PET at said temperature (Fig.4b), we assume that PET46 needs
high temperatures to attack true PET polymer. At 50 °C, PET46
released 791.40 µM products (99.9% TPA and 1.65% conversion),
where incubation with LCC lead to the release of 3,832.67 µM
(7.98% conversion and ﬁve times more than PET46). Interest-
ingly, TPA amounts released by LCC account for only 42.46% of
the total (TPA:MHET:BHET≈ 1:1.32:0.04). At 60 °C, the PETase
activity of LCC decreases by 36.3%, releasing 2,440.68 µM
Table 2 PET46 has structural similarities to feruloyl esterases and bacterial PETases.

Fig. 3 The protein structure of archaeal PETase PET46 and ferulic acid esterases (FAEs) is closely related to bacterial PETases.A heatmap represents
structure similarity (Z-Score87) and reveals structural clusters. The FAE cluster, to which PET46 (coral orange) belongs, shows the highest similarity to the
cluster of bacterial PETases. PET 46 is the FAE with the highest structural similarity to the bacterial PETases. Enzymes for which no activity on PET has
been proven (e.g., FAEs) are shown in graya. PET46 shares most of its structure with FAEsb. The structure of the archaeal PETase (coral orange) is
overlaid to the crystal structure of the cinnamoyl esterase LJ0536 S106A mutant from Lactobacillus johnsonii (dark gray, PDB 3QM1) in complex with
ethylferulate (EF, cyan). Loop 1 (deep blue) and Loop 2 (magenta) are highly conserved, but there are some variations in the lid domain (bright green).A
Tyr in the loop of LJ0536 involved in substrate binding has a homologous Phe in PET46 (bright green). For structural alignments with other two FAEs and
the tannase IsMHETase, see Supplementary Fig. 4. *No obvious phylogenetic afﬁliation. Data supporting panel“a” can be found in Supplementary Data 2.

aromatic compounds (78.8% TPA and 5.08% conversion). This
makes LCC WT only 33.4% more active than PET46 at 60 °C.
Further experiments revealed that most product release happens
during the ﬁrst 24 h of incubation and supplementation with
fresh enzyme (fed-batch) does not promote additional hydrolysis
(Supplementary Fig. 9). This suggests again that the enzyme is
most probably just cleaving terminal TPA moieties. Initial
experiments showed that PET46 Δlid did not hydrolyze PET
polymer. Nevertheless, fed-batch incubations resulted in a slight
degradation after 2 days (Supplementary Fig. 9).
As for the incubation with 3PET, we did not detect any BHET
or only trace amounts, and MHET was also a minor product
(Table 3). We asked how the BHETase and MHETase activities
compared to the reference enzymes, for which we incubated them
with both substrates at their respective optimal temperature
(Fig. 5b). After only 10 minutes at 70 °C, 0.06 µM PET46
degraded 62.06 µM BHET to MHET and EG (starting concentra-
tion 150 µM in 200 µL). Under the same conditions but at 30 and
50 °C, respectively, IsPETase and LCC degraded only 44.03 and
19.66 µM (Fig.5b). This makes PET46 40.9% and 215.7% more
active on this substrate. On MHET, 3 µM PET46 releases
38.44 µM TPA after 30 min at 70 °C. LCC and IsPETase release
30.11 and 20.63 µM, respectively (Fig.5b). PET46 is therefore up
to 27.7 and 86.3% more active on MHET than the reference
Fig. 5 PET46 degrades PET polymer.PET46’s PET-degrading ability was assayed at 60 °C and compared to the IsPETase and the LCC at their respective
temperature optima (30 °C and 50 °C;a). 3µM PET46 (roughly 0.1 mg mL−1) release up to 1.6 mM TPA out of 48 mM crystalline PET powder after 72 h at
60 °C. PET46 is more effective than IsPETase and LCC in degrading the intermediates BHET and MHET (150 mM) at their respective optimal temperatures
b. The color palette is shared between“a” and “b”. Product release linked to autohydrolysis at the different temperatures was subtracted at each timepoint.
Enzyme concentrations were kept equal for all assayed enzymes within each experiment. Data represent mean results (n = 3). Error bars indicate standard
deviation. *Due to faster degradation of BHET by all enzymes, enzyme concentration used is 50× less than for PET and MHET degradation. Supporting data
can be found in Supplementary Data 2.

enzymes. U mg−1 values are presented in Table4. We speculate
that the lid domain, not present in the other PETases, is involved
in the better accommodation of these substrates in the active site
(Supplementary Fig. 6).
PET46 is adapted to the geochemical conditions at the Guay-
mas Basin. We characterized PET46 in more detail and with
respect to its temperature and substrate pro ﬁle. Therefore, a
substrate spectrum was recorded withpNP-esters, which had an
acyl chain length of 4 to 18 C-atoms. The highest activities of
PET46 were observed with pNP-decanoate (C10). PET46 was
only poorly active on short (C4-C6) and long (C12-16) acyl chain
lengths (Supplementary Fig. 10).
Using 1 mM pNP-decanoate as substrate, the recombinant
enzyme PET46 revealed a broad temperature spectrum. The
highest activity was observed at 70 °C, while at 90 °C only 10%
residual activity was detectable. The enzyme remained active at a
temperature below 40 °C, but only had low activities (Fig.6a). To
further assess thermostability, the recombinant PET46 was
incubated at 60 °C and 70 °C for two weeks. At 60 °C, the
enzyme kept more than 60% of its activity for up to 8 days. At
70 °C, 80% of the activity was lost after 2 days, with only 10%
remaining after 3 days (Fig.6b). NanoDSF experiments measured
aT m of 84.55 °C (Fig.6c). The original metagenomic sample was
collected at a temperature of 48 °C34, at which PET46 shows 52%
relative activity under laboratory conditions.
PET46 revealed activity at a broad pH range of 5– 8. It had its
optimum at pH 7– 8 when tested on 1 mMpNP-C10 at 70 °C.
However, it also retained high activities (50%) at pH 5 (Fig.6a).
The pH at the Guaymas Basin is recorded to be approximately
5.947, at which PET46 would exhibit up to 77% of its activity
under laboratory conditions.
To further characterize the effects of various metal ions, PET46
was incubated for 1 h with 1 or 10 mM Ca2+,C o2+,C u2+,F e3+,
Mg2+,M n2+,N i2+ or Zn2+. The activity was assayed under
optimal conditions and compared to a metal-free control. The
activity of PET46 signiﬁcantly increased in the presence of most
of these ions. In contrast, Cu
2+ reduced the activity by 50%.
Especially the addition of Zn2+ resulted in an almost two-fold
activity increase (Supplementary Fig. 10). Some of these ions are
present at signiﬁcant concentrations in the Guaymas Basin
48.
Thus, metal binding to the protein seems plausible.
Further, we tested the sensitivity of PET46 towards detergents
and the reducing agent DTT. A concentration of 1 and 5% of the
detergents Triton X-100 and DTT strongly affected the enzyme
activities (Supplementary Fig. 10). Interestingly, 1% DTT
stimulated esterase activity by a factor of two.
Finally, we assessed the solvent tolerance of PET46. In general,
the enzyme was remarkably stable with acetone, DMF, iso-
propanol, and DMSO. Notably, 10% acetone and 5% DMSO and
DMF increased the enzyme ’s activities by a factor of 2
(Supplementary Fig. 10). This is a noteworthy solvent tolerance.
Overall, PET46 is a well-adapted and very stable enzyme in its
natural environment. Bathyarchaeota are ubiquitous and the
predominant archaea in deep-sea environments like the Guaymas
Basin36,49, and they have been shown to grow on lignin as energy
source50, for which enzymes like PET46 need to be secreted.
Together with our results on PET poly-, oligo- and monomer
hydrolysis, we conclude that enzymes associated with lignin
degradation, and especially FAEs from Bathyarchaeota and other
prokaryotes, may have a global impact in promiscuity-driven
degradation of PET litter in the deep-ocean, even if degradation
happens only at low rates.
Discussion
The degradation of polyethylene terephthalate (PET) through
enzymatic hydrolysis has gained considerable attention as a
promising approach to address the global plastic waste crisis.
PET-degrading enzymes, including cutinases (EC 3.1.1.74), lipa-
ses (EC 3.1.1.3), and carboxylesterases (EC 3.1.1.1), which are
known to be very promiscuous51,52, target the ester bond within
the amorphous or low-crystalline regions of the polymer, leading
to the production of key intermediates BHET, MHET, as well as
TPA and EG16.
Mesophilic enzymes such as IsPETase have been shown to
hydrolyze PET at relatively low temperatures 26. This ﬁnding
challenged the common misconception that PET degradation is
solely efﬁcient at around the glass transition temperature (Tg) of
PET, often believed to be 70 °C33. A recent study demonstrated
that, when exposed to water, the Tg of the thin surface layer
decreases to approximately 40 °C53. Nevertheless, thermostability
is a notable characteristic of many highly active PETases, with
optimal temperatures ranging from 55 to 65 °C. These enzymes
are best-suited for industrial applications, where elevated
Fig. 6 PET46 is a thermostable hydrolase adapted to the conditions of
the Guaymas Basin.The enzyme’s optimal temperature and pH were
determined by incubation withpNP-ester substrates (decanoate, C10,a).
The enzyme conserved most of its activity after 8-day incubation at 60 °C,
but lost almost 80% after two days at 70 °Cb. NanoDSF experiments show
that PET46 has a melting temperature (Tm) of 84.55 °Cc. Error bars
indicate the standard deviation (n = 3). Standard deviation in“a” was below
6% for all conditions assayed. Supporting data can be found in
Supplementary Data 2.

temperatures can enhance reaction rates and improve overall
process efﬁciency, but this phenomenon is nevertheless only
explained by the Arrhenius equation53. In light of theseﬁndings,
much work has been done to improve current PETases regarding
their heat-resistance
33,54– 59. But there is also a growing need to
expand our knowledge of heat-stable enzymes and explore new
protein scaffolds that can further optimize PET degradation60.
Furthermore, mining the biodiversity can also help understand
the global distribution and roles of these promiscuous enzymes in
nature.
Within this setting, we provide compelling evidence that
Candidatus Bathyarchaeota archaeon B1_G2 hosts the pro-
miscuous esterase PET46 that can act on semi-crystalline PET
polymer. Besides, PET46 hydrolyzes BHET and MHET with
signiﬁcant rates, conﬁrming that it can handle both the polymer
and the intermediates (Figs.4 and 5). Based on structural analysis
and activity assays (Fig.3 and Supplementary Fig. 4), PET46 is a
feruloyl esterase. Feruloyl/ferulic acid esterases (FAE; EC 3.1.1.73)
release ferulic acid and other hydroxycinnamic acids from plant-
based hemicellulose and lignin, which have a large biotechnolo-
gical application61. They are widespread in nature and have been
found in bacteria, plants, and fungi. Their 3D structure usually
reveals a canonical eight-strandα/β-fold of lipases and esterases
(Supplementary Fig. 3). In addition, a lid domain is observed,
which, analogous to lipases, conﬁnes the active site with a loop
that confers plasticity to the substrate-binding site62.
Analogous to PETases, FAEs remove aromatic acids from the
end of polymers (Supplementary Fig. 4). A recent study described
a metagenomic FAE with phthalate-degrading activity, but no
PET degradation was assayed63. PETases are assumed to not have
a lid domain. However, some enzymes acting on the intermediate
MHET are annotated as tannases, which form a protein family
with FAEs, and they bear a lid domain of varying length. They
can hydrolyze MHET into TPA and EG. One of the best-studied
examples is the MHETase derived from the gram-negative bac-
terium I. sakaiensis(IsMHETase). This enzyme acts efﬁciently on
MHET, but recently an exo-function on PET pentamers was
described
64. It also hydrolyzed BHET in a concentration-
dependent manner, and its three-dimensional structure shows a
much larger lid domain involving more than 200 aa (Supple-
mentary Fig. 5). A new study by Erickson et al.60 searched for
new thermotolerant PET hydrolase scaffolds following a similar
searching strategy as in our study. They reported the
metagenome-derived enzymes 204 and 211, but did not investi-
gate their taxonomic afﬁliation nor their conserved domains in
detail. PETase 204 is 97.93% identical to WP_187147021.1 and
WP_148684612.1 from Thermophilum adornatum, while 211 is
99.62% identical to MBS7639053.1 from a Cand. Bathyarchaeota
archaeon, both archaea. PET46 shares 34.92% and 65.78%
sequence identity, respectively (Fig.1), but their structure is very
similar (Supplementary Fig. 11). In their study, the PET46-like
211 released up to 85.23 mg L−1 aromatic products from crys-
talline PET powder at 60 °C and pH6 (optimal conditions). This
equals to 0.52 mM assuming all of it is TPA, which is less but in
the range of the amount of product that we measured with PET46
(1.6 mM; Fig. 4). As for PET46, no activity was detected on
amorphous PET foil.
PET46 is encoded in a marine Bathyarcheota MAG. Micro-
organisms afﬁliated with the Bathyarchaeota are globally occur-
ring and widespread in marine and terrestrial anoxic sediments65.
They can use a wide range of polymers as carbon and energy
sources, and they are well known to be very versatile with respect
to metabolic capabilities. They are further known to be abundant
in some marine sediments. Because of their huge metabolic
potential, it is further assumed that they may play a signiﬁcant
role in global carbon biogeochemical cycling65– 68. Interestingly,
Bathyarcheota have been associated with the degradation of the
biopolymer lignocellulose previously50. Therefore, the observa-
tion here that not only their genomes code for FAEs, but also the
demonstration that they are functionally active underscores this
observation.
Within this setting, PET46 being catalytically active on PET
powder is in line with the known wide metabolic diversity of the
Bathycharchaeota
69. When we benchmarked our enzyme with the
well-characterized enzymes IsPETase and LCC (WTs), our data
imply that the overall PETase activities observed for PET46 are
comparable (Fig. 5). Furthermore, PET46 was faster in the
degradation of intermediates BHET and MHET. We expect that
evolution experiments would enhance the activity of PET46, a
necessary step to make the enzyme a viable candidate for possible
industrial application46,70.
While PET esterases are not highly conserved among each
other, few structural traits and sequence homologies are common
in most of the known enzymes (Fig.3). Based on our data ana-
lyses and others33, it becomes evident that most PETases do not
carry a lid domain, which was proved to be crucial for enzymatic
activity of PET46 (Fig.4 and Supplementary Fig. 9). All published
active enzymes are secreted proteins that carry at least an
N-terminal signal peptide and some even a PorC-like type
9 secretion system (T9SS) domain 29. The region involved in
substrate binding (formation of the aromatic clamp and oxyanion
hole) contains in general the amino acids Tyr/Phe-Met-Trp/Tyr,
and the catalytic triad is composed of Asp-His-Ser. Further, active
enzymes carry 1-2 disulﬁde bonds and of these, one is close to the
active site (Fig. 2b). The active site is well accessible for bulky
substrates and is in a large cavity. For more detailed analyses of
common PETase features, we refer to other studies13,33.
In summary, our biochemical results signiﬁcantly extend the
knowledge of PETase enzymes and their biodiversity. Our study
further enables the development of an expanded phylogenetic
framework for identifying the diversity of putative PET-degrading
enzymes in marine microbial groups throughout the global ocean.
Finally, the data presented here will help advance our knowledge
on the ecological role of the Bathyarchaeota and the possible
decomposition of marine PET litter.
Methods
Proﬁle Hidden-Markov Model (HMM) searches identify
putative archaeal PETases. An HMM constructed from all PET-
degrading enzymes listed in the PAZy database
16 was used to
search against NCBI ’s non-redundant protein database 71
(ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/blast/db/FASTA/nr.gz) ﬁltered for sequen-
ces of archaeal origin (tax ID: 2157), as described
previously13,25,35. In short, a multiple sequence alignment (MSA)
was performed with T-Coffee v.12.00 in Expresso mode72 and a
proﬁle HMM was constructed with hmmbuild and applied on a
search with hmmsearch from the HMMER v.3.3 software
package73.
Primers, constructs, and bacterial strains used. The gene coding
for PET46 was codon-optimized and synthesized in pET21a(+)
(Novogene, Cambridge, UK) by Biomatik (Ontario, Canada) and
transformed in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) (Novagen/Merck,
Darmstadt, Germany) for protein production. The primers used
to generate all PET46 mutants by site directed mutagenesis were
synthesized by Euroﬁns Genomics (Ebersberg, Germany), and are
listed in Supplementary Table 1. Sequencing of all constructs was
conducted by Microsynth Seqlab GmbH (Göttingen, Germany).
Protein production and puriﬁcation. PET46 WT, its mutant
derivatives, and LCC were produced heterologously by growingE.

coli BL21(DE3) cells carrying the respective pET21a(+) construct
at 37 °C in Lysogeny Broth/Luria-Bertani (LB) medium con-
taining 100 µg mL−1 ampicillin. When OD600 reached 0.7, 1 mM
IPTG was added to induce expression of the genes and cultures
were incubated overnight at 22 °C to facilitate protein production.
The IsPETase from I. sakaiensis was produced in a similar
manner, but the vector was the pMAL-p4X. Cells were cen-
trifuged and lysis was carried out via French Press three times at
1,250 psi. The proteins were puriﬁed from the cleared lysate with
Ni-NTA agarose (Macherey-Nagel, Düren, Germany) or maltose
columns, following concentration and dialysis against 0.1 M
potassium phosphate buffer pH 7.
Crystallization, data collection, data reduction, structure
determination, reﬁnement, and ﬁnal model analysis. PET46
was crystallized by sitting-drop vapor-diffusion at 12 °C with a
concentration of 10 mg mL
−1 in 100 mM potassium phosphate
buffer pH 7. 1.5 µL of PET46 were mixed with 1.5 µL of reservoir
solution consisting of 325 mM (NH4)H2PO4. Crystals formed
after 3– 4 weeks, were harvested, and cryo-protected with 35%
ethylene glycol followed by ﬂash-freezing in liquid nitrogen.
Diffraction data were collected at−173 °C (100 K) at beamline
ID23-1 (ESRF, Grenoble, France) using a 0.9793 Å wavelength.
Data reduction was performed using XDS74 and Aimless75 from
the CCP4 Suite76. The structure was solved via molecular repla-
cement with Phaser77 using an AlphaFold78 model as search
model. The initial model was reﬁned alternating cycles of manual
model building in COOT79,80 and automatic reﬁnement using
Phenix81 v.1.19.2_4158. Data collection and reﬁnement statistics
are reported in Table 1. The structure assembly was analyzed
using PISA82.
Sequence and structure analysis. Local alignments were per-
formed with BLASTp83 v.2.12.0+ or DIAMOND84 v.2.0.15, and
network analysis was carried out in Cytoscape85 v.3.9.1. Con-
served domains at the sequence level were inferred from the
Conserved Domain Database 86 (CDD). Heuristic structural
searches against the Protein Databank (PDB) were performed on
the Dali server87. Structural visualization and alignments were
performed with PyMOL88 v.2.0 and USFC Chimera89 v.1.16.
Substrate docking. The BHET substrate was docked into the
catalytic site of PET46 utilizing a combination of AutoDock390 as
a docking engine and DrugScore201891,92 as an objective func-
tion. Following an established procedure91,93, the docking pro-
tocol considered 100 independent runs for BHET using an initial
population size of 150 individuals, a maximum of 50,000 gen-
erations, a maximum of 106 energy evaluations, a mutation rate
of 0.02, a crossover rate of 0.8, and an elitism value of 1. The
Lamarckian genetic algorithm was chosen for sampling in all
approaches. Distances between atoms were measured using the
PyMOL Molecular Graphics System88 v.2.3.0.
PET degradation assays. Respectively, 3 µM PET46 WT (roughly
0.1 mg mL−1), the generated variants, IsPETase or LCC were
incubated with 50 µM ethylene terephthalate linear trimer (3PET,
Toronto Research Chemicals, Ontario, Canada), 150 µM bis-(2-
hydroxyethyl) terephthalate (BHET), 150 µM mono-(2-hydro-
xyethyl) terephthalate (MHET; Merck, Darmstadt, Germany),
7 mg amorphous PET foil platelet (product no. ES301445;
a = 5m m2, 33.6 µmol or 168 mM TPA eq.; GoodFellow GmbH,
Hamburg, Germany), 2 mg semi-crystalline PET powder (product
no. ES306000; >40% crystallinity, d≈ 300 µm; 9.6 µmol or 48 mM
TPA eq.; GoodFellow GmbH, Hamburg, Germany), unless indi-
cated otherwise. The reaction took place under agitation in
200 µL with 0.1 M potassium phosphate buffer pH 8 at 30, 50, 60,
or 70 °C for a maximum of 5 days. Alternatively, 0.06 µM PET46
WT (roughly 2 µg mL−1), LCC or IsPETase were incubated with
150 mM BHET at 70, 50, or 30 °C, respectively, for up to 1 h. For
end point analysis, samples were prepared in 96 well microtiter
plates by adding 12.5 µL reaction supernatant to 50 µL acetonitrile
with 1% v/v triﬂuoroacetic acid (TFA) followed by centrifugation
(2,204 g, 30 min; A-2-DWP rotor, Eppendorf AG, Hamburg,
Germany) and transferring of 50 µL centrifugation supernatant
into 150 µL MilliQ H
2O. Samples were sealed using ZoneFree™
sealing ﬁlm (Excel Scientiﬁc, Victorville, CA, USA) and stored at
−20 °C until analysis. Samples were analyzed via RP-UHPLC
(UltiMate™ 3000 UHPLC system, Thermo Scientiﬁc, Waltham,
MA, USA) with a Triart C18 column (YMC Europe GmbH,
Dinslaken, Germany). Isocratic elution was done by using a
mobile phase consisting of 20:80 (v/v) acetonitrile and water
(acidiﬁed with 0.1% v/v triﬂuoroacetic acid) at a ﬂowrate of
0.4 mL min−129,94. Standards of the expected degradation pro-
ducts TPA, MHET, and BHET were analyzed to obtain the
respective elution times. All assays were performed in triplicates
and compared to an enzyme-free control.
Biochemical characterization. Initial biochemical characteriza-
tion aimed to identify the WT enzyme’s optimal temperature, pH,
and substrate chain length and was performed withpara-nitro-
phenyl (pNP) esters as described previously25,29,94. Shortly, 3 µM
enzyme were incubated with 1 mM substrate in 0.1 M citrate,
potassium phosphate, or carbonate-bicarbonate buffer and release
of pNP-OH was measured at 405 nm on a BioTek Synergy H1
plate reader (Agilent Technologies Deutschland GmbH, Wald-
bronn, Germany). To test the thermostability of the enzyme, it was
incubated at 60 and 70 °C for up to two weeks prior to apNP assay
under optimal conditions to quantify residual activity. Further-
more, the effect of metal ions, detergents, and organic solvents was
assayed. The enzyme was either pre-incubated for one hour with 1
or 10 mM Ca2+,C o2+,C u2+,F e3+,M g2+,M n2+,N i2+ or Zn2+
(chloride salts) or different detergents and organic solvents were
added to the standard reaction mixture (Supplementary Fig. 10).
To test for general ferulic acid esterase activity, a colorimetric pH-
shift-based assay with the model substrate ethyl cinnamate (EC) was
performed as described previously52. In short, the reactions took
place in 5 mM EPPS buffer with 0.45 mM phenol red. The release of
protons due to enzymatic cleavage of the ester results in a decrease
in absorbance at 550 nm, which is measured photometrically.
All assays were performed with 3 µM enzyme, unless otherwise
indicated, in triplicates, and compared to an enzyme- or additive-
free control.
Measuring of protein thermal stability. Approximately 1 mg mL−1
puriﬁed enzyme solution in 100 mM potassium phosphate buffer
with 100 mM NaCl (pH 7.2) was loaded into Nano Temper
capillary tubes. The capillary tubes were then loaded into a
Prometheus nanoDSF (NanoTemper Technologies GmbH,
Munich, Germany) and a melting scan with a range from 20 to
95 °C with a heating rate of 1 °C min−1 was performed. The
results were evaluated with the NanoTemper analytics software.
