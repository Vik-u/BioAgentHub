ABSTRACT  
The widespread utilization of polyethylene terephthalate (PET) has caused a variety of environmental and health 
problems. Compared with traditional thermomechanical or chemical PET cycling, the biodegradation of PET may 
offer a more feasible solution. Though the PETase from Ideonalla sakaiensis ( Is PETase) displays interesting PET 
degrading performance under mild conditions; the relatively low thermal stability of Is PETase limits its practical 
application. In this study, enzyme-catalysed PET degradation was investigated with the promising Is PETase 
mutant HotPETase (HP). On this basis, a carbohydrate-binding module from Bacillus anthracis ( Ba CBM) was fused 
to the C-terminus of HP to construct the PETase mutant (HLCB) for increased PET degradation. Furthermore, to 
effectively improve PET accessibility and PET-degrading activity, the truncated outer membrane hybrid protein 
(FadL) was used to expose PETase and Ba CBM on the surface of E. coli (BL21with) to develop regenerable whole- 
cell biocatalysts (D-HLCB). Results showed that, among the tested small-molecular weight ester compounds ( p - 
nitrophenyl phosphate ( p NPP), p -Nitrophenyl acetate ( p NPA), 4-Nitrophenyl butyrate ( p NPB)), PETase displayed 
the highest hydrolysing activity against p NPP. HP displayed the highest catalytic activity (1.94 μ M( p -NP)/min) at 
50 
◦
C and increased longevity at 40 
◦
C. The fused Ba CBM could clearly improve the catalytic performance of 
PETase by increasing the optimal reaction temperature and improving the thermostability. When HLCB was used 
for PET degradation, the yield of monomeric products (255.7 μ M) was ~25.5 % greater than that obtained after 
50 h of HP-catalysed PET degradation. Moreover, the highest yield of monomeric products from the D-HLCB- 
mediated system reached 1.03 mM. The whole-cell catalyst D-HLCB displayed good reusability and stability and 
could maintain more than 54.6 % of its initial activity for nine cycles. Finally, molecular docking simulations 
were utilized to investigate the binding mechanism and the reaction mechanism of HLCB, which may provide 
theoretical evidence to further increase the PET-degrading activities of PETases through rational design. The 
proposed strategy and developed variants show potential for achieving complete biodegradation of PET under 
mild conditions.   
1. Introduction 
Polyethylene terephthalate (PET) has greatly contributed the mod -
ern world and is widely applied in various fields because of its excellent 
mechanical and thermal properties ( Carniel et al., 2021; Taniguchi et al., 
2019 ). However, just as every coin has two sides, the increasing accu -
mulation of postconsumer PET waste in the natural environment has 
posed a serious threat to ecosystems, as PET exhibits exceptional dura -
bility and resistance to physicochemical and biochemical degradation 
( Gao et al., 2022; Tamargo et al., 2022 ). Therefore, effective strategies to 
address plastic pollution are urgently needed ( Singh Jadaun et al., 2022; 
Miri et al., 2022 ). The enzymatic biodegradation of PET offers a prom -
ising alternative to traditional thermomechanical or chemical PET 
cycling methods ( Cao et al., 2022 ). 
To date, various enzymes with efficient PET-degrading activity have 
been successfully identified; these enzymes are mainly members of the 
family of carboxylic ester hydrolases (EC 3.1.1.x), and most of them 
further fall into the subfamily of cutinases (cutinases or the cutinase-like 
PET-hydrolase), such as TfCut2, Cut190, HiC, and LCC ( Ellis et al., 2021; 
Zumstein et al., 2017; Tamoor et al., 2021; Kumar et al., 2022; Urbanek 
et al., 2021 ). These enzymes can cleave PET polymers into diverse 
monomeric products, including terephthalic acid (TPA), ethylene glycol

(EG), and mono-(2-hydroxyehyl)terephthalic acid (MHET) ( von Haug -
witz et al., 2022; Wei and Zimmermann, 2017; Moyses et al., 2021 ) 
( Tournier et al., 2020 ). In 2016, the bacterium Ideonella sakaiensis 
201-F6 was reported to proliferate on a low-crystallinity (1.9 %) PET 
film at 30 
◦
C for 40 days and hydrolyse PET with catalysis by two 
released enzymes (ISF6_4831 ( Is PETase) and ISF6_0224 ( Is MHETase)) 
( Yoshida et al., 2016 ). This led to the rapid development of Is PETase, an 
Is PETase-like enzyme, in the field of PET biodegradation ( Bell et al., 
2022; Son et al., 2020; Cui et al., 2021a; Liu et al., 2022; Shi et al., 2023 ). 
However, compared with chitinase or chitinase-like PET-degrading en -
zymes(e.g., LCC
ICCG (
Tournier et al., 2020
)
, Tf Cut-DM ( Yang et al., 
2023a )), Is PETase exhibits relatively lower PET-degrading activity and 
thermostability, and these problems have not been fully addressed to 
satisfy the needs of industrialization. Consequently, further engineered 
is needed to achieve more efficient PETases. 
Various strategies, such as directed evolution ( Bell et al., 2022 ), 
rational protein design ( Liu et al., 2022; Meng et al., 2021; Son et al., 
2019; Yin et al., 2022; Lu et al., 2022; Wu, 2021 ), posttranslational 
glycan modification ( Deng et al., 2023 ), enhanced secretory expression 
( Zurier and Goddard, 2023; Shi et al., 2021; Cui et al., 2021b; Seo et al., 
2019 ), and metabolic engineering of the utilized host, have been 
developed to improve the catalytic performance of PET-degrading en -
zymes. Moreover, rational construction of PET-degrading enzymes fused 
to the carbohydrate-binding module ( Dai et al., 2021; Ribitsch et al., 
2013; Zhang et al., 2013 ) or to hydrophobic proteins ( Puspitasari et al., 
2021a, 2021b; Ribitsch et al., 2015 ) has been confirmed to streamline 
the binding ability of the fused catalyst to the PET surface and improve 
the degradation of PET ( Weber et al., 2019 ). In 2019, a Bacillus anthracis 
carbohydrate-binding module (CBM) from family 2 ( Ba CBM2) ( Weber 
et al., 2019 ), which is the chitin-binding domain of a chitinase enzyme, 
was identified. In addition, researchers found that BaCBM2 has a high 
affinity for crystalline PET and can bind to insoluble polysaccharides, 
such as cellulose or xylan. Due to these findings, CBMs are promising 
tools for improving the catalytic performance of several different types 
of degrading enzymes. 
In addition, a strategy that involves cell surface display has been 
widely used to design renewable biocatalysts by expressing target en -
zymes on the surface of microbial cells ( Gercke et al., 2021; Tissopi et al., 
2022; He et al., 2022; Brandenberg et al., 2022 ). In this system, the 
target protein is synthesized in microbial cells and then automatically 
transferred to the cell surface through the cellular secretion system. The 
target protein is tethered as the fused cargo of the anchor protein on the 
cell surface. Therefore, the catalytic activities of the target enzyme are 
maintained on the cell surface, resulting in enhanced stability and 
reusability ( Chen et al., 2021a, 2022; Guo et al., 2023; Pham and 
Polakovi, 2020 ). This approach is valuable for designing and con -
structing cell factories for use as whole-cell catalysts to efficiently bio -
synthesize biochemicals with high added value. 
In this study, a promising PETase, HP ( Bell et al., 2022 ), was further 
rationally engineered. Fusing HP to Ba CBM2 and functional interaction 
with the surface of E. coli cells were designed to improve the 
PET-degrading ability of HP. The results showed that the engineered 
mutants displayed improved degrading activity against PET, which may 
be an efficient and environmentally friendly whole-cell catalyst for the 
biocatalytic degradation of PET. 
2. Materials and methods 
2.1. Bacterial strains, plasmids and reagents 
HP was employed as the starting point for protein engineering, and 
the genes in Fig. 1 ( such as HP gene (792 bp) ( Bell et al., 2022 ) and the 
HLCB gene) were all chemically synthesized and codon optimized by 
Tsingke Biotechnology ( https://tsingke.com.cn/ ). The pET22b ( + ) 
plasmid was used as the expression vector, and pET30(a) was used for 
the cell surface display of PETase. E. coli DH5 α maintained in our lab -
oratory was used as the amplification host, and E. coli BL21 (DE3) was 
employed as the host to heterogeneously express HP and the mutants. 
All the primers used in this study were chemically synthesized by San -
gon Biotech ( https://www.sangon.com/ ). 
2.2. Gene cloning and construction of recombinant bacteria 
Construction of the HP expression vector (p22-HP). The HP gene 
was cloned and inserted into the Hind III and BamH I sites of pET22b ( + ), 
resulting in the recombinant plasmid p22-HP. 
Construction of the fusion expression vector for HLCB (p22- 
HLC). The carbohydrate-binding module ( Ba CBM2, GenBank: 
MK349005.1) was fused to the C-terminus of HP to form the recombi -
nant plasmid p22-HLC, which contains a Sec-dependent translocation 
signal peptide, pelB , for secretion. Synthetic oligonucleotides encoding 
sequences of the flexible peptide linker (GGGGS)3 were introduced be -
tween the pelB and HP genes, and also between HP and the 
carbohydrate-binding module. 
Construction of an E. coli display system (p30-D-HLC). The 
truncated fadL gene (NCBI Reference Sequence: NC_000913.3) was 
chemically synthesized and linked to the PETase gene at the C-terminus 
with flexible peptide linkers (GGGGS)
3
, and the other end of the PETase 
was linked to Ba CBM2 with the same linkers (GGGGS)
3 
(FHLCB, shown 
in Fig. 1 ). The constructed gene fragment was then cloned and inserted 
into the Nde I and Xho I sites of pET30(a), which formed the recombinant 
plasmid p30-D-HLC. 
All the (recombinant) enzymes carried a C-terminal 6xHis-Tag for 
rapid purification by affinity chromatography. The sequence-verified 
plasmids were subsequently transformed into E. coli BL21 (DE3)

competent cells, resulting in the recombinant strains for the (or secre -
tory) production of heterologous proteins. 
2.3. Expression, protein quantitation and enzymatic assays 
The recombinant strain was cultured overnight and subsequently 
inoculated into 50 ml of fresh Luria – Bertani (LB) medium supplemented 
with 50 mg/L kanamycin (for D-HLCB) or 100 mg/L ampicillin (for HP 
and HLCB) at 37 
◦
C and 200 rpm until the cell density at 600 nm (OD
600
) 
reached 0.6 – 0.8. A final concentration of 0.5 mM isopropyl- β -D-thio -
galactopyranoside (IPTG) was added to the culture before it was incu -
bated at 25 
◦
C and 200 rpm for 10 – 12 h. The cells were harvested by 
centrifugation at 6000 × g for 10 min at 4 
◦
C. The pellet was resus -
pended and washed three times in ice-cold 50 mM Gly-NaOH buff er (pH 
9.0), and the cells were resuspended and disrupted by ultrasonic waves. 
After centrifugation, the crude enzyme solution was purified by a Ni 
affinity column. The homogeneity of the purified protein was assessed 
by SDS
–
PAGE, and the protein concentrations were measured by a 
Pierce BCA Protein Assay Kit (Shanghai, Thermo Fisher Scientific Co., 
Ltd.). 
It is known that the PETase is capable of catalysing ester bond hy -
drolysis displaying esterase and lipase activities. Accordingly, the ester 
bond of different ester compounds hydrolysis could be used for efficient 
high-throughput screening of PETase variants. Therefore, the PETase 
activity in this study was determined by using the selected p -nitrophenyl 
palmitate ( p NPP) as a model substrate ( Liu et al., 2022; Ma et al., 2018 ). 
The purified protein (or D-HLCB) was added into190 μ L of in 50 mM 
glycine-NaOH buffer (pH 9.0) with 10 μ L of p NPP solution (25 mM). 
After incubation for 30 min at 40 
◦
C, the reaction was terminated by 
adding 100 μ L methyl alcohol. The reaction mixture was then analysed 
by microplate reader at 405 nm (A410). For the D-HLCB, the reaction 
was terminated by centrifuged to separate D-HLCB from the reaction 
mixture. The optimum temperatures of variants were determined at 
temperatures ranging from 40 
◦
C to 70 
◦
C in 50 mM glycine-NaOH 
buffer (pH 9.0) as mentioned above. For the bio-catalysis of PET film 
(T = 0.019 mm), the film was cut into 0.5 × 0.5 cm
2 
pieces (~100 mg) 
and washed with distilled water, and ethanol, then they are dried at 60 
◦
C for 1 h. The degradation of PET film was performed in 50 mM 
glycine-NaOH buffer (pH 9.0) with HP, HLCB and D-HLCB in a reaction 
volume of 20 ml at 40 
◦
C and constant agitation. The reaction was 
terminated by centrifuged to separate PET film (or D-HLCB) from the 
reaction mixture, which would be then analysed by microplate reader at 
562 nm (A
562
) 
One unit of enzyme activity was defined as the release of 1 µ m ol p - 
nitrophenol ( p -NP) per minute at 40 
◦
C, and the p -NP was detected by 
microplate reader at 405 nm (A
410
). All the experiments were repeated 
three times. 
2.4. Molecular docking of substrate recognition and the catalytic 
mechanism 
Molecular docking was performed to determine the molecular basis 
and mode of action of the PETase using Discovery Studio (DS) 4.0. A 
homology model of HLCB was generated by MODELER implanted in the 
DS with 7QVH, 6QFS, 2XBD, 1EXG, and 1E5C as the best templates, and 
the model with the lowest total PDF energy was identified as the optimal 
protein structure. 
Flexible docking within the DS was used to investigate the docking 
process during PET degradation. The crystal structure of HotPETase 
(PDB ID: 7QVH) was used to designate the receptor. The substrate 
binding site (CC) was defined as the domain lined by the residues Y87, 
T88, A89, N241, N244, S245, N246, R280, M161, W185, I208, S160, 
H237, S236, I232, N233 and D206. Residues at Ser160, Asp206 and 
His237 were identified as the catalytic triad, and the “ selected flexible 
residues ” were defined as “ CC ” . The default settings for the other pa -
rameters associated with this process were utilized. 
LibDock implanted in the DS was used to investigate the docking 
process that underlies the PET-binding process of CBM. The homology 
model of HLCB was used as the receptor, and the binding sphere lined by 
the residues W288, W323 and W342 was defined with a radius of 
20.7037 Å. The ligands (2-HE(MHET)
4
) used in this study were gener -
ated with DS. 
Force fields (CHARMm) and energy minimization were applied to 
the target proteins and the ligands, respectively, to guarantee reliable 
docking analysis. The highest score with a reasonable conformation 
indicated that the most favourable binding occurred with the target 
complex structure. The interactions between the ligand and the target in 
the binding processes were analysed. 
All other parameters were left as default values. 
3. Results and discussion 
3.1. Screening of the optimal substrate for PETase 
To establish an efficient high-throughput screening method for the 
determination of PET-degrading activity of PETase, substrate screening 
was firstly carried out to identify the optimal small-molecular weight 
ester substrates for efficient determination of PETase activity. The re -
sults ( Fig. 2 ) indicated that HP displayed hydrolysing activities against 
all the tested substrates ( p NPA, p NPB, and p NPP) at different concen -
trations; however, HP achieved the best catalytic performance against 
p NPP, which generated the maximum reaction rate and product yields at 
the same substrate concentration. 
Therefore, in the following studies, p NPP was selected as a model 
esterase substrate for the determination of the catalytic performance of 
PETase mutants. 
3.2. Effects of reaction temperature on the catalytic performance of HP, 
HLCB, and D-HLCB 
As shown in Fig. 3 , it was found that the catalytic activities of HP, 
HLCB and D-HLCB increased first, and then decreased, which would 
reach the peaks at 50 
◦
C. Especially, to further increase the reaction 
temperatures (above 50
◦
C), the catalytic performance would be signif -
icantly inhibited. After ~80 min of incubation at 60 
◦
C, the catalytic 
activities were decreased by ~45 %, 62.8 % and 50.3 % respectively or 
HP, HLCB and D-HLCB compared with those incubated at 60 
◦
C. 
From Fig. 3 (1), the enzymatic hydrolysing activity of p -NPP cata -
lysed by HP were explored at various temperatures. At 50 
◦
C, the 
maximum initial reaction rate was obtained before 80 min. However, 
the highest conversion rate of 29.87 % ( c
product
/ c
substrate
)was obtained 
after ~160 min of incubation. With increasing (or decreasing) incuba -
tion temperature to 70 
◦
C, the maximum conversion rate decreased to 
8.05 % ( c
product
/ c
substrate
). This indicated that increasing the tempera -
ture accelerated the catalytic rate of the HP; however, with increasing 
time, increasing the reaction temperature inevitably reduced the cata -
lytic performance of the HP. This result is different from the finding in 
which HP depolymerized semicrystalline PET more rapidly at ~65 
◦
C 
( Bell et al., 2022 ). This difference possibly occurred because at tem -
peratures approaching the reported glass transition temperature ( T
g
) of 
PET (~ 60 – 70 
◦
C) in aqueous solution, the mobile amorphous fraction of 
the PET polymer could be preferentially accessed by hydrolases and 
converted into soluble products, resulting in increased PET-degrading 
activity ( Wu, 2021; Pirillo et al., 2023 ). Results also revealed that re -
action temperature above 75 
◦
C was shown to be detrimental to PET 
conversion caused by rapid recrystallization of PcW-PET ( Tournier et al., 
2020 ). Therefore, blind pursuit of higher PET-degrading temperature 
would display a negative effect on the kinetic turnover. As a result, in 
this study for the small-molecule substrate p NPP, the operating tem -
perature at approximately the T g might exert little stimulatory effect on 
the substrate-degrading enzymes.

different reaction temperatures (40, 50, and 60 
◦
C) revealed that HP is a 
robust catalyst with increased longevity at 40 
◦
C. Although an increased 
reaction temperature improves catalytic performance ( Bell et al., 2022 ), 
it inevitably decreases enzyme stability, leading to decreased catalytic 
activity. Therefore, it is necessary to further improve the operational 
stability. 
As shown in Fig. 3 (2,3), the adsorption time courses of HLCB and D- 
HLCB were investigated at various temperatures. At 50 
◦
C, the 
maximum yield of the released products was achieved after ~160 min of 
incubation, with the highest conversion rate of 22.31 %. With increasing 
(or decreasing) incubation temperature to 60 
◦
C, the maximum con -
version rate decreased to 6.13 % after 2 h of incubation. Therefore, 50 
◦
C is the optimal reaction temperature for HLCB-catalysed plastic 
degradation. The optimal temperatures for HLCB and D-HLCB were 10 
◦
C greater than that for HP (40 
◦
C). On the one hand, this could occur 
because HP is a relatively thermostable variant of Is PETase, which was

consistent with previous findings ( Bell et al., 2022 ). This finding is 
similar to the improved optimal reaction temperature of fusion proteins 
(LCC
ICCG
- Tr CBM and CfC BM-LCC
ICCG
) ( Chen et al., 2023 ). On the other 
hand, it was estimated that the direct interactions between the fused 
CBMs and PETase might contribute to the increased thermostability. The 
underlying mechanism is investigated in the following sections. 
In addition, ( Fig. 3 (3)) temperature had different effects on the cat -
alytic activity of D-HLCB and HLCB. No significant changes were 
observed at relatively high temperatures (40 – 50 
◦
C), although 
increasing the temperature slightly improved the enzymatic activity. 
However, at higher reaction temperatures (60 – 70 
◦
C), the degradation 
activity was significantly inhibited. This difference might result from the 
improved catalytic performance of the cell-surface displayed protein, 
and the cell surface might provide natural protection from higher 
ambient temperatures. On the other hand, enzymes immobilized on the 
cell surface might be structurally stable and resistant to the effects of 
extreme heat. 
3.2.1. Thermostabilities of HP, HLCB, and D-HLCB 
Thermostability plays a critical role in the catalytic performance of 
PETase, especially in industrial applications. As shown in Fig. 4 , the 
stabilities of the PETase-associated enzymes decreased markedly at 
higher reaction temperatures, such as 60 
◦
C or 70 
◦
C. For example, at 70 
◦
C after heat treatment for 2 h, only ~ 50.2 %, 65.2 %, and 7.65 % of the 
initial activities of HP, HLCB and D-HLCB, respectively, were main -
tained. It was further confirmed that the Ba CBM utilized probably in -
creases the resistance of the fused protein to higher temperatures. The 
potential mechanisms underlying the increased thermostability of HLCB 
were investigated in the following section. 
Further investigations revealed that the whole-cell catalyst D-HLCB 
had the poorest stability. This is a strange phenomenon for an immo -
bilized enzyme. The cell debris resulting from heat treatment might 
account for the decreased catalytic activity of D-HLCB rather than the 
disruption of PETase by heat treatment. The cell surface on which HLCB 
was displayed was disrupted by high-temperature processing. The 
released cell debris further covers a large proportion of the enzyme 
surface and may have a critical impact on the reduced catalytic per -
formance. The PET-binding reaction catalysed by CBM and the PET- 
degradation catalysed by PETase occur on the enzyme surface. There -
fore, the whole-cell catalyst with D-HLCB displayed on the cell surface 
was more likely to be inhibited by heat treatment. 
3.2.2. Study on the effects of CBM on the thermostability of PETase 
It was reported that spatial arrangement might play affect the cata -
lytic performance of fusion catalysts, and the stimulatory effect disap -

. Therefore, it is reasonable to speculate 
that the fused CBM directly contributes to the improved thermostability 
by increasing the interactions with the PETase. 
To investigate this hypothesis, the structure of the fusion protein 
(HLCB) was constructed with MODELER. The interactions between the 
fused linker-CBM and PETase are simulated with flexible docking, and 
the best interaction modes are obtained based on the lowest docking 
energy with reasonable spatial configuration. The detailed interactions 
are highlighted in Fig. 5 . The fused CBM is located on the surface of 
PETase and can directly interact with critical residues in the α 7 helices

(S243 and C247), α 6 helices (R234) and β 1 helices (N262). Moreover, 
the linker sequence acts as a “ zipper ” located across β 4 and β 5, and it can 
interact with critical residues in the α 3-helix (S143) and α 6-helix (M236, 
W231, and G238). In particular, strong H-bonds could be formed be -
tween resides S269 and M236, G268 and G228, Y335 and C247, Y335 
and S243, and N262 and N316. A salt bridge could also be formed be -
tween E312 and R234. These interactions not only provide physical 
protection but also further increase the structural rigidity of PETase, 
increasing its stability. 
3.3. PET degradation catalysed by the constructed catalysts 
3.3.1. HLCB- and D-HLCB-mediated PET-mediated degradation 
3.3.1.1. HP. Due to the special catalytic mechanism of HP, its potential 
applications could be extended to the biodegradation of PET waste, 
which can cause ubiquitous pollution. In this study, the use of PETase for 
the biodecomposition of widely used plastic bags (with low crystallinity) 
was investigated. As previously found ( Bell et al., 2022; Wu, 2021 ), the 
reaction profile ( Fig. 6 (1), product accumulation over time) in this study 
was nonlinear, with a faster initial phase occurring after ~5 h and by a 
slower phase after 5 – 30 h. 
The PET bags treated with HP ( Fig. 6 (1)) clearly degraded during the 
first 20 h, especially during the first 10 h, due to the increased catalytic 
stability of the HP. This finding corresponds with the biodegradation of 
0.4 % cryPET substrate catalysed by HP ( Bell et al., 2022 ). As revealed 
by the time course of reactions with HP, for reactions catalysed by HP, 
monomeric products can continue to accumulate for over 60 h. PET 
degradation probably ceased after ~70 h, maintaining an essentially 
constant yield of monomeric products (271.5 μ M after 71 h). 
3.3.1.2. HLCBs. As shown in Fig. 6 (2), the higher PET degradation rate 
was partly caused by the increased hydrophobic affinity towards PET; as 
the hydrophobic substrate binding surface was flatter than those of other 
PET-degrading enzymes ( Joo et al., 2018 ). Therefore, the feasibility of 
using the carbohydrate-binding module to further improve PET degra -
dation activity via the use of HP, which exhibits a higher affinity for PET 
substrates, was investigated. 
Compared to the HP, HLCB exhibited relatively lower degradation 
activity in the first 20 h; however, the catalytic activity rapidly 
increased beginning at approximately 25 h. After 50 h, the yield of 
monomeric products (255.7 μ M) generated by HLCB was ~25.5 % 
greater than that obtained from HP-catalysed PET degradation 
(203.7 μ M). These findings are consistent with previous results showing 
that more time is needed for CBMs or hydrophobins to efficiently bind to 
the PET surface ( Puspitasari et al., 2021a ). If the assembly process is 
disrupted, the unwell-assembled CBMs will contribute little to the 
enhanced affinity of PETase for PET and stimulate the hydrolysis pro -
cess. Therefore, it is reasonable that for the first ~20 h, HLCB displayed 
a relatively lower catalytic performance.

Interestingly, fusing CBMs onto the C-terminus of HP had a stimu -
latory effect on the enzymatic hydrolysis of PET. However, after ~60 h, 
the PET depolymerization rate clearly decreased, which was attributed 
to the decreased operational stability. Although the accumulation of 
monomeric products might terminate after ~80 h, the enzymatic PET 
degradation catalysed by HLCB was prolonged and increased by 
approximately 10 hours. The catalytic performance of HLCB increased 
by ~11.1-fold from 0.89 μ М (monomeric products)/protein ( μ g/ml) to 
9.87 μ М /protein ( μ g/ml). This difference might be caused by the 
increased thermostability. 
These findings suggest that fusing a polymer-binding module to PET 
PET-degrading catalysts is a promising strategy for stimulating the 
enzymatic hydrolysis of PET. 
3.3.1.3. D-HLCB. E. coli cells that contained the HLCB expression sys -
tem were coincubated with PET film from waste PET bags, and the re -
sults further highlighted the roles of fused CBMs in PET biodegradation. 
The fused CBMs could act on PET substrates, contributing to the efficient 
degradation of PETase; these effects might result from the colonized 
CBMs on the PET surface, which lead to higher concentrations of PETase 
and better contact on the PET film. 
Similar to the reaction catalysed by HLCB, a longer time is needed for 
the CBMs to efficiently react with the PET surface, which leads to slower 
initial degradation (~25 h, Fig. 6 (3)). Subsequently, PET depolymer -
ization dramatically increased as the released products accumulated 
faster and increased in concentrations over time. The highest yield of 
monomeric products was up to 1.03 mM. Moreover, D-HLCB could 
maintain PET-degrading activity after ~100 h, which was further 
increased by ~ 20 hours compared with that of HLCB. This revealed that 
the stability of the displayed PETase might also be improved. 
3.3.2. Reusability of the whole-cell catalyst D-HLCB 
The reusability of catalysts plays a critical role in reducing costs for 
industrial applications. In this study, the number of cycles in the D-HLCB 
system was investigated. The results ( Fig. 7 ) showed that the displayed 
PET-degrading catalysts on the surface of E. coli cells could continuously 
maintain degradation activity. The residual activity of the D-HLCB sys -
tem revealed a relatively low loss of PET-degrading activity during the 
Fig. 6. PET degradation catalysed by HP, HLCB and D-HLCB. The concentrations of HP and HLCB were 230 μ g/ml and 25.9 μ g/ml, respectively; the final OD

of 
the D-HLCB cells used for enzymatic PET degradation was 7.93.

recycling process, and 54.6 % of its initial activity was maintained after 
nine cycles. In particular, recovery of D-HLCB could be achieved with an 
inexpensive strategy by centrifugation or filtration from the reaction 
system. These results indicate that the constructed D-HLCB system has 
enhanced reusability and sustainability and shows great potential for 
further PET degradation. 
3.4. Molecular insights into the catalytic mechanisms of HCLB 
3.4.1. Investigation of the PET-binding mechanisms of CBMs 
The noncatalytic domains widely present in polysaccharide- 
degrading enzymes can facilitate substrate recognition and binding. 
Although CBM binding is promiscuous, it helps enrich the enzyme on the 
substrate surface. Among the different CBMs, type A CBMs (e.g., 
Ba CBM2) are surface-binding proteins that include members of families 
1, 2a, 3, 5, and 10. They are usually characterized by their high ability to 
bind insoluble, highly crystalline polysaccharides (e.g., cellulose and 
chitin). This process is largely promoted by the special platform-like 
binding site lined by several surface-exposed aromatic amino acid resi -
dues, especially the aromatic triad that consists of W9-W44-W63 (for 
Ba CBM2, Fig. 8 (1)) ( Zhang et al., 2013 ). 
Docking studies showed that 2-HE(MHET)
4 
could readily enter the 
binding site of Ba CBM, and the surrounding polar amino acids could 
interact with the PET surface mainly through π -stacking interactions 
(shown as pink dotted lines) and H-bonds (shown as green lines) ( Fig. 8 
(2, 3, 4)). The roles of W288 and W323 in PET binding were confirmed 
in this study. Residues W288, V322, I327, K326, W309, I306, I298, 
K299, and L311 can form π -stacking interactions with PET; in addition, 
G291, Y292, Q321, S325, K326, K299 and I296 can form H-bonds with 
the PET surface. However, the initial binding of W342 to PET was not 
identified. This difference might occur because the initial binding of PET 
likely induces a structural rearrangement of Ba CBM, resulting in 
simultaneous access of W342 and N343 to the PET surface ( Weber et al., 
2019; Rennison et al., 2023 ). Therefore, W342 might be a potential

T. Wang et al.

target for performing site-directed mutagenesis to improve the affinity 
of Ba CBM for the PET surface ( Rennison et al., 2023 ). 
3.4.2. Docking studies of the PET-degrading mechanisms of HP 
Is PETases belong to the α / β hydrolase superfamily, and the central 
twisted β -sheet is formed by 9 mixed β -strands and surrounded by 7 
α -helices ( Joo et al., 2018 ). As expected, Is PETase also contains the 
highly conserved serine hydrolase G-X1-S-X2-G motif 
(G158-W159-S160-M161-G162), which is located at the active site. 
The catalytic activity and thermostability of PETase are closely 
linked to its structural effects, such as its conformation and different 
folded/native states. On the other hand, although crystal structures of 
different PETases or complex structures with monomeric products (e.g., 
HEMT [PDB ID: 5XH3]) have already been described, relatively few 
detailed structures that illustrate the degradation process of PET sub -
strates are available. To gain further insight into the potential func -
tionalities, especially the structural roles, of PETase and CBMs, 
molecular docking simulations were carried out with the 2-HE(MHET)
4 
molecule as the ligand. The residues lining the binding cleft residues 
were set as flexible during the docking simulations. 
As shown in Fig. 9 (A), the polymer chain 2-HE(MHET)
4 
of PET could 
suitably stretch to fill the substrate binding cleft (PETase) across the 
protein surface, and the TPA moiety could bind to the active site in a way 
similar to the MHET complex structure of a cutinase from Thermobifida 
fusca ( Yang et al., 2023b ; Zeng et al., 2022 ). At the active site, the TPA 
moiety is located exactly immediately above the catalytic triad formed 
by S160, H237, and D206. In addition, the substrate in the long binding 
cleft could be further stabilized by different interactions. The TPA 
moiety is stabilized by hydrophobic interactions (formed with I208 and 
A89, shown as pink dotted lines in Fig. 9 (B)) and weak H-bonding 
(formed with Y87, shown as a light green dotted line in Fig. 9 (B)). The 
aliphatic part is mainly maintained by H-bond interactions formed with 
C233, G234, S245, S242, and G243, especially 2 strong H-bonds formed 
with S92 ( Fig. 9 (B)). Through these interactions, the whole polymer 
chain could be tightly bound to the active site. 
As shown in Fig. 10 (A), this binding cleft may accommodate as long 
as four monomers, 2-HE(MHET) (2-HE(MHET)
4
). Therefore, PET- might 
be biodegraded in an ‘ endo ’ way catalysed by PETase, similar to the 
functions of TfCut, which first causes random cleavage of the side chains 
that enter the binding cleft. Once the smaller degrading intermediates 
(e.g., 2-HE(MHET)
4
, 2-HE(MHET)
4
, and MHET) are released, the “ exo - 
reaction ” could further catalyse the hydrolysis of the produced in -
termediates into various monomeric products, such as MHET, TPA, and 
EG. 
To investigate the abovementioned mechanism of PETase degrada -
tion, MHET and 2-HE(MHET)
2 
were chosen as substrate mimics for use

in the following study. The docking results revealed that the binding 
modes of MHET ( Fig. 10 (B)) and 2-HE(MHET)
2
, which were bound to 
the binding cleft, ( Fig. 10 (A)) proximal to the catalytic S160were similar 
to each other. The aromatic ring of the TPA moiety forms π -stacking 
interactions with W185, M161 and Y87 (shown as pink dotted lines); 
moreover, the carbonyl group of the reactive ester bond can form H- 
bonds with Y87 and G86. In particular, site-directed mutagenesis further 
demonstrated that Y87 dramatically influences PET degradation ( Han 
et al., 2017 ), which might be caused by a decreased substrate binding 
affinity, as mentioned above. Therefore, the results strongly suggested

that regulating hydrophobic amino acids (W185 and I208) to increase 
the openness of the PET-binding cleft and appropriate rotation of the 
side chain (especially the benzene ring) of Y87 would improve the cat -
alytic activity, which might further improve the PET-degrading perfor -
mance of PETase. 
In addition, the interaction mode of 2-HE(MHET)
2 
revealed that 
hydroxy and the second ester bond could also form H-bond interactions 
with R207 and N205 (Fig. 10(A)). W185 functions as a “gatekeeper”, 
and the orientation of its side chain plays a critical role in accommo -
dating the longer chains of PET substrates (Fig. 10(C)). The results also 
revealed that regulating the flexibility of the W185 region (Liu et al., 
2022) contributes to the catalytic performance of the DuraPETa -
se
N233C/S282C/H214S/S245R 
mutant. Furthermore, it was found that the 
segment around the active site (R171, N186, F218, S214, D186) plays 
critical roles in regulating the degradation activity and thermostability 
of PETase (Joho et al., 2023; Chen et al., 2021b), possibly through 
“W185 wobbling” and β6-β7 loop flexibility. 
Like that of carboxylesterases, protonated S160 of PETase should 
function as a covalent nucleophile for the carbonyl carbon atom in the 
scissile ester bond (Liu et al., 2023), and this initial acylation may be the 
rate-limiting step for the catalytic process of PETase (Boneta et al., 
2021). In addition, a study indicated that the initial acylation and final 
deacylation steps (substrate release) might be the competing 
rate-limiting steps (Feng et al., 2021). As shown by the docking studies 
(Fig. 10(D)), MHET and 2-HE(MHET)
2 
are very stable in the active site, 
and their reactive ester bonds are directly related to the catalytic S160. 
This binding pose facilitates an attack of the active ester bond by the 
catalytic residue S160. 
Based on these findings, the PET-degrading activity of PETase could 
be improved by site-directed mutagenesis to rationally shorten the dis -
tance between the carbonyl carbon atom of the reactive ester bond and 
the hydroxy oxygen of the catalytic S160. However, this might result in 
unexpected consequences for the hydrophobic substrate-binding pocket. 
4. Conclusions 
PET-plastics have been widely applied in daily life as storage mate -
rials and synthetic fabrics. However, resistance to chemical and bio -
logical degradation has led to the rapid accumulation of PET wastes in 
terrestrial and marine ecosystems at a terrifying rate. Recently, 
numerous efforts have been dedicated to alleviating this problem 
through the enzymatic hydrolysis of PETase-mediated PET degradation. 
In this study, a promising IsPETase mutant (HP) was applied for efficient 
PET biodegradation, which should be amenable to industrial application 
at mild temperature. The carbohydrate-binding module fused to PETase 
was further confirmed to improve the degradation of PET, including its 
catalytic activity and thermostability. However, the detailed mechanism 
responsible for the increased thermostability should be further investi -
gated. Moreover, the whole-cell biocatalyst D-HLCB was shown to 
exhibit high thermal stability and high PET degradation activity. In 
particular, the HLCB displayed on the surface of E. coli could be used to 
efficiently degrade PET through enzymatic catalysis. Moreover, D-HLCB 
was shown to display good reusability and stability and could maintain 
more than 50 % of its initial activity for 9 cycles. This whole-cell catalyst 
shows great potential for providing an economical and efficient 
approach for the industrial biodegradation of PET waste. 
Moreover, we elucidated the substrate-binding mechanisms and 
potential degradation mechanisms of PETase, and the critical residues 
associated with these biological processes were also identified. It is 
strongly believed that this structural information could be very effec -
tively utilized in rational molecular engineering of PETase to further 
improve its thermal stability and PET degradation activity, which would 
provide opportunities for further industrial biodegradation of PET 
waste.
