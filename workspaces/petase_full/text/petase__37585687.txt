ABSTRACT: Polyethylene terephthalate (PET) is the most
abundant polyester plastic, widely used in textiles and packaging,
but, unfortunately, it is also one of the most discarded plastics after
one use. In the last years, the enzymatic biodegradation of PET has
sparked great interest owing to the discovery and subsequent
mutation of PETase-like enzymes, able to depolymerize PET.
FAST-PETase is one of the best enzymes hitherto proposed to
efficiently degrade PET, although the origin of its efficiency is not
completely clear. To understand the molecular origin of its
enhanced catalytic activity, we have carried out a thorough
computational study of PET degradation by the FAST-PETase
action by employing classical and hybrid (QM/MM) molecular
dynamics (MD) simulations. Our findings show that the rate-
limiting reaction step for FAST-PETase corresponds to the
acylation stage with an estimated free energy barrier of 12.1 kcal mol
−1
, which is significantly smaller than that calculated for
PETase (16.5 kcal mol
−1
) and, therefore, supports the enhanced catalytic activity of FAST-PETase. The origin of this enhancement
is mainly attributed to the N233K mutation, which, although sited relatively far from the active site, induces a chain folding where
the Asp206 of the catalytic triad is located, impeding that this residue sets effective H-bonds with its neighboring residues. This effect
makes Asp206 hold a more basic character compared to the wild-type PETase and boosts the interaction with the protonated
His237 of the catalytic triad in the transition state of acylation, with the consequent decrease of the catalytic barrier and acceleration
of the PET degradation reaction.

INTRODUCTION
Plastics are ubiquitous materials in our daily lives due to their
excellent durability, lightness, and low cost. The total
production of plastics reached 390.7 million tons in 2021.
1
However, only 14% of produced plastics is recycled, and the
rest is incinerated (14%), deposited in a landfill (40%), or
leaked to the environment (32%).
2
Considering that plastics
have a high chemical and biological stability, they can remain
in the environment for hundreds of years,
3
becoming a threat
to terrestrial and marine ecosystems. Moreover, in recent
studies, the presence of microplastics in seafood and foodstuff
has been clearly documented, exposing humans to contami-
nated food with an impact on human health that is not fully
understood yet.
4
For all this, the development of new
technologies that allow us to reduce, reuse, and recycle our
plastic residues efficiently is a worldwide challenge for our
current society.
Polyethylene terephthalate (PET), obtained from the
polycondensation of terephthalic acid (TPA) and ethylene
glycol (EG), is likely to be the most common thermoplastic
polymer whose ester group confers superior resistance to
(bio)degradation (Figure 1a). PET is widely used in the food
industry as liquid and food containers but also as clothing
fibers.
5
Unfortunately, it is also one of the most discarded
plastics after one use (e.g., plastic bottles for water).
6
Currently, the recycling of PET is partially achieved by
employing a mechanical transformation from which clothing
fibers can be obtained and reused for the textile industry.
Nevertheless, the complete degradation or depolymerization of
PET to its original components (TPA and EG) by chemical
methods (chemical recycling) is an expensive (both econom-
ically and energetically) industrial process compared to its
production from fossil fuel monomers.
7,8
Faced with this
problem, a more ecological alternative is the enzymatic
biodegradation of PET.
9,10
This biotechnological recycling
route uses biocatalysts (i.e., enzymes) to hydrolyze the ester-
type bonds present in PET and thus recover the starting TPA
and EG monomers for further re-polymerization. This green

technology is, therefore, very attractive since it allows us not
only to reach the desired closed-loop recycling of PET
(circular economy) but also to meet the Sustainable Develop-
ment Goals. Although the initial degradation yields for PET-
hydrolyzing enzymes were low for industrial implementa-
tion,
9,11−13
new scientific advances in recent years foresee a
promising future for enzymatic biorecycling of PET and other
plastics.
10,14−21
An important breakthrough was achieved by Yoshida and
collaborators with the discovery of a bacterium (Ideonella
Sakaiensis 201-F6) able to degrade and assimilate PET as its
sole source of carbon and energy.
14
Two enzymes (PETase
and MHETase) were identified to be responsible for the
depolymerization of PET into its original building blocks, TPA
and EG (Figure 1a). Among the two enzymes, PETase is the
enzyme that does the hardest work by recurrently decompos-
ing the PET polymeric chain into the mono (2-hydroxyethyl)
terephthalate (MHET), with trace amounts of TPA and bis(2-
hydroxyethyl) terephthalate (BHET) as secondary products.
Closing the catalytic process, MHETase then hydrolyzes

MHET into TPA and EG monomers. In particular, PETase
from Ideonella Sakaiensis is an interesting target due to its
capability of degrading PET at moderate temperatures (30 °C)
more efficiently than other PET-hydrolyzing enzymes,
14
and
has received considerable attention in the scientific commun-
ity. Initially, scientific efforts were focused on the character-
ization of the PETase structure and its underlying PET-
degrading mechanism. Almost in parallel, Han et al.
22
and Joo
et al.
23
were able to identify the active site of PETase, in which
the PET substrate was accommodated, as well as the relevant
amino acids responsible for the enzyme:PET complex and the
biocatalytic process (Figure 1b). Both studies revealed that the
active site of PETase holds a typical catalytic triad (Ser160-
His237-Asp206), in line with other hydrolases,
24
two amino
acids (Met161 and Tyr87), able to stabilize the oxygen of the
PET carbonyl group by H-bonds (oxyanion hole), and an
aromatic amino acid (Trp185), which can interact by π-
stacking with a benzene ring of PET (Figure 1b). Austin et al.
further confirmed the initial structural analysis after crystalizing
the structure of the PETase enzyme at a more accurate
resolution (0.92 Å).
25
From this structural information, it was
proposed that PETase follows the typical catalytic mechanism
for cutinases, which comprises two steps (Scheme 1): an
acylation process, with the formation of an intermediate acyl-
enzyme complex and the release of a hydroxyethyl(HE)-
terminal PET fragment, and deacylation, with the enzyme
returning to its initial state and the formation of a TPA-
terminal PET chain. This biocatalytic mechanism has been
investigated at the molecular level by using quantum
mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) simulations.
26−29
First, Boneta et al.,
26
by using semiempirical AM1/MM
umbrella-sampling calculations with further corrections from
density functional theory (DFT) with the M06-2X functional,
described the mechanism as a two-step process in both
acylation and deacylation via a tetrahedral enzyme-substrate
intermediate and two transition states for each stage. In
contrast, Jerves et al.,
27
using a larger QM region described at
the PBE level, predicted a single-step catalytic mechanism for
both stages (acylation and deacylation) through a tetrahedral
transition state. Although it is not relevant to this work,
scientific advances concerning the elucidation of the structure
and catalytic mechanism of MHETase have also been recently
achieved.
30−32
Apart from the mechanistic aspects of the PET biode-
gradation, the scientific spotlight has also been put on PETase
engineering to obtain novel variants capable of working more
efficiently and at a higher range of temperatures. Note that the
PET biodegradation rate drops with the rising degree of
crystallinity and, thus, the quest for thermostable PETase
scaffolds able to maintain their PET-degrading activity at
temperatures higher than 60 °C�temperature in which the
glass transition of PET from a (semi)crystalline to amorphous
phase occurs�is highly attractive for large-scale industrial
applications. Likewise, efficient PETase scaffolds functioning at
mild conditions, even with a pretreatment of PET, are also
highly interesting for industrial recycling processes. With this
in mind, several efficient PETase and cutinase-like variants
have already been proposed in the last few years.
16,17,33,34
Regarding the PETase mutants, Son et al. proposed, by using
the structural information of the wild-type PETase, a rational
protein engineering strategy to increase the thermostability and
the PET degradation activity of the enzyme.
33
In particular,
they obtained a PETase scaffold (known as ThermoPETase),
with only three mutations with respect to the wild-type
homolog (S121E/D186H/R280A), in which the thermal
stability was enhanced by ca. 9 °C and the PET degradation
activity improved by 14-fold at 40 °C. From a different
approach, Cui et al.
34
computationally redesigned PETase to
provide a new variant (DuraPETase) which, after its synthesis,
exhibited a high melting temperature (a T
m
value of 77 °C
compared to that reported for PETase, T
m
= 46 °C) and
strikingly enhanced degradation toward semicrystalline PET
films at mild temperatures (over 300-fold). Despite these
interesting PETase mutants, the recent discovery of the variant
proposed by Lu et al. (known as FAST-PETase) has meant an
important breakthrough.
16
The FAST-PETase enzyme, initially
designed by machine learning techniques, contains only five
mutations with respect to wild-type PETase and exhibits a
superior catalytic activity in the 30−50 °C range compared to
wild-type PETase and all other so far proposed mutants.
Interestingly, FAST-PETase is able to completely biodegrade
untreated and postconsumer PET waste from different
products in 1 week. More challenging, it depolymerizes PET
in the amorphous domains of untreated commercial water
bottles and, under thermal pretreatment, an entire water bottle
at 50 °C. This promising study opens the door for a closed-
loop PET recycling process at the industrial scale, where the
FAST-PETase enzyme is used to depolymerize PET and the
recovered monomers are employed to resynthesize PET again.
Despite FAST-PETase’s success, the origin of its enhanced
catalytic activity is not completely understood at the molecular
level. Note that the five mutations in FAST-PETase, all of
them out of the active site, seem to enhance the stability of the
enzyme by extending the H-bonding network and establishing
a favorable electrostatic salt bridge interaction. Therefore, it is
not clear how these mutations can stabilize the initial
enzyme:PET complex or the intermediate structures (tran-
sition states) that determine the catalytic mechanism and the
reaction rate for PET biodegradation. That mechanistic
information at the molecular level can be very helpful for the
design of novel and enhanced FAST-PETase mutants but also
for other PET-hydrolyzing enzymes. Herein, we seek to shed
light on this knowledge gap from a computational perspective.
Classical molecular dynamics (MD) simulations for the mutant
FAST-PETase and the wild-type PETase enzymes and their
respective enzyme:PET complexes were first performed to gain
insight into the structural changes induced by the mutations in
the FAST-PETase scaffold that might be important for the
PET depolymerization. In a second step, multiscale QM/MM
simulations were employed to characterize the catalytic
mechanism of FAST-PETase in comparison with wild-type
PETase to unveil the enhancement of the FAST-PETase
activity. The free energy profiles (FEPs) calculated for the PET
degradation (acylation and deacylation processes) allowed us
to connect all intermediates and transition states from
reactants to products.

COMPUTATIONAL METHODS
Building of (FAST-)PETase:PET Systems. The initial coordi-
nates of the PETase enzyme were taken from the highest-resolved X-
ray crystal structure (0.92 Å) of the apoenzyme available in the
Protein Data Bank, with code 6EQE.
25
For the FAST-PETase mutant,
the structure available with code 7SH6 was selected.
16
To calculate
the adequate protonation states of titratable residues at pH 7.0, the
PROPKA3.0 software tool was employed.
35,36
We introduced the
PET substrate model (a trimer) into the enzyme systems using the
alignment with a PETase-substrate crystal structure (5XH3),

which the substrate corresponds to the 1-(2-hydroxyethyl) 4-methyl
terephthalate. The PET trimer model used here is 2-hydroxyethyl-
(mono-hydroxyethyl terephthalate)
3
, abbreviated as 2-HE(MHET)
3
(Scheme 2). The PET model was described by the GAFF37
parameters using the Antechamber module of the AMBER20 software
package
37
and employing the RESP atomic point charges calculated at
the HF/6-31G(d) level with the Gaussian 09 program.
38
Once the
enzyme:PET systems were built, the PET substrate was minimized by
2000 steps of the steepest descent method followed by the conjugate
gradient method until the root mean square of the gradient was below
50 kcal mol
−1
Å
−1
in order to accommodate the substrate into the
active site of both enzymes (FAST-PETase and PETase). Afterward,
both systems were prepared using the tleap tool implemented in the
AMBER20 software.
37
The enzyme scaffolds (both the FAST-PETase
mutant and wild-type PETase), described with the ff14SB force field
implemented in AMBER20,
37
were solvated into a box of TIP3P
39
water molecules, with a buffer region of at least 12 Å from any protein
substrate atom to the limits of the simulation box. We added six Cl
−
anions to neutralize the total charge of the systems. Then, the
resulting FAST-PETase:PET (PETase:PET) system was composed of
37,243 (37,247) total atoms: 3795 (3799) protein atoms, 76 PET
atoms, 6 counterions, and 11,122 water molecules.
For both enzyme:PET systems, the protocol was the same. The
entire system was minimized using 5000 steps of the steepest descent
method followed by the conjugate gradient method. Initially, only the
water molecules and counterpoise ions were minimized, keeping the
rest of the system fixed. Then, the entire system, except for the
protein’s backbone, was minimized. Finally, the entire system without
restrictions was fully minimized until the root mean square of the
gradient was below 10 kcal mol
−1
Å
−1
. The system was later heated
from 0 to 300 K using a heating rate of 1.7 K·ps
−1
. In order to
equilibrate the system, 100 ns of classical MD simulations at 300 K
with periodic boundary conditions were performed. The time step of
the classical simulation was 1 fs using the SHAKE algorithm.
40
The
Particle Mesh Ewald method was employed to describe the long-range
electrostatic interactions
41,42
with a cutoff of 15 Å. We used the
Berendsen barostat
43
and the Langevin thermostat
44
to control the
simulation’s pressure and temperature, respectively. Free protein
versions of FAST-PETase and PETase (i.e., without the PET
substrate) were generated from the respective X-ray structures
following the same computational procedure.
Classical MD Simulations. To analyze the structural properties
of the enzymes (FAST-PETase and PETase with and without the
PET model), we run 1 μs of classical MD simulations with the same
characteristics as the relaxation described in the previous section but
with a time step of 2 fs (also using SHAKE) and saving points every
100 ps. By using the CPPTRAJ program,
45
included in AMBER20,
the root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) and the root-mean-square
fluctuation (RMSF) for each protein were calculated.
From the simulations over the (FAST)-PETase:PET complexes,
the binding energies of the PET model with the FAST-PETase and
PETase enzymes were estimated by using the GBSA implicit solvent
model
46
using 1000 frames spaced by 1 ns from the trajectory with
the MM-PBSA.py tool
47
included in the AMBER20 program. The
same program used to estimate the enzyme-substrate binding energy
(MM-PBSA.py) also allowed us to split the binding energy into its
fundamental contributions (internal and solvation).
The electrostatic potential felt by a selected atom was obtained by
calculating the total energy of the whole system and subtracting the
total energy of the system but with the charge of the selected atom set
to zero, and the difference divided by its original charge.
QM/MM MD Simulations. Finally, a QM/MM molecular
dynamic simulation of 100 ps for the stable structures of the reaction
mechanism (i.e., RS, I1, I2, and PS, Scheme 1) was performed. For
acylation, the QM region was composed of a total of 129 atoms: (i)
the full PET trimer, (ii) the catalytic triad (His237, Ser160, and
Asp206), and (iii) the Tyr87 and Met161 residues (oxyanion hole)
(Scheme 2, top). The semiempirical DFTB3 Hamiltonian
48
implemented in AMBER20 was used for the QM part. For
deacylation, the PET trimer was substituted by the dimer bonded
to Ser160’s oxygen, and a water molecule (WAT) was introduced in
the QM region to react with the acyl-enzyme complex in the active
site (Scheme 2, bottom).
In order to explore the free energy landscapes associated with the
chemical reaction, our implementation of the adaptive string method
(ASM) was employed.
49
In this method, N replicas of the system (the
nodes of the string) evolve according to the averaged forces and stay
equidistant, converging in such a way to the minimum free energy
path (MFEP) in the space of arbitrary dimensionality. Once the string
has converged, we define a single path using a path Collective Variable
(path-CV) that measures the advance of the system along the MFEP.
This path-CV represents the reaction coordinate used to trace the
FEPs along the chemical reaction. We explored the MFEPs on a free
energy hypersurface defined by a set of CVs formed by those variables
(distances, angles, or torsions), showing relevant changes during the
process under study. QM/MM MD simulations to define the
beginning/end of our initial/final string guesses were performed. In
line with the reaction mechanism, we divided the process into two
strings: acylation and deacylation. Scheme 2 shows the relevant
distances used to define the CV for each reaction stage. Note that we
also included point-plane distances (to the plane formed by C
2
, O
1
,
O
2
, and C
3
atoms for acylation and C
2
, O
2
, C
3
, and O
γ
for
deacylation) in the CV to facilitate the string convergence. These
distances were removed from the analysis, for clarity purposes, as they
do not provide relevant mechanistic information.
Once the MFEP was converged, the CV reaction coordinate was
defined and MD simulations (at least for 100 ps) were run at each
node on the string using an umbrella potential automatically defined.
Then, with the aid of the weighted histogram analysis method
(WHAM),
50
the potential of mean force (PMF) profiles were
calculated.
We anticipate that the free energy barriers calculated with the
current approximation for both acylation and deacylation in wild
PETase are in good accord with other theoretical studies (Boneta et
al.
26
and Jerves et al.,
27
see below). This indicates that the selected
computational approximation is trustworthy for further studies of
other PETase-like mutants. Nevertheless, the comparison between the
different QM/MM MD schemes can highlight some differences

interesting for future theoretical treatments of novel PETase-like
variants. Jerves et al.
27
accurately studied the PET degradation by the
wild-type PETase by means of a robust QM/MM umbrella-sampling
method with a large QM region at the PBE level including 146 atoms
(a PET dimer; the catalytic tSer131-Hist208-Asp177 triad; the Tyr58
and Met132 residues responsible for the oxyanion hole; Trp156 to set
π−π interactions with the PET fragment; and the extra residues
Ser178, Ile179 and Ala180). This study predicted a single-step
catalytic mechanism for both stages (acylation and deacylation)
through a tetrahedral transition state consistent with the experimental
mechanism initially proposed by Han et al.
22
and Joo et al.
23
Our
approximation, with a reduced QM region (a PET trimer, the catalytic
triad Ser160-His237-Asp206 and the Tyr87 and Met161 residues)
and the ASM, also predicts a single-step catalytic mechanism in line
with the most accurate theoretical and experimental studies. In
contrast, Boneta et al.
26
obtained a two-step mechanism for both
acylation and deacylation, which seems not to be totally in accord
with the previous studies. They employed semiempirical AM1/MM
umbrella-sampling calculations with further corrections from DFT
(M06-2X functional) for a small QM region (a PET dimer and the
catalytic triad). This comparison reveals that the medium-size QM
region selected here (treated at the DFTB3 level) in combination
with the ASM for the free energy landscapes is a good approach with a
reasonable balance between precision and computational cost.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Structural Analysis and Binding Energies from
Classical Simulations. The crystal structure of the FAST-
PETase enzyme reveals that the structure of FAST-PETase is
quite similar to that found for the wild-type PETase variant,
being organized in a set of nine β-strands and seven α-helices
(Figure 2). Similar to PETase, the active site of FAST-PETase
is located on the enzyme surface (in a surface cleft) and holds
the canonical catalytic Ser-His-Asp triad (hereafter, Ser160-
His237-Asp206), which is essential for the catalytic activity.
24
FAST-PETase also maintains the two characteristic disulfide
bonds (Cys203-Cys239 and Cys289-Cys273) of PETase,
which endows the enzyme with additional stability. Although
the disulfide bond Cys203-Cys239 is located near the active
site, it is still flexible enough to effectively accommodate the
rigid PET substrate.
As mentioned above, the FAST-PETase variant only
contains five mutations with respect to the wild-type PETase
(S121E/D186H/R224Q/N233K/R280A). In the crystal
structure, the first two mutations (the replacement of Ser121
and Asp186 by Glu and His, respectively) are located relatively
close to the active site (ca. 7 Å), enabling to establish a more
extended H-bond network between Glu121, H186, and
Figure 2. (a) Structure of FAST-PETase where the secondary structure’s features are colored for β-strands (yellow) and α-helices (purple). The
active site is depicted with the most relevant residues (labeled as sticks colored by element). Mutations and disulfide bonds are colored in green and

Asn172 through two water molecules.
16
The substitution of
Arg224 by Gln did not cause any impact in terms of H-bonds;
i.e., the H-bond between Arg224 and Ser193 for PETase is
lost, and a new bond is formed between the shorter Gln224
peptide and Ser192 in FAST-PETase. The N233K mutation,
which substitutes the neutral Asn233 by a positively charged
Lys, gives rise to an intramolecular salt bridge with the close
Glu204 by an optimal electrostatic interaction. Note that
N233K is sited relatively near the His237 and Asp206 of the
catalytic triad (ca. 11 Å) although it is still far from the active
site. Interestingly, N233K is likely to be the most important
mutation for the PET-degrading reaction since that mutation
has been incorporated in several PET-degrading enzymes (e.g.,
LCC, ICCM, and Cut190) and, in all of these mutants, the
hydrolytic activity has improved compared to their respective
previous scaffolds.
16
Finally, the R280A mutation, where
Arg280 is replaced by Ala, is found to be close to the
N233K mutation (ca. 5 Å) and at ca. 15 Å of the active site.
That mutation is present not only in FAST-PETase but also in
the ThermoPETase variant,
33
and its role was ascribed to a
better binding with the PET substrate.
All the mutations described above are found to be relatively
distant from the active site (>7 Å) and, in principle, their direct
impact on the biocatalytic mechanism is not evident. To gain
insight into the structural changes induced by the mutations
that can be relevant to the reaction, classical MD simulations of
1 μs were performed for the free enzymes and their respective
enzyme:PET complexes. In particular, the changes caused by
the mutations in their local environments (intermolecular
contacts) were analyzed along the dynamics and, to get a
broader perspective, the mobility of each protein residue
(RMSF analysis) was also examined (see below).
As mentioned above, mutations D186H and S121E seem to
promote an extended H-bonding network between Glu121,
H186, and Asn172 through two bridging water molecules.
Note that the Glu121, H186, and Asn172 residues are sited on
the enzyme surface and, thereby, are easily accessible to the
water solvent. Our classical MD simulations reveal that this H-
bonding network is highly dynamic, with a steady formation/
breaking of the intermolecular H-bonds between the respective
peptides and close water molecules. From our analysis of the
H-bonds over the classical trajectories, we can observe that the
solvent-mediated-bridge between Glu121 and His186 is
maintained and slightly increased (the fraction of frames
forming the bridge is 0.12 compared to the bridge formed by
Ser121 and Asp186 in the wild-type variant which is 0.10).
Likewise, the solvent-mediated-bridge between Glu121 and
Asn172 is strengthened in FAST-PETase (fraction of 0.10)
compared to PETase, where there is hardly any solvent-
mediated-bridge between Ser121 and Asn172 (fraction of

0.002). Interestingly, the effective interaction between Glu121,
H186, and Asn172 via water-mediated H-bonds strengthens
the interaction between two β-strands and an α-helix. Our
simulations, in line with the X-ray structure, therefore support
that the D186H and S121E mutations may be responsible for
the enhanced thermal stability due to the more extended H-
bonding network.
The previously discussed mutations (D186H and S121E)
together with R280A are indeed the mutations incorporated in
the wild-type enzyme to give rise to the ThermoPETase
variant.

The new and small-sized Ala280 forms an effective
H-bond within the β-strand with Asn277 with an averaged
distance of 2.3 ± 0.4 Å. This H-bond is not observed between
Arg280 and Asn277 for the wild-type PETase (6.1 ± 0.2 Å)
because Arg280 is interacting with the vicinal residues of the
contiguous α-helix. As briefly mentioned above, the enhanced
PET-degrading activity caused by the R280A mutation was
associated with an extension of a subsite (subsite IIc) to
accommodate the PET polymer more easily.
33
That was
explained because the incorporation of the short Ala280
residue generates a hydrophobic and nonprotruding cleft.
Unfortunately, we cannot evaluate the enhancement of the
enzyme-PET interaction due to this mutation because our PET
model (a trimer) is not large enough to reach the subsite
where the Ala280 residue is placed.
For the R224Q mutation, our simulations, in good accord
with the crystal structure analysis, display that Gln224 is able
to establish a weak H-bond (2.9 ± 0.2 Å) with Ser192 along
the trajectory. Gln224 seems not to promote the formation of
extra H-bonds with other neighboring residues. It is therefore
difficult to unveil the role of this mutation from the
computational results since, on the one hand, the mutation
is far from the active site (ca. 22 Å) to have a direct influence
on the PET-degrading reaction and, on the other hand, the
lack of extra H-bonds with vicinal residues would not improve
the thermostability of the enzyme. This conclusion is however
in line with the experimental outcomes since all the PETase-
like variants (wild-type, ThermoPETase, and DuraPETase)
with only this mutation hardly improve the PET degradation,
and thus, this mutation seems to be less relevant.
We now turn our attention to the N233K mutation, which is
by far the key mutation for the enhanced PET degradation
ability not only in FAST-PETase but also in other related
variants.
16
Previously, Lu et al. claimed that the incorporation
of Lys233 (positively charged) upon the N233K mutation
favored an attractive electrostatic interaction (salt bridge) with
the Glu204 residue (negatively charged). Our simulations
clearly indicate an opposite behavior; i.e., the salt bridge
between Lys233 and Glu204 is not preserved along the
dynamics. Lys233 and Glu204 are significantly separated with
an average distance between the two oxygen atoms of Glu204
and the positively charged nitrogen of Lys233 of 11.0 ± 3.0 Å
(Figure S1). We have also analyzed the potential H-bonds
between the hydrogens attached to the positively charged
nitrogen of Lys233 with any of the two oxygen atoms of
Glu204 for FAST-PETase, and only a small fraction of frames
with H-bonds (6%) is predicted, which contrasts to the
fraction (34%) calculated for the wild-type enzyme between
Asn233 and Glu204. What actually occurs along the dynamics
is that Lys233, which is placed on the enzyme surface, is highly
stabilized by effectively interacting with the accessible water
molecules of the solvent.
Since the previous structural analysis throughout the
dynamics for the free enzymes did not provide conclusive
insights concerning the enhanced catalytic activity of FAST-
PETase, the dynamics of the enzyme:PET complexes were also
analyzed. Interestingly, the N233K mutation causes two
important effects that can be visualized by representing the
RMSF of each residue for the FAST-PETase:PET and
PETase:PET complexes and the difference (ΔRMSF) between
both enzyme:PET complexes (Figure 3). The main effect is the
decreased mobility of the residues that are directly linked to
Lys233 (residues 232−246) except for His237, which is
accompanied by the increased mobility of the residues bonded
to Glu204, among which is Asp206. The increased mobility of
Asp206 in the FAST-PETase:PET complex is associated with a
change in the chain folding (residues 206−210, Figure S2),
causing less effective H-bonds interactions of the Asp206 with
its neighboring residues (Ile208 and Ala209) compared to the
PETase:PET complex (Figure S3). We anticipate that the
difficulty of Asp206 to set H-bonds with its vicinal residues in
the FAST-PETase:PET complex makes Asp206 hold a more
basic character supported by the higher electrostatic potential
felt by the O
δ1
and O
δ2
atoms (141.0 ± 8.0 and 140.0 ± 8.0
kcal mol
−1
|e|
−1
, respectively) compared to the PETase:PET
complex (135.0 ± 7.0 and 129.0 ± 7.0 kcal mol
−1
|e|
−1
,
respectively, Figure S4). As explained below, the increased
basicity of Asp206 in FAST-PETase:PET is crucial to
strengthen the interaction with His237 and stabilize the
transition state during the acylation stage (next section).
Therefore, the mutation N233K, which is relatively far from
the active site, has an effect on the residues of the catalytic
triad, in particular over His237 and Asp206, after removing the
interaction with Glu204.
For the enzyme:PET complexes, the binding energies
between the PET model and the enzyme scaffolds were also
computed from the classical simulations (see the Computa-
tional Details). The five mutations inserted in FAST-PETase
seem to have a small impact on the enzyme-PET interaction.
The predicted binding energies are similar for the mutant and
the wild-type, the binding energy being slightly smaller for the
FAST-PETase:PET complex (−28.0 ± 5.0 kcal mol
−1
) than
that for PETase:PET (−32.0 ± 4.0 kcal mol
−1
). Nevertheless, a
further analysis by decomposing the binding energy into two
contributions (enzyme:substrate and solvation) reveals that the
interaction between the PET fragment and the enzyme is
stronger for FAST-PETase (−49.4 ± 10.1 kcal mol
−1
) than for
PETase (−37.5 ± 4.4 kcal mol
−1
). The contribution from
solvation indeed equilibrates the binding energies for both
enzyme:PET systems with a more unfavorable solvation energy
for the FAST-PETase:PET complex compared to PETase:PET
(21.0 ± 5.0 and 5.0 ± 0.9 kcal mol
−1
, respectively). These
findings suggest that the PET substrate is better accommo-
dated inside the active site for FAST-PETase but less exposed
to the solvent. These energetic results can be explained by the
structural analysis. The insertion of PET in FAST-PETase is
accompanied by a cleft narrowing of the active site (13.0 ± 0.4
Å) compared to the wild-type enzyme (14.5 ± 0.5 Å, Figure
S5). Additionally, this shrinkage of the active cleft in FAST-
PETase also reduces the number of water molecules accessible
in the active site. This is supported by the radial distribution
function of water molecules around Ser160 (Figure S6) and
the number of water molecules within the cavity formed by the
catalytic triad (Figure S7) for both FAST-PETase:PET and
PETase:PET complexes. The smaller number of water

19249
molecules surrounding Ser160 and also within the cavity of the
catalytic triad for FAST-PETase indicates a more favorable
preorganized state compared to PETase, which would be
favorable for the rate of the PET-degrading reaction as occurs
in other biocatalysts. Desolvation of the Michaelis complex
may contribute to a decrease in the activation free energy of
the catalytic process.
51
Finally, it should be noted that the
reduction of accessible water molecules for FAST-PETase is
not due to a significant change in the hydrophobicity of the
active site as no mutation is present in the site (Figure S8).
Biocatalytic Mechanism of the PET Degradation.
Umbrella-sampling simulations along the path-CV defined by
the ASM were performed to estimate the FEPs for the mutant
FAST-PETase and the wild-type PETase enzymes for the
acylation and deacylation stages (Figures 4 and 5, respec-
tively). Figures 4 and 5 also display the evolution of the most
important structural parameters (distances) involved in the
path-CV along MFEPs, whereas Table 1 gathers the average
values of those selected distances for the most relevant species
along the reaction paths.
Prior to the detailed analysis of the PET degradation by
FAST-PETase, it is convenient to briefly describe the reaction
mechanism obtained for the wild-type PETase and compare
our findings with those reported in the literature to validate our
computational approach. The FEP calculated for wild-type
PETase clearly indicates that acylation occurs through a single
and concerted step involving a single transition state (TS1)
(Figure 4). The free energy barrier was estimated to be 16.5 ±
0.2 kcal mol
−1
in good accord with that experimentally
determined for BHET (18.0−18.6 kcal·mol
−1
) and with those
theoretically predicted for PET-like dimer models at different
quantum-chemical levels (17.0 and 20 kcal·mol
−1
, respec-
tively).
26,27
For the deacylation step (Figure 5), a free energy
barrier of 10.0 ± 0.2 kcal·mol
−1
was predicted, which again is
in line with the values calculated by similar methods (14.0 and
15.1 kcal·mol
−1
).
26,27
These outcomes suggest that the selected
computational approach is reliable for further studies of
PETase-like variants.
Turning our attention to FAST-PETase, the predicted FEP
for the acylation stage is significantly different compared to
that obtained for PETase (Figure 4) with an important
reduction of the energy barrier (12.1 ± 0.1 kcal mol
−1
).
Starting from RS, the structure for the FAST-PETase:PET
complex shows optimal contacts for the initiation of the
chemical reaction; i.e., the distance between oxygen O
γ
(Ser160) and carbon C
2
(PET) is calculated to be relatively
close (2.62 ± 0.06 Å) for a further nucleophilic attack and the
Ser160 H
γ
and His237 N
ε
are also well oriented (distance of
1.87 ± 0.09 Å) for a proton transfer. H-bonds between oxygen
O
2
(PET) and hydrogen atoms of Tyr87 and Met161 are
already set (Table 1 and Figure 4b). These distances are
predicted to be similar for the wild-type PETase enzyme
(Table 1 and Figure S9). The main difference between the
enzyme:PET structures for the mutant and wild-type enzymes

distances (Asp206 and
His237), for which the fluctuation is higher in FAST-PETase
compared to PETase in line with the previous analysis of the
mobility of Asp206 (Figure 3).
From RS to the acyl-enzyme intermediate (I1), the reaction
occurs through a broad transition state (TS1), which is
significantly stabilized compared to the wild-type PETase
(Figure 4). The TS1 region comprises a wide variety of
energetically-similar structures and begins when the H
γ
is
equally shared by Ser160 and His237 (ca. 1.2 Å) and the
nucleophilic attack of oxygen O

(Ser160) to C

(PET) is
initiated (average C

distance of 2.01 Å). From this point,
the Ser160 gradually transfers its proton to the His237 with a

) distance increase (decrease), whereas
the C
2
−O
γ
distance undergoes a steady shortening until it
reaches a covalent bond of 1.35 ± 0.03 Å. On the other hand,
the ester C
2
−O
1
bond of the PET model exhibits a continuous
lengthening from 1.35 ± 0.03 to 4.21 ± 0.08 Å. This C
2
−O
1
lengthening is accompanied by a progressive shortening of the
distance of the H
γ
proton (now bound to His237) to the PET
oxygen O
1
due to a favorable electrostatic interaction between
both atoms as a consequence of the C
2
−O
1
bond cleavage. In
all this TS1 region, a tetrahedral structure for the PET C
2
is
predicted. Unlike the extended TS1 region found for FAST-
PETase, the wild-type PETase exhibits a well-defined
tetrahedral TS1 with C
2

γ
and C

distances of 1.40 ±
0.03 and 1.96 ± 0.06 Å, respectively. In addition, H

is bound
to His237 and oxygen O

of the PET model with similar
distances (1.21 ± 0.11 and 1.34 ± 0.14 Å for H

and H

distances, respectively).
For both FAST-PETase and PETase enzymes, the TS1 state
seems to be stabilized, in line with other experimental and
computational studies,
24,27
by the formation of an oxyanion
hole between the amine groups of Met161 and Tyr87 and the
oxygen O
2
of the PET with short H−O
2
contacts in the 1.8−
1.9 Å range (Table 1, Figures 4b, and S9). The additional
stabilization of TS1 for the FAST-PETase mutant compared to
the wild-type enzyme comes from the higher basicity of
Asp206 within the FAST-PETase:PET complex as a
consequence of the N233K mutation as previously discussed
(Figure 3). This higher basicity (lower stabilization of the
negative charge due to the lack of vicinal H-bonds) promotes a
stronger electrostatic interaction with the protonated His237
in FAST-PETase (−47.0 ± 4.0 kcal mol
−1
) compared to
PETase (−44.0 ± 3.0 kcal mol
−1
). A structural signature of this
optimal electrostatic interaction for FAST-PETase is the
bifurcated H-bond interaction established between the two
Asp206 oxygen atoms (Ο
δ1
and O
δ2
) and the His237 H
δ
along
the TS1 region with average distances in the 2.0−2.5 Å range
in both cases (Table 1 and Figure S10). In contrast, only one
H-bond (O
δ1
−H
δ
) can be set for PETase during the acylation
(Table 1 and Figure S10). Therefore, the higher basicity of
Asp206 and, consequently, the more favorable His237-Asp206

electrostatic interaction predicted for FAST-PETase is the
origin of the free energy barrier decrease.
Finally, TS1 evolves to the I1 intermediate through the
breaking of the ester C
2
−O
1
bond (4.21 ± 0.08 Å for I1) and
the H
γ
−O
1
bond formation (0.97 ± 0.02 Å) for FAST-PETase.
In I1, the acyl-enzyme complex is also stabilized due to the H-
bonds between oxygen O
2
of PET and the amine groups of
Tyr87 and Met161 (contacts in the 2.0−2.1 Å range, Table 1).
A similar I1 structure is found for PETase (Table 1 and Figure
S9). The difference arises from the fact that the I1
intermediate is predicted to be slightly exergonic for FAST-
PETase and endergonic for PETase.
For the deacylation stage (Scheme 1), a water molecule,
introduced in the active site and well oriented with respect to
the catalytic triad and the acyl-enzyme complex, can initiate
the reaction (starting from I2) by a simultaneous proton
transfer to His237 and a nucleophilic attack to the PET
carbonyl (C
2
) of the enzyme:substrate adduct. This would
generate a new tetrahedral transition state (TS2), which would
evolve toward the product (PS) by means of a proton transfer
from His237 to Ser160 (regenerating the enzyme scaffold) and
the release of the TPA-terminal PET fragment (Scheme 1).
Note that, as the active site of the PETase-like variants is
located on the enzyme surface, water molecules are easily
accessible for the deacylation step, in particular when one of
the substrate fragments has left the active site.
For FAST-PETase, the active water in the I2 intermediate is
found to be relatively far from the acyl-enzyme adduct (Table
1 and Figure 5) with distances between the water oxygen (O
w
)
and carbon C
2
(PET) of 3.68 ± 0.05 Å. The water H
w
and the
His237 N
ε
are computed to be at 4.65 ± 0.15 Å, which is also
rather remote for a direct proton transfer. On the other hand,
the I2 intermediate does not preserve short contacts between
Asp206 and His237 (O
δ1
−H
δ
and Ο
δ2
−H
δ
distances of 3.6 ±
1.1 and 3.5 ± 1.1 Å, respectively). I2 also exhibits a favorable
H-bonding interaction between oxygen O
2
(PET) and the
Tyr87 and Met161 hydrogen atoms with similar distances (2.2
± 0.3 Å for both). For the wild-type PETase, the structure of
I2 is similar to that obtained for FAST-PETase (Table 1 and
Figure S9).
As the reaction advances from I2, we can differentiate three
relevant regions (Figure 5a): an initial stable intermediate, the
transition state (TS2), and the products (PS) together with
the enzyme recovering. The deacylation reaction presents a
free energy barrier for FAST-PETase (PETase) of 11.2 ± 0.1
kcal mol
−1
(10.0 ± 0.2 kcal mol
−1
) and an exergonic free
energy of −6.7 ± 0.1 kcal mol
−1
(−4.4 ± 0.2 kcal mol
−1
).
Unlike the acylation stage, the deacylation shows clear minima
for both enzymes, which can be ascribed to the favorable
interaction between the TPA-terminal PET fragment and the
enzyme in the active sites. As can be inferred from Figure 5a,
the initial intermediate for FAST-PETase is steadily destabi-
lized (∼2.5 kcal mol
−1
), whereas there is almost no energy
penalty to reach this intermediate (a tiny energy barrier of
∼0.9 kcal mol
−1
) for PETase. For both enzymes, this initial
and stable intermediate results from an optimal orientation of
the active water molecule for the nucleophilic attack and
proton transfer; in particular, a disposition with a significant
shorter distance compared to I2 between the active water and
His237 (N
ε
−H
w
of ca. 2.0 Å). The energetic destabilization of
this intermediate for FAST-PETase is in line with the higher
electrostatic interaction felt by the reactive water molecule as it
approaches the PET fragment compared to PETase (Figure
S11). These findings reveal that the free energy barrier for the
deacylation step in FAST-PETase can be decomposed in two
processes with different energy costs: i) the insertion and
orientation of the reactive water molecule (∼2.5 kcal mol
−1
)
and ii) the formation of the tetrahedral transition state (∼8.7

kcal mol
−1
). For PETase, the free energy barrier comes mainly
from the tetrahedral transition state formation (∼10.0 kcal
mol
−1
). Therefore, there is even a slight energy stabilization of
the transition state for FAST-PETase during the deacylation
stage, which, in line with acylation, also comes from the
favorable electrostatic interaction between the protonated
His237 and Asp206.
From the I2 intermediate, the reaction progresses until TS2.
Note that, for convenience and comparison purposes, we have
kept the label TS2 in Table 1 and Figure 5 for a structure that,
in the case of FAST-PETase, is not a proper transition state but
a stable high-energy intermediate. For FAST-PETase, TS2
exhibits a clear tetrahedral structure similar to TS1. The C

O
γ
distance (C

of PET and O
γ
of Ser160) has undergone a
slight lengthening (1.49 ± 0.05 Å), whereas a short contact
between the PET fragment and water hydroxyl has appeared
(C

−O
W
of 1.49 ± 0.05 Å). At TS2, the proton transfer from
the active water to His237 has totally occurred with a N
ε
−H
w
distance of 1.03 ± 0.03 Å and a significant lengthening of O
w
−
H

(2.11 ± 0.13 Å). Likewise, a reorientation of Ser160 and
His237 for a subsequent proton transfer (now from His237 to
Ser160) has taken place in TS2 with an O
γ
−H
w
contact of ca.
2.3 Å (Figure 5b). For the wild-type PETase, TS2 shows a
slightly weaker tetrahedral character with longer C
2
−O
W
distances (1.80 ± 0.05 Å) compared to FAST-PETase (1.49
± 0.05 Å). The proton transfer from the active water to His237
has also happened (1.04 ± 0.03 Å), although the lengthening
of O

is smaller (1.93 ± 0.13 Å). Regarding the oxyanion

and Met161 H atoms are predicted and slightly strengthened
for both FAST-PETase and PETase (in the 1.8−1.9 Å range).
Our findings, in contrast to those reported by Jerves et al.,
therefore indicate that the nucleophilic water attack and
deprotonation processes are asynchronous, being the His237
protonation the first important event for the deacylation stage
for both enzymes.
In the products (PS), the bond between the PET fragment
and Ser160 (C
2
−O

) has significantly lengthened (2.78 ± 0.05
Å) for FAST-PETase, and the Ser160 has been regenerated
due to the proton transfer from His237 to Ser160 (O

distances of 0.99 ± 0.03 and 1.96 ± 0.10 Å,
respectively). Additionally, the relevant C
2
−O
w
covalent
bond has been formed (1.33 ± 0.03 Å), generating the TPA-
terminal PET fragment. Compared to FAST-PETase, a
comparable PS structure for PETase is calculated with similar
distances (Table 1 and Figure S9).

CONCLUSIONS
In this article, we perform a detailed computational study to
gain insights into the enhancement of the PET degradation
biocatalyzed by the promising FAST-PETase enzyme. In
particular, we seek to disentangle the role that the five
mutations incorporated in the FAST-PETase scaffold (S121E/
D186H/R224Q/N233K/R280A), all of them far from the
active site, play on the stabilization of the initial PET-enzyme
complex or other important intermediates (transition states)
determining the catalytic reaction rate for the PET
biodegradation. With this aim, we have applied classical and
hybrid (QM/MM) MD simulations for the wild-type PETase
and mutant FAST-PETase as the enzyme scaffolds and a PET
model (trimer) as the substrate to understand the catalytic
mechanism. The free energy landscapes for the reaction
mechanism have been predicted by using the ASM together
with umbrella-sampling simulations.
Our outcomes support that the FAST-PETase variant
follows the canonical reaction mechanism of the wild-type
PETase and other hydrolases with two stages (acylation and
deacylation), in which a Ser-His-Asp triad is actively involved
in the biocatalytic process. FAST-PETase displays a catalytic
mechanism in which both acylation and deacylation exhibit
broad transition state-like regions, the acylation stage being the
rate-limiting reaction step with a free energy barrier of 12.1
kcal mol
−1
. That free energy barrier is significantly smaller than
that predicted for PETase (16.5 kcal mol
−1
), confirming that
FAST-PETase is a better biocatalyst for PET degradation. Our
study reveals that the origin of the enhanced activity of FAST-
PETase mainly comes from the N233K mutation, and is not
due to the formation of a salt bridge interaction, as previously
suggested,
16
but rather to an opposite effect. In particular, the
lack of a salt bridge interaction between Lys233 and Glu204
gives rise to a change of the chain folding of the residues
around Glu204, among which is Asp206 of the catalytic triad.
This folding hinders that Asp206 establishes effective H-bonds
with its vicinal residues (Ile208 and Ala209) compared to
PETase and, as a consequence, Asp206 acquires a more basic
character favoring the interaction with the protonated His237
in the transition state of the acylation stage. This improved
His237-Asp206 interaction lowers the free energy barrier of
acylation and, consequently, accelerates the PET depolymeri-
zation.
The results here presented therefore rationalize the
molecular origin of the improvement of the catalytic activity
of FAST-PETase in PET degradation. Additionally, we believe
that the enhanced basicity of Asp206, indirectly caused by the
N233K mutation, might also be the reason why other PET-
degrading enzymes incorporating the N233K mutation show
an increased catalytic activity. Overall, our study contributes to
an in-depth comprehension of the PET biodegradation process
and can help for the rational design of novel PET-hydrolyzing
enzymes for feasible industrial applications.
