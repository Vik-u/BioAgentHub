Abstract 
Background: Proteins with novel functions or advanced activities developed by various protein engineering tech‑
niques must have sufficient solubility to retain their bioactivity. However, inactive protein aggregates are frequently 
produced during heterologous protein expression in Escherichia coli. To prevent the formation of inclusion bodies, 
fusion tag technology has been commonly employed, owing to its good performance in soluble expression of target 
proteins, ease of application, and purification feasibility. Thus, researchers have continuously developed novel fusion 
tags to expand the expression capacity of high‑value proteins in E. coli.
Results: A novel fusion tag comprising carbohydrate‑binding module 66 (CBM66) was developed for the soluble 
expression of heterologous proteins in E. coli. The target protein solubilization capacity of the CBM66 tag was veri‑
fied using seven proteins that are poorly expressed or form inclusion bodies in E. coli: four human‑derived signaling 
polypeptides and three microbial enzymes. Compared to native proteins, CBM66‑fused proteins exhibited improved 
solubility and high production titer. The protein‑solubilizing effect of the CBM66 tag was compared with that of two 
commercial tags, maltose‑binding protein and glutathione‑S‑transferase, using poly(ethylene terephthalate) hydro‑
lase (PETase) as a model protein; CBM66 fusion resulted in a 3.7‑fold higher expression amount of soluble PETase 
(approximately 370 mg/L) compared to fusion with the other commercial tags. The intact PETase was purified from 
the fusion protein upon serial treatment with enterokinase and affinity chromatography using levan‑agarose resin. 
The bioactivity of the three proteins assessed was maintained even when the CBM66 tag was fused.
Conclusions: The use of the CBM66 tag to improve soluble protein expression facilitates the easy and economic 
production of high‑value proteins in E. coli.

aggregates called “inclusion bodies” during expression in 
E. coli. There are two approaches for dealing with inclu -
sion bodies: counterpointing and avoiding. The former 
is the utilization of protein aggregates, with the advan -
tage of yielding large amounts of protein. However, the 
inclusion body should be solubilized and refolded by the 
strong and large amount of detergents to recover the 
bioactivity of the target protein, which is a hurdle for 
scale-up production [1–3]. The latter comprises several 
strategies, including the optimization of culture condi -
tions, host genome engineering, and the application of 
fusion tags to increase the solubility of target proteins [4].
Fusion tag technology is an attractive solution for 
inclusion body formation owing to its good performance 
in the soluble expression of target proteins, ease of appli -
cation, and purification feasibility. To date, various pep -
tides, proteins, and their derivatives have been developed 
and employed as fusion tags to enhance soluble protein 
expression and purification (Table  1). Maltose-binding 
protein (MBP) and glutathione-S-transferase (GST) 
tags are generally considered representative options for 
solubility enhancers, and hexa-histidine tag is the most 
widely used affinity tag [5]. Although various fusion tags 
have been developed and applied in recombinant protein 
production, it is impossible for a specific tag to carry an 
omnipotent solubilizing effect for various target proteins. 
Hence, researchers have developed novel fusion tags to 
expand the expression capacity of high-value proteins in 
E. coli.
Carbohydrate-binding modules (CBMs) are the com -
ponents of carbohydrate-active enzymes with carbohy -
drate affinity [6]. Since the discovery of CBMs by Reese 
in 1950 [7], numerous CBMs have been identified and 
characterized [8]. In recombinant protein production, 
CBMs have been used as fusion partners for soluble 
expression and affinity purification with a combination 
of their carbohydrate ligands. The most studied sys -
tem is the CBM3. Through the fusion of CBM3 from 
Clostridium sp., various proteins, including human heat-
shock protein, antimicrobial peptides, and protein A, 
have been expressed in E. coli and purified using a cellu -
lose matrix [9–12]. Another well-studied system, CBM2, 
has been shown to express proteins in various hosts such 
as E. coli, yeast, and mammalian cell lines [13, 14]. Fur-
thermore, different target enzymes have been fused with 
CBM1, 9, and 30 and purified using a cellulose matrix 
[15–17]. Cuskin et  al. recently reported a novel CBM 
family 66 (CBM66) from the exo-levanase of Bacillus 
subtilis (BsSacC). Using isothermal titration calorimetry 
and affinity gel electrophoresis, high binding affinity of 
CBM66 to fructans, particularly levan (β-2,6 fructan) was 
identified [18]. In addition, BsSacC was expressed well as 
a soluble enzyme in E. coli [19]; therefore, as with other 
CBMs, we considered the possibility of a soluble expres -
sion tag using CBM66.
Herein, we suggest the possibility of CBM66 as a novel 
fusion tag for the soluble expression of heterologous pro -
teins in E. coli. The soluble expression capability of the 
tag was confirmed using various passenger proteins that 
are difficult to express in E. coli. The soluble expression-
enhancing effect of the CBM66 tag was compared with 
that of commercial tags (MBP and GST) using a model 
protein. The novel protein fusion tag CBM66 can be used 
for the production of high-value proteins in the active 
form in E. coli.
Results and discussion
Construction of a plasmid for the expression 
of CBM66‑fused proteins
To express target proteins fused with the CBM66 tag, 
the plasmid pCBM66 was constructed using the pET21b 
vector backbone. The target protein was designed to be 
expressed with a CBM66 tag on the N-terminus under 
the T7 promoter. A hexa-histidine-tag (his-tag) was 
attached to the C-terminus to purify and identify the 
expressed target proteins. In addition, a flexible linker

domain, double repeats of four glycine and one ser -
ine [(G 4S)2], and an enterokinase recognition site  (D4K) 
were inserted between the tag and passenger protein for 
optional purification. To facilitate easy target gene clon -
ing, recognition sites for two restriction enzymes (BamHI 
and XhoI) were inserted (Fig.  1). Although CBM66 natu-
rally occurs in the C-terminus part of the levanase from 
Bacillus subtilis (BsSacC), we fused the CBM66 at the 
N-terminus of target proteins to obtain intact target pro -
teins after enterokinase treatment, which cleaves after 
recognition sequence  (D4K↓).
Solubility enhancement of proteins by CBM66
To verify the soluble expression-enhancing effect of the 
CBM66 tag, we tested seven target proteins: four human-
derived signaling polypeptides (epidermal growth factor 
[EGF], vascular endothelial growth factor isoform 165 
[VEGF], noggin [NOG], and bone morphogenetic protein 
7 [BMP7]) and three microbial enzymes (lipase B from 
Candida antarctica [CALB], alcohol dehydrogenase 1 
from Saccharomyces cerevisiae [ADH1], and polyethylene 
terephthalate (PET) hydrolase from Ideonella sakaien -
sis [PETase]), which are difficult to express in E. coli. E. 
coli containing expression vectors was grown at 18 °C for 
18 h after isopropyl β-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) 
induction, and when optical density at 600  nm  (OD600) 
reached approximately 4.0 (Additional file  1: Fig. S1), the 
cells were harvested and protein expression was analyzed. 
As shown in Fig.  2, the solubility and productivity of the 
most proteins increased by the fusion of the CBM66 tag.
After fusion with CBM66, three human-derived signal -
ing proteins, EGF, VEGF, and NOG, were detected in the 
soluble fraction, with titers of 233, 119, and 323  mg/L, 
respectively, whereas the recombinant  proteins  without 
the fusion tag were almost undetectable upon SDS-PAGE 
analysis after Coomassie blue staining. On SDS-PAGE, 
there were no proteins below 6 kDa. Therefore, we inves -
tigated whether EGF was not expressed or ran off the gel. 
When EGF purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, 
MO, USA) was loaded on the gel as a standard, it could be 
detected in SDS-PAGE (Additional file  1: Fig. S2). Based 
on this, it was confirmed that intact EGF was expressed 
to the extent that it could not be detected.
For the other human-derived protein, BMP7, protein 
solubility was inverted. A high amount of insoluble BMP7 
(190 mg/L) was expressed without the CBM66 tag; how -
ever, CBM66-BMP7 was produced as a soluble protein 
(279  mg/L). For efficient expression of human signaling 
proteins, various fusion tags have been tested. As for EGF, 
thioredoxin (Trx) and GST tags have been employed; 
however, the tags were not effective in solubilizing EGF 
[20]. Viable soluble tags for EGF were developed based

a CBM66 tag on the N‑terminus and a His‑tag on the C‑terminus under the T7 promoter. The flexible linker between CBM66 and the passenger 
protein comprised a double repeat of four glycine and one serine [(G4S)2]. EK site indicates enterokinase recognition sequence  (D4K)

on small ubiquitin-related modifier (SUMO) tags. Su 
et  al. first reported the feasible expression of SUMO-
fused EGF, with 54.3 mg/L titer and 38.9% soluble expres-
sion ratio per total protein [21]. Subsequently, Ma et al. 
demonstrated an improved EGF production titer and the 
soluble expression ratio of 281 mg/L and 59.5%, respec -
tively, by the fusion of Mxe GyrA intein with SUMO 
(Mxe-GyrA-SUMO) [22]. The production amount of 
CBM66-EGF (233  mg/L) was lower than that of the 
intein-SUMO-fused EGF. However, the soluble EGF 
expression ratio with CBM66 was 80.1%, and therefore, 
CBM66 is the most efficient fusion tag for soluble expres-
sion of EGF. For soluble expression of VEGF, various 
fusion tags, including MBP , GST, Trx, NusA, 6 × His, and 
two domains of human protein disulfide isomerase (PDI), 
were tested. From the tested tags, MBP , GST, NusA, and 
the two PDIs exhibited over 92% solubility of VEGF at 
18 °C. For ease of purification, they selected MBP as the 
best option for VEGF production, and the production 
titer of MBP-VEGF was 64.4 mg/L [23]. In this study, the 
solubilizing effect of CBM66 for VEGF was determined 
to be 85.1%; however, the CBM66-VEGF production titer

was 119  mg/L. NOG and BMP7 have been considered 
as proteins that are difficult to express in E. coli. There -
fore, these proteins are expressed in mammalian cell lines 
[24, 25]. However, as mammalian cell culture requires 
elaborate culture conditions using expensive media, eco -
nomic production techniques using microbial systems, 
must be established [26]. To the best of our knowledge, 
the CBM66 tag system was the first successful method 
for soluble expression of NOG and BMP7 in E. coli. In 
this study, although the CBM66 tag did not consistently 
exhibit the high titer or solubility of the tested human-
derived proteins, the four human-derived target proteins 
were expressed with an average soluble ratio of over 81%, 
and the titer reached several hundreds of milligrams per 
liter, which is viable for high-yield production.
We also tested three microbial industrial enzymes 
(CALB, ADH1, and PETase) as passenger proteins to 
demonstrate the soluble expression capability of the 
CBM66 tag. CALB is the most extensively applied 
biocatalyst for the production of various oleochemi -
cals [27]. However, E. coli has not been considered as 
an expression host for recombinant CALB because 
the protein is produced in negligible quantities or 
expressed as an inclusion body. To solubilize CALB, 
various biotechnological techniques such as codon 
optimization, mutagenesis, and co-expression with 
chaperones have been applied; however, the amount 
of soluble CALB produced was only several milligrams 
per liter [28– 31]. Polycationic amino acid tags have 
recently been suggested for the soluble expression of 
CALB. Jung et  al. constructed various polyamine tags 
comprising 10 consecutive homo basic amino acids 
(lysine, arginine, and histidine), and they selected the 
tag composed of 10 arginine residues as an optimal 
soluble tag for CALB by fusion at the carboxy termi -
nus of the enzyme (CALB-10Arg) [32]. Similarly, Zhou 
et  al. developed a more efficient soluble expression 
tag for CALB by the fusion of six histidine residues at 
the amino terminus and ten lysine residues at the car -
boxy terminus of CALB (6His-CALB-10Lys), and the 
production titer reached 100  mg/L [33]. In this study, 
by fusion with the CBM66 tag, the soluble CBM66-
CALB exhibited 327  mg/L (Additional file  1: Fig. S3). 
ADH1 is a key enzyme involved in the metabolism of 
primary alcohols. Owing to its high stereoselectiv -
ity, it has been traditionally used in the production of 
drugs and chemicals [34]. ADH1 is a protein that is 
considered difficult to express in E. coli, and this was 
confirmed by the expression of insoluble ADH1 (71%) 
using the pET21b vector system; however, when ADH1 
was fused to the CBM66 tag, the soluble ADH1 expres -
sion ratio increased to 53%, with 189 mg/L titer. PETase 
is a recently identified esterase from I. sakaiensis that 
hydrolyzes PET [35]. With increasing environmen -
tal issues due to the enormous usage and subsequent 
accumulation of petroleum-based plastics such as PET, 
biological degradation of the plastic by the enzyme has 
been suggested. Since its discovery, studies on enzymes 
have primarily focused on basic understanding, such 
as structural analysis of the mode of action, mutagen -
esis for the identification of crucial residues, and func -
tional characterizations [36– 40]. To utilize PETase in 
biological degradation of PET waste, a production sys -
tem yielding sufficient amount of the enzyme has to be 
established. In this study, the level of CBM66-PETase 
was 360  mg/L, of which 306  mg/L (85%) was pro -
duced in the soluble form. However, 383 mg/L of intact 
PETase was produced, of which 11% (43 mg/L) was pro -
duced in the soluble form. Even in Rosetta-gami (DE3) 
strain, only about 50 mg/L of protein was produced in 
the soluble form (Additional file 1 : Fig. S4).
Codon optimization is a predominant method for het -
erologous expression of recombinant proteins. How -
ever, in this study, we tested the soluble expression level 
of target proteins without codon optimization to avoid 
the misjudgment of solubilizing effect by CBM66 tag. 
For the seven proteins we tested, target proteins exhib -
ited good expression levels in soluble form when fused 
with CBM66. However, it is difficult to predict whether 
CBM66 will function well for all proteins. In this case, 
better protein expression results can be obtained through 
codon optimization and the selection of various E. coli 
strains.
In this study, CBM66 tag was comprised the CBM66 
domain following a repeat of four glycine and one serine 
 (G4S)2, and a specific protease recognition sequence (EK 
site, DDDDK). To verify whether the solubilizing effect 
of the CBM66 tag was derived from CBM66 not the 
linker and EK site, we constructed a pLE vector (Addi -
tional file  1: Fig. S5a), and tested expression titer using 
three target proteins (EGF, ADH, and PETase). ADH and 
PETase exhibited higher soluble expression with the LE 
tag than with canonical pET21b. However, the amount 
of obtained protein were < 50 mg/L (Additional file 1: Fig. 
S5b and c). Therefore, we concluded that the CMB66 tag 
was primarily responsible for the solubilizing effect.
The mechanism underlying solubility enhancement of 
fusion tags like CBMs has been investigated for decades; 
however, the correlation between tags and passenger 
proteins has not been elucidated. One dominant model 
for increased solubility of passenger proteins by CBMs is 
“chaperone-like quality. ” Similar to MBP , various CBMs 
act as molecular chaperones that assist proper folding of 
attached proteins [16, 41, 42]. Despite the lack of under -
standing of CBMs, various CBMs have been utilized, 
and their applicability as fusion tags for heterologous 
Page 6 of 12Ko et al. Microbial Cell Factories          (2021) 20:232 
expression and purification of various proteins has been 
proven [43, 44].
Comparison of CBM66 with commercial tags
The solubilizing efficacy of the CBM66 tag was com -
pared with that of two commercial tags, MBP and GST. 
We selected PETase as a model protein because it has 
emerged as a countermeasure for the environmental 
issues of petro-derived plastics. As shown in Fig.  3, 
under induction temperatures of 37, 30, 25, and 18 °C, 
a high proportion of insoluble PETase was expressed 
in the absence of fusion tags. However, when a fusion 
tag (MBP , GST, or CBM66) was attached to the N-ter -
minus of the passenger, the soluble expression level 
was increased at lower temperatures. Among them, 
the CBM66 tag exhibited the highest titer of soluble 
PETase (369  mg/L), and the soluble expression ratio 
was increased by over 82% at 18  °C. MBP and GST 
also exhibited increased soluble expression levels at 
18  °C; however, the maximal concentration obtained 
by fusion with GST was approximately 100  mg/L. In 
addition, the total expression level with MBP and GST 
was decreased at lower temperatures; however, CBM66 
maintained total protein production titer regardless of 
the induction temperature. Another advantage of the 
CBM66 tag is its smaller size (18 kDa) compared to the 
two commercial solubilizing tags (MBP , 43  kDa; GST, 
26 kDa). Even if the soluble mass of the CBM66-tagged 
and MBP-tagged proteins were equivalent, the smaller 
CBM66 tag guarantees higher recovery yield of target 
proteins after tag removal procedure.
Purification of intact protein from fusion protein using 
levan‑agarose resin (LAR)
To check whether CBM66-fused proteins could be puri -
fied using levan, a CBM66-binding carbohydrate, intact 
PETase cleaved from CBM66-PETase was purified using 
LAR. In detail, CBM66-PETase was purified by immobi -
lized metal ion affinity chromatography (IMAC) using a 
His-tag on the C-terminus of the protein. Thereafter, the 
PETase and fusion tag were separated by enterokinase 
treatment. After cleavage, the reactant with 90.1% cleav -
age efficiency was directly loaded onto the prepared LAR. 
As shown in Fig. 4a, SDS-PAGE analysis revealed that the 
intact PETase did not interact with LAR and ran out as 
flow through. In contrast, the CBM66 tag was bound to 
LAR and was fully eluted using 100 mM NaCl. From the 
quantitative analysis of each fraction, the recovery yield 
of cleaved intact PETase was 88.6%.
Most CBMs identified thus far are cellulose-binding 
modules. Cellulose is a good purification matrix owing 
to its stability, safety, and cost-effectiveness. However, the 
binding affinity between CBMs and cellulose is extremely 
high, and thus, strong protein denaturation reagents such 
as urea and guanidine hydrochloride are required for the 
detachment of CBMs from cellulose followed by dialysis 
[43]. Based on the binding nature of CBM66, we prepared 
LAR as the purification matrix, and the target protein

was easily eluted from the matrix using sodium chloride, 
which is a favorable reagent for protein studies. The puri-
fication system used in this study has not yet been fully 
established, which limits the precise specification of the 
levan matrix. Therefore, to improve CBM66-based solu -
ble expression and levan-based purification systems, it 
is necessary to determine the precise binding capability, 
physical and chemical stability, and other characteristics 
of the levan matrix.
Bioactivity of CBM66‑fused proteins
To analyze the effect of CBM66 tag on the bioactiv -
ity of the CBM66-fused protein, the relative activities 
of CBM66-PETase, -EGF, and -ADH1 were compared 
with those of the corresponding intact proteins. The 
intact PETase was obtained from a large volume culture 
of E. coli BL21 (DE3)/pET21b vector system, followed 
by IMAC purification. PETase activity was calculated as 
the hydrolysis activity of bis(2-hydroxyethyl) terephtha -
late (BHET). The biological activities of CBM66-PETase 
and detagged PETase were 97.9 ± 1.3% and 100.1 ± 1.4% 
of the biological activity of the commercial PETase, 
respectively (Fig.  4b). Specific activity of CBM66-
EGF was 1.8 ×  106 EU/mg, which corresponded to 
97.6 ± 2.5% of that of commercial EGF (Fig.  4c). For 
ADH, both commercial and CBM66-fused ADH exhib -
ited similar specific activity (300.1 ± 4.9 and 305.4 ± 8.2 
U/mg, respectively) within the margin of error (Fig.  4d). 
Overall, all tested fusion proteins were found to exhibit

Conclusions
In this study, we developed a novel protein fusion tag 
using CBM66. The capacity of CBM66 to solubilize tar -
get proteins was investigated using seven target proteins, 
and the CBM66 tag exhibited increased soluble protein 
expression and total expression levels. The solubilizing 
effect of CBM66 was compared with that of MBP and 
GST using PETase as a model protein. CBM66 exhibited 
the highest soluble protein expression compared to other 
commercial tags. Furthermore, the possibility of using 
CBM66 as a protein purification tag was applied to intact 
PETase purification through serial treatment with a spe -
cific protease (enterokinase) and affinity chromatography 
via LAR. To date, there have been numerous studies aim-
ing to overcome inclusion body formation during recom-
binant protein production in E. coli; however, there is no 
universal solution in biological systems. Thus, we expect 
that the CBM66 tag can be an alternative protein fusion 
tag for efficient production of high-value proteins in E. 
coli.

vector was constructed on the pET21b vector backbone. 
The CBM66 fragment (residues 514–677 of BsSacC) 
was prepared from the genomic DNA of B. subtilis [18]. 
The strain was obtained from the Korean Collection for 
Type Cultures (KCTC#2217, ATCC33234). To amplify 
the fragment, primers (F1 and R1) were designed based 
on the NCBI database (NP_390581.1), including NdeI 
and XhoI recognition sites, and synthesized by Genotech 
(Daejeon, Korea). The linker was added to the carboxyl 
terminus of CBM66 by PCR using primers F2 and R2, 
and the enterokinase recognition sequence was added 
to the amino terminus of the target protein using spe -
cific primers F3 and R3. The fragments were cloned into 
the NdeI/XhoI double-digested pET21b vector using the 
In-Fusion HD cloning kit, and the recombinant vector 
was introduced into BL21(DE3). To compare the soluble 
expression efficacy of CBM66 with commercial tags, the 
CBM66 region of the vector was replaced by MBP and 
GST. Each gene was prepared from pMAL-p5X (NEB) 
and pGEX-4T1 (GE Healthcare, Little Chalfont, UK) vec-
tors, respectively, using PCR with the F4/R4 and F5/R5 
primer sets, respectively. To construct a vector, pLE con -
taining only a linker [(G 4S)2] and an enterokinase recog -
nition site (DDDDK) was used. Each gene was amplified 
using F6 and R3 primers. The amplicon was ligated with 
the linearized pET21b vector by NdeI/XhoI (Additional 
file 1: Fig. S5). Cloning was performed as described pre -
viously. The genes of seven passenger proteins from the 
NCBI database [EGF (GenBank: AAS83395.1), VEGF 
(GenBank: AAL27630.1), NOG (PDB: 1M4U_A), BMP7 
(GenBank: AIL24690.1), CALB (PBD: 1LBT_B), ADH1 
(PDB: 4W6Z_A), and PETase (PDB: 6EQD_A)] were syn-
thesized by Bioneer Corp. (Daejeon, Korea). Nucleotide 
sequences of the primers are listed in Table 2.
Protein expression analysis
E. coli BL21(DE3) was transformed with the plasmids 
constructed for the expression of the passenger proteins, 
and each transformant was cultured in a 250 mL Erlen -
meyer flask containing 50 mL LB at 37 °C and 180 rpm 
until the  OD600 was 0.4–0.6. To induce protein expres -
sion, 0.1  mM IPTG was added to the culture medium 
and incubated at 18  °C for 18  h. After cultivation, the 
cells were harvested by centrifugation at 8000 × g for 
5  min and reconstituted in 10  mL of 25  mM Tris–HCl 
buffer (pH 7.5). The cells were disrupted by ultrasonica -
tion for 5  min with a 3  s pulse interval on ice. The cell 
lysate was centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 15  min, and the 
supernatant and pellet were collected. The supernatant 
was used as a soluble protein sample, and insoluble pro -
tein was obtained from the pellet using an equal volume 
of xTractor buffer following the manufacturer’s instruc -
tions (Takara Bio, Shiga, Japan). To compare the expres -
sion ratio of soluble and insoluble portions, 10 μL of 
prepared samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Proteins 
expressed with His-tag were purified and desalted using a 
Page 9 of 12
Ko et al. Microbial Cell Factories          (2021) 20:232 
 
Profinia protein purification system employing 5/50  mL 
Bio-scale mini Profinia affinity/desalting cartridges fol -
lowing the manufacturer’s instructions (Bio-Rad, Hercu -
les, CA, USA). Quantitative analysis was performed by a 
densitometry assay using Image Studio Lite (Licor Inc., 
Lincoln, NE, USA). Purified protein samples were quanti-
fied using the Pierce BCA protein assay kit following the 
manufacturer’s instructions (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 
Rockford, IL, USA), and the known concentrations of 
the proteins were loaded on SDS-PAGE to set the stand -
ard curves. A comparison analysis of the soluble expres -
sion efficacy of CBM66 with two commercial tags (MBP 
and GST) was performed as described above at various 
induction temperatures. The temperature was set from 
37 °C to 18 °C.
Preparation of LAR
LAR was prepared by following a homemade amylose–
agarose column preparation method [45]. Briefly, 25 mL 
Sepharose 6B (GE Healthcare) was sequentially washed 
with water and 1 M sodium carbonate solution, and the 
resin was reconstituted in 25 mL of 1 M sodium carbon -
ate and 5 mL of vinyl sulfonate for 70 min. The resin was 
then washed with water and resuspended in 25  mL of 
1 M sodium carbonate containing 1.25 g of levan for 16 h 
with gentle stirring. The resin was washed with water, 
then with 0.9% NaCl, and again with water. The prepared 
resin was stored in 20% ethanol solution at 4 °C, and the 
binding yield of levan onto the agarose was measured via 
high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) [46].
Removal of the CBM66 tag and purification of target 
protein
Before the removal of the CBM66 tag from the fusion 
protein by enterokinase, the fusion protein was partially 
purified using the Profinia protein purification system as 
described above. The purified fusion protein was recon -
stituted in cleavage buffer (20  mM Tris–HCl, 50  mM 
NaCl, 2  mM  CaCl2, pH 8.0) using an Amicon centrifu -
gal filter cartridge (Merck, Kenilworth, NJ, USA). One 
unit of enterokinase per 25 µg of the fusion protein was 
added to the reaction mixture and incubated at 25 °C for 
16 h. After the reaction, the reactant was loaded directly 
into the open column containing the prepared LAR. 
Intact target protein was collected from the flow through, 
and the fusion tag was eluted with 50 mM and 100 mM 
sodium chloride. Each fraction was analyzed using 
SDS-PAGE.
Bioactivity analysis
PETase activity was verified based on previous reports 
using BHET as a substrate [35, 47]. In detail, 500 μL ali -
quots of 100 nM enzyme samples were added to 500 μL 
of 20  mM Tris–HCl buffer (pH 7.5) containing 2  mM 
BHET and 1% DMSO. The reaction was performed 
at 30  °C for 30  min and halted by heating at 85  °C for 
15 min. The activity was calculated by quantitative anal -
ysis of degraded BHET detected using HPLC. The 1100 
series HPLC and ZORBAX Eclipse XDB-C18 column 
(Agilent, Santa Clara, CA, USA) were used for the quan -
titative analysis of BHET. Compounds were detected at 
260  nm wavelength. Mobile phase A (0.1% formic acid) 
and B (acetonitrile) were used at a flow rate of 0.8 by 
gradually increasing B from 5 to 65% over 25 min.

EGF activity was verified by cell proliferation analysis. 
Human keratinocyte HaCaT cells were cultured in Dul -
becco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM) supplemented 
with 10 U/mL of penicillin–streptomycin and 10% fetal 
bovine serum (FBS) (DMEM + / +) at 37 °C with 5% car-
bon dioxide in a 96-well microplate. The initial inoculum 
was adjusted to 2 ×  104 cells/mL in the prepared media 
and incubated for 48  h. After 48  h, the medium was 
replaced with fresh DMEM + / − (without FBS) contain -
ing intact and CBM66-fused EGF at a final concentration 
of 1  nM and incubated for 48  h. The colorimetric assay 
of cell proliferation was performed using a water-solu -
ble tetrazolium salt (EZ-Cytox, Daeillab Service, Seoul, 
Korea). One-tenth volume of EZ-Cytox was added to 
each culture and incubated for 5 h. Cell viability was ana-
lyzed by measuring the  OD540.
The bioactivity of ADH1 was confirmed by the forma -
tion of acetaldehyde from ethanol. An aliquot of 5  nM 
of each protein sample was added to 1  mL of reaction 
mixture containing 50  mM ethanol and 25  mM  NAD+. 
The mixture was incubated at 30 °C for 2 h. After incuba -
tion, 50 μL of 3 M HCl was added to the mixture to halt 
the reaction. The amount of acetaldehyde produced was 
quantified using HPLC analysis. The Animex HPX-87H 
column (Bio-Rad) was equipped with 1100 series HPLC 
(Agilent), and HPLC grade water containing 5 mM sulfu -
ric acid was used as the mobile phase at a flow rate of 0.6.
One unit of EGF (EU) was defined as the amount pep -
tide that generates 50% cell proliferation effect via MTT 
assay described above. One unit of ADH was defined as 
the amount of enzyme produced by 1  μM acetaldehyde 
from ethanol per minute. Standard EGF and ADH1 were 
purchased from Sigma–Aldrich.
