Background & Aims:The evolution and clinical signiﬁcance of
abnormal liver chemistries and the impact of hepatitis B infec-
tion on outcome in patients with COVID-19 is not well charac-
terized. This study aimed to explore these issues.
Methods: This large retrospective cohort study included 2,073
patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and deﬁnite
outcomes in Wuhan, China. Longitudinal liver function tests
were conducted, with associated factors and risk of death
determined by multivariate regression analyses. A prognostic
nomogram was formulated to predict the survival of patients
with COVID-19. The characteristics of liver abnormalities and
outcomes of patients with COVID-19, with and without hepatitis
B, were compared after 1:3 propensity score matching.
Results: Of the 2,073 patients, 1,282 (61.8%) had abnormal liver
chemistries during hospitalization, and 297 (14.3%) had a liver
injury. The mean levels of aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and
direct bilirubin (D-Bil) increased early after symptom onset in
deceased patients and showed disparity compared to levels in
discharged patients throughout the clinical course of the disease.
Abnormal AST (adjusted hazard ratio [HR] 1.39; 95% CI 1.04– 1.86,
p= 0.027) and D-Bil (adjusted HR 1.66; 95% CI 1.22– 2.26; p=
0.001) levels at admission were independent risk factors for
mortality due to COVID-19. A nomogram was established based
on the results of multivariate analysis and showed sufﬁcient
discriminatory power and good consistency between the pre-
diction and the observation. HBV infection in patients did not
increase the risk of poor COVID-19-associated outcomes.
Conclusions: Abnormal AST and D-Bil levels at admission were
independent predictors of COVID-19-related mortality. There-
fore, monitoring liver chemistries, especially AST and D-Bil
levels, is necessary in hospitalized patients with COVID-19.

Lay summary:Liver test abnormalities (in particular elevations
in the levels of aspartate aminotransferase [AST] and direct
bilirubin [D-Bil]) were observed after symptom onset in patients
who went on to die of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
Abnormal levels of AST and D-Bil at admission were independent
predictors of COVID-19-related mortality. HBV infection in pa-
tients did not increase the risk of poor COVID-19-associated

Introduction
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute
respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infections has
spread rapidly worldwide.
1 As a new, highly contagious disease,
COVID-19 was ﬁrst reported with characteristics of viral pneu-
monia, such as fever, dry cough, and lymphopenia, with ground-
glass opacities on chest CT imaging. In addition, alterations in
liver chemistries were found in patients with COVID-19.
2 A
previous study revealed that liver abnormalities occurred more
frequently in severely or critically ill patients with COVID-19.
3
Pathological examination of liver tissues from deceased pa-
tients with COVID-19 conﬁrmed that liver involvement of COVID-
19 was characterized by microvesicular steatosis, focal necrosis
with inﬁltration of lymphocytes, and microthrombosis in the
portal area.
4 Given the alterations in liver function tests and liver
impairment in pathologicalﬁndings in patients with COVID-19,
the clinical course and outcome of patients with COVID-19 and
liver abnormalities needed to be explored. In addition, the rela-
tionship between liver chemistries and in-hospital deaths due to
COVID-19 remains controversial.
This large, retrospective cohort study conducted at 3 centers
of a designated hospital for treating COVID-19 in Wuhan, China,
reported the dynamic characteristics of alteration in liver
chemistries in patients with COVID-19. In addition, the associa-
tion between liver abnormalities and in-hospital outcomes of
patients with COVID-19 was investigated. The present study
established a predictive model based on the baseline character-
istics at admission in patients with COVID-19, including liver
abnormalities. Moreover, the characteristics and outcomes of
patients with COVID-19 and hepatitis B, as well as other liver
diseases, were described and investigated.
Patients and methods
Study design, participants, and data collection
This retrospective study (TJ-COVID19-LI) was conducted on pa-
tients with COVID-19 discharged or deceased in 3 centers (Main
District, Sino-French Branch, and Optical Valley Branch) of Tongji
Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science
and Technology (Wuhan, China) from January 18 to April 25,
2020. The diagnosis of COVID-19 was made according to the
interim guidance of the World Health Organization.
5 The hos-
pitalization of the patients was based on the criteria proposed by
the National Health Commission of China guidelines for the
management of COVID-19. In detail, hospitalized patients were
laboratory-conﬁrmed patients with symptoms of fever, or res-
piratory symptoms such as cough or dyspnea, showing the
radiologic features of viral pneumonia.
4 The inclusion and
exclusion criteria of this study are listed inTable S1. This study
was approved by the Institutional Review Board (IRB) of Tongji
Hospital (Approval No.: TJ-IRB20200342). Written informed
consent was waived by the IRB of Tongji Hospital for the rapidly
emerging infectious disease and because of the retrospective
nature of the study.
The electronic medical records of all patients from the Tongji
Cloud Hospital Information System were reviewed. The data
were collected using a standardized data collection form and
analyzed by the authors under the Data Process & Application
Platform (DPAP, Yidu Cloud). A de-identiﬁed patient identiﬁca-
tion was assigned to each patient in the DPAP to protect conﬁ-
dentiality. A team of experienced clinicians who had been
treating patients with COVID-19 reviewed and cross-checked the
data. The attending clinicians were approached when the core
data in the patients’ medical records were unavailable or if any
clariﬁcations were needed.
The laboratory testing of patients during hospitalization was
conducted in the clinical laboratory of Tongji Hospital. The real-
time PCR of nasal and pharyngeal swab specimens was used to
test for SARS-CoV-2 RNA as described previously.
6 The laboratory
tests included a complete blood count, coagulation proﬁle, serum
biochemical tests (including liver and renal function tests, car-
diac troponin I [cTnI], lactate dehydrogenase [LDH], high-
sensitivity C-reactive protein [CRP], procalcitonin, and cyto-
kines), hepatitis B-related antigen or antibodies, and hepatitis C-
related antibodies. Chest CT scans of every patient were per-
formed. The frequency of laboratory tests and examinations was
determined by the clinicians treating COVID-19, and serial lab-
oratory data were collected until the discharge or death of every
patient.
Deﬁnition
The upper limit of the normal range of liver chemistries was
determined at the clinical laboratory of Tongji Hospital and is
listed in Table S2.D eﬁnitions of liver abnormalities, mild liver
abnormalities, types of liver abnormalities, liver injury, acute
liver injury (ALI), acute liver failure (ALF), acute-on-chronic liver
failure (ACLF), the severity of the disease (severe pneumonia or
not), complications such as acute respiratory distress syndrome
(ARDS) and septic shock, excessive alcohol assumption, diagnosis
of cirrhosis and decompensated cirrhosis, metabolic
dysfunction-associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD), hepatitis B,
and hepatitis C viral infection are listed inTable 1and Table S3.
Statistical analysis
Detailed statistical analyses are described in supplementary
methods. All statistical analyses were performed using R soft-
ware, version 3.5.1 (R Foundation for Statistical Computing), and
statistical signiﬁcance was determined atp <0.05.
Results
Dynamic characteristics of liver chemistries in patients with
COVID-19
A total of 2,073 patients with COVID-19 were included in the
analysis of liver function test abnormalities (Fig. S1). At admis-
sion, 1,013 (48.9%) patients were diagnosed with severe COVID-
19, of whom 200 (9.7% total) died after a median (IQR) interval
from symptom onset to death of 22.38 (16.72 – 32.66) days
(Table S4). In the remaining 1,873 patients who survived, the
median (IQR) interval from symptom onset to discharge was
39.46 (30.48– 52.54) days.
Serial liver chemistries of patients were collected and
analyzed. Any liver abnormality was documented in 1,282 (61.8%

total) patients during their hospitalization, of whom 958 (46.2%)
had these at admission. Mild liver abnormalities were docu-
mented in 985 (47.5%) patients during hospitalization, of whom
853 (41.1%) had these at admission. Liver injury was documented
in 297 (14.3%) patients during hospitalization, of whom 105
(5.1%) already had this at admission (Table 2).
The types of liver abnormalities were hepatocellular in 614
(29.6%) patients at admission and 535 (25.8%) during hospitali-
zation; cholestatic in 57 (2.7%) at admission and 126 (6.1%)
during hospitalization; and mixed in 108 (5.2%) at admission and
533 (25.7%) during hospitalization. When referring to speciﬁc
liver indices, the elevation of alanine aminotransferase (ALT)
(43.3% during hospitalization and 24.2% at admission), aspartate
aminotransferase (AST) (38.9% during hospitalization and 26.3%
at baseline levels), and gamma-glutamyltransferase (GGT) (31.8%
during hospitalization and 21.4% at admission) levels was pro-
nounced in patients with COVID-19 ( Table 1), whereas the
elevation of total bilirubin (T-Bil), direct bilirubin (D-Bil), and
alkaline phosphatase (ALP) was less common. Only 7 patients
had an isolated elevation of T-Bil. Consistently, kernel density
estimates using Gaussian kernels depicted the baseline distri-
butions (tested at admission) and peak values of ALT, AST, ALP,
GGT, T-Bil, and D-Bil in patients. The widest separation of dis-
tribution between baseline and peak values were observed for
ALT, AST, and GGT levels (Fig. S2).
Notably, 73.0% (146/200) of deceased patients had liver ab-
normalities at admission, and this incidence of liver abnormal-
ities was higher than that in discharged patients (73.0%vs. 43.4%,
p< 0.001). In addition, during hospitalization, the prevalence of
liver abnormalities (92.5% vs. 58.6%, p< 0.001) and liver injury
(31.5% vs. 3.6%, p< 0.001) was also higher in deceased patients.
Both baseline and peak values of liver indices were higher in the
deceased group, except for the incidence of abnormalities in
baseline ALT levels. In addition, abnormal AST and D-Bil levels
were most commonly found in liver tests of deceased patients at
admission and during hospitalization (Table 2).
In the last liver function tests of 1,873 discharged patients
during hospitalization, 594 (31.7%) still showed liver abnormal-
ities, and liver injury was not found. The results of detailed liver
chemistries showed that elevated ALT (349 patients, 18.6%) and
GGT (323 patients, 17.2%) levels were most commonly seen in
patients approaching discharge ( Table S5). However, in 200
deceased patients, 85% (170/200) showed liver abnormalities,
and 35.5% (77/200) showed liver injury in their last liver function
tests before succumbing. In detail, the elevation of AST (117 pa-
tients, 58.5%) and D-Bil (104 patients, 52%) were most commonly
seen in deceased patients before succumbing (Table S5).
Generalized additive models illustrated the changes in liver
chemistries in deceased and discharged patients ( Fig. 1). In
detail, the mean AST and D-Bil levels in the deceased group
increased early after symptom onset and were higher than those
in the discharged group throughout the clinical course of COVID-
19. Also, the mean levels of ALP, T-Bil, and GGT in the deceased
group were comparable with those in the discharged group at
symptom onset but then increased and peaked in the late stage
of the disease. In addition, the changes in mean ALT levels
ﬂuctuated, and the values were close in the deceased and dis-
charged groups.
ALI was found in 10 (0.5%) of 1,869 patients without chronic
liver diseases during their hospitalization (Table S4); ultimately,
all 10 of these patients died. ALI occurred on day 18.5 (IQR
16.25– 30.75) after symptom onset. The occurrence of hepatic
encephalopathy and ALF could not be assessed because 8 of the
10 patients with ALI received invasive mechanical ventilation

Terminology De ﬁnitions
Liver abnormalities Liver abnormalities were de ﬁned as serum levels of ALT, AST, ALP, GGT, T-Bil, or D-Bil exceeding the ULN.
Liver injury Liver injury was de ﬁned according to clinical guidelines of ACG and BSG in evaluation of abnormal liver blood
tests7,8 and the deﬁnition used in previous studies in COVID-19 patients.7 In detail, liver injury was considered
in patients with an increase in ALT or AST of at least 3× ULN, or an increase in ALP, T-Bil or D-Bil of at least 2×
ULN.
Mild liver abnormalities Patients with abnormal ALT, AST, ALP, GGT, T-Bil, or D-Bil serum levels, but symptoms and serologic abnor-
malities that did not meet the criteria for injury, acute injury or acute failure.
Types of liver abnormalities Classi ﬁcation of liver abnormalities was based on clinical guidelines of ACG and BSG in evaluation of abnormal
liver blood tests.
8,9
Hepatocellular type: if the hepatocellular-related indices including ALT or AST levels were above ULN and ALP
level was in the normal range;
Cholestatic type: if ALP levels were increased but with normal AST and ALT levels;
Mixed type: in the presence of elevation of both ALP and ALT/AST levels;
Others: if patterns of liver abnormalities were not matched with types of liver abnormalities mentioned above
such as isolated elevation of GGT or bilirubin.
Acute liver injury Acute liver injury was measured in patients without chronic liver diseases according to the EASL CPGs
10 and
the deﬁnition used in previous studies in COVID-19 patients.11 Acute liver injury was considered if patients
with liver injury and showing disorder of coagulation (INR>−1.5) and jaundice (T-Bil level of>−51 lmol/L (3 mg/
dl)) within 26 weeks of the onset of illness.
Acute liver failure Acute liver injury was measured in patients without chronic liver diseases. Acute liver failure was diagnosed
in patients with acute liver injury and manifestations of hepatic encephalopathy (grade>−2, according to the
West Haven criteria12).
Acute-on-chronic liver failure In patients with chronic liver diseases, liver failure was de ﬁned according to the acute-on-chronic liver failure
consensus recommendations of APASL.13
Acute-on-chronic liver failure is manifested as an acute (within 4 weeks) increase of serum T-Bil>−85 lmol/L
(5 mg/dl) and disorder of coagulation (INR>−1.5), as well as clinical ascites or encephalopathy (grade>−2) in a
patient with chronic liver disease.

under sedation. We then noticed that isolated ALI was not found
in patients with COVID-19. ARDS, septic shock, acute kidney
injury, and cardiac injury were the most common conditions
simultaneously occurring with ALI in patients with COVID-19
(Fig. S3).
Association of alterations of liver chemistries with in-hospital
mortality of COVID-19 patients
The association of liver abnormalities with in-hospital death in
patients with COVID-19 was explored using Cox proportional
hazards model (Tables S6 and S7). After adjustment for age,
gender, high BMI, severe pneumonia at admission, metabolic
cardio-cerebrovascular disease, liver disease, chronic pulmonary
disease, chronic kidney disease, reduced lymphocyte, and
platelet counts and albumin levels, and prolonged prothrombin
time, elevated interleukin-6, D-dimer, CRP, LDH, procalcitonin,
creatinine, and cTnI levels at admission, liver injury during
hospitalization was associated with in-hospital mortality (hazard
ratio [HR] 4.63; 95% CI 2.34– 9.14; p <0.001). Among the types of
liver abnormalities, cholestatic (HR 3.99; 95% CI 1.43– 11.14;p =
0.008) and mixed types (HR 4.77; 95% CI 2.41– 9.41; p <0.001) of
liver abnormalities during hospitalization were independently
associated with in-hospital death ( Table S7 ). In addition,
adjusted HRs for the associations between speciﬁc liver indices
and all-cause mortality were also analyzed.Table S7shows that
patients with abnormal AST, ALP, GGT, T-Bil, or D-Bil levels dur-
ing hospitalization had a higher mortality risk compared to pa-
tients with normal levels of these liver indices.
We further explored the value of abnormal admission levels
of liver chemistries in predicting in-hospital mortality. After

similar adjustment, liver injury at admission was also associated
with in-hospital death due to COVID-19 (HR 2.08; 95% CI
1.25– 3.44; p = 0.005). In addition, abnormal AST and D-Bil levels
at admission showed predictive potential for in-hospital death in
COVID-19, with HRs of 1.61 (95% CI 1.20– 2.15,p = 0.001) and 1.57
(95% CI 1.14– 2.16, p = 0.006), respectively. Even among patients
without severe pneumonia at admission, those with liver injury
(5.9% vs. 2.0%, p = 0.002) or abnormal AST (9.8%vs. 2.0%, p< 0.001)
or D-Bil levels (14.3%vs. 3.0%, p< 0.001) were more likely to die
(Table S8).
Based on a backward stepwise selection with Akaike infor-
mation criterion of multivariate Cox regression analyses and to
avoid multicollinearity among liver chemistries, 2 prognostic
models were selected (Fig. 2). In model 1, liver injury at admis-
sion was independently associated with the risk of in-hospital
death (HR 1.87; 95% CI 1.23– 2.85; p = 0.003). In the second
model, abnormal AST (HR 1.39; 95% CI 1.04– 1.86; p = 0.027) and
D-Bil (HR 1.66; 95% CI 1.22– 2.26; p = 0.001) levels at admission
were independent risk factors for in-hospital death. The good-
ness ofﬁt was similar across these models, with a C-index value
of 0.876 (95% CI 0.833-0.918, model 1) and 0.887 (95% CI 0.844-
0.929, model 2).
Next, we visualized the second regression model with a
higher C-index using a nomogram. Each prognostic factor was
assigned a score based on the top scale of the nomogram. By
adding up these scores to the total on the bottom scale, the 14-,
21-, and 28-day overall survival of patients with COVID-19 were
predicted (Fig. 3). The calibration plots on bootstrap resampling
validation showed good consistency (Fig. S4).
Clinical characteristics and outcomes of patients with COVID-
19 accompanied by hepatitis B and other pre-existing liver
diseases
A total of 204 patients among the included 2,073 patients had
pre-existing liver diseases, including hepatitis B (134 patients),
HCV infection (39 patients), MAFLD (20 patients), and compen-
sated cirrhosis (11 patients; etiology: HBV infection [n = 5], HCV
infection [n = 1], HBV/HCV co-infection [n = 1], alcohol abuse [n =
1], schistosomiasis [n = 2], unknown [n = 1]). In addition, the
initial cohort comprised 3 patients with decompensated
cirrhosis (etiology: HBV infection [n = 3]), who were excluded
from theﬁnal cohort of 2,073 patients. The characteristics of the
patients with COVID-19 and hepatitis B (HBV group)vs. patients
without liver diseases (normal group) are listed inTable S9. All
patients in the HBV group had available hepatitis B e-antigen
status, and 119 (88.8%) had negative hepatitis B e-antigen. The
in-hospital mortality was 6.0% (8/134) in the HBV group. Only 4
patients showed peak ALT levels>−5x the upper limit of normal
(ULN) (hepatitisﬂare) during hospitalization. ACLF was found in
1 of 134 patients with hepatitis B during hospitalization. In this
patient, ACLF developed on the 10th day after symptom onset,
accompanied by ARDS with mechanical ventilation for 3 days;
the patient died on the 8th day after ACLF development (Fig. S5).
In addition, we performed propensity score matching (3:1)
for baseline confounders that could possibly interfere with the
association of hepatitis B and all-cause mortality. There was no
difference in the mortality between patients with HBV and those
without liver disease (6.0%vs. 6.2%, p >0.99). The Kaplan-Meier
curves of the matched HBV and normal groups further
conﬁrmed that the survival rates and curves of these groups
were similar (Fig. 4). Further, no statistically signiﬁcant differ-
ence in the baseline levels and peak values of liver chemistries
were found between the matched HBV and normal groups. The
trajectories of liver chemistries in the matched HBV and normal
groups were close to each other throughout the clinical course of
COVID-19 (Fig. S6).
The characteristics of patients with HCV infection, MAFLD,
and cirrhosis in this study are shown inTable S10. Three patients
with decompensated cirrhosis, who were in the initial cohort of
2,601 patients but were excluded from the cohort of 2,073 pa-
tients, were included in the analysis on liver abnormalities in
COVID-19 to investigate the impact of COVID-19 on patients with
decompensated cirrhosis. The prevalence of liver abnormalities
in these patients was higher than that in patients without liver
diseases, whereas the prevalence of liver injury in patients
without decompensated liver function was comparable with that

in patients without liver diseases. Notably, none of the 3 patients
with COVID-19 and decompensated cirrhosis were diagnosed as
having severe pneumonia at admission, whereas ACLF developed
in 2 (66.7%) patients with a time interval from admission to ACLF
of 6 and 7 days. Jaundice and ascites were found in both of these
patients, and ﬁnally, 1 patient died on the 14th day after the
diagnosis of ACLF (Fig. S7).
Discussion
This study is one of the largest studies evaluating the prevalence
and impact of abnormal liver blood tests in patients with COVID-
19. It provides robust evidence about the prevalence, pattern,
severity, and dynamic changes in liver abnormalities, as well as
associated clinical outcomes, in patients with COVID-19 in
Wuhan, China. In addition, the clinical characteristics and out-
comes of COVID-19 in patients with pre-existing liver diseases,
especially in those with hepatitis B, were analyzed.
This study shows that a mild elevation of liver chemistries is
most commonly found in patients with COVID-19, whereas liver
injury is relatively rare. However, liver injury determined either
at admission or during hospitalization is independently associ-
ated with in-hospital death after adjusting for baseline con-
founders. The prevalence and prognostic value of abnormal liver
chemistries in COVID-19 varies across different studies
14,15 and
are inﬂuenced by the baseline characteristics of patients such as
age, severity of pneumonia, pre-existing comorbidities, and the
presence of multi-organ failure. Moreover, due to the different
prognostic power of predicting COVID-19 mortality in different
liver indices, even in the same study, different deﬁnitions of liver
abnormalities and liver injury showed different prognostic po-
wer for COVID-19 mortality. For example, a previous study
enrolled 417 patients with COVID-19 and used 2 different deﬁ-
nitions to classify the patterns of liver abnormalities in COVID-
19; the associations between liver abnormalities and COVID-19
severity were signi ﬁcantly different under different de ﬁni-
tions.
7 These results suggest that varied deﬁnitions of COVID-19-
associated liver abnormalities and liver injury limited the
possible comparisons of different studies. Therefore, in the
absence of any consensus on liver abnormalities or liver injury in
patients with COVID infection, we elected to evaluate the impact
of speciﬁc liver chemistry parameters.
This study investigated liver chemistries separately. Our re-
sults show that liver abnormalities in COVID-19 are featured by
the elevation of AST, ALT, and GGT levels, whereas the alterations
in ALP and bilirubin levels are relatively uncommon. These
characteristics of abnormalities are consistent with those in
previous reports from other cities of China,
7,16 Europe,17,18 and
the United States.19 In addition, we ﬁrst report trajectories of
liver chemistries in the clinical course of deceased patients with
COVID-19 and found that the mean levels of AST and D-Bil in-
crease early after symptom onset in deceased patients and show
disparity compared to those in discharged patients throughout
the clinical course of the disease. Moreover, we observed that
abnormal D-Bil is commonly found during the hospital stay of
deceased patients with COVID-19, with its prevalence second
only to that of abnormal AST level in liver chemistries, despite
the fact that abnormal D-Bil levels are not commonly found in
patients with COVID-19. Both baseline and peak abnormal AST
and D-Bil levels are independently associated with in-hospital
death in patients with COVID-19. Future studies should eval-
uate the observed association between early AST and D-Bil
elevation and mortality in patients with COVID-19.
Due to the retrospective design of this study, the causality of
liver abnormalities and fatal outcome in COVID-19 cannot be
explored. However, this study reports that liver outcomes,
including ALI and ACLF, are rarely found in patients with COVID-

19. ALI and ACLF develop in the late stage of the disease and are
always accompanied by acute multi-organ injuries, such as ARDS
and acute kidney injury. These results suggest that the liver is
unlikely a key organ driving the mortality due to COVID-19,
although liver abnormalities are commonly found in COVID-19.
The present study reports the largest cohort of patients with
COVID-19 and hepatitis B. The prevalence of hepatitis B in pa-
tients with COVID-19 is similar to that in the general Chinese
population
20 and is much higher than that in previous reports.21
This disparity might be because the serological tests of hepatitis
B surface antigen were not performed in all enrolled patients in
previous studies, and the results of the present study do not
support the hypothesis that HBV has an impact on the suscep-
tibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection. In addition, after adjusting
baseline characteristics by propensity score matching between
groups, in-hospital mortality in patients with hepatitis B is
similar to that in patients without liver diseases. These results
suggest that HBV infection does not increase the risk of COVID-
19-associated poor outcomes. In addition, SARS-CoV-2 infections
might not increase the risk of severe liver impairment in patients
with hepatitis B and compensated liver function.
In this study, we do not report increased mortality in patients
with liver diseases and with compensated liver function. In
contrast, a high prevalence of ACLF and in-hospital mortality is
reported in 3 patients with COVID-19 and decompensated
cirrhosis. These results are consistent with previousﬁndings that
patients with COVID-19 and Child-Pugh B and C cirrhosis show a
signiﬁcantly higher prevalence of hepatic decompensation
events and in-hospital mortality compared with those with
Child-Pugh A cirrhosis.
19,22 Given the high mortality caused by
COVID-19 in patients with decompensated cirrhosis, the present
study conforms with the suggestion from the EASL-ESCMID po-
sition paper that measures should be taken to protect patients
with decompensated cirrhosis from SARS-CoV-2 infection.
23
This study has several limitations. Firstly, selection bias might
be inevitable because the study enrolled only inpatients with
COVID-19, and 48.9% of patients in the cohort were diagnosed
with severe pneumonia at admission, which is not consistent
with the real-world situation that most COVID-19 cases are mild
or moderate. Secondly, repeated liver function tests were per-
formed by clinicians at different time intervals for each patient.
Therefore, patients with severe pneumonia and liver test de-
rangements might undergo a higher number of tests, leading to
bias. Thirdly, liver abnormalities at admission might be inﬂu-
enced by pre-existing liver diseases or other basic conditions of
patients, but the pre-hospital status of liver function tests of
patients could not be retrieved from the present cohort. Finally,
this is a retrospective and observational study, and hence a
validation cohort could not be set up to assess the accuracy of the
predictive model due to the urgent circumstances of the
pandemic. However, the bootstrap resampling cohort was used,
and the ideal C-index of the model was presented. Moreover, the
calibration curves for survival probability also showed good
consistency between the prediction and the observation.
In conclusion, the early onset of elevated AST and D-Bil in
patients following hospitalization with COVID-19 was an inde-
pendent predictor of in-hospital mortality. The proposed
nomogram based on abnormal AST and D-Bil levels at admission
and other individual characteristics accurately predict the
prognosis of patients with COVID-19. Therefore, monitoring liver
chemistries, especially AST and D-Bil levels, is necessary in
hospitalized patients with COVID-19.
