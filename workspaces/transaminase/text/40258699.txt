Graphical Abstract
Study Highlights 
• In a secondary analysis of a Phase 2 clinical trial in patients with presumed MASH and T2DM HTD1801 demon-
strated the potential to induce clinically relevant improvements in noninvasive markers closely correlated with the 
histologic features of MASH and fibrosis.
• In a preclinical model of MASH in hamsters, HTD1801 improved fibrosis, inflammation and ballooning such that 
histologic features resembled normal controls.
• In the clinical trial, 52% of HTD1801-treated patients achieved MRI response criteria compared to 24% of placebo 
(P<0.05). 
• Dose-dependent improvements were observed across biomarkers, with more HTD1801-treated patients achieving 
thresholds correlated with histologic improvement and lower disease activity.

INTRODUCTION
The complex and interrelated pathophysiology underlying 
metabolic liver diseases calls for treatments that address 
multiple targets. Metabolic dysfunction-associated steato -
hepatitis (MASH), a severe form of metabolic dysfunction-
associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD), is the hepatic 
manifestation of metabolic syndrome and is characterized 
by dysregulation of glucose, lipid and bile acid metabolism, 
and progressive fibrosis.
1
 The disease burden of MASLD is 
gradually increasing and parallels the obesity and type 2 
diabetes (T2DM) epidemics.
1
 In patients with MASLD, con-
comitant cardiometabolic risk factors such as T2DM drasti-
cally increase the risk of both cardiovascular and liver-re -
lated mortality.
2
Liver histology has been used as the surrogate endpoint 
to assess treatment response in late-stage clinical trials. 
However, there are well-reported limitations and associated 
risks with the invasive procedure.
3
 Additionally, many non-
invasive tests have repeatedly been shown to predict major 
adverse liver outcomes as good as, if not better than, histo
-
logic fibrosis staging.
4,5
Promising imaging biomarkers include the use of mag -
netic resonance imaging proton density fat fraction (MRI-
Background/Aims:  Berberine ursodeoxycholate (HTD1801) has been shown to significantly reduce liver fat 
content (LFC) in an 18-week, placebo-controlled Phase 2 study in patients with metabolic dysfunction-associated 
steatohepatitis (MASH) and type 2 diabetes mellitus. The purpose of this assessment was to establish proof of 
concept in liver histologic improvement with HTD1801 treatment based on preclinical and clinical evidence.
Methods: The efficacy of HTD1801 was evaluated in a preclinical MASH/dyslipidemia model (golden hamsters fed a 
high fat diet, eight/group) after six weeks of daily treatment. Additionally, in a secondary analysis of a Phase 2 clinical 
study, 100 patients with presumed MASH were evaluated by multiple noninvasive markers associated with MASH 
resolution and/or fibrosis improvement. These include magnetic resonance imaging proton density fat fraction (MRI-
PDFF; ≥30% LFC reduction), iron-corrected T1 (≥80 ms reduction), alanine aminotransferase (≥17 U/L reduction), 
weight loss (≥5% reduction), Fibrosis-4 index (shift to <1.3), and MASH resolution index (achieving ≥–0.67).
Results: Preclinical findings in the MASH/dyslipidemia hamster model showed that HTD1801 significantly improved 
histologic fibrosis and the Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease Activity Score to such a degree that improvements 
approximated the appearance of the normal controls. In the clinical study, 52% of HTD1801-treated patients achieved 
MRI response criteria compared to 24% of placebo (P<0.05). Dose-dependent improvements were observed across 
biomarkers, with more HTD1801-treated patients achieving response criteria associated with improvements in the 
histologic features of MASH.
Conclusions: These findings suggest that HTD1801 has strong potential to produce histological improvements in 
patients with MASH. (Clin Mol Hepatol 2025;31:1071-1083)

PDFF) and iron-corrected T1 (cT1) mapping. MRI-PDFF is 
currently the gold standard for quantifying hepatic steato -
sis.
1
 In a meta-analysis of seven clinical studies (n=346), a 
≥30% relative decline in liver fat content (LFC) by MRI-
PDFF was strongly associated with histologic response in-
cluding a ≥2-point improvement in the Nonalcoholic Fatty 
Liver Disease Activity Score (NAS) with ≥1-point improve -
ment in lobular inflammation or ballooning (odds ratio 6.98, 
P<0.001) and MASH resolution (odds ratio 5.45, P<0.01).
6
Liver cT1 has been shown to correlate with fibroinflam -
matory activity present in histology and has high diagnostic 
accuracy in identifying patients with MASH across the dis
-
ease spectrum.
7
 In a cross-sectional investigation of 264 
patients, it was estimated that an approximately 80 ms re -
duction in cT1 corresponded to a ≥2-point decrease in NAS 
with no worsening of fibrosis.
8
 In a follow-up analysis of 
data pooled from three clinical trials (n=150), a cT1 reduc -
tion of 80 ms was associated with a 5-fold increase in the 
odds of achieving MASH resolution.
9
In addition to imaging, other noninvasive laboratory-
based markers and weight loss have been associated with 
a histologic response in patients with MASH. A secondary 
analysis of the FLINT study found that a decrease in ala -
nine aminotransferase (ALT) of ≥17 U/L was significantly 
associated with ≥2-point improvement in NAS with no 
worsening of fibrosis (odds ratio 11.0, P<0.001).
10
 Similarly, 
in a prospective evaluation on the impact of lifestyle chang-
es on the histologic features of MASH, a reduction in body 
weight of ≥5% was associated with higher rates of resolu -
tion of steatohepatitis (58% vs. 10%, P<0.001) and ≥2-point 
improvement in NAS (82% vs. 32%, P <0.001).
11-13
 Lastly, 
the fibrosis-4 index (FIB-4) was developed to predict the 
severity of liver fibrosis in lieu of performing a liver biopsy 
using routine laboratory assessments and, in an analysis 
of 541 adults with MASLD, was shown to be superior to 
other noninvasive markers of fibrosis.
12,13
 A FIB-4 of ≤1.3 
has been used to reliably exclude patients with advanced 
fibrosis with a negative predictive value of 88–95%.
13,14
Composite scores based on a combination of imaging 
and serum biomarkers have also been developed to better 
predict an improvement in histologic response. In a multi
-
variable analysis of 108 patients, a ≥30% decrease in MRI-
PDFF and a ≥17 U/L decrease in ALT was a predictor of 
achieving a ≥2-point improvement in NAS with no worsen-
ing of fibrosis (adjusted odds ratio 11.3, P<0.01) and MASH 
resolution (adjusted odds ratio 7.4, P<0.01).
15
 Loomba et 
al.
16
 used the strong association of ALT and MRI-PDFF with 
MASH resolution to develop a more robust noninvasive 
score, the MASH resolution index, which combines these 
with serum aspartate aminotransferase (AST). The MASH 
resolution index outperformed the individual ALT or MRI-
PDFF response criteria in predicting MASH resolution with 
an area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve 
of 0.83 compared to 0.58 and 0.76, respectively.

Berberine ursodeoxycholate (HTD1801) is a gut-liver anti-
inflammatory metabolic modulator, a new molecular entity 
composed of an ionic salt of ursodeoxycholic acid and ber-
berine that has the potential to offer a comprehensive ben-
efit to diseases driven by insulin resistance and inflamma -
tion. With its unique dual mechanism of action (adenosine 
monophosphate kinase activation and NLRP3 inflamma
-
some inhibition), HTD1801 was designed on the premise 
that it would have the benefits of both active moieties, but 
with improved and novel pharmacological effects resulting 
from its unique molecular structure. As a result, HTD1801 
has the potential to become a novel treatment option for 
multiple chronic metabolic and liver diseases. The safety 
and efficacy of HTD1801 have been evaluated in Phase 1 
and Phase 2 clinical studies globally and have demonstrat
-
ed beneficial effects on glycemic parameters, lipid metabo-
lism, markers of liver injury and cholestasis, body weight, 
and noninvasive markers of liver fibrosis.
17-20
In an 18-week study of HTD1801 in patients with pre -
sumed MASH and T2DM, patients treated with HTD1801 
had significant reductions in LFC per MRI-PDFF, glycated 
hemoglobin (HbA1c), lipids, and body weight.
18
 While liver 
biopsies were not conducted in this study, several different 
non-invasive techniques have been evaluated to estimate 
the potential of HTD1801 on histologic improvements in pa
-
tients with MASH. Noninvasive tests were selected based 
on a review of the most commonly used noninvasive bio
-
markers and treatment response criteria reported to be as-
sociated with histological improvements of MASH (steato -
sis, inflammation and fibrosis) and whose outcomes were 
also assessed in the present Phase 2 clinical study.
The purpose of this manuscript is to establish proof of 
concept of liver histologic improvement following treatment 
with HTD1801 based on histologic evaluation in a preclini
-
cal model of metabolic disease and assessment of nonin -
vasive biomarkers associated with histologic improvements

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Preclinical study: hamster model of MASH and 
dyslipidemia
Male Syrian golden hamsters (n=32; Vital River Labora -
tories, Beijing, China) were utilized in a preliminary evalua-
tion of histologic and biochemical efficacy of HTD1801. 
Hamsters received a high fat diet containing 1.25% choles-
terol and 20% grease (2.79% soybean oil and 17.27% co -
coa butter) for 2 weeks prior to treatment administration to 
induce MASH/dyslipidemia and maintained this diet 
through Week 6. After a 2-week high fat diet feeding peri
-
od, prior to dosing and grouping, 4 hamsters were sacri -
ficed for histological evaluation. The remaining hamsters 
were randomly stratified by total cholesterol level prior to 
treatment into the following groups: normal control (n=8), 
model control (n=8), and HTD1801 (high dose: 200 mg/kg, 
n=8 and low dose: 100 mg/kg, n=8). Hamsters designated 
to the normal control group received normal chow through
-
out the study period. Food intake was monitored for all 
groups throughout the study period. Hamsters received 
daily treatment for 6 weeks. Blood was drawn by orbital 
vein for assessment of biochemical parameters (AST, ALT, 
total bilirubin, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol [LDL-C], 
total cholesterol) at Day 0 and Week 2, 4 and 6. Livers 
were resected for analysis at Week 6 after the animals 
were sacrificed. Livers were sectioned (paraffin embedded 
blocks into 4 µm thickness sections) and stained with he
-
matoxylin and eosin and Masson’s trichrome for evaluation 
of the NAS and the Nonalcoholic Steatohepatitis Clinical 
Research Network fibrosis score by a pathologist blinded 
to group assignment.
21
 The liver index was calculated as 
liver weight (g) divided by body weight (kg). All animal ex -
periments were conducted with Laboratory Animal Man -
agement and Ethics Committee of Zhejiang University of 
Traditional Chinese Medicine approvals. 
For statistical testing of biochemical parameters in the 
preclinical hamster model, an analysis of variance (ANO
-
VA) was used to evaluate differences between groups. 
Only for biochemical parameters, the Grubbs test was 
used to determine the outliers for each group with a confi
-
dence interval of 97.5%.
22
 No more than one outlier was re-
moved from each group. For histologic parameters in the 
preclinical hamster model, a non-parametric Kruskal–Wal -
lis test was used. P-values less than 0.05 were considered 
to be significant. SPSS 22.0 software (IBM Co., Armonk, 
NY, USA) was used for statistical analyses and PRISM 9.5 
(GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA, USA) was used for 
plotting data.
Phase 2 study in MASH
This secondary analysis used data from a Phase 2, ran -
domized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of the effi-
cacy and safety of HTD1801 in patients with presumed 
MASH and T2DM. The primary results, including the study 
design and patient disposition were previously published 
by Harrison et al.
18
 (NCT03656744). In brief, 100 patients 
with presumed MASH based on an LFC ≥10%, cT1 ≥830 
ms, AST ≥20 U/L, and a documented clinical diagnosis of 
T2DM (at least 6 months prior to randomization) were ran-
domized 1:1:1 using permuted blocks without additional 
stratification factors and treated orally with placebo (n=33), 
HTD1801 500 mg BID (n=33), and HTD1801 1,000 mg BID 
(n=34) for 18 weeks. HTD1801 and placebo were provided 
as matching white tablets (supplied by HighTide Therapeu
-
tics Inc.). All patients, study personnel, and the sponsor 
were blinded to treatment assignment. MRIs were per
-
formed at baseline and at Week 18. Biochemistry and body 
weight were assessed at baseline and every visit through
-
out the study.
For this analysis, MRI response was defined as achiev -
ing either ≥30% reduction in LFC by MRI-PDFF or an im -
provement in fibroinflammation as determined by ≥80 ms 
reduction in cT1 at 18 weeks. MRI-PDFF data was collect
-
ed prospectively for evaluation of the primary endpoint. A 
cT1 segmented analysis (Perspectum, Oxford, UK) was 
evaluated following completion of the study in patients who 
had been randomized to HTD1801 1,000 mg BID or place
-
bo only.
FIB-4 was derived from a patient’s age, AST, ALT, and 
platelet count using the formula developed by Sterling et 
al.
12
 with a shift in FIB-4 from >1.3 at baseline to ≤1.3 at 
Week 18 representing an improvement in fibrosis stage.

the equation published by Loomba et al.
16
 For this analysis, 
a histologic improvement was defined as achieving a 
MASH resolution index of ≥–0.67.
The clinical study was conducted in accordance with the 
Declaration of Helsinki 2013, approved by the institutional 
review boards and written informed consent was obtained 
from all participants.
Statistical analysis for the comparisons between active 
treatment groups and placebo were tested using an esti
-
mation based on a Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel model. Anal-
yses were performed using SAS V9.4.
RESULTS
Preclinical study: hamster model of MASH and 
dyslipidemia
Macroscopic observations and histological evaluation 
prior to dosing for golden hamsters fed a high fat diet for 2 
weeks are presented in Supplementary Figure 1. Following 
dosing, the model control had marked elevation in amino -
transferases, total bilirubin and lipids (Fig. 1) compared 
with normal controls. Each of the markers of liver inflam
-
mation and hepatocellular damage (AST, ALT) were im -
proved with HTD1801 treatment by Week 2, with significant 
mean improvements in the HTD1801 high dose group to a 
level resembling the normal controls at Week 6 (Table 1). 
Furthermore, significant reductions with HTD1801 were 
also observed in key cardiometabolic parameters (LDL-C 
and total cholesterol) with mean LDL -C approaching the 
same values as the normal controls. Additionally, a clear 
dose-dependent effect is observed with greater reductions 
across each biochemical parameter with the higher dose 
of HTD1801 approximating the level of the normal control 
(Fig. 1).
Improvements in HTD1801 could be readily viewed in re
-
sected hamster livers without the aid of a microscope. As 
shown in Figure 2A, HTD1801-treated livers most closely 
resembled the normal control group macroscopically. The 
liver index in the model control increased significantly com-
pared with the normal control (mean [standard error of 
means, SEM]: 51.9 g/kg [2.8] vs. 27.9 g/kg [1.1]; P <0.01). 
Significant reductions in the liver index were observed with 
HTD1801 100 mg/kg (33.5 g/kg [0.9]; P<0.01) and HTD1801 
200 mg/kg (30.2 g/kg [0.6]; P<0.01) compared to the model 
control.
Following hematoxylin and eosin staining (Fig. 2B), the 
structure of the liver in the normal control group was clear, 
the central vein of the liver was intact, the hepatic cords 
were arranged neatly, and the hepatic cells were normal in 
shape. In contrast, for the model control group, the bound
-
ary of hepatic lobules was unclear, hepatocytes were ar -
ranged mussily, cord structures disappeared, and a large 
number of hepatocytes showed swelling. Overall, the mor
-
phology in the HTD1801 groups improved compared to the 
model control group. In the HTD1801 200 mg/kg group, the 
hepatic lobular structure and cord structure were clear, and 
there was no obvious swelling of hepatocytes.
The model controls developed significant fibrosis, steato
-
sis, inflammation, and ballooning compared to the normal 
controls (Fig. 2C). Treatment with both doses of HTD1801 
resulted in significant reductions in fibrosis (by approxi
-
mately 1 stage) as well as improvements in each compo -
nent of the NAS with almost no residual ballooning. A clear 
dose-dependent effect was observed with HTD1801 result-
ing in greater histologic improvements at the highest dose 
across each histologic parameter.
Phase 2 study: study overview in MASH 
A total of 100 patients were randomized and received at 
least one dose of study drug (placebo n=33, HTD1801 
500 mg BID n=33, and HTD1801 1,000 mg BID n=34).
18
 
Overall, 88 patients (87%) completed the study, 32 patients 
(97%) in the placebo group, 29 patients (85%) in the 
HTD1801 500 mg BID group and 27 patients (79%) in the 
HTD1801 1,000 mg BID group. The most common reason 
for study discontinuation was due to adverse events (6 pa
-
tients), primarily gastrointestinal adverse events, followed 
by lost to follow-up.
18
 Demographic characteristics were 
generally well balanced across all three treatment groups 
(Supplementary Table 1). The median age overall was 57 
years (range: 26 to 75 years), and 72% were female. Most 
patients were White (91%) and not Hispanic or Latino 
(62%). Median baseline weight and body mass index were 
similar across treatment groups. Baseline values for 
HbA1c, ALT, γ-glutamyl transferase, LDL-C, triglycerides, 
and LFC were similar across treatment groups. As de
-
scribed in Harrison et al.,

 the primary endpoint was

achieved with a significant reduction in LFC (via MRI-
PDFF) with HTD1801 1,000 mg BID compared to placebo 
(–4.8% vs. –2.0%, P =0.011). The beneficial effect of 
HTD1801 on liver fat was accompanied by improvements 
in liver biochemistry and weight (Supplementary Table 2).
As shown in Supplementary Table 3, treatment with 
HTD1801 was generally safe and well tolerated. More pa -
tients in the HTD1801 1,000 mg BID group experienced a 
treatment emergent adverse event during the study com
-
pared to placebo (26 [76%] vs. 20 [61%]). The most com -
mon adverse events were diarrhea and nausea which were 
generally mild to moderate in severity. During the study, 3 
patients (3%) experienced serious adverse events of de
-
creased oxygen saturation (1), myocardial infarction (1), 
and bladder transitional cell carcinoma (1) in the HTD1801 
500 mg BID, 1,000 mg BID, and placebo groups, respec -
tively. All serious adverse events were considered not re -
lated to study drug by the Investigator.

Phase 2 study: MRI response criteria
At baseline, patients receiving placebo and HTD1801 
1,000 mg BID had elevated mean LFC by MRI-PDFF (20% 
and 19%, respectively) and cT1 (938 ms and 942 ms, re -
spectively). As shown in Figure 3 and Table 2, after 18 
weeks of treatment, the MRI response criteria (either MRI-
PDFF or cT1) was achieved by 52% in the HTD1801 group 
and 24% in the placebo group (P=0.03). Of these patients,

Phase 2 study: composite response criteria
More patients treated with HTD1801 compared to place-
bo achieved the composite response criteria of MRI-PDFF 
and ALT which is associated with achieving ≥2-point im -
provement in NAS and MASH resolution. A dose-depen -
dent effect was observed, with 7% (n=2) and 33% (n=9) of 
patients in the HTD1801 500 mg BID and 1,000 mg BID 
group, respectively, achieving both a ≥30% reduction in 
LFC and a ≥17 U/L reduction in ALT compared to none in 
the placebo group (Fig. 5A and Table 2).
Additionally, more than 3 times as many patients treated with 
HTD1801 1,000 mg BID (41%) than placebo (12%) achieved 
MASH resolution index ≥–0.67 (Fig. 5B and Table 2).

DISCUSSION
Using a preclinical model and secondary analysis of a 
Phase 2 clinical study with consistent findings across multi-
ple noninvasive surrogates, HTD1801 demonstrated the 
potential to induce clinically relevant histologic improve -
ments in patients with MASH.
Preclinical findings in the MASH/dyslipidemia hamster 
model showed that HTD1801 significantly reduced ALT, 
AST, total bilirubin, LDL-C and total cholesterol after 6 
weeks of treatment. Furthermore, HTD1801 improved his
-
tology including fibrosis and NAS to such a degree that the

final histologic features were similar to control animals fed 
with normal chow. The improvements in liver size and ste -
atosis were also obvious macroscopically. 
This secondary analysis of a randomized, placebo-con -
trolled Phase 2 study in patients with presumed MASH ex-
amined biomarkers and treatment response criteria that 
are associated with improvements across the spectrum of 
histologic features of MASH including steatosis (MRI-PDFF 
and weight loss), inflammation (cT1, MRI-PDFF, ALT, and 
weight loss) and fibrosis (cT1 and FIB-4). The MRI re
-
sponse criteria was achieved by twice as many patients 
treated with HTD1801 as placebo, with nearly half in the 
HTD1801 1,000 mg BID group achieving response criteria 
in both LFC and cT1. Dose-dependent improvements were 
observed across biomarkers, with more HTD1801-treated 
patients achieving thresholds correlated with histologic im
-
provement and lower disease activity. Treatment with 
HTD1801 was generally safe and well tolerated. Mild to 
moderate diarrhea and nausea were the most frequently 
reported events and no serious adverse events were con -
sidered related to study drug.
HTD1801 is believed to work through multiple pathways 
that address the core aspects of MASH, including activa -
tion of adenosine monophosphate kinase, inhibition of the 
NLRP3 inflammasome, induction of the insulin receptor, 
and induction of the LDL receptor. The results on fibrosis 
and metabolic control are consistent with adenosine mono
-
phosphate kinase activation and suppression of NLRP3 in-
flammasomes—addressing MASH fibrosis in two ways—
improving the metabolic drivers of disease and potentially 
a direct anti-fibrotic effect through suppressing NLRP3, 
which is an inflammatory pathway reported to be tied to fi -
brogenesis.
23
In MASLD, biomarkers are generally developed for diag-
nostic, prognostic, monitoring, and response assessment 
purposes.
24
 While numerous studies have confirmed the 
diagnostic and prognostic capabilities of various noninva -
sive tests, few have been validated as response biomark -
ers. This limitation arises because developing response 
biomarkers necessitates not only serial noninvasive tests 
paired with liver biopsies but also effective treatment be
-
tween assessments. Among the proposed response bio -
markers, an MRI-PDFF response of ≥30% relative reduc -
tion has the most robust evidence base, validated in clinical 
trials such as the Phase 3 MAESTRO-NASH study for res-
metirom.
25
 However, it is crucial to understand that MRI-
PDFF is a steatosis marker, with its association to improve-
ments in inflammation and fibrosis being correlational. 
Conversely, while weight reduction has been linked to 
MASH resolution and fibrosis improvement in natural histo
-
ry or lifestyle intervention cohorts,

 the relationship be -
tween weight loss and histologic response may become

dissociated when a patient is undergoing effective drug 
treatment for MASH. Additionally, some biomarkers, such 
as liver stiffness measurement by vibration-controlled tran-
sient elastography, are influenced by weight changes, fur -
ther complicating their use as response biomarkers.
27
 Last-
ly, liver biopsies themselves are an imperfect reference 
standard for assessing treatment response in MASH, as 
imprecision in histologic scoring may result in dilution of 
treatment effect size and misevaluation of therapeutic ef -
fects.
28
 Thus, consistency in response across multiple bio -
markers would enhance confidence in identifying genuine 
therapeutic effects, as demonstrated in the current study.
Currently, the only pharmacological treatment to receive 
approval by the United States Food and Drug Administra
-
tion for the treatment of MASH is resmetirom, a small mol-
ecule thyroid hormone receptor beta agonist. In the pivotal 
Phase 3 study, treatment with resmetirom resulted in histo
-
logic improvements in MASH and fibrosis. While histologic 
data are not yet available from clinical studies of HTD1801, 
treatment with HTD1801 may provide a broader metabolic 
benefit, including significant improvements in glycemic 
control and weight loss, which have not been shown with 
resmetirom.
18,20
Limitations of this evaluation include the post hoc nature 
of the analysis of the clinical study, short treatment duration 
with HTD1801 (only 18 weeks), and limited number of bio
-
markers/imaging tools evaluated. Additionally, in this study 
the presumption of MASH was based on the combination 
of LFC ≥10%, cT1 ≥830 ms, and AST ≥20 U/L. Although 
these thresholds have been correlated with the presence 
of high-risk MASH and are higher than the clinical diagnos
-
tic criteria for MASLD, as liver biopsies were not performed, 
the presence of MASH was presumed.
1,7
 The strengths of 
this evaluation include the fact that the data are from a ran-
domized, placebo-controlled, multi-site clinical study.
While these data are preliminary, it suggests that ongo -
ing treatment with HTD1801 would be expected to result in 
improvements in the key histologic targets in patients with 
MASH. A Phase 2b study is currently ongoing to evaluate 
the histologic effects of HTD1801 in patients with MASH 
and T2DM or prediabetes (NCT05623189).
