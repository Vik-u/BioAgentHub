Abstract
Aims: Ectopic fat is reduced by effective weight management, but difficult to 
assess clinically.
Methods: We evaluated paired data on 42 participants in the intervention group 
of the Diabetes Remission Clinical Trial (DiRECT) at baseline, 12 and 24 months 
after weight loss as indicators of liver fat content measured by 3- point Dixon MRI.
Results: Baseline liver fat was elevated at 13.0 [7.8–23.3]% with fasting plasma 
glucose 7.9 [7.1–10.1] mmol/L. Prevalence of baseline MASLD was 86.4%. After 
weight loss of 11.9 ± 1.2 kg (0–37 kg) at 12 months, remission of MASLD occurred 
in 74% and liver fat normalised for many (1.8 [1.2–5.2]%; p < 0.0001) as did fasting 
glucose (5.9 [5.5–7.2] mmol/L; p < 0.0001). Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) 
and gamma glutamyl transferase (GGT) decreased at 12 months by 38 [19–60]% 
(p < 0·0001) and 38 [16–53]% (p < 0.0001) respectively. The positive predictive 
value for decrease in liver fat, with baseline values of >40 IU/L, was 100% for ALT 
and 87.5% for GGT. As expected, change in liver fat correlated with change in 
ALT (r = 0.64; p < 0.0001), GGT (r = 0.38; p = 0.013), AST (r = 0.36; p = 0.018), fatty 
liver index (r = 0.50; p < 0.0001) and hepatic steatosis index (r = 0.44; p < 0.0001).
Conclusion: Metabolic dysfunction- associated steatotic liver disease, an 
important marker of ill- health is improved by intentional weight loss. If enzyme 
levels are raised at baseline, following weight loss, changes in ALT and GGT 
usefully reflect change in liver fat content, with high positive predictive value. 
Monitoring liver enzymes can provide a simple way to assess change in liver fat 
following weight loss in day- to- day clinical practice.

1 | INTRODUCTION
Once considered to be an incidental finding of little clini-
cal importance, metabolic dysfunction- associated steatotic 
liver disease (MASLD), formerly known as non- alcoholic 
fatty liver disease (NAFLD), is now an established indi-
cator of morbidity and mortality. The overall prevalence 
of MASLD around the world is rising and estimated to be 
above 20%.1 An increase in liver fat is important in the ae-
tiology of type 2 diabetes 2–4 among whom the prevalence 
of MASLD is at least 70%.5,6
There are currently no simple, reliable methods of 
measuring liver fat in primary care. Referral for liver ultra-
sound can provide an estimate but accurate quantification 
requires magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Remission 
of type 2 diabetes is now a key therapeutic goal, and this 
requires normalisation of liver fat, by weight loss. 2,7,8 
Therefore, knowledge of return to normal liver fat levels 
would be valuable in clinical practice, both for motivation 
and monitoring of interventions. Knowledge of the possi-
bility of remission of type 2 diabetes has alerted many par-
ticipants to the presence and implications of MASLD. Liver 
enzyme measurement at a single time point is not reliable 
for assessing MASLD,9 though when seen in conjunction 
with elevated BMI, triglycerides and often HbA1c, they 
are often signalling excess liver fat. 10 Furthermore, the 
major change in liver fat content which accompanies sub-
stantial weight loss might be accompanied by a clinically 
useful decrease in liver enzymes, serving as a pragmatic 
biomarker for liver fat reduction.1 Data are required to ex-
plore this possibility.
In the Diabetes Remission Clinical Trial (DiRECT) 
magnetic resonance measurement of liver fat content 
and LFT data were obtained in a trial subgroup 11 permit-
ting assessment of the relationship during weight loss. 
Additionally, the Fatty Liver Index12 and Hepatic Steatosis 
Index13 could be calculated. The present exploratory post- 
hoc analysis was conducted to evaluate the predictive 
value of serial liver function tests and derived indices of 
MASLD during substantial weight loss, as judged against 
the gold standard of magnetic resonance measurement of 
liver fat.
2 | RESEARCH DESIGN AND 
METHODS
2.1 | Participants
Participants in the Tyneside cohort of DiRECT ran-
domised to the weight loss management intervention 
were studied. Inclusion criteria were type 2 diabetes du-
ration of less than 6 years, age 20–65 years, BMI between 
27 and 45 kg/m2 and HbA1c ≥ 48 mmol/mol (≥6.5%) if on 
diet alone or HbA1c ≥ 43 mmol/mol (≥6.1%) if on treat-
ment with oral hypoglycaemic agents. The recruited 
group (n  = 59) was typical of early type 2 diabetes: age 
52.5 ± 1.1 years; 50·9% men; weight 100.4 ± 2.3 kg; BMI 
34.9 ± 0.6 kg/m2. Duration of diabetes since the diagnosis 
was 3.0 ± 0.2 years. Full data on liver fat and LFT were 
available on 59 participants at baseline and on 42 partici-
pants for paired data at baseline, 12 and 24 months.
Non- Diabetic Controls (NDC, n  = 25) were recruited 
to permit comparison with the DiRECT group matched 
for post weight loss weight and BMI, and age and sex 
(86.6 ± 3.0 kg; 29.7 ±  0.8 kg/m2, 55.8 ± 1.2 years; 52% 
men; Table  1). Oral Glucose Tolerance Tests were per-
formed on this group to confirm normal glucose toler-
ance, and none had known personal or family history of 
type 2 diabetes.
2.2 | Study protocol
The present study involves a subset of participants in the 
DiRECT intervention group, who followed an integrated 
weight management programme, with 12–20 weeks on 
825–853 kcal/day liquid formula diet to induce weight 
loss, a 4–6 period of food reintroduction and then food- 
based weight maintenance diet. Quantification of liver 
fat and LFTs was carried out at baseline, then at 12 and 
24 months of follow- up in DiRECT. The NDC group were 
studied on a single occasion.7
After fasting from 10:00 PM of the previous day all 
participants had liver fat measurement by MR and blood 
sampling. The morning medications were omitted on the 
What‘s new?
• Substantial weight loss had a potent effect on 
liver fat content leading to remission in 74% of 
those with MASLD at baseline.
• The proportion achieving remission of MASLD 
induced by dietary weight loss of 10–15 kg 
is similar to that seen with very large weight 
losses post-bariatric surgery.
• Decreases in ALT and GGT following weight 
loss can be used to reflect change in liver fat as 
they have a high positive predictive value for 
normalisation of liver fat content when baseline 
levels are raised.
• Sequential measurements of liver enzymes in 
clinical practice can provide a simple means of 
assessing change in liver fat.

day of the study and antidiabetic and antihypertensive 
treatments were then discontinued, being reintroduced 
if indicated from blood glucose and blood pressure mon-
itoring. Participants were reviewed at their GP practice 
fortnightly until they had completed food reintroduction, 
then monthly to limit and address weight regain during 
the 2- year follow- up phase.
Ethical approval was obtained from the West of 
Scotland Research Ethics Committee (reference number: 
13/WS/0314). DiRECT was registered on 20 December 
2013, Current Controlled Trials number ISRCTN03267836.
2.3 | Measurements and analytical 
procedures
Magnetic resonance images were collected by using 
a 3 Tesla Phillips Intera Achieva Scanner (Phillips, 
Amstelplein 2, 1096 BC Amsterdam, Netherlands). A 
standard 6 channel cardiac coil (Phillips) was used for tak-
ing images in most cases. In the circumstances of the large 
body habitus the so- called Flexi Coil or four large surface 
coils (Phillips) were used instead. Liver fat data were gath-
ered by using the Newcastle modification of the 3- point 
Dixon MR scanning method as previously described using 
MATLAB software (Mathworks, Cambridge, UK). 14 The 
Image J 1.43 software was used to define the Region- of- 
Interest (ROI) by utilising the Image J polygon tool. 15 5 
ROIs for the liver were acquired and averaged, using the 
same anatomical area across every scan for each person 
sequentially. The inter- scan Bland–Altman repeatability 
coefficients were 0.5% for the liver.2
Venous blood was sampled after MR scanning following 
the overnight fast from 10 pm of the previous day. Fasting 
plasma glucose was measured by using the glucose oxidase 
method (YSI glucose analyser, Yellow Springs Instrument 
Company, Yellow Springs, OH). Liver enzymes (ALT, 
GGT, AST) and HbA1C were analysed at the Institute of 
Cardiovascular and Medical Sciences, University of Glasgow 
(c311, Roche Diagnostics, Burgess Hill, UK). Fasting plasma 
insulin (FPI) was measured by ELISA (Mercodia, Uppsala, 
Sweden) at the Clinical Pathology Laboratory of Newcastle 
upon Tyne Hospitals NHS Trust.
Hepatic Steatosis Index (BMI, AST, ALT, diagnosis of 
type 2 diabetes)12 was calculated using MD App (https://  
www. mdapp. co/ hepat ic-  steat osis-  index -  hsi-  calcu lator -  
357/ ) calculator. As a secondary objective, the BARD score 
for an assessment of the risk of hepatic fibrosis, based on 
BMI, AST/ALT ratio and the presence/ absence of type 2 
diabetes,16 was calculated using MD Calc online calculator 
(https:// www. mdcalc. com/ bard-  score -  nafld -  fibrosis). Fib- 4 
score could not be used as platelet count was not available.
Data were analysed using IBM SPSS statistical software 
(www. ibm. com). Normality of the data was examined 
using histograms and Shapiro–Wilk test. Paired data for 
42 people with type 2 diabetes was analysed at all time-
points in comparison with baseline values and with NDC. 
Correction for multiple testing was not done. Normally 
distributed data were analysed using paired samples t- test, 
independent samples t- test or Pearson correlation test, 
and skewed data were analysed using Wilcoxon Rank test, 
Mann–Whitney U- test, or Spearman Rank correlation test 
as appropriate. Data were presented as mean ± SEM or me-
dian with interquartile range [25th and 75th centiles].

Positive predictive values (PPV) of ALT and GGT for 
normalisation of liver fat (< 5.6%) post weight loss were 
calculated in the diabetes group only (n = 42) at 12 months.
2.4 | Results
Mean weight loss at 12 months was 11.9 ± 1.2 kg (range 
0–37 kg). Weight decreased from 98.3 ± 2.5 kg at baseline 
to 86.4 ± 2.2 kg (p < 0.0001) at 12 months and increased 
by 4.2 ± 0.6 kg to 90.7 ± 2.4 kg (p < 0.0001; Table  1) at 
24 months. 33% (n = 14) of participants had maintained 
≥10 kg weight loss at 24 months. Liver fat content was 
grossly elevated at baseline at 13.0 [7.8–23.3]% (upper 
level of normal 5.6%). 17 It decreased to 1.8 [1.2–5.2]% at 
12 months (p < 0.0001) becoming comparable with NDC 
(1.9 [1.0–4.9]%, p = 0.99). Change in liver fat correlated 
strongly with change in weight and indices of glucose con-
trol at 12 months (Figure  3). At 24 months, liver fat had 
increased to 6.5 [5.7–7.9]% (p < 0.0001) (Figure 1).
The baseline prevalence of MASLD (defined as above 
the upper limit of normal) was 86.4% (n = 51/59). It was 
similar in those with paired data at both time points 
(83.3%; n = 35/42) and the prevalence of MASLD declined 
to 21.4% (n = 9/42) at 12 months, becoming similar to NDC 
(24.0%; n = 6/25). With weight regain the prevalence of 
MASLD in the type 2 diabetes group rose between 12 and 
24 months to 54.8% (n = 23/42).
Remission of MASLD (liver fat content below the 5.6% 
threshold) was achieved at 12 months in 26 of the 35 peo-
ple with MASLD at baseline (74.3%) or 26 of the total 42 
type 2 diabetes people (61.9%). At 24 months, remission of 
MASLD persisted in 14/35 (40%) or 14/42 (33.3%) of the 
whole group.
2.5 | Liver enzymes
Baseline liver fat in the whole type 2 diabetes group (n = 59) 
correlated positively with ALT (r = 0.45; p = 0.0003) but 
less so with GGT (r = 0.23; p = 0.079).
Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) fell after weight loss 
by 38 [19–60]%: from 30.8 [22.1–38.1] IU/L at baseline to 
15.8 [13.7–20.3] IU/L (p < 0.0001) at 12 months (Table 1). 
At 24 months, ALT had increased from 12- month values 
to 21.6 [17.0–26.0] IU/L but remained significantly lower 
than baseline (p < 0.001). At both 12 and 24 months, ALT 
was not significantly different from NDC (18.5 [15.8–26.5]

IU/L) (p = 0.088 and p = 0.308 respectively). When consid-
ered in relation to degree of weight loss, ALT decreased by 
48 [32–61]% and 23 [14–54]%, in those losing >10 kg and 
<10 kg respectively at 12 months.
Gamma glutamyl transferase (GGT) decreased 38 
[16–53]% from 35.0 [24.5–51.5] IU/L to 22.0 [16.3–29.5] 
IU/L ((p < 0.0001) at 12 months; Table  1) and remained 
steady to 24 months (24.0 [18.0–33.5] IU/L; p < 0·0001 vs. 
baseline). It became close to that of the NDC group (19.5 
[15.8–41.8] IU/L) at 12 months (p = 0.674) and 24 months 
(p = 0.566). GGT fell by 52.0 [33.1–63.5] % (p < 0.0001) and 
28.7 [12.3–37.2] % (p = 0.003) respectively with weight 
losses of >10 kg and <10 kg at 12 months.
Aspartate aminotransferase ( AST) decreased between 
baseline and 12 months by 20.1 [3.8–39.0]% from 19.3 [15.4–
25.1] IU/L to 16.4 [13.7–18.7] IU/L (p < 0.0001). It then re-
mained steady at 24 months (17.9 [15.2–19.3] IU/L; p = 0.003 
vs. baseline). AST fell by 22.8 [12.7–35.9]% at 12 months in 
the >10 kg weight loss subgroup (p  < 0.0001) and by 11.9 
[−10.5–39.1]% in those who lost <10 kg (p = 0.050).
In the whole group of participants with and without 
type 2 diabetes at baseline, liver fat correlated with ALT 
(r = 0.57; p < 0.0001) and with GGT (r = 0.42; p < 0.0001) 
(Figure  2). Between baseline and 12 months, there were 
positive correlations between changes in liver fat and ALT 
(r = 0.64; p < 0.0001), GGT (r = 0.38; p = 0.013) and AST 
(r = 0.36; p = 0.018) (Figure 3a–c).
ANOVA was performed to examine the interactions 
between variables potentially affecting change in liver 
fat post intervention (changes in weight, BMI, ALT, 
AST, GGT, lipid oxidation, total plasma cholesterol, total 
plasma triglycerides). With liver fat as the dependent 
variable, there were associations only with fall in weight 
(p = 0.001), BMI (p < 0.001) and ALT (p = 0.001).
2.6 | Indices of hepatic steatosis and 
hepatic fibrosis
The hepatic steatosis index decreased from 43.2 ± 0.8 
at baseline to 39.7 ± 0.8 at 12 months (p < 0.0001) and 
remained steady at 24 months (40.2 ± 0.8). Change in 
weight correlated with change in hepatic steatosis index 
at 12 months (r = 0.65; p < 0.0001) as well as with absolute 
weight (r = 0.58; p < 0.0001), BMI (r = 0.91; p < 0.0001) and 
liver fat (r = 0.47; p = 0.002) (Figure  4), fatty liver index 
(r = 0.56, p = 0.001).
The BARD score of fibrosis was not changed at 
12 months (2.7 ± 0.2 vs. 2.8 ± 0.2 at baseline, p = 0.800) but 
had improved at 24 months (2.4 ± 0.2; p = 0.041) compared 
both with baseline and 12 months values (p = 0.032).
2.7 | Predictors of change in liver fat 
content
In the whole type 2 diabetes group, decreases in ALT and 
GGT after dietary intervention at 12 months had positive 
predictive value (PPV) for normalisation of liver fat con-
tent of 75.0% and 90.0% respectively.
Threshold effects of the scores were investigated. For 
those with a baseline ALT of >40 IU/L, PPV for normal-
isation of liver fat content after dietary intervention at 
12 months was 100% with NPV of 33.3%. With levels 
>25 IU/L at baseline, PPV was 91.7% with NPV of 16.7% 
(Table 2). For GGT the optimal threshold for detecting the 
normalisation of liver fat content after dietary interven-
tion at 12 months was >35 IU/L at baseline resulting in a 
PPV of 92.3%.
PPV for the change in hepatic steatosis index (HSI) de-
tecting the normalisation of liver fat at 12 months for the 
whole type 2 diabetes group was 93.3%.

3 | DISCUSSION
These data on people with type 2 diabetes and BMI 
>27 kg/m2 (mean BMI 34.9 kg/m2) at baseline demon-
strate that sequential measurement of individual liver 
enzymes allowed prediction of normalisation of liver fat 
levels with mean weight loss 11.9 kg at 12 months or 74% 
of those with MASLD at baseline. If baseline ALT was 
raised >40 IU/L, normalisation at 12 months after weight 
loss had a positive predictive value of 100%. The positive 
predictive value for normalisation of liver fat post weight 
loss was 75% and 90% for ALT and GGT respectively, 
although only change in ALT was independently asso-
ciated with change in liver fat on multivariate analysis 
in conjunction with a fall in weight and BMI. ALT also 
had the strongest correlation with weight change of all 
markers tested. Use of these widely available tests per-
mit diagnosis of remission of MASLD in routine clinical 
practice. Calculation of the hepatic steatosis index did 
not provide additional benefit.
Liver function tests have a wide variability in appar-
ently healthy people under many metabolic and environ-
mental influences but remain fairly constant within any 
individual. They rise when there is any injury to liver

tissue, and intrahepatic fat is such a causative factor in 
part via local, low- grade inflammation. Fatty liver is a key 
element in the aetiology of type 2 diabetes 3,4 but difficult 
to assess in primary care. Neither ALT nor GGT have high 
reliability individually as point estimates to confirm or 
exclude the presence of MASLD 9,18 but in type 2 diabetes 
cohorts, 57% have at least one and 27% have two or more 
abnormal LFT tests.19 Elevated GGT is well recognised to 
be associated with type 2 diabetes, as well as being sensi-
tive to excess alcohol intake, and a predictor of fibrosis/
cirrhosis.20 Compared with type 1 diabetes, people with 
type 2 diabetes exhibit a higher prevalence of elevated 
ALT (22.9 vs. 5.3%, p < 0.01) and GGT (23.7 vs. 10.5%, 
p < 0.01).21 This is consistent with observations from a 
four- country study of detected MASLD in which the one 
which uses more imaging for MASLD diagnosis reports 
the highest prevalence of MASLD.22 However, the clinical 
importance of the present study lies in demonstration of 
the clinical utility of sequential decrease in simple liver 
enzymes to assess change in hepatic steatosis, reflecting 
the reverse of the sequential increase seen during over-
feeding studies. 23,24 These changes are reflected in the 
5- year follow- up data from DiRECT.25 Full clinical assess-
ment involves measurement of plasma triglyceride and 
HbA1c levels which, as noted above, decline in step with 
falling liver fat levels, further supporting a reduction in 
ectopic fat as we have previously argued.10
Achieving a complete return to normal of liver fat con-
tent by many participants after weight loss underscores 
the relationship of MASLD with overnutrition in suscep-
tible individuals, particularly those who exhibit prediabe-
tes or type 2 diabetes. 19,24 The clinical utility of tracking 
the return to normal using liver function tests or derived 
indices is relevant not only to monitoring liver health 
during remission of type 2 diabetes but also to the wider 
management of people with presumed or proven MASLD. 
The Hepatic Steatosis Index (HSI) 13 is also imprecise for 
diagnosis of MASLD as a point estimate, but like plasma 
liver enzymes can be used for sequential demonstration 
of change after weight loss, especially when baseline lev-
els are raised. However, it requires a calculation, is time 
consuming in clinical practice, and fails to offer superior 
predictive power over sequential plasma ALT levels.
Importantly, in diagnosed MASLD, with or without 
type 2 diabetes, many individuals have ALT and GGT lev-
els in elevated or the ‘high- normal’ range.9 The upper level 
of ALT which may be regarded as ‘normal’ is open to ques-
tion as the thresholds are based upon the values found in 
general populations which include many individuals who 
are overweight, possibly with prediabetes, and who have 
undiagnosed fatty liver disease. These findings are in line 
with ALT levels seen in participants with NAFLD in a re-
cent European wide study of the prevalence of the diag-
nosed MASLD. 26 Derivation of a truly normal range for 
ALT and GGT based on a population shown not to have 
MASLD would allow reassessment of the value of point 
measurements of these enzymes for diagnosis of MASLD.

The proportion achieving remission of diabetes, and of 
MASLD, induced by dietary weight loss of 10–15 kg is like 
that seen with very large weight losses post- bariatric surgery. 
Up to 85% of those losing 25% of their initial body weight 
had remission of MASLD 1- year post- surgery.27 A weight 
loss of 13.5% after either bariatric surgery or dietary induced 
weight loss achieves a maximum decrease in liver fat.28 This 
was confirmed in a meta- analysis of bariatric surgery stud-
ies,29 with remission of diabetes of around 83% at 2 years 
after bariatric surgery with weight losses up to 35%. It was 
similar (83% at 2 years) after non- surgical weight loss >10 kg 
in DiRECT.7 Importantly, reversal of hepatic fibrosis has 
been detected using transient elastography after bariatric 
surgery.30 In the present study, the observation of decrease 
of the BARD score at 2 years is notable, suggesting potential 
improvement in this serious condition after dietary weight 
loss. Further research to evaluate this finding is warranted.
Limitations of the present study must be considered. 
The intensive diet intervention and real- time primary 
care- based setting of DiRECT precluded liver biopsies to 
confirm a relationship with hepatocyte ballooning, liver 
inflammation or fibrosis. 31 LFTs were not measured in 
all participants immediately after the 3–5- month weight 
loss period, when maximum weight change occurred. 
However, at 12 months when weight was relatively sta-
ble after some early regain, there was a clear correla-
tion between extent of weight loss and decrease in liver 
fat from baseline. The participants on DiRECT reflected 
the populations studied (typical white European ethnic-
ity with mean BMI 34.9 kg/m2) but it cannot be assumed 
that plasma liver enzymes will have the same relationship 
in people of differing ethnicity. In DiRECT, known alco-
hol or other substance abuse was an exclusion although 
we cannot rule out undeclared prior high consumption. 
However, we observed the strongest relationships for 
ALT rather than GGT which would be expected to change 
more with fall in alcohol consumption.
In summary, following weight loss, decreases in ALT, 
GGT and hepatic steatosis index have a high positive pre-
dictive value for normalisation of liver fat content when 
baseline levels are raised. In day- to- day clinical practice, 
sequential monitoring of liver enzymes following inten-
tional weight loss can provide a simple means of demon-
strating reduction in liver fat.
