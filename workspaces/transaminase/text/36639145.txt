Aim: Serum microRNA-122 (miR-122) is a novel biomarker for drug-induced liver
injury, with good sensitivity in the early diagnosis of paracetamol-induced liver injury.
We describe miR-122 concentrations in participants with antituberculosis drug-
induced liver injury (AT-DILI). We explored the relationship between miR-122 and
alanine aminotransferase (ALT) concentrations and the effect of N-acetylcysteine
(NAC) on miR-122 concentrations.
Methods: We included participants from a randomized placebo-controlled trial of
intravenous NAC in AT-DILI. ALT and miR-122 concentrations were quantified
before and after infusion of NAC/placebo. We assessed correlations between ALT
and miR-122 concentrations and described changes in ALT and miR-122 concentra-
tions between sampling occasions.
Results: We included 45 participants; mean age (± standard deviation) 38 (±10) years,
58% female and 91% HIV positive. The median (interquartile range) time between
pre- and post-infusion biomarker specimens was 68 h (47-77 h). The median
pre-infusion ALT and miR-122 concentrations were 420 U/L (238-580) and 0.58 pM
(0.18-1.47), respectively. Pre-infusion ALT and miR-122 concentrations were
correlated (Spearman's ρ = .54, P = .0001). Median fold-changes in ALT and miR-
122 concentrations between sampling were 0.56 (0.43-0.69) and 0.75 (0.23-1.53),
respectively, and were similar in the NAC and placebo groups (P = .40 and P = .68
respectively).
Conclusions: miR-122 concentrations in our participants with AT-DILI were consider-
ably higher than previously reported in healthy volunteers and in patients on
antituberculosis therapy without liver injury. We did not detect an effect of NAC on
miR-122 concentrations. Further research is needed to determine the utility of
miR-122 in the diagnosis and management of AT-DILI.

1 | INTRODUCTION
Drug-induced liver injury (DILI) is the most frequent severe adverse
effect of first-line antituberculosis therapy. 1 Antituberculosis
drug-induced liver injury (AT-DILI) is primarily diagnosed by elevated
serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) concentrations, together with
symptoms and signs of DILI. 2 However, ALT is not a specific
biomarker of DILI because it may be released from tissues other than
the liver (eg, skeletal muscle, kidney and heart).
3 More specific
biomarkers of DILI are therefore potentially important.
MicroRNAs are small, single-stranded RNAs that regulate gene
expression at a post-transcriptional level. 4 MicroRNAs can be
detected in blood as stable complexes and quantified using
quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR).5 Liver
injury due to drug exposure, viral hepatitis or hepatocellular carcinoma
has been shown to result in altered microRNA expression profiles.6–9
MicroRNA-122 (miR-122) accounts for 70% of hepatic microRNA10
and plays an essential role in lipid metabolism, anti-inflammatory and
antitumorigenic mechanisms.11 miR-122 has been explored as a novel
biomarker of paracetamol-induced liver injury in pre-clinical12,13 and
clinical studies.9,14–17 In paracetamol-induced liver injury, an increase
in miR-122 concentrations occurred earlier than an increase in ALT
concentrations and was a sensitive test for identifying those patients
who went on to develop liver injury.12,18 Peak increases in serum
miR-122 concentrations correlated with later increases in serum
ALT.13,14,19 miR-122 concentrations have also been found to be
elevated in patients with nonparacetamol DILI.20,21 miR-122 is largely
liver-specific and therefore concentrations are unaltered by impaired
renal function15 and muscle injury.17
There are limited data on miR-122 as a biomarker of AT-DILI. For
this study, we quantified miR-122 concentrations in stored specimens
from a randomized placebo-controlled trial of N-acetylcysteine (NAC)
for treatment of AT-DILI. We found that NAC administration
shortened the duration of hospitalization, but time for ALT to fall
below 100 U/L was similar for NAC and placebo groups.
22
Our aims for this analysis were to describe miR-122 concentra-
tions in AT-DILI, to assess correlations between ALT and miR-122
concentrations, to describe changes in miR-122 concentrations over
time and to determine if repeat miR-122 quantification would be
more informative than ALT in detecting a biochemical response to
NAC administration.
2 | METHODS
2.1 | Study participants
Participants were drawn from a previously reported22 randomized
placebo-controlled trial (RCT) of NAC in the management of AT-DILI
conducted in Cape Town, South Africa. NAC was dosed intrave-
nously according to the regimen for paracetamol overdose: 150 mg/
kg over 1 h, 50 mg/kg over 4 h and 100 mg/kg over 16 h. The study
was a pragmatic randomized trial nested within routine clinical care
at the participating hospitals. The study protocol specified that
participants' ALTs be tested before the study infusion and twice
weekly during hospital follow-up. These ALT samples were generally
taken by the hospital clinical care team. In addition to the monitor-
ing of ALT concentrations for the clinical study, investigators
collected blood samples for storage for future biomarker research.
For this analysis, we included the subset of participants from the
RCT with paired specimens stored for biomarker quantification: the
first specimen taken between 24 h before and 30 min after
What is already know about this subject?
• Serum microRNA (miR)-122 is a sensitive biomarker for
early detection of paracetamol-induced liver injury.
• Serum miR-122 concentrations increase slightly in
participants taking antituberculosis treatment without
liver injury.
• Serum miR-122 concentrations increased markedly in
participants with antituberculosis drug-induced liver
injury (AT-DILI) in one study but decreased in another.
• In a randomized controlled trial of intravenous N-acetyl-
cysteine (NAC) in participants with AT-DILI, NAC did not
hasten the decline of alanine aminotransferase (ALT)
concentrations. The effect of N-acetylcysteine on
miR-122 concentrations in this setting has not previously
been studied.
What this study adds?
• In our cohort drawn from a randomized controlled trial of
intravenous NAC in participants with AT-DILI, miR-122
concentrations were markedly higher than those seen in
healthy volunteers and in patients on antituberculosis
treatment without liver injury.
• We did not detect an effect of NAC on the change in
miR-122 concentrations observed during the first week
after infusion of NAC/placebo.
• We found high intra-individual and inter-individual
variability in serum microRNA-122 concentrations
following AT-DILI.

commencement of the study infusion and the second specimen
taken within 7 days after initiation of the study infusion. Blood was
centrifuged within 8 h of collection, and serum was stored at
/C080
/C14C. We compared baseline characteristics of the participants
with paired samples, and study participants not included in this
analysis to confirm that they were similar.
2.2 | ALT quantification
ALT was quantified in stored serum using an International Federation
of Clinical Chemistry recommended method. ALT and miR-122
concentrations were determined from the same sample in each case,
except for two pre-infusion samples which were unsuitable for ALT
determination; in those two cases, we used the ALT concentration
from clinical records from an assay performed on the same day of the
infusion. Both of these ALTs were from the samples taken within 3 h
of the sample used for miR-122 determination.
2.3 | MicroRNA isolation from serum
For recovery of miRNA-enriched fractions from serum, the miRNeasy
Mini Kit and the RNeasy MinElute Cleanup Kit (Qiagen, Venlo,
Netherlands) were used on the QIAcube automated platform
(Qiagen), following manufacturer's instructions with an addition of
200 pM cel-lin-4 (cat. 4464066, ID MC10768; Ambion, Thermo Fisher
Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) as a spiked-in exogenous nonhuman
miRNA to monitor for the efficiency of the miRNA extraction
process. Freshly isolated miRNA-containing eluate (15μL) was stored
at /C080
/C14C.
2.4 | Reverse transcriptase and RT-qPCR reactions
TaqMan miRNA Assays for miR-122 (Assay ID 002245) and cel-lin-4
(Assay ID 000258; Thermo Fisher Scientific) were used to perform
real-time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR). miRNA-containing eluate was
reverse-transcribed using the TaqMan MicroRNA Reverse Transcrip-
tion Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) and a custom
Multiplex RT Primer pool in a GeneAmp 9700 PCR System (Applied
Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA). A fixed volume of 2μL miRNA-
containing eluate was added to an RT Master Mix containing dNTPs,
RNase Inhibitor, Reverse Transcription Buffer, 75 units per reaction of
MultiScribe Reverse Transcriptase and a multiplex RT primer pool
consisting of primers for miR-122 and cel-lin-4 (Thermo Fisher Scien-
tific). A 1 nM synthetic miR-122 (mirVana miRNA mimic, Assay ID
MC11012; Ambion) was reverse-transcribed together with the
samples to allow the generation of a standard curve in each plate.
No-template samples were included as negative controls. Reaction
conditions followed the manufacturer's instructions: annealing for
30 min at 16
/C14C, followed by cDNA synthesis for 30 min at 42/C14C and
denaturation for 5 min at 85/C14C. The resulting cDNA was diluted 1:3
with RNase-free water and stored at/C020/C14C until further processing.
Pre-amplification of cDNA was run on a GeneAmp 9700 PCR
System (Applied Biosystems). Negative controls containing RNase-
free water instead of cDNA were included. Reaction conditions
followed the manufacturer's instructions: 95/C14C for 10 min, 55/C14C for
2 min, 72/C14C for 2 min, followed by 12 cycles at 95/C14C for 15 s and
60/C14C for 4 min followed by enzyme inactivation at 99.9/C14C for 10 min.
The pre-amplified synthetic miR-122 was serially diluted 1:10 (ranging
from 1 nM to 0.1 fM) and stored at/C020
/C14C.
Two microlitres of the diluted pre-amplification product
was combined with a qPCR Master Mix containing 5μL of 2x TaqMan
Universal MasterMix II without Uracil-N glycosylase (Thermo Fisher
Scientific) in a total reaction volume of 10μL. RT-qPCR was then
performed in duplicates on an ABI ViiA 7 Thermocycler (Applied
Biosystems) using a two-step thermal cycling protocol of 95
/C14C for
10 min followed by 40 cycles of 95/C14C (15 s) and 60/C14C (60 s) for both
miR-122 and cel-lin-4. Data were analysed using QuantStudio
Real-Time PCR Software v1.3. The number of copies of miR-122 in
each sample was quantified using the absolute quantification method
with the standard curve generated with synthetic miR-122 in each
plate. miR-122 levels were normalized to the level of cel-lin-4 to
account for technical variations between samples. Then, 10%
duplicates (including samples run in a separate plate) were added to
each run to account for intra- and inter-plate variability, and final
miR-122 copy numbers were averaged across experiments (intra- and
inter-assay coefficient of variation (CV) less than 5% and 10%,
respectively).
2.5 | Statistical analysis
Data were analysed using Stata SE Version 13.1 (Statacorp, College
Station, TX, USA) and Microsoft Excel. We compared numerical data
with a normal distribution using the Student's t-test, non-normally
distributed data using the Wilcoxon rank sum test and categorical
data using the Fisher's exact test. We calculated the Spearman's rank
correlation coefficient (ρ) to assess correlation between ALT and
miR-122 concentrations. We calculated the CV for ALT and miR-122
concentrations pre- and post-study infusion. We log transformed ALT
and miR-122 concentrations for parametric comparative analyses. To
explore change in miR-122 and ALT concentration between samples,
we calculated the ratio of post-infusion to pre-infusion concentration
and performed a Student's t-test on logged ratios to look for
differences between groups. To determine the average change in ALT
and miR-122 concentrations per day, we calculated the slope
between the concentration before and the concentration after study
infusion. A P value of <.05 was considered to be statistically
significant throughout.
2.6 | Ethics
The study protocol was approved by University of Cape Town Human
Research Ethics Committee (HREC 087/2012 and HREC 421/2017)
and the Western Cape Department of Health. Participants provided
written informed consent. The trial was registered with the
South African National Clinical Trials Registry (SANCTR: DOH-
27-0414-4719) and
clinicaltrials.gov (NCT02182167).

3 | RESULTS
3.1 | Participant characteristics
We included 45 of the 102 NAC randomized controlled trial
participants from whom paired biomarker specimens had been
collected within the specified time windows, 26 of these were from
the NAC and 19 were from the placebo group (see Supporting
Information Figure S1). Baseline characteristics of the 45 included
participants did not differ significantly from the 57 participants
without paired specimens (see Supporting Information Table S1). Four
of the 45 participants with paired specimens died during study follow-
up (two in the NAC group and two in the placebo group)vs 10/57
participants without paired specimens (Fisher's exactP = .255).
Participant characteristics were similar between the NAC and
placebo groups in those participants with biomarker samples (Table
1).
The mean age was 38 years ± standard deviation (SD) 10, 58% were
female and 91% were HIV positive. We had self-reported ethnicity
data on 31 participants, of whom 27 (87%) self-identified as Black
African.
3.2 | Time intervals between AT-DILI presentation,
biomarker sampling and study infusion
The median time from presentation with AT-DILI to collection of the
pre-infusion sample was 2.7 days (interquartile range [IQR]
1.5-4.1 days). This first sample was taken at a median of 0.6 h (IQR
0.2-11 h) before study infusion commenced, and the second sample
was taken at a median of 50 h (IQR 26-73 h) after commencement of
study infusion. The median time interval between paired specimens
was 68 h (IQR 47-77 h) and was similar between the NAC and
placebo groups (Wilcoxon rank sum testP = .08).
3.3 | ALT and miR-122 concentrations before
study infusion
The ALT and miR-122 concentrations and CVs are summarized in
Table 1. The median ALT concentration before intravenous
NAC/placebo infusion was 420 U/L (IQR 238-580 U/L) and the
median miR-122 concentration was 0.58 pM (IQR 0.18-1.47 pM)
(Figure
1). miR-122 and ALT concentrations before study infusion
were correlated (Spearman's ρ = .54, P = .0001); Figure 2. The
median cycle threshold (Ct) pre-infusion was 23.1 (IQR 20.8-24.7).
3.4 | ALT and miR-122 concentrations after study
infusion
Post-infusion ALT and miR-122 concentrations were similar in the
NAC and placebo groups (see Table 1 and Figure 1).Post-infusion
miR-122 concentrations were correlated with ALT concentrations in
both the NAC and placebo groups (Spearman'sρ = .42, P = .031 and
Spearman's ρ = .53, P = .020, respectively) and when participants
from both groups were analysed together (Spearman's ρ = .45,
P = .002) (Figure
2).The median Ct post-infusion was 23.7 (IQR
22.0-24.7).

3.5 | Change in ALT and miR-122 concentrations
ALT concentrations decreased between samples in 43 (96%)
participants. In contrast, the magnitude and direction of change in
miR-122 concentrations varied substantially between participants,
and miR-122 concentrations increased in 16 (36%) participants
(10/26 in NAC group and 6/19 in placebo group) (Figure
3).
The median fold-change in ALT concentrations between samples
was 0.56 overall (IQR 0.43-0.69) and was similar in the NAC and
placebo groups: median 0.55 (0.39-0.78) and 0.60 (0.46-0.69),
respectively (Wilcoxon rank sum testP = .40) (Supporting Information
Figure S2). The median fold change in miR-122 concentrations was
0.75 (IQR 0.23-1.53) overall and was similar in the NAC and placebo
groups; median 0.78 (IQR 0.23-1.53) and 0.54 (IQR 0.20-1.62),

respectively (Wilcoxon rank sum testP = .68) (Supporting Information
Figure S2; note that fold change value greater than 1 corresponds to
an increase).
3.6 | Change in ALT and miR-122 concentrations
per day
ALT concentrations changed a median of 0.79-fold per day (IQR
0.75-0.83-fold) between the two biomarker samples. miR-122
concentrations changed a median of 0.89-fold per day (IQR
0.49-1.17-fold) between the two biomarker samples.
4 | DISCUSSION
The miR-122 concentrations observed in our participants with
AT-DILI were much higher than those previously observed in healthy
volunteers20 or participants on antituberculosis therapy without
DILI.23 We found that serum ALT and miR-122 concentrations were
correlated at both sampling occasions in participants with AT-DILI.
ALT concentrations declined in almost all participants at the post-
infusion sampling occasion. In contrast, changes in miR-122 concen-
trations were more variable, showing an increase in over a third of
participants. The fold change in miR-122 concentrations between
samples did not differ between NAC and placebo arms.
The median miR-122 concentration before study infusion in our
cohort was 0.58 pM, which is 10 times higher than the upper limit of
normal (ULN) of the reference range for healthy volunteers derived
from the European Safer and Faster Evidence based Translation
(SAFE-T) cohort, and 20 times the ULN from the Critical Path
Institute's Predictive Safety Testing Consortium (PSTC) in the
United States.
20 Only two of our participants had concentrations
below the ULN derived from the SAFE-T cohort, and none were
below the PSTC ULN.
In the ALISTER study cohort in Scotland, participants starting
antituberculosis therapy without liver injury had similar miR-122
concentrations to healthy volunteers. miR-122 concentrations
increased slightly after starting antituberculosis therapy but remained
considerably lower (median 0.004 pM) than the miR-122 concentra-
tions observed in our participants with AT-DILI.
23
There are limited data on miR-122 concentrations in patients with
AT-DILI. Two participants in the ALISTER cohort developed DILI with
ALTs of 431 and 194 U/L, and miR-122 concentrations of 0.06 and
0.34 pM, respectively. In both these participants, miR-122 concentra-
tions increased considerably from baseline, by 15- and 20-fold,
respectively. A recent Indian study by Bakshi et al found miR-122
expression to be 75% lower in participants with AT-DILI compared to
healthy controls,
24 but miR-122 was only sampled at enrolment and
participants had less severe DILI than in our study, with a median ALT
of 120 U/L. Despite these differences, the reason for the conflicting
results is unclear and requires further exploration.
miR-122 concentrations varied widely between participants in
our study, as did the intra-individual change in miR-122 between
sampling occasions. In the absence of other clinical evidence, it is
unclear whether these changes in miR-122 concentrations indicate
worsening or improvement of the liver injury or merely reflect high
intra- and inter-individual variability. In the PSTC healthy volunteer
cohort who were sampled repeatedly over 3 weeks, both inter-subject
and intra-subject coefficients of variation for miR-122 were high, at
91% and 94%, respectively.
20 Intra-individual variability was particu-
larly high in Black participants.20 A North American healthy volunteer

MOOSA ET AL. 1849

cohort also found high intra- and inter-donor variability in miR-122
expression, particularly in participants who identified as
non-Caucasian.
25 Inter-individual variability poses challenges to
defining cut-offs for abnormal elevation of miR-122. Intra-individual
variability complicates interpretation of changes observed in miR-122
concentration over time. Inter-individual and intra-individual variabil-
ity may therefore limit utility of miR-122 as a biomarker in diagnosing
AT-DILI and monitoring AT-DILI progression or recovery.
We observed an increase in miR-122 concentrations between the
two sampling occasions in a third of our study participants. The hepa-
tocellular injury in AT-DILI
26 may be more sustained than injury due
to oxidative stress injury in paracetamol overdose, and miR-122 may
therefore decline more slowly in AT-DILI. Even among studies of
paracetamol-induced hepatotoxicity, there are some that describe
increased miR-122 concentrations from 3 to 14 days after DILI
onset.
15,17
Our study has limitations. We only included RCT participants with
two biomarker samples (approximately half of the cohort), which may
have introduced selection bias. However, baseline characteristics and
liver biochemistry did not differ substantially between those RCT par-
ticipants included in this study and those not included. HIV prevalence
was high in our cohort and therefore our findings may not be general-
izable to other populations with lower HIV prevalence. We only quan-
tified miR-122 at two time points. We did not have a control group
without AT-DILI drawn from the same population to allow for com-
parison. Different quantification and normalization methods used in
different studies may influence comparisons between our results and
results from other studies.
5 | CONCLUSION
miR-122 concentrations were markedly higher in our cohort of
AT-DILI than previously observed in healthy controls and in
participants on antituberculosis therapy without liver injury. miR-122
may therefore be a useful biomarker to diagnose AT-DILI in this pop-
ulation. However, high intra-individual and inter-individual variability
in miR-122 concentrations may limit its utility. To characterize miR-
122 concentrations prior to liver injury onset and in early AT-DILI, a
large prospective cohort study collecting repeated samples for bio-
marker quantification from patients on antituberculosis therapy, with
frequent clinical review, would be required because AT-DILI occurs
in a small subset of patients on antituberculosis therapy. Further
larger studies monitoring miR-122 over the full course of recovery
from AT-DILI are required to characterize changes in this biomarker
over time, and associations between concentrations observed
and outcomes.
