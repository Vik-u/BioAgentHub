Abstract: The combination of biocatalysis and chemo-
catalysis can be more powerful than either technique alone.
However, combining the two is challenging due to typically
very different reaction conditions. Herein, chiral N-aryl
amines, key features of many active pharmaceutical ingre-
dients, are accessed in excellent enantioselectivity (typi-
cally > 99.5 % ee) by combining transaminases with the
Buchwald-Hartwig amination. By employing a bi-phasic
buffer-toluene system as well as the ligand GPhos, the
telescoped cascade proceeded with up to 89 % overall
conversion in the presence of excess alanine. No coupling
to alanine was observed.
Biocatalysis is a powerful tool in the synthesis of fine
chemicals;
[1]
in particular, enzymes can achieve excellent
enantioselectivities, which is highly relevant for the pharma-
ceutical industry.
[2]
In synthesis routes, telescoping several
reaction steps is often desirable as it reduces waste, material
loss, and saves time by avoiding purification steps.
[3]
However,
combining chemical and enzymatic steps poses several key
challenges, specifically in the compatibility of the reaction
environments.
[4]
Either the enzyme has to tolerate the con-
ditions required by the chemical reaction (organic solvents,
reagents such as heavy metals, high temperatures, high or low
pH, etc.) or the chemical step has to be compatible with the
environment required by the enzyme (aqueous medium, buffer
salts, cofactors, mild temperature, mild pH, etc.). Additionally,
biotransformations typically employ much more diluted con-
ditions than chemical transformations. These challenges not-
withstanding, there are several examples in the literature of
such chemo-enzymatic cascades which overcome some of
these drawbacks by separating the reactions in time (e. g. one-
pot two-step) or space (e. g. membrane reactors).
[4–8]
Transaminases (TAs) are highly applicable to the synthesis
of primary amines and can access either enantiomer depending
on the enzyme used.
[9]
However, active pharmaceutical ingre-
dients (APIs) frequently contain secondary or tertiary amines,
often with N-aryl groups (Figure 1). While secondary and tertiary
amines can be synthesised biocatalytically via the reductive
amination of ketones with aliphatic amines using imine
reductases (IREDs), this approach is more challenging when
employing anilines and only a few examples with limited
substrate scope have been reported.
[10,11]
Chemo-catalysed
asymmetric reductive aminations often require undesirable
reaction conditions, such as anhydrous organic solvents, high
pressure, and high temperatures, and often result in lower
enantiomeric excess than can be achieved biocatalytically.
[12–14]
Thus, an attractive strategy in the synthesis of chiral N-
arylamines is the combination of biocatalysis with subsequent
arylation of the amine intermediate, employing the Pd-
catalysed Buchwald-Hartwig amination (BHA). In 2020, the
Turner group have reported for the first time the combination
of amine dehydrogenases (AmDH) and IREDs with a BHA
(Scheme 1A);
[15]
however, they were unsuccessful in combining
the BHA with TAs, as the presence of excess amine donor that

is required for the TA step interfered with the BHA in their
system. Compared to TAs, AmDHs typically have a narrower
substrate scope
[16]
and strong product inhibition
[17]
and the IRED
system could only be applied to preformed cyclic imines.
Currently, the only example of combining TAs with Pd-catalysis
in a one-pot system is from the Bornscheuer group who
accessed α-biarylamines by employing a Suzuki cross-coupling
followed by transamination (Scheme 1B).
[18]
Herein, the TA-BHA
mediated synthesis of chiral N-arylamines with excellent
enantioselectivity and good to excellent conversions is re-
ported, employing the crude biotransformation mixture in the
BHA without the need for removal of excess alanine (Sche-
me 1C).
Initially, two ligands, tBuXPhos and tBuBrettPhos, that had
been reported to enable BHAs in water were investigated
(Figure 2).
[19]
For convenience, a biphasic system
[20]
(employing
the aqueous biotransformation and toluene) was chosen and
the preformed Pd-complex, a third-generation Buchwald pre-
catalyst, was added directly (Figure 2). Initial optimization was
carried out using benzaldehyde as a model starting material,
which is efficiently converted to benzylamine when using the
(R)-selective transaminase from Thermomyces stellatus (TsRTA)
[21]
with d-alanine (5 equiv.) as the donor and employing an LDH/
GDH pyruvate removal system to shift the equilibrium
(Scheme 2). The results of the optimization are shown in
Table 1. Crucially, the BHA required additional equivalents of
base compared to standard conditions (entries 3–6), as some of
Scheme 1. A: Chiral amines are produced from prochiral ketones using an
AmDH (top) or a cyclic imine using an IRED (bottom), which are then
arylated using a palladium catalyst to give chiral N-arylamines.
[15]
B: Suzuki
cross-coupling to produce bi-aryl ketones which are then aminated using a
transaminase biocatalyst.
[18]
C: Chiral amines are produced from pro-chiral
ketones using a TA with alanine as the amine donor and arylated in the
presence of excess alanine to give chiral N-arylamines, enabled by the ligand
GPhos. This reaction could be carried out using a higher substrate loading
than in the previous examples.

the base is consumed in an acid-base reaction with the
protonated amines present in the biotransformation mixture (at
pH 8). Sodium t-butoxide was chosen based on Wagner et al.
[19]
While essentially complete conversion to the N-arylamine was
achieved when using 10 mol% of tBuBrettphos-Pd-G3 (entry 3),
using 5 mol% of the cheaper tBuXPhos-Pd-G3 still reached
almost 80 % conversion (entry 7).
To improve the synthetic potential, reactions were scaled
up to a 0.5 mmol scale, by increasing the volume of the
biotransformation 5-fold. Conversions dropped compared to
the 0.1 mmol scale but could be improved by decreasing the
ratio of toluene to the aqueous biotransformation (1 : 5 v/v)
(Table 1 entries 8 and 9). Conversions were approximately 10 %
higher when precipitated protein was removed from the
biotransformation by centrifugation prior to the BHA (Table 1
entry 10). These conditions were then taken forward for the
synthesis of chiral N-arylamines. At no point coupling to alanine
was observed. Alanine, presumably, exclusively acts as a poison
of the catalyst rather than as a substrate.
[15,22]
Partitioning of the
alanine to the aqueous phase and the catalyst to the organic
phase sufficiently slows this inactivation, allowing the reaction
to occur (using the surfactant TPGS-750-M in preliminary
experiments showed lower conversions in the presence of one
equivalent of alanine when compared to the bi-phasic system;
data not shown).
Moving from benzaldehyde to the structurally similar o-
fluoroacetophenone (1 b) conversions in the BHA step were
reduced significantly (Scheme 3). This is due to the increased
steric hinderance of the secondary α-carbon, which was
confirmed indirectly when biotransformations employing the
amine donor isopropylamine (IPA) were investigated. Here,
selective arylation of benzylamine in the presence of excess IPA
was observed, consistent with a faster reaction of the α-primary
amine. However, this selectivity disappeared when moving to
the α-secondary 2 b (see Scheme S1). Pd-black formation was
observed in all reactions containing alanine (as well as in the
reactions with benzaldehyde), indicating a lack of stability of
the catalyst under these conditions. This Pd-black is expected to
be catalytically inactive.
[23]
At this point in the investigation the Buchwald group
reported a new ligand, GPhos, which is derived from BrettPhos
(Figure 2).
[24]
Crucially, it lacks the 4’-iPr group which enhances
the amine substrate scope to α-tertiary amines (in organic
solvent). Given the similarity to tBuBrettPhos, it was decided to
investigate whether GPhos could overcome the decreased
performance with α-secondary amines in the current aqueous
system as well, by accelerating the coupling reaction relative to
the catalyst inactivation in the presence of alanine. Pleasingly,
conversions improved to 74 % with the new ligand (Scheme 4).
Good conversions were also obtained starting from the aliphatic
ketones phenoxy-acetone (1 c) and hexan-2-one (1 d), while 2-
acetylthiazol (1 e) resulted in low conversions in the BHA.
Starting from all four pro-chiral ketones, TsRTA exclusively
produced the (R)-enantiomer of the corresponding amine. This
stereochemistry was retained after the BHA, except for 3 e,
which showed reduced ee of 51 %, indicating partial racemisa-

tion of the stereocentre, presumably by the Pd-catalyst.
[25]
Varying the aryl bromides employed in the BHA (Scheme 5), the
N-heterocycles pyridine (5 a) and isoquinoline (5 b) (common
features in APIs)
[26]
showed good conversions. Conversions
improved with the electron-poor benzonitrile (5 c), while the
electron rich anisole (5 d) showed low conversions, comple-
menting IRED catalysed reductive aminations with anilines
which so far do not accept electron withdrawing substituents
or pyridines.
[11]
Finally, the catalyst loading was increased to 10 mol% for
the reaction starting from 2 b (Scheme 6), which increased the
overall conversion to 89 %, with the optical purity fully
maintained. In contrast, under otherwise identical conditions,
tBuXPhos and tBuBrettPhos only reached 45 and 54 % overall
conversion, respectively. Product 3 b was isolated in 70 %
isolated yield following silica column chromatography.
In conclusion, the synthesis of chiral N-arylamines in a
sequential transaminase-BHA cascade has been described. By
using the ligand GPhos, up to 89 % overall conversion can be
achieved starting from diverse pro-chiral ketones, without
intermediate purification steps. The current system can tolerate
a large excess of alanine, although the formation of palladium
black, also in the case of GPhos, indicates that the stability of
the Pd-catalyst needs to be further improved; coupling to
alanine is not observed. As it has been reported that tBuXphos
and tBuBrettPhos show superior performance in water com-
pared to their cyclohexyl substituted analogues,

the

current system. The use of different bases as well as co-
solvents
[27]
could also be explored.
While a one-pot two-step reaction was possible, removing
the precipitated protein from the biotransformation in a quick
centrifugation improved conversion. The removal of the soluble
enzymes may further improve the results; however, doing so by
for example ultrafiltration
[8]
would further complicate the
reaction set-up, and eliminate its main advantage which is the
minimal processing that is required prior to the BHA step.
