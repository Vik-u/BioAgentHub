The Ryukyu archipelago is located southwest of the Japanese islands, and people originally from 
this region, the Ryukyu population, have a unique genetic background distinct from that of other 
populations, including people from mainland Japan. However, few genetic studies have focused on 
the Ryukyu population. In this study, we performed genome-wide association studies (GWAS) on 
the serum levels of alanine aminotransferase (AL T, n = 15,224), aspartate aminotransferase (AST, 
n = 15,203), and gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT, n = 14,496) in the Ryukyu population. We found 
13 loci with a genome-wide significant association (P < 5 × 10−8), three for AL T, four for AST, and six for 
GGT, including one novel locus associated with AL T: rs117595134-A in HMMR/HMMR-AS1, ß =  − 0.131, 
standard error = 0.024, P = 4.90 × 10−8. Rs117595134-A is common in the Japanese population but is not 
observed in other ethnic populations in the 1000 genomes database. Additionally, 77 of 80 loci derived 
from Korean GWAS and 541 of 716 loci from European GWAS showed the same directions of effect 
(P = 1.41 × 10−19, P = 2.50 × 10−44, binomial test), indicating that most of susceptibility loci are shared 
between the Ryukyu population and other ethnic populations.

Serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and gamma-glutamyl transferase 
(GGT) levels are widely used in clinical tests to evaluate liver injury or function. The hepatocellular or cholestatic 
injury, caused by various conditions, including hepatitis virus infection, malignancy, autoimmune diseases, 
alcohol intake, obesity, and drugs, leads to the increase of the levels of these serum liver enzymes 1,2. Although 
AST and ALT are abundant in the canalicular membrane of hepatocytes, the enzymes also exist in extrahepatic 
tissues such as cardiac muscle, skeletal muscle, kidney, and brain, especially AST. Therefore, serum AST levels 
are also elevated in individuals with myocardial infarction or myositis. In contrast, because the amount of ALT 
is lower in other tissues, ALT elevation is relatively specific to hepatocellular injury. Elevated serum GGT levels 
usually reflect bile stasis, but serum GGT levels are also elevated during the detoxification of xenobiotics, which 
include alcohol3 or in patients treated with enzyme-inducing anticonvulsant drugs4.
Additionally, several genetic variants have been shown to abolish these enzyme activities and significantly 
affect the results of clinical measurements of liver enzymes 5,6, because the serum levels of these enzymes are

usually determined by measuring their enzyme activities in clinical practice. Therefore, it is expected that the 
serum liver enzyme levels are affected by genetic factors related or unrelated to liver injury5–7.
During the last two decades, genome-wide association studies (GW AS) have been extensively performed 
worldwide, and a substantial number of loci were successfully identified to be associated with common diseases 
and quantitative traits8–10. Large-scale GW AS for serum liver enzyme levels have also been performed, which 
identified 954 loci in European11,12, 521 loci in trans-ancestry13, and 284 loci in Japanese studies10.
The Ryukyu Archipelago is located southwest of the Japanese Islands and comprises dozens of islands. People 
from the Ryukyu Archipelago have been shown to possess unique genetic backgrounds that differ from those 
of the mainland Japan 14–18. However, no GW AS has been conducted specifically on the Ryukyu population. 
Because GW AS using genetically isolated populations identified novel loci with larger effect sizes, even in a 
smaller sample size19,20, GW AS focused on the Ryukyu population is important and necessary to elucidate the 
genetic factors not only specific to the Ryukyu population but also for other populations.
In this study, we conducted a GW AS for serum liver enzyme levels using the Ryukyu population for the first 
time from two independent Japanese study groups: Okinawa Bioinformation Bank (OBi) 16,17,21 and BioBank 
Japan (BBJ)22–24.
Results
Population structure analyses
The overall study design is shown in Supplementary Fig. 1. We analyzed 10,285 individuals registered in the OBi 
using principal component analysis (PCA), along with individuals in the 1KGP phase 3 reference panel (AFR, 
n = 661; AMR, n = 347; EAS, n = 504; EUR, n = 503; SAS, n = 489), and defined 10,136 individuals as the Japanese 
population (Supplementary Fig.  2b). Subsequent PCA combined with uniform manifold approximation and 
projection (UMAP) for the Japanese population revealed that the population was further divided into five 
clusters (Supplementary Fig. 2c). Information on the birthplace of grandparents for each participant indicated 
that one cluster consisted of people from mainland Japan, the Hondo cluster (OBi Hondo, n = 1421), and the 
remaining four consisted of people from the Ryukyu archipelago, the Ryukyu cluster (OBi Ryukyu, n = 8715) 
(Supplementary Fig. 2c).
We also performed PCA on 184,092 participants registered in BBJ and 1KGP Phase 3 and removed 100 
individuals defined as outliers not belonging to JPT or CHB (Supplementary Fig.  2d). From the PCA results of 
the remaining 183,992 individuals in BBJ, we defined two clusters: BBJ Ryukyu and BBJ Hondo (Supplementary 
Fig. 2e).
GWAS for serum liver enzyme levels in the Ryukyu population
The clinical characteristics of the Ryukyu population brought to GW AS are presented in Table 1. We observed 
13 independent loci with GW AS (P < 5 × 10−8) for three serum liver enzyme traits (Fig. 1, Table 2, Supplementary 
Tables 1, 2, 3), three for ALT (n = 15,224), rs3747207 in PNPLA3, rs3782886 in BRAP, and rs117595134 in 
HMMR/HMMR-AS1, four for AST (n = 15,203), rs76850691 in GOT1, rs3747207 in PNPLA3, rs369827206 in 
MRC1, rs147992802 near NAA25, and six for GGT, (n = 14,496), rs4049918 in GGT1, rs5760109 near MIF-
AS1, rs58367757 in HNF1A, rs7678352 in ZNF827, rs11066325 in PTPN11, rs7519043 near EPHA2 (Fig.  2, 
Supplementary Fig.  3). Most of these loci have been previously reported to be associated with serum liver 
enzyme levels, except for the HMMR/HMMR-AS1 locus, whose association with ALT or other liver enzyme 
traits has not been previously reported.
The minor A-allele of rs117595134 within HMMR/HMMR-AS1 was observed only in the Japanese in the 1000 
genomes database, 5.3% in JPT (Supplementary Table 4). In this study, the A-allele frequencies were significantly 
higher in the Ryukyu population than in the Hondo population ( P = 2.59 × 10−6, 6.0%, 6.0%, 2.9%, and 2.8% 
in OBi Ryukyu, BBJ Ryukyu, OBi Hondo, and BBJ Hondo, respectively; Table 3). Additionally, the absolute 
values of effect sizes (ß) of the A-allele are also significantly larger in the Ryukyu population than in the Hondo 
population (P for heterogeneity = 2.16 × 10−4, ß = – 0.133, −0.128, 0.015, −0.012 in OBi Ryukyu, BBJ Ryukyu, OBi 
Hondo, and BBJ Hondo, respectively, Table 3).
Replication study for previously reported loci in the Ryukyu population
We conducted replication studies of the loci reported in the Korean Genome and Epidemiology Study (KoGES)25 
and UK Biobank11,12. Among the 24 loci associated with ALT in 126 K Korean individuals in KoGES, two loci

3 of 336 loci for AST and 12 of 371 loci for GGT showed significant association in the Ryukyu population 
(P < 1.49 × 10−4 = 0.05/336 for AST, P < 1.35 × 10−4 = 0.05/371 for GGT) (Supplementary Tables 6, 7, 8). In total, 
541 of 716 signals (142 of 185 in ALT, 174 of 249 in AST, and 225 of 282 in GGT) showed the same directions 
of effect (P = 1.47 × 10−13 for ALT, P = 3.11 × 10−10 for AST, and P = 8.94 × 10−25 for GGT, P = 2.50 × 10−44 in total, 
binomial test).
Gene-based analyses using MAGMA
Next, we performed gene-based association analyses using MAGMA using data from the GW AS meta-analyses 
in the Ryukyu population and identified 22 genes significantly associated with liver enzyme traits: five for ALT, 
three for AST, and 14 for GGT ( P < 2.63 × 10−6 = 0.05/18,980, Supplementary Tables 9, 10, 11, Supplementary 
Fig.  4). These genes are located within ± 500  kb of the individual loci that have been previously reported in 
GW AS for serum liver enzyme levels. Of these, the association of two genes, CHCHD10 and C22orf15, with 
GGT, has not been previously reported by gene-based analyses. We conducted gene-set analyses using MAGMA 
but could not identify any curated gene sets or Gene Ontology terms significantly associated with ALT, AST, 
and GGT (Supplementary Tables 12, 13, 14). Tissue expression enrichment analyses using MAGMA revealed 
that the genes for GGT, identified through gene-based analysis, were significantly enriched in the liver tissue. In 
contrast, no significant enrichment was observed for genes associated with ALT and AST (Supplementary Tables 
15, 16, 17, Supplementary Fig. 5).
Discussion
In this study, we conducted GW AS meta-analyses using the Ryukyu population and found 13 loci with genome-
wide significant associations for three serum liver enzyme traits, one novel locus, HMMR/HMMR-AS1 for ALT, 
and 12 known loci.
GW AS have been extensively performed to identify the genetic loci associated with common diseases or 
quantitative traits, such as laboratory tests. Thousands of genetic loci have been reported to be associated with 
serum liver enzyme levels, including ALT, AST, and GGT, through GW AS using nearly a million participants, 
mostly individuals of European origin. A large-scale GW AS for the liver enzyme traits in the Japanese has also 
been performed, and additional 130 loci associated with ALT, AST, and GGT have been identified10,23,24.
In this study, we performed GW AS for serum liver enzyme levels, focusing on the Ryukyu population for 
the first time. Although the Japanese population is considered genetically homogenous, it has been known that 
there are two genetically distinct groups, Hondo for the mainland Japan and Ryukyu for the Ryukyu archipelago 
located in the south-western part of Japanese islands, from the results of principal component analyses using 
information of genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphism genotypes14,15. Additionally, it has been reported 
that people from the Ryukyu archipelago are further divided into several sub-groups16,17. Therefore, the Ryukyu 
population has a unique genetic background that differs from other regions. Since GW AS for isolated populations 
with unique genetic backgrounds have been reported to be useful for identifying novel loci with larger effect 
sizes even in smaller sample sizes, such as TBC1D4 for type 2 diabetes in Greenlandic Inuits 19 or CREBRF for 
body mass index in Samoans20, it is suggested that GW AS using populations with unique genetic backgrounds, 
such as the Ryukyu population, is useful and important for identifying additional novel loci even if the sample 
size is not very large.
Our GW AS meta-analysis of ALT identified a novel SNP locus, rs117595134, within HMMR/HMMR-AS1 
on chromosome 5. In this study, the A-allele frequencies are significantly higher in the Ryukyu population 
than in the Hondo population, and the absolute values of effect sizes (ß) of the A-allele are also significantly 
larger in the Ryukyu population than in the Hondo population. Therefore, the higher allele frequency and larger 
effect size for this variant observed in the Ryukyu population indicate that HMMR/HMMR-AS1 is likely to be 
a Ryukyu population-specific locus associated with ALT measures. We further searched for the whole genome 
sequencing data from 254 individuals belonging to the Ryukyu population to identify functional variants with 
high linkage disequilibrium to rs117595134 (r 2 ≥ 0.6), but no variant exists within ± 5 Mb from rs117595134, 
showing a significant deleterious effect evaluated using Combined Annotation Dependent Depletion software 
(Supplementary Table 18).
This variant is located in the intron of HMMR and HMMR-AS1. HMMR encodes a hyaluronan-mediated 
motility receptor, also known as CD168 or RHAMM26. The HMMR has been reported to be overexpressed 
in various tumor tissues, such as breast cancer 27 and gastrointestinal cancer 28 and implicated in promoting 
carcinogenesis29. Additionally, HMMR was recently reported as a critical gene associated with both nonalcoholic 
steatohepatitis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and silencing HMMR reduces HCC cell proliferation and 
tumor growth while also regulating cell cycle progression30,31. However, no evidence suggests a role for HMMR 
in directly or indirectly regulating serum ALT levels. Further studies are required to elucidate the molecular 
mechanisms through which this locus regulates serum ALT levels.
This study has several limitations. First, although this was the largest GW AS of serum liver enzyme traits 
in the Ryukyu population, the sample size was insufficient. Therefore, further studies are required to validate 
the association of the novel locus. Since statistical power to detect significant association of rs117595134 with 
ALT value in BBJ-Hondo was insufficient (14.4% for α = 0.05, Supplementary Table 19), additional replication 
sets with larger sample size or with larger effect size would be required to validate the association of this locus. 
Second, precise information on liver diseases, such as a history of hepatitis B or C viral infection, presence 
of diseases including metabolic dysfunction-associated fatty liver disease and HCC, is lacking in the OBi 
participants. Third, differences in the characteristics of participants between OBi and BBJ exist. BBJ is a hospital-
based disease cohort, whereas OBi is a population-based study, and the mean age of BBJ participants is higher 
than that of OBi participants. These differences may have reduced the statistical power of the meta-analysis.

Fourth, some databases for in silico analyses have been built from European data, which reduces the statistical 
power of these analyses.
In conclusion, we performed a GW AS for serum liver enzyme levels in the Ryukyu population for the first 
time and found several independent loci with genome-wide significant associations, including a novel locus 
associated with serum ALT. The lead variant located in the intron of HMMR/HMMR-AS1, rs117595134, is 
specific to the Japanese population, especially the Ryukyu population. Further studies are required to elucidate 
the biological mechanisms of this locus that contribute to the regulation of serum ALT levels.
Methods
Participants, genotyping, and imputation
We analyzed individuals registered in Okinawa Bioinformation Bank (OBi), which is a population-based study 
in Okinawa Prefecture established in 2016 16,17,21. Individual’s values for laboratory tests, including serum 
ALT, serum AST, and serum GGT; anthropometric measurements, including height, body weight, and body 
mass index; and lifestyle questionnaire information, including alcohol consumption and smoking status, were 
obtained from results of health check-up. Genomic DNA was extracted from peripheral leukocytes or saliva 
using a standard procedure, and SNP genotyping was performed using the Infinium Asian Screening Array v1.0 
BeadChip (Illumina, Inc. CA, USA).
We also analyzed participants registered in BioBank Japan (BBJ), a hospital-based cohort study consisting 
of patients with 47 diseases from 12 medical institutions in Japan22,23,24. Clinical information for laboratory test 
results, including serum ALT, AST, and GGT; anthropometric measures, including height, body weight, and 
body mass index; lifestyle questionnaire, including alcohol drinking behavior; and the status of 47 target diseases 
were obtained from the clinical records. Individuals with liver diseases, including liver cirrhosis, Hepatitis B 
or C virus infection, hepatocellular carcinoma, gallbladder carcinoma, or cholangiocarcinoma were excluded 
from the analyses. Genotyping was performed using Illumina Infinium Omni Express, Human Exome, Infinium 
Omni Express Exome v1.0, or Infinium Omni Express Exome v1.2 (Illumina Inc, CA, USA).
As a quality control (QC), we removed individuals (i) other than Japanese (outliers determined using 
PCA with 1KGP phase 3 as a reference panel), (ii) sex mismatch between clinical and genotypic information, 
(iii) sample call rate < 0.98, and (iv) one of the pairs of identical twins or duplicate samples determined using 
identity-by-descent (PIHAT > 0.95). For QC of SNPs, we excluded SNPs with (i) SNP call rate < 0.98, (ii) deviated 
genotype distribution from Hardy Weinberg Equilibrium (P ≤ 1.0 × 10−6), (iii) minor allele frequency < 0.01. The 
QC process was performed using PLINK v1.9.
The genotyped data were phased using Eagle (version 2.3) and imputed using linkage disequilibrium (LD) 
information for 3,256 Japanese WGS from the BBJ and 2,504 individuals from the 1KGP (phase3v5) 32 using 
Minimac4 software. We excluded variants with low imputation quality (Rsq < 0.7) and low minor allele frequency 
(minor allele frequency < 0.005).
GWAS and GWAS meta-analyses
To perform GW AS for the values of serum liver enzymes, we standardized serum ALT, AST, and GGT 
values using the following procedures: (i) we first transformed individual values to common logarithms, (ii) 
distributions of log-transformed values were evaluated in females and males separately, and samples with above 
4SD or below − 4SD were removed, (iii) linear regression analysis was performed by adjusting age, sex, principal 
components 1 to 10, drinking status (none; 0, sometimes; 1, almost every day; 2 in OBi, no; 0 or yes; 1 in BBJ) 
and the each disease statuses of the 42 diseases (unaffected;0, affected;1 only for BBJ), and (iv) the residuals for 
the regression analyses were z-standardized and applied to GW AS as quantitative values (Supplementary Fig. 6). 
We conducted GW AS for serum liver enzyme levels using a linear mixed model in BOLT-LMM (v.2.3.6) 33, 
which effectively accounts for population stratification and cryptic relatedness, by assuming candidate SNP is 
modeled as a fixed effect, and environmental effect and polygenic effect by residual SNPs other than tested SNP 
are modeled as random effects.
We performed meta-analyses using the inverse-variance weighted method with a fixed-effects model and 
assessed heterogeneity using Cochran’s Q-test with METAL software (v.2020-05-05) 34. The genomic inflation 
factors (λGC) of GW AS meta-analyses in the Ryukyu population for the ALT, AST, and GGT were 1.03, 1.04, 
and 1.06 respectively (Fig.  1), and those of the LDSC intercepts were 1.0109, 1.0097, and 1.0398 respectively 
(Supplementary Table 20). These results indicate there was no significant inflation attributable to population 
stratification and other confounding factors. We defined independent genome-wide significant loci as genomic 
positions within ± 500 kb from the lead variant. We searched for the genome-wide significant loci of this study in 
the GW AS catalog, and if there are no variants reported as associated with each serum liver enzyme level in the 
locus within ± 1 Mb from the lead variants of this study, we determined these loci as novel loci associated with 
the liver enzyme trait. We annotated rsIDs in the dbSNP database, the closest genes to the lead variants, using 
ANNOV AR software35.
LD score regression
We conducted LD Score Regression v1.0.1 36 using GW AS meta-analysis data for ALT, AST and GGT in the 
Ryukyu population. For the regression, we used the East Asian LD scores and summary statistics of high-quality 
common SNPs present in the HapMap 3 reference panel for each trait.
Gene-based and gene-set association analyses
Gene-based and gene-set association analyses were conducted using MAGMA v1.08, as implemented in FUMA 
v1.6.137. We used summary statistics data for the meta-analysis in this study. These included 8,413,895 variants 
for ALT, 8,412,728 for AST, and 8,395,794 for GGT. The variant information was converted from GRCh38

www.nature.com/scientificreports/
(hg38) to GRCh37 (hg19) using the lift-over method (LiftOver; https://genome.sph.umich.edu/wiki/LiftOver). 
Individual variants were mapped to 18,980 protein-coding genes in the hg19 build, and gene-based p-values 
were calculated. Information on LD from the 1KGP phase 3 EAS was used, and window sizes were set to range 
from 2 kb upstream to 1 kb downstream of the genes. The statistical significance threshold for the gene-based 
analysis was set at a Bonferroni-corrected P-value, < 2.63 × 10−6 (0.05/18,980). In the gene-set analysis, 17,009 
gene sets (curated gene sets and Gene Ontology terms) from MsigDB v7.0 were assessed, and the significance 
threshold was set at P < 2.94 × 10−6 (0.05/17,009). We conducted tissue expression enrichment analyses using the 
MAGMA tool and RNA sequencing data from 54 different tissue types sourced from the GTEx v8.
In silico functional annotation
The functional category was annotated using Combined Annotation Dependent Depletion (CADD) v1.6 38 to 
evaluate variant pathogenicity.
Statistical power calculation
Power calculations for the association of rs117595134 within novel locus were given for a range of allele 
frequencies and effect sizes based on the additive genetic model and using the Quanto (Version 1.2.3) program39.
Softwares
Manhattan and quantile–quantile plots were drawn using R software version 4.0.5  [   h t t p s : / / C R A N . R - p r o j e c t . o r g 
/     ] , and regional association plots were generated using LocusZoom40.
