v-Transaminase (v-TA) as a kind of important biocatalyst is widely used in preparation of chiral
intermediates. In this paper, a magnetic PVA-Fe3O4 nanoparticles was prepared and employed on
immobilization of v-TA to reduce the cost, increase reusability and enhance stability. The prepared
magnetic PVA-Fe3O4 nanoparticles were characterized by transmission electron microscope (TEM), X-ray
diffraction (XRD) and vibrating sample magnetometer (VSM). The average size of magnetic PVA-Fe3O4
nanoparticles was located between 30– 40 nm v-TA was immobilized onto magnetic PVA-Fe3O4
nanoparticles via glutaraldehyde cross-linking, achieving a wider pH range as 6– 8 and also a better
thermal stability at 60 /C14C. Meanwhile, the immobilized v-TA could be successfully reused for 13 times in
biotransformation. These results therefore indicated that the immobilized v-TA with high stability might
be readily utilized in industrial purposes.

1. Introduction
v-Transaminase (v-TA), which is a pyridoxal-50-phosphate
(PLP) dependent enzyme, plays a very important role in synthesis
of chiral amines and non-natural amino acids [1– 3]. Processes
catalyzed by v-TA are advantageous over others with high
enantioselectivity, precise regioselectivity, and broad substrate
speciﬁcity [4]. Previously, application of v-TA was sometimes
restricted by its stability, production cost and difﬁculty in
recycling. In order to overcome such problem, many efforts have
been made, such as over-expression of v-TA in E. coli to reduce the
production cost and the addition of DMSO as cosolvent to improve
the stability of v-TA at 50 /C14C for industrial application [5,6]. For
now, more attention is given to the immobilization of enzymes,
which might improve the stability and also allow for recycling of
the enzymes.
Over the past years, scientists have managed to immobilize
v-TAs onto different supports. v-TA had been entrapped into
calcium alginate, showing increase in Vmax by 28– 33% and decrease
in activation energy by 41% compared to the free [7]. By means of
binding with chitosan covalently, immobilized v-TAs had retained
higher activity and signiﬁcant stability compared with the free
enzyme [8,9]. Sol– gel/Celite 545 was also tested as a matrix to
immobilize commercially available v-TA, and the immobilized
v-TA maintained its activity at a broader pH range and better
operational stability without any substantial loss in enantiose-
lectivity and conversion in ﬁve cycles [10]. Immobilized v-TA on
SEPABEADS EXE120 demonstrated its good capability of operating
in organic solvent and also excellent recyclability [11]. Besides,
whole cells containing v-TA were also immobilized onto different
carriers, indicating improved storage and operational stability
[12,13].
In consideration of high load rate, speciﬁc surface area, and
intensity, nanomaterials have been considered as the promising
carriers for enzyme immobilization [14]. Moreover, much research
has revealed that nanomaterials can provide better microenviron-
ments surrounding enzyme molecules and bring about much
improved performances (e.g. stabilities) [15]. Investigations on
immobilized enzymes supported by nanomaterials with types
of spheres, ﬁbers, and tubes have been dramatically increased
[16– 18]. Among them, functionalized magnetic nanomaterials are
found to be a practically useful support for enzyme immobilization
due to readily recyclability [19]. Some papers have been reported
to be involved in enzymes immobilized onto magnetic nano-
materials. Laccase, cholesterol oxidase, alcohol dehydrogenase,
lipase, etc, have been immobilized onto different magnetic
nanomaterials and exhibited good stability and reusability
[20– 23]. However, seldom have studies been carried out related
with immobilization of v-TA onto magnetic nanoparticles.
In the present study, Fe3O4-PVA was prepared and applied in
immobilization of v-TA. XRD and TEM were employed to analyze
Fe3O4 and Fe3O4-PVA nanoparticles. The immobilized v-TA was

characterized by enzymatic parameters. Still the reusability of
immobilized v-TA was investigated.
2. Materials and methods
2.1. Materials
The recombinant v-TA (E.C. 2.6.1.1) originated from Mycobac-
terium vanbaalenii was purchased from Sigma– Aldrich. Polyvinyl
alcohol (PVA, 1750 /C6 50), ferric chloride hexahydrate (FeCl3/C16H2O),
ferrous chloride tetrahydrate (FeCl2/C14H2O), concentrated hydro-
chloric acid, 25% glutaraldehyde, n-butanol, benzoyl peroxide,
dodecyl trimethyl ammonium chloride, Tween 80, Coomassie
Brilliant Blue G250 and bovine serum albumin were obtained from
Sinopharm. Pyridoxal-50-phosphate (PLP), R-a-methylbenzyl-
amine (R-a-MBA) were supplied by Aladdin. Edible oil was
purchased from a local ﬁrm. All other reagents used were of
analytic grade.
2.2. Preparation of magnetic Fe3O4 nanoparticles
Three and half milliliter of concentrated hydrochloric acid,
7.96 g of FeCl2/C14H2O and 10.82 g of FeCl3/C16H2O were dissolved and
mixed in 100 mL of distilled water. After 30 min of nitrogen
purging, the solution was heated at 70 /C14C and 500 mL of 3 M NaOH
was slowly dropped with mechanical agitation at 500 rpm under a
nitrogen atmosphere. After 1 h of reaction, the product was
isolated with an external magnetic ﬁeld and rinsed with distilled
water until neutral. Finally, the product was rinsed three to ﬁve
times with methanol and suspended in methanol at a concentra-
tion of 0.01 g/mL.
2.3. Preparation of magnetic PVA-Fe3O4 nanoparticles
Under nitrogen atmosphere, 500 mL of 0.01 g/mL Fe3O4 nano-
particles ﬂuid was added into a ﬂask at 70 /C14C, and 1.5 g of
dodecyltrimethylammonium methyl chloride and 15 mL of
n-butanol was then dropped into mixture. With continually
mechanical stirring, 60 mL of PVA solution (10%, w/v) was added
into the solution. Thirty minutes later, 2 g of initiator of benzoyl
peroxide dissolved in 10 mL of ethanol was added under
mechanical stirring at 70 /C14C. After 7 h of reaction, the product
was separated employing a magnetic ﬁeld and rinsed 3 times with
distilled water, followed by being rinsed with methanol and dried
in an oven at 75– 80 /C14C for 4 h.
2.4. Characterization of magnetic Fe3O4 and PVA- Fe3O4 nanoparticles
The size and morphology of magnetic Fe3O4 and PVA-Fe3O4
nanoparticles were characterized by TEM (H-7650, Hitachi), and
the material composition and the crystal structure were acquired
by XRD (D8 Discover, Bruker) analysis using an X-ray beam with
nickel-ﬁltered Cu-K radiation. VSM (EV7, ADE Technologies) was
used to record the magnetic susceptibility of Fe3O4 and PVA-Fe3O4
and a magnet was added for more intuitive results.
2.5. Immobilization of v-TA by magnetic PVA-Fe3O4 nanoparticles
combined with glutaraldehyde
Two gram of magnetic PVA-Fe3O4 nanoparticles was added into
17 mL of pH 7.0 phosphate buffer and dispersed by ultrasonic for
20 min. The solution was suspended into the dispersion medium
consisted of 200 mL of edible oil, 3 mL of Tween 80 and 30 mL of n-
butanol under mechanical stirring at 70 /C14C for 4 h. Glutaraldehyde
was then added to a ﬁnal concentration of 0.05%. Finally, the
product was separated and rinsed repeatedly with methanol for
getting rid of the remaining dispersion medium. The immobiliza-
tion of v-TA onto the magnetic PVA-Fe3O4 nanoparticles was
carried out by directly adding 1 mL of 1 mg/mL v-TA (0.3U) to 3 mL
of 10 mg/mL magnetic PVA-Fe3O4 nanoparticles in 1 mL of pH
7.0 phosphate buffer. After 6 h of reaction, the precipitates were
collected using a magnetic ﬁeld and rinsed 3 times with distilled
water and stored at 4 /C14C until use.
2.6. Determination of activity and concentration of v-TA
The determination of v-TA activity was conducted as follows:
1 mL of mixture including 1 mM R-a-MBA, 1 mM pyruvate, 0.1 mM
PLP, 35 mg of immobilized or 1 mg of free enzymes and phosphate
buffer (pH 7.0, 50 mM). After the mixture was incubated at 30 /C14C and
180 rpm for 10 min, the reactionwas stopped byaddition of an equal
volume of TFA. The mixture was analyzed by HPLC (1500, Alltech)

using a chiral column (CROWNPAK CR(+), 5 mm, 4 /C2150 mm,
DAICEL) at 220 nm with the elution of 20% puriﬁed water and
80% HClO4 buffer (pH 1.5). One unit of v-TA was deﬁned as the
amount of enzyme releasing 1 mmol acetophenone using R-a-MBA
as substrate per minute at 30 /C14C.
2.7. Optimum pH, temperature and stability of the free and
immobilized v-TA
Optimum pH of free and immobilized v-TA was determined at
30 /C14C in buffer at pH ranging from 4.0 to 9.0 for 12 h, and optimum
temperature was determined in phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) at
temperature ranging from 20 to 80 /C14C. Thermal stability of free and
immobilized v-TA was studied at 60 /C14C in phosphate buffer (pH
7.0) for different time.
2.8. Reusability of the immobilized v-TA
The reusability of immobilized v-TA was investigated by
converting R-a-MBA repeatedly. The reaction solution was
consisted of 250 mM R-a-MBA, 250 mM pyruvate, 1 mg/mL v-TA
and 0.1 mM PLP. Reaction was conducted at 40 /C14C for 25 h. After
each test, the immobilized v-TA was collected by using magnetic
ﬁeld and washed three to ﬁve times with methanol and distilled
water before the next cycle.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Hysteresis loop analysis
Based on modiﬁed co-precipitation and microemulsion method
in this paper [24– 26], single dispersion, uniform size of the
magnetic Fe3O4 and PVA-Fe3O4 nanoparticles were prepared
[27– 29]. The hysteresis loop of the magnetic Fe3O4 nanoparticles
revealed a ferromagnetic behavior and the remanence and coercive
force was very small, almost near to zero, closing to super-
paramagnetism with the saturated magnetic intensity value of
57.24 emu/g, as can be seen from Fig. 1a. Similarly, the magnetic
PVA-Fe3O4 nanoparticles also showed that there was no rema-
nence and the coercive force was near to zero. However, the
saturated magnetic intensity of the magnetic PVA-Fe3O4 nano-
particles had a value as 47.84 emu/g, indicating that the saturated

magnetic intensity of PVA modiﬁed nanoparticles was smaller
than that of the unmodiﬁed. Similar observations of magnetic
chitosan-caoted Fe3O4 nanoparticles were presented in previous
papers [30,31].
3.2. Magnetic nanoparticles by TEM analysis
In view of the existence of agglomeration, the magnetic
nanoparticles would reunit more or less. As is shown in Fig. 2a,
the magnetic Fe3O4 particles showed its form as not very regular
cube, and its diameter was between 10 and 15 nm. Magnetic PVA-
Fe3O4 nanoparticles were presented in Fig. 2b, and the formation
and dispersion of the nanoparticles were clearly observed and
particle size distributed in 30– 40 nm, which was consistent with
the reported coated magnetic naoparticles [30]. Not only had the
Fe3O4 nanoparticles been stabilized by wrapping PVA in their
surface to prevent them from coagulation, but the afﬁnity of the
nanoparticles to the cross linker had also been enhanced.
3.3. Magnetic nanoparticles by XRD analysis
To analyze the crystallographic structure of the magnetic
nanoparticles, the XRD analysis was performed and results were
shown in Fig. 3. The peaks of magnetic Fe3O4 nanoparticles
respectively corresponded to the standard peaks of Fe3O4
characteristic diffraction. The well-deﬁned XRD pattern indicating
the formation of magnetic Fe3O4 nanoparticles was high purity
with a spinel structure [32]. The calculated average particles
diameter was 13.53 nm according to the Debye– Scherer’s formula.
The XRD pattern of magnetic PVA-Fe3O4 nanoparticles as is shown
in Fig. 3b indicated the characteristic peaks were almost identical
to the standard XRD patterns of Fe3O4 with 31.45 nm of mean
calculated diameter, indicating that it also kept the type of Fe3O4.
The diameter sizes of both magnetic Fe3O4 and PVA-Fe3O4
nanoparticles were very close to the results of TEM analysis.

3.4. Optimum pH and temperature
Itiswellknownthattheactivityofenzymedependsgreatlyonthe
surrounding pH and temperature. Many studies have revealed that
the PVA can slightly broadenpH-ranges of the immobilized enzymes
[33,34]. As can be seen in Fig. 4, the free v-TA gave the maximal
activity at pH 7.0, but the immobilized v-TA exhibited much broader
optimum pHrangewithin7.0 – 9.0.Similarresults havebeen reported
for v-TA immobilized on calcium alginate and chitosan [5– 7]. The
possible reason was speculated as: PVA could maintain the pH value
of microenvironment at a level different from the external medium
[35]. The temperature proﬁles for the free and immobilized v-TA
preparations were shown in Fig. 5. The optimum temperature of the
free v-TA was approximately 30 /C14C, and it would shift to 40– 50 /C14C for
the immobilized one, indicating that the immobilized v-TA was less
sensitive to temperature changes compared to the free one. The
enhances optimum temperature have also been currently reported
in other studies [5,7,36].
3.5. Kinetic parameters of v-TA
The Km and Vmax are the important kinetic parameters of
enzyme and can be calculated from a Lineweaver– Burk plot. The
kinetic parameters of the free and immobilized v-TA were
summarized in Table 1. There was an increase in Km and Kcat from
the free v-TA to the immobilized one. The Km of the free and
immobilized v-TA was 4.40 mM and 11.03 mM, respectively. As a
parameter reﬂecting the afﬁnity between substrate and enzyme,
the bigger Km caused by the increased diffusion and strict
resistance of the immobilized v-TA would lead to the reduced
afﬁnity with respect to the free one [35]. Besides, the high
hydrophilicity of PVA could also contribute to a higher Km by
reducing the local concentration of substrate in the microenviron-
ment surrounding enzyme [37].
3.6. Thermal stability
Thermal stability of the free and immobilized was tested after
incubation in a water bath at 60 /C14C. In general, the structure of
protein would change to various degrees, and then denatures to
inactivation with the increased temperature and extension of time.
It was clearly shown in Fig. 6 that the activity of the free v-TA
declined to 10% within 60 min, while the immobilized one still
retained around 70% residual activity even for 80 min. The effect on
thermal stability of immobilized v-TA was in accordance with
results reported in previous article [5]. This might be explained by
a covalent bond connection between the enzyme and magnetic
PVA-Fe3O4 nanoparticles, bringing the immobilized v-TA a more

inﬂexibility against the structural changes exposed in heat
surroundings [38].
3.7. Storage stability
The residual activities were investigated to examine the storage
stability of the free and immobilized v-TA after stored at 4 /C14C for 45
days. As shown in Fig. 7, the free v-TA presented no detectable
activity, and the immobilized one was found to maintain more than
80% residual activity. This result was identical to previous reports
about immobilization of v-TA and other enzymes [8,20,36].
3.8. Reusability
Reusability is an important criterion of enzyme for industrial
utilization. The immobilized v-TA was performed to convert R-
a-MBA for 19 consecutive reaction cycles over 475 h under the
same conditions. Results showed the immobilized v-TA might
present almost no decrease in activity after 13 rounds of operation.
Conversion rate of nearly 50% could be remained after 19 rounds.
Compared to the immobilized v-TA reported in previous
publications [8– 10,39], a better operational stability would be
apparently achieved in this paper (Fig. 8).
4. Conclusion
In this paper, the magnetic PVA-Fe3O4 nanoparticles with
average size between 30 and 40 nm were synthesized and used as
carrier for immobilization of v-TA. The immobilized v-TA, with
broader pH range and higher optimum temperature, might present
better thermal and storage stability. It could be successfully reused
for 13 cycles with high activity being retained. The immobilized
v-TA could be a promising biocatalyst for kinetic resolution of
chiral amines.
