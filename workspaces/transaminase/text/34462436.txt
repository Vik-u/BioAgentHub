Peptides are important compounds with broad applications in many areas. Asymmetric
transamination of α-keto amides can provide an efﬁcient strategy to synthesize peptides,
however, the process has not been well developed yet and still remains a great challenge in
both enzymatic and catalytic chemistry. For biological transamination, the high activity is
attributed to manifold structural and electronic factors of transaminases. Based on the
concept of multiple imitation of transaminases, here we report N-quaternized axially chiral
pyridoxamines 1 for enantioselective transamination ofα-keto amides, to produce various
peptides in good yields with excellent enantio- and diastereoselectivities. The reaction is
especially attractive for the synthesis of peptides made of unnatural amino acids since it
doesn’t need great efforts to make chiral unnatural amino acids before amide bond formation.

eptides are one type of the most important compounds with
high biological activities, which are widely present in many
natural products, pharmaceutically relevant molecules, and
biological systems1–3. Especially in recent years, there appears a
growing interest in therapeutic peptides1–3 and more and more
peptide drugs have been developed (Fig.1a)4–6. Development of
alternative new methods for the synthesis of peptides is always
highly desirable and potentially useful7,8.
Enzymatic transamination is an important process to produce
chiral amines such as amino acids in biological systems (Fig.1b)9,10,
which is promoted by transaminases (Fig. 1c) with pyridoxal/pyr-

a highly intriguing method to synthesize NH2-free amines from
readily available carbonyl compounds15–17. The chemistry has
attracted much attention since the 1970s18–36. The studies mainly
include stoichiometric chiral pyridoxamine-promoted asymmetric
transamination of α-keto acids18–21, pyridoxal/pyridoxamine-cata-
lyzed asymmetric transamination ofα-keto acids22–26,a n dc h i r a l
base/Lewis acid-catalyzed asymmetric transamination ofα-keto esters
and activated ketones27–36. Asymmetric transamination ofα-keto
amides can potentially provide an appealing new strategy to produce
peptides. However, to the best of our knowledge, asymmetric
transamination ofα-keto amides to peptides are barely reported37,38,
although the reverse process, transamination of peptides at the
N-termini toα-keto amides, has been widely developed and already
have been successfully applied to protein modiﬁcation38–45.I nc o n -

catalysis likely due to non-naturally occurring process and it is also a
challenge for chemical catalysis probably because the complicated
structure ofα-keto amides requires more active catalysts to promote
transamination.
Previous studies have suggested that asymmetric 1,3-proton shift
between the ketimine intermediate and the aldimine is likely a key
step for biological transamination (Fig.1d)11–13,46,47.I no r d e rt o
accelerate this step, evolution has elegantly optimized transaminases
by incorporating a Lys residueat an appropriate position48–50.T h eε-
NH2 group of the Lys residue serves as an intramolecular base to
deprotonate the benzylic C-H of the ketimine (Fig.1d)48–50.I n
addition, the pKa v a l u e so ft h ep y r i d i n eNi nt h ec o e n z y m ep y r i d o x a l
5′-phosphate (PLP) and pyridoxamine 5′-phosphate (PMP) are
around 8.551–53, thus the pyridine N is predominantly protonated in
biological systems (near pH 7)53–56. The strong electron-withdrawing
property of the protonated pyridine ring helps to increase the acidity
of the benzylic C-H bond (Fig.1d)54–58. The two effects work
together to promote the transformation from the ketimine to the
aldimine via 1,3-proton shift, magically accelerating transamination
process. Inspired by the controlled protonation of the pyridine N of
PLP in biological systems, Rapoport has developedN-methylpyr-
idinium-4-carboxaldehyde benzenesulfonate (Rapoport’s salt) as an
effective transamination reagent for conversion of amines to carbonyl
compounds59. Francis have found that Rapoport’s salt displays sig-
niﬁcantly improved efﬁciency in the transamination of proteins as
compared to pyridinium-4-carboxaldehyde, converting the N-termini
into the corresponding carbonyl groups44,45. Recently, we have
proved that introducing an amineside arm to a chiral pyridoxamine
can remarkably increase its activityand enantioselectivity for asym-
metric transamination ofα-keto acids26 and also have observed that
quaternization of the pyridine N of a chiral pyridoxal leads to dra-
matical improvement of catalytic activity for asymmetric biomimetic
Mannich reaction60 and aldol reaction61 of glycinate. On the basis of
the structural characteristics of transaminases46–50,53–56 as well as the
previously reported studies 26,44,45,59–62,w eh a sd e s i g n e d
N-quaternized biaryl axially chiral pyridoxamines1 bearing an amine
side arm, mimicking transaminasesin multiple aspects for catalytic
asymmetric transamination ofα-keto amides to peptides (Fig.1c).
The quaternization always keeps the pyridine ring with strong
electron-withdrawing ability to improve the benzylic C-H acidity of
the ketimine intermediate during transamination, no matter under
acidic or basic conditions60,61. Like the Lys residue does in biological
transamination, the amine side arm can serve as an intramolecular
base to facilitate 1,3-proton shift.
Here we show that asymmetric biomimetic transamination of
α-keto amides2 can be achieved by using chiral pyridoxamines1
as the catalyst, to produce various peptides 3 with excellent
enantiopurities (Fig. 1e).
Results
Catalyst synthesis. The synthesis of chiral pyridoxamines 1
started with reductive amination of compound526 to introduce
the amine side chain. Protecting the two amine groups with di-
tert-butyl dicarbonate gave intermediates6 (Fig. 2). Treatment of
6 with methyl iodide and subsequent deprotection with hydro-
chloric acid afforded N-methyl pyridoxamines 1a-e in good
yields.
Condition optimization. With diphenylglycine (4) as the amine
source25,26,63, catalyst chiral pyridoxamine1b was ﬁrst tested for
the transamination of glycinylα-keto amide 2a (Fig. 3, entry 1).
The originally-formed NH 2-free transamination product was
treated with di-tert-butyl dicarbonate to avoid the cyclization to
piperazinedione during the isolation64, to give the corresponding
N-Boc-protected dipeptide3a in 20% yield with 76% ee. Additives
have signiﬁcant impacts on the reaction in terms of enantios-
electivity and activity. Increased yield and enantioselectivity were
obtained for transaminations performed in MeOH/H 2Oo r
TFEA/H2O with HOAc/KOAc or HOAc/Na2HPO4 as the addi-
tives (Fig. 3, entries 2 and 10 vs 3–9). Chiral pyridoxamine 1b
exhibited the best performance among the catalysts1a-e exam-
ined (Fig. 3, entries 10–14).
Substrate scope. Under the optimal conditions, various glycinyl
α-keto amides containing alkyl (for3b-e), aromatic (for3a and
3f-i), or heteroatomic alkyl (for3j-k) groups were all smoothly
transaminated to give the correspondingN-Boc-protected glyci-
nyl dipeptides 3a-k in 70-94% yields with up to 98% ee (Fig.4).
Chiral glycinyl α-keto amide (for 3l ) displayed excellent dia-
stereoselectivity (98:2 dr). Transamination of α-keto phenylbu-
tanamides of chiral amino acid esters produced variousN-Boc-
protected dipeptides 3m-y in 56–93% yields with up to 99:1
diastereoselectivity. Peptidylα-keto amides were also effective for
the asymmetric transamination, to form tripeptides 3z-ab and
tetrapeptides 3ac-ad in 60–87% yields with excellent diastereos-
electivities under very mild conditions. Various functional groups
such as C-C double bond (for 3c, 3l and 3y ), NH2-sensitive
bromide (for3j), silyl group (for3k), OH group of Tyr (for3s ),
NH group of Trp (for3t), amide CONH2 of Asn (for3v ), Boc-
protected Lys residue (for3w), Boc-protected guanidine (for3x),
and basic NH2 group of Lys (for3ab) were all well tolerated by
the transamination likely due to the mild reaction conditions.
In order to investigate the impacts of catalyst and substrates on
diastereomeric induction, several representativeα-keto amides (for
3m-n, 3r, 3v-y,a n d3aa-ab) were examined respectively using (S)-

%) as the catalyst. The corresponding peptides were formed withS
conﬁgurations of the newly generated chiral centers from catalyst
(R)-1b and R conﬁgurations from (S)-1b. The chiral pyridoxamine
catalyst dominated the stereoselectivity, while the chiral groups on
the amino acid residues ofα-keto amides throwed little inﬂuence on
the diastereomeric induction probably due to being far away from
the reaction centers as well as theﬂexibility of the skeletons of theα-
keto amides. No matter which conﬁguration of the catalyst1b was
applied, excellent diastereoselectivities were always obtained, even
for α-keto amides (for 3n and 3aa)w i t han e a r b yb u l k yc h i r a l
amino acid residue and for those that displayed obvious substrate-
induction on diastereoselectivity in 7-catalyzed non-asymmetric
transamination (5:95 dr for3r and 19:81 dr for3x). For α-keto
amide 2y bearing two nearby chiral centers, a pair of diastereomers
(R,R,S)-3y and (R,S,S)-3y were respectively obtained in good yields
with high enantiopurities by using (S)-1b and (R)-1b as the catalyst.
The absolute conﬁgurations of the newly generated chiral centers of
peptides 3 were assigned by analog, based on the X-ray analysis of
3d, 3m ,a n d3r (also see Supplementary Figs. 1–3i nS I ) .
Synthetic applications. Divergent extending an additional amino
acid unit from a central peptide is of great interest for peptide
drug screening and bioactivity studies. The synthesis would be
difﬁcult when the extended unit is a commercially unavailable
unnatural amino acid. The transamination process provides an
efﬁcient strategy for the amino acid extending. For example,
starting from the benzyl ester of protease inhibitor Ubenimex
(8)65, condensation withα-keto acids and subsequent asymmetric
transamination afforded a variety of enantiopure peptides3ae-ai
with one more amino acid residue extended (Fig. 5a). The

unprotected OH group remained untouched during the con-
densation and transamination.
Based on the “condensation-transamination” process, a new
strategy for the synthesis of peptides also can be developed. As
illustrated in Fig. 5b, the methyl ester of DPP-IV inhibitor
Diprotin A (10)66 underwent condensation withα-keto acid 9a
and subsequent asymmetric transamination, forming tetrapeptide
3ad with excellent diastereoselectivity. Repeating the reaction
sequence two more times afforded hexapeptide 3ak with high
enantiopurity. The chirality of the extended amino acid residues
was established along with the transamination process. The
protocol is especially attractive for the synthesis of peptides made

of unnatural amino acids, since it doesn’t need great efforts to
make NH2-protected chiral unnatural amino acids before the
amide bond formation.
Reaction mechanism. A plausible mechanism was proposed for
the transamination (Fig. 6a)11–13,25,26. Pyridoxamine 1b con-
denses with α-keto amide 2 to form ketimine11, which under-
goes asymmetric 1,3-proton shift to aldimine 13 under the
assistance of the amine side arm46–50. Hydrolysis of aldimine13
releases peptide 3 and generates the pydridoxal, which is in situ
converted into iminium14 via intramolecular condensation. The
iminium 14 then undergoes decarboxylative transamination with
the amine source diphenylglycine (4) back to pyridoxamine cat-
alyst 1b25,26,63, completing a catalytic cycle.
As expected, N-quaternization of the pyridine ring of the chiral
pyridoxamines resulted in higher catalytic activity and better
enantioselectivity for the asymmetric transamination (Fig. 6b,
1b vs 1g). The stronger electron-withdrawing property makes the
benzylic C-H of ketimine11 more acidic and also stabilizes the
corresponding delocalized carbanion 12 better54–58,67–69,t h u s
favoring the 1,3-proton shift and accelerating the transamination
process. The control experiment conﬁrmed the amazing effect of
the amine side arm again (Fig.6b, 1b vs 1f). Introducing an acetyl
group onto the nitrogen to eliminate the basicity of the amine on
the side arm led to marked decreases in activity and enantios-
electivity. The amine side arm not only promotes the 1,3-proton
shift by acting as an intramolecular base to deprotonate the
benzylic C-H of ketimine11 (Fig. 6a) but also helps to orient the
α-keto amide by hydrogen bonding with the carbonyl oxygen of
the amide group (Fig. 6c), resulting in improved activity and
stereoselectivity48–50. Protonation of the delocalized carbanion12
occurs atα−position of the amide group from the up side of the
pyridine ring away from the amine side arm26,46,47,t of o r mt h e

Discussion
In summary, based on the concept of multiple imitation of
transaminases, we have developed N-quaternized axially chiral
pyridoxamines 1 containing an amine side arm. With pyridox-
amine 1b as the catalyst, challenging substrates α-keto amides
were successfully transaminated to peptides in good yields with
excellent enantio- and diastereoselectivities. The catalyst domi-
nated the diastereoselective control for the transamination of
chiral α-keto amides. Thus, a pair of diastereomeric peptides
could be respectively obtained with high enantiopurities by

switching the conﬁguration of the pyridoxamine catalyst. The
strong electron-withdrawing property of the N-quaternized pyr-
idine ring together with the cooperative catalysis of the amine
side arm account for the increased catalytic activity and selectivity
of the pyridoxamine1b in the transamination. The reaction can
provide an efﬁcient strategy for divergent and successive exten-
sion of peptides via condensation-transamination reaction
sequence, which is especially attractive for the synthesis of pep-
tides made of unnatural amino acids.
Methods
General procedure for the asymmetric biomimetic transamination Reaction
(Fig. 4). A mixture ofα-keto amide 2 (0.10 mmol), chiral pyridoxamine1b
(0.0050 mmol), 2,2-diphenylglycine (4) (0.11 mmol), HOAc (0.40 mmol),
Na2HPO4 or KOAc (0.20 mmol), CF3CH2OH or MeOH (0.48 mL), and H2O
(0.12 mL) was stirred at 16–25 °C for the speciﬁed time. For glycinylα-keto amides
(for 3a-l) andα-keto phenylbutanamides of amino acid esters (for3m-y), the crude
reaction mixtures were treated with di-tert-butyl dicarbonate (0.3 mmol) at room
temperature for 3 h after the transamination was completed, then concentrated via
rotary evaporator to remove most of the solvent and isolated by column chro-
matography on silica gel with a mixed solvent ethyl acetate and petroleum ether as
the eluant to give the productsN-Boc-protected dipeptides 3a-y. For Peptidylα-
keto amides (for3z-ad), the reaction mixtures were submitted to concentration via
rotary evaporator to remove most of the solvent and then isolated by column
chromatography on silica gel with a mixed solvent of dichloromethane, methanol
and ammonia solution in ethanol (2.9 M) as the eluant to give the transamination
products tripeptides 3z-aa and tetrapeptides 3ab-ad without NH
2-protection. The
ee and dr values of3a-ac were determined by HPLC analysis.
