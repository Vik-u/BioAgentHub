Abstract: Background: Mexico, one of the world’s most biodiverse countries, holds a rich
tradition of using medicinal plants to manage chronic diseases such as type 2 diabetes and
hypertension. Despite their historical significance, the scientific validation of these plants’
mechanisms and safety remains limited. Natural products have shown potential in improv-
ing insulin sensitivity, reducing insulin resistance, and promoting vasodilation. Prostachea
livida (Lindl.) W.E.Higgins, a native orchid, is believed to possess therapeutic properties, yet
its pharmacological effects are unexplored. Objective: The current investigation is aimed
to bridge traditional knowledge and scientific evidence by investigating the antidiabetic,
vasodilatory and antihypertensive activities of a 1:1 dichloromethane and methanol ex-
tract from Prosthechea livida bulbs, alongside an evaluation of its pharmacological safety.
Methods: Antidiabetic effects of the extract were evaluated in a non-insulin-dependent
mouse model using a 100 mg/kg dose. Vasodilatory activity was assessed ex vivo using rat
aortic rings, exploring its mechanism through calcium channel blockade. Antihypertensive
effects were evaluated in spontaneously hypertensive rats, while acute and subacute toxi-
city tests were conducted in a murine model. Results: The extract significantly reduced
glycemia between 1, 3, 5, and 7 h compared to the positive control (* p = 0.04, *** p < 0.001)
and induced vasorelaxation but showed no antihypertensive effects in vivo. Toxicity tests
indicated no severe damage, though elevated transaminase activity and increased liver
weight were observed. Histopathological analysis revealed minimal hepatocellular lesions
with active regeneration. Conclusions: Prosthechea livida demonstrates potential in the
discovery of active metabolites to treat diabetes, with significant hypoglycemic and vasore-
laxant effects and promising pharmacological safety. Further research is needed to fully
understand its therapeutic applications and ensure its safe integration.

1. Introduction
Natural products (NPs) are among the principal sources used by the Mexican popu-
lation to treat various diseases, ranging from non-communicable to chronic degenerative
diseases, such as hypertension and diabetes [1]. Diabetes is a serious, chronic condition
that occurs when the body cannot produce enough insulin or cannot use the insulin that
it does produce, leading to high levels of glucose [ 2]. Over time, this disease can lead
to other complications, such as vascular trauma, retinopathy, heart disease, nephropathy,
and diabetic neuropathy. There is scientific evidence of the relationship between vascular
diseases and glycemic disorders. Hyperglycemia has been identified as a critical factor
that elevates the risk of developing vascular complications in patients with diabetes [ 3].
This association is evident in individuals with type 2 diabetes (T2D), where inadequate
glycemic control has been correlated with an increased incidence of both microvascular
and macrovascular complications [4]. Approximately 589 million people are affected by
diabetes, which can even be fatal [5]. Observational clinical studies have mentioned the
importance of maintaining optimal glycemic levels as a key strategy to reduce the burden
of vascular complications. Furthermore, these studies emphasize the need for the regular
monitoring and effective management of additional cardiovascular risk factors, particu-
larly blood pressure, in patients with T2D [ 6]. Natural products have been the subject
of extensive research in the management of diabetes and hypertension. Several natural
compounds and extracts have shown potential in improving blood glycemia and blood
pressure by enhancing insulin sensitivity or by promoting vasodilation [7]. It is essential to
understand that drug development involves extensive testing in preclinical studies and
multiple phases of clinical trials to ensure the pharmacological safety and efficacy of the
evaluated compound. While some approaches may show promising results in the early
stages of research, not all of them will eventually become approved treatments for diabetes
and/or cardiovascular diseases. Therefore, ongoing research and clinical trials are crucial in
bringing new and more effective drugs or natural products to the market for diabetes and
hypertension management [8]. In this research, we focused on a single species in the orchid
family, as there have been a wide variety of studies on different orchid species exploring
their pharmacological and phytochemical properties. There is a greater interest in these
plants as ornamental flowers and in the perfume and cosmetics industry; however, there
are limited studies on their pharmacological properties related to chronic diseases.
Mukherjee and Jagtap (2020) reported on up to 20 orchid species for diabetes man-
agement and other related disorders; parts of the whole plant, such as roots, leaves, pseu-
dobulbs, tubers, and chewed plant material, were prepared in decoctions and infusions [9].
These orchids are used for diabetes, hyperglycemia, and urinary problems, with Prostechea
karwinskii (Mart.) J.M.H being the most commonly used orchid in Mexico and Latin Amer-
ica. Additionally, pharmacological evidence across 17 species, supported by animal studies
and clinical trials, suggests the antidiabetic potential of orchids and related benefits such as
antihyperglycemic, antioxidant, and anti-insulin resistance, along with improvements in
retinopathy and anti-obesity effects [9]. In Mexico, Prosthechea karwinskii is traditionally
used by Indigenous communities to treat coughs, wounds, burns, and diabetes. Bioactive
compounds from this plant have been shown to reduce obesity, insulin resistance, and
cardiovascular risk in a model of metabolic syndrome [10,11]. On the other hand, studies in-
dicated that extracts from Prosthechea karwinskii showed anti-inflammatory and antioxidant
properties in a rat model, with roles played by LTB4 and nitric oxide in its gastroprotective
effect [12]. Another species, Prothechea michuacana W.E. Higgins (LaLlave & Lex), showed
nephroprotective activity in a study on cisplatin-induced acute renal failure in rats [13].
Prostachea livida (Lindl.) W.E.Higgins is an epiphytic orchid with an elliptical pseudob-
ulb and one or two apical leaves (Figure 1). It blooms throughout the year, with an apical
Pharmaceuticals 2025, 18, 881 3 of 15
inflorescence measuring 4 to 11 cm and producing 3 to 7 flowers. This orchid is found in
humid and seasonally dry forests, forming mats on trees, cacti, and rocks. It is distributed
across a number of States of Mexico, such as Chiapas, Oaxaca, San Luis Potosí, Tabasco,
Tamaulipas, and Veracruz [14].

Therefore, this study aimed to explore the pharmacological potential of Prostachea
livida (Lindl.) W.E. Higgins in the treatment of diabetes and hypertension. Given the
limited scientific evidence available on its efficacy and safety, this research focused on
the generation of 1:1 dichloromethane and methanol extracts from its bulbs to evaluate
their pharmacological effects as an adjuvant in lowering blood glucose levels, vasodilatory
effects, and toxicological profiles, thus contributing to the validation of its traditional use
by the Mexican population as a medicinal plant.
2. Results and Discussion
2.1. Oral Glucose or Sucrose Tolerance Tests
Hypertension and diabetes have a very close relationship. It is well established that
type 2 diabetes can contribute to the development of cardiovascular complications such as
hypertension, though the reverse is not true. However, the exact link between these two
diseases remains unclear [15]. Treatments are available for both hypertensive and diabetic
patients, but challenges arise when these conditions coexist or when type 2 diabetes triggers
the onset of hypertension or chronic kidney disease [ 7]. In this context, Prostachea livida
has been studied in animal models to assess its effects on diabetes and hypertension, as
well as its pharmacological safety. It is important to note that, while there is no prior
scientific evidence supporting its uses for these conditions, Prostachea livida is commonly
used in traditional Mexican medicine to treat hypertension and other ailments. Further-
more, the genus Prosthechea has been the subject of two previous ethnopharmacological
studies that have reported anti-inflammatory effects and bioactive compounds against
components of metabolic syndrome [10,11]. In our study, the oral glucose tolerance test
(OGTT) was performed; it is considered a gold-standard test for diagnosing diabetes to
estimate glucose uptake according to the World Health Organization [5,16,17]. As shown
in Figure 2, Prosthechea livida bulb extract (EDMBPl) at a dose of 100 mg/kg reduces the
percentage of glycemia variation between 30 min and 3 h, displaying an effect like that of
the positive control (glibenclamide 5 mg/kg). In addition, the fact that the extract opposes
the hyperglycemic peak indicates that the effect may be related to the inhibition of the
Na+-dependent glucose transporters or the transporter GLUT2 [ 18]. Furthermore, the
effect observed after 30 min may be attributed to secretagogue action and increased insulin
sensitivity [19]; further experiments are necessary to explore those mechanisms of action.
Subsequently, the oral sucrose tolerance test was conducted to evaluate the extract’s effect
on disaccharide hydrolysis. Intestinal disaccharidases cleave disaccharides such as sucrose
and maltose into monosaccharides. When sucrose is cleaved, glucose is released, which
Pharmaceuticals 2025, 18, 881 4 of 15
is absorbed by Na+-glucose co-transporters [20]. As shown in Figure 3, EDMBPl reduces
glycemia variation from 30 min to 3 h, comparable to the positive control group (acarbose
5 mg/kg), which inhibits α-glucosidase enzymes, which break down dimeric carbohy-
drates into monomers, such as glucose and fructose, that are absorbed into the bloodstream
for energy. Their inhibition leads to a decrease in the absorption of carbohydrates in the
gut. These results suggest that EDMBPl is associated with the inhibition of glucose uptake
from the intestinal lumen, likely due to its inhibitory effect on the intestinal α-glucosidase
complex, which plays a key role in carbohydrate digestion [21,22].

2.2. Non-Insulin-Dependent Model (NIDD) of T2 Diabetes
After observing the antihyperglycemic effect of EDMBPl in normoglycemic animals,
we evaluated its acute antidiabetic effect in an STZ-induced diabetic mouse model. As
shown in Figure 4, EDMB Pl at a dose of 100 mg/kg reduced glycemia in diabetic mice
from the first few minutes up to seven hours of experimentation, exhibiting a similar effect
to glibenclamide (5 mg/kg). This suggests that the extract may act similarly to sulfony-
lureas by stimulating insulin secretion in pancreatic β cells [23]. However, extrapancreatic
mechanisms related to insulin sensitization cannot be ruled out [24].

were tested by two-way ANOVA, followed by a Tukey test. *p = 0.04, *** p < 0.001.
2.3. Vasorelaxant Effect of EDMBPl
In addition to our experiments on diabetes, we aimed to investigate whether EDMBPl
had a hypertensive effect due to its potential relationship with this disease. Therefore,
EDMBPl was tested on rat aortic rings to evaluate its vasorelaxant effect. As shown
in Figure 5, EDMB Pl shows a concentration-dependent effect in the presence of en-
dothelium, with a maximum effect (E max) of 80.9 ± 4.7% and effective concentration
50 (EC50) of 502.5 ± 2.5 µg/mL. In the absence of endothelium, the maximum effect was
Emax = 73.9 ± 6.5% with an EC50 = 536 ± 4.6 µg/mL. The similar response observed in
both conditions suggests that the extract may exert its vasorelaxant effect directly on the
vascular smooth muscle [25].

No significant difference is seen in the percentage of relaxation in the presence and absence of the
endothelium. Each point represents the mean ± S.E.M. for five animals.
2.4. Determination of the Mechanism of Action of EDMBPl
We determined the possible mechanism of action of EDMBPl when it was added to
aortic rings lacking vascular endothelium and explored with functional experiments. First,
we explored the participation of α-adrenergic receptors (Figure 6); a non-competitive antag-
onist effect (a complete blockade of NA-induced contraction) can be observed, suggesting
a possible functional antagonism caused by a downstream interaction in post-agonist-
receptor binding signaling [26].
An intracellular calcium increase plays a role in the activation of various disease pro-
cesses, including hypertension. When calcium ions enter the cells and bind to calmodulin,
this activates the enzyme myosin light chain kinase, which then phosphorylates myosin,
allowing it to bind to actin and generate contractions [27,28].

induced by NA. Each point represents the mean ± S.E.M. for five animals. A statistical difference
was considered when * p < 0.05.
In Figure 7a, pre-incubation with the EC50 of EDMBPl followed by a concentration–
response curve (CRC) to CaCl2-induced contraction can be observed; the extract avoided
contraction, suggesting an effect on the smooth muscle of blood vessels via calcium channel
blockade [29]. This is further confirmed by the CRC for the administration of 80 mM KCl,
which led to membrane hyperpolarization through BKCa, allowing calcium entry through
Cav 1.2 calcium channels.

animals. Statistically significant differences between the treatments were tested by two-way ANOVA,
followed by a Bonferroni test. * p = 0.02, *** p < 0.001.
In this sense, EDMB Pl induced a concentration-dependent vasorelaxant effect
(Figure 7b), corroborating its ability to block calcium channels and thereby reducing vaso-
contractions. As the smooth muscle begins to relax, a comparison with the control (nifedip-
ine) shows that the EDMBPl extract has greater efficacy (Emax = 81.1 ± 2.2 %); however, it
is less potent than the positive control.
2.5. Antihypertensive Study
Therefore, EDMBPl was used to evaluate its antihypertensive effect in spontaneously
hypertensive rats (SHRs). EDMBPl did not exhibit a significant antihypertensive effect at
a dose of 100 mg/kg on the evaluated parameters (Figure 8), i.e., systolic blood pressure
(SBP), diastolic blood pressure DBP , and heart rate (HR). This lack of effect may be attributed
to factors such as the absorption, distribution, and metabolism of the extract in vivo, which
may differ from that observed in an ex vivo model.

two-way ANOVA, followed by a Tukey test.n = 6 animals.
2.6. Toxicity Assays
2.6.1. Acute Toxicity of EDMBPl
We determined safety with a study of acute and subacute toxicity. When talking about
natural products, it is common for people to associate them with safety; however, they
must be tested alone or in combination with other pharmaceutical agents [30,31]. In this
sense, to demonstrate the safety of EDMB Pl, different doses were administered. After
24 h of administration, no deaths were observed in any group. However, at the dose of
5 mg/kg, an abscess in the left arm was observed in one mouse. Due to this and following
the OECD 423 guide [32], an average dose of 25 mg/kg was evaluated, with no physical
changes or deaths observed in the mice. These results suggest that the abscess observed
in the animal were not caused by the extract but rather were likely due to the handling or
manipulation of the animals. According to the Globally Harmonized System (GHS), the
dichloromethane/methanol extract of Prosthechea livida could be tentatively classified into
Category 4, suggesting non-toxicity under certain conditions.
2.6.2. Subacute Toxicity of EDMBl
Repeated oral administration of EDMBPl (100 mg/kg/day) for 28 days did not produce
characteristic signs of toxicity in either the treated or vehicle groups. The results showed
that EDMB Pl did not cause changes in body weight, variations in organ weights, or
alterations in transaminases levels (Figures 9–11) [ 33]. Histological sections of various
organs (heart, lung, kidney, and liver) were examined to identify any cellular damage using
hematoxylin and eosin staining. As shown in Figure 12, the heart displayed no damage in
the muscle fibers (A) or nuclei (B) across all three treatment groups. Similarly, the kidney
showed no damage; the glomeruli (C), responsible for blood filtration and urine formation,
and the proximal tubules, involved in solute reabsorption and secretion, appeared normal
in all treatments. The lung also exhibited no damage to the alveoli (D) or interalveolar
septa (E), crucial for oxygen exchange with the blood. The liver, a key organ in metabolism,
required detailed analysis due to changes in transaminase activity. The micrographs in
Figure 12 reveal mild inflammation in the hepatic artery, a loss of lymphocytes near the
Pharmaceuticals 2025, 18, 881 8 of 15
portal vein (F), the presence of binuclear cells (G) indicating the active regeneration of
hepatocytes with large nuclei (H), and minimal active necrosis. Prosthechea livida has no
prior record of toxicity studies; however, this study found no mortality at different doses.
The subacute toxicity evaluation indicated no physical or behavioral changes, and the
treated animals maintained a stable weight throughout the 28 days of EDMB Pl extract
administration. Despite this, there was an increase in transaminase activity (Figure 10) and
a significant rise in liver weight (Figure 11). Histopathological analysis revealed minimal
hepatocellular lesions and signs of active regeneration of hepatocytes. Therefore, it can be
concluded that a 28-day treatment with the EDMBPl extract causes minimal liver damage.

3. Materials and Methods
3.1. Reagents and Drugs
Glucose (G7021), Sucrose (S9378), Nicotinamide (N0636), Streptozotocin (S0130) (STZ),
Acarbose (A8980), Glibenclamide, dimethylsulphoxide (DMSO), Noradrenaline hydrochlo-
ride (NA), Nifedipine, and Carbamoylcholine chloride were acquired from Sigma-Aldrich
Co. (St. Louis, MO, USA). All reagents were prepared before use.
3.2. Plant Material
Specimens of Prosthechea livida were collected in August 2019 by MBT. Enciso-Diaz in
the mountains Otontepec of Ignacio de la Llave in Veracruz State, (21◦24′13′′ N 98◦29′11′′
O/21.403611111111, −98.486388888889). A voucher specimen (OE-009) was identified and
deposited in the herbarium of the Veracruzana University. Only the pseudobulbs of these
specimens were used, which were dry and ground.
3.3. Plant Material and Preparation of EDMBPl
Maceration extraction was developed with 81 g dry material and ground in a mechan-
ical grinder; the solvents employed were a mixture of dichloromethane and methanol (50%
v/v), each for 72 h (three times). Later, the macerated was filtered, and a liquid extract was
obtained. The solvent was then removed using a rotary evaporator until a dry extract was
obtained (R-200, Buchi Labortechnik AG, Flawil, Switzerland).
3.4. Pharmacology Assays
3.4.1. Animals
Male ICR mice (25–30 g) were used, organized into groups of five or six animals
for antidiabetic and toxicological experiments. The vasorelaxant effect was evaluated
using male Wistar rats weighing between 250 and 300 g. To assess the antihypertensive
activity, spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs) weighing between 300 and 350 g were
used, following the provisions of the Official Mexican Standard NOM-062-ZOO-1999
and protocol number B11-20, approved by the Ismael Cosío Villegas National Institute of
Respiratory Diseases Ethics Committee.
3.4.2. Oral Glucose or Sucrose Tolerance Tests
A population of 18 mice was used, which were fasted for 8 h with free access to
water. Subsequently, 3 experimental groups were formed (n = 6 each). The initial blood
glucose (T0) was measured with a glucometer (Accu-Chek guide, Roche, Basel, Switzer-
land) for each group, the positive control group (glibenclamide 5 mg/kg or acarbose
3 mg/kg), the EDMBPl group (100 mg/kg), and the vehicle group (Tween 80, 10% v/v),
30 min after oral glucose or sucrose (2 g/kg) was administered. Additionally, blood
samples were collected from the caudal vein 0, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, and 3 h after the adminis-
tration of the vehicle, positive control, and extract. The percentage variation in glycemia
for each group was calculated concerning the initial (0 h) value, according to the for-
mula: %Variation of glycemia = [(Gx − G0)/G0] × 100, where G0 represented the initial
glycemia values, and Gx represented the glycemia values at each time, as described [34].
3.4.3. Acute Antidiabetic Effect of EDMBPl
Experimental Diabetic Model
The animals were fasted for 8 h before starting the administration, and subsequently
nicotinamide (40 mg/kg) was administered intraperitoneally. After 15 min, streptozotocin
(100 mg/kg) dissolved in citrate buffer at pH 4.5 was administered through the same via.
After two weeks, hyperglycemia was established by higher blood glucose, which was
Pharmaceuticals 2025, 18, 881 11 of 15
monitored by a commercial glucometer (Accu-Check guide ®, Basel, Switzerland). The
animals selected for the study were those with blood glucose above 140 mg/dL. Animals
were divided into three groups: the vehicle group, orally administered with Tween80 at
10%; the positive control glibenclamide group (5 mg/kg); and the third group, which
received EDMBPl (100 mg/kg). Blood samples were collected from the caudal vein 0
(fasting blood glucose), 1, 3, 5, and 7 h after administration. The percentage variation in
glycemia was determined concerning the blood glucose at 0 h, according to the equation
mentioned above, with some modifications [34].
3.4.4. Preparation of Aortic Rings
Aortic rings (3–5 mm) were obtained free of connective tissue and fat (in some rings,
the endothelium was removed) and suspended by platinum hooks under an optimal tension
of 3 g in a Krebs solution (composition was mM: NaCl, 118; KCl, 4.7; CaCl2, 2.5; MgSO4,
1.2; KH2PO4, 1.2; NaHCO3, 25.0; EDTA, 0.026; glucose, 11.1, pH 7.4), maintained at 37◦C in
at atmosphere of 95% O2 and 5% CO2. Isometric tension was measured and recorded using
Grass-FT03 force transducers (Astromed®, West Warwick, RI, USA) connected to an MP100
analyzer (Biopac® Instruments, Santa Barbara, CA, USA) (Vergara-Galicia, et al. [25]).
3.4.5. Vasorelaxant Effect of EDMBPl
The aortic rings with and without endothelium were pre-contracted with NA (0.1 µM)
for 15 min, then EDMB Pl was cumulatively added in different concentrations with
1000 µg/mL every 3 min. Finally, the contractile effect induced by NA and the vasorelaxant
effect of EDMBPl were compared with the control groups (nifedipine and carbachol) [29].
3.4.6. Determination of the Mechanism of EDMBPl
For this purpose, three sets of experiments were designed [26].
Participation of α-Adrenergic Receptors
Endothelium-denuded aortic rings were incubated with 502 µg/mL of EDMBPl for
15 min, and then NA was cumulatively added at different concentrations (0.1 nM to 1µM)
Finally, the contractile effect induced by NA was compared in the absence (control group)
and presence of the extract.
Effect of EDMBPl on Blockade of Ca2+ Channels
Endothelium-denuded aortic rings were isolated from rats and washed with Krebs
solution with KCl (80 mM). Once a plateau was attained, the CRC of EDMBPl-induced
relaxation was obtained by adding cumulative concentrations of the extract to the bath
(502 µg/mL).
Effect of EDMBPl on Extracellular Ca2+-Induced Contraction Activated by KCl
To determine whether the inhibition of extracellular Ca 2+ influx was involved in
EDMBPl-induced relaxation, experiments were carried out in a Ca2+-free Krebs solution.
Endothelium-denuded aortic rings were washed with Ca2+-free solution (30 min) and then
rinsed with Ca2+-free solution containing KCl (80 mM). The cumulative CRCs for CaCl2
(80 µM to 27 mM) were obtained in the absence of EDMBPl (control group) or after 30 min
incubation with the test sample (502 µg/mL). Finally, the contractile effect induced by
CaCl2 was compared to the absence (control group) and presence of EDMBPl.

3.5. In Vivo Experiments
Antihypertensive Study
An antihypertensive activity study of EDMBPl was conducted in SHRs. Animals were
allotted into three groups (six animals each): control rats (CR, group 1), positive control
(amlodipine 5 mg/kg, group 2), and treated rats (EDMB Pl 100 mg/kg, group 3). The
treated group received a single intragastric dose of EDMBPl (100 mg/kg). Measurements
[blood pressure and heart rate (HR)] were recorded before and after the treatment of the test
compound at 0, 1, 3, 5, and 7 h using a tail cuff method (LE 5001 automatic blood pressure
meter, (PanLab™ Harvard Apparatus, Barcelona, Spain)). The percentage decrease in HR,
SBP , and DBP was calculated.
3.6. Toxicity Assays
3.6.1. Acute Toxicity of EDMBPl
Male mice of the ICR strain were used; they were divided into 5 groups of 5 animals
with test doses (5, 25, 50, 300, and 2000 mg/kg) of EDMBPl. The animals were fasted for 4 h
before the test. The animals were observed individually after administration for the first
30 min and during the following 24 h. They were then observed daily for 14 days. At the
end of this period, the number of deaths was determined as % mortality. Finally, according
to the results of the extract, it was categorized as established by the Global Harmonization
System (GHS) guide [35].
3.6.2. Subacute Toxicity of EDMBPl
Male mice of the ICR strain were used and divided into 3 groups of 5 animals, a control
group (tween 80 at 10%), a sham group, and the test dose (100 mg/kg), using repeated
doses each 24 h for 28 days, weighting each group, and at 29 days, when euthanasia was per-
formed [36]. The main organs were isolated (heart, liver, lung, and kidney) from each mouse
from the experimental and control groups and weighted for the calculation of the rela-
tive organ weight, calculated as (% relative weight = organ weight/body weight × 100%).
The blood from the heart was obtained by cardiac puncture and processed to obtain
plasma, and the activity of alanine transaminase (ALT) and aspartate transaminase (AST)
were determined.
3.6.3. Histology
For the staining of the histological sections of the isolated organs, tissue preparation
was carried out: the tissues were placed in formalin, and later they were washed and
dehydrated in a series of alcohol concentrations, then they were placed in xylol to remove
excess alcohol and later placed in molten paraffin, which, once dry, was cut into blocks.
The sections were made with a microtome with a thickness of 4 µm and were placed on a
slide, passed again through xylol and a series of alcohols to pass through the hematoxylin
and eosin stain, washed, and placed in a fixative and a coverslip. Hematoxylin and eosin
allowed us to see the nuclei of the cells to determine whether any damage could be observed.
Histological slides were examined with a microscope (Zeiss 40×, Oberkochen, Germany).
3.7. Statistics
The results are presented as mean ± standard error of the mean (SEM). Data was
analyzed by two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by Tukey’s test. Statistical
analyses were performed with Graphpad-prism 2018 software (https://www.graphpad.
com/scientific-software/prism/, accessed on 22 April 2024). A statistical difference was
considered significant when p < 0.05.

4. Conclusions
The use of NPs for diabetes and hypertension management remains a promising area
of research. Our findings indicate that Prosthechea livida (Lindl.) W.E.Higgins , an orchid
species with no previously reported studies, holds significant potential as a source of
bioactive metabolites for managing these conditions. EDMBPl demonstrated a regulatory
effect on glycemia and exhibited a favorable pharmacological safety profile. Addition-
ally, EDMBPl induced vasorelaxation in rat aortic rings via an endothelium-independent
mechanism, possibly through the blockade of Ca2+ channels. These results represent the
first evidence that Prosthechea livida (Lindl.) W.E.Higgins can promote glucose uptake and
improve blood pressure in ex vivo models. Given its dual action on glycemia and vascular
tone, EDMBPl may serve as a promising candidate in the development of new therapeutic
agents targeting metabolic and cardiovascular disorders. Future studies will aim to eluci-
date its precise molecular mechanisms, assess its in vivo efficacy, evaluate its potential in
preclinical models of diabetes and hypertension, and carry out phytochemical analyses to
identify the compounds responsible for these effects.
