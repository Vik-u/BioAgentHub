During the last decade the use ofω-transaminases has been
identified as a very powerful method for the preparation of
optically pure amines from the corresponding ketones. Their
immense potential for the preparation of chiral amines, to-
gether with their ease of use in combination with existing
biocatalytic methods, have made these biocatalysts a com-
petitor to any chemical methodology for (asymmetric) amin-
ation. An increasing number of examples, especially from in-
1. Introduction
An ω-transaminase catalyzes the deamination of a pri-
mary amine (amine donor) and the concomitant amination
of a ketone or aldehyde (amine acceptor), which results in
a reaction in which an amino moiety is transferred between
two molecules (Scheme 1).
[1] Unlike α-transaminases, ω-
transaminases are not restricted to α-amino and α-keto
acids but can aminate virtually any ketone or aldehyde
functionality and deaminate in theory any prim-amine; con-
sequently they are also referred to as amine transami-
nases.
[2] For the transamination reaction the enzyme re-
quires pyridoxal 5 /H11032-phosphate (PLP, 1) as cofactor, acting
as an intermediate amine acceptor and electron sink (see
mechanism, Section 3). Because the amination/deamination
is reversible, ω-transaminases can be used for the prepara-
tion of optically pure amines in two fashions: either (a) by
kinetic resolution, in which one enantiomer of a racemic
amine is converted into the corresponding ketone, leaving
the desired amine enantiomer untouched (Scheme 1, a), or,
more preferred, (b) in an asymmetric synthesis starting
from the prochiral ketone (Scheme 1, b). The substrates and
products of the reaction (amine donor and acceptor, prod-
uct, co-product) exist in equilibrium which each other,
which – depending on the substrates’ and products’ natu-
res – might require reaction engineering or follow-up reac-
tions to shift the reaction to the product side. Because, from

existing chemical processes by its simple and flexible nature.
In the last few years numerous publications and patents on
synthetic routes, mainly to pharmaceuticals, involving ω-
transaminases have been published. The review gives an
overview of the application of ω-transaminases in organic
synthesis with a focus on active pharmaceutical ingredients
(APIs) and the developments during the last few years.
a thermodynamic point of view, pyruvate is an ideal amine
acceptor, ω-transaminases were at first mainly employed in
kinetic resolution. The development of process-adapted en-
zymes or methods to shift the equilibrium launched the suc-
cess of this biocatalytic method for the synthesis of amines.
The obtained (chiral) amines represent highly valuable tar-
get molecules, because they are precursors for numerous

synthetic targets, variously for the pharmaceutical industry
(alkaloids etc.), the polymer area (e.g., carbamates, polyure-
thanes), or for plant protection [e.g., (+)-dihydropinidine].
It is worth noting that chiral amines can alternatively be
prepared by employing other type of biocatalysts such as
monoamine oxidases, amine dehydrogenases, and imine re-
ductases; this has been the subject of other recent re-
views.
[1c,3]
2. The Early Days ...
Although the first records concerning ω-transaminases
date back about 50 years,[4] it took until the end of the last
century for these enzymes to be spotted as possible catalysts
for synthetic applications. The company Celgene demon-
strated the first enantioselective production of chiral amines
through kinetic resolution of a racemate on a 2.5 m
3 scale.[5]
At around the same time investigations into ω-transamin-
ases for synthetic applications also started in academia, re-
vealing that one of the major problems to overcome was
shifting the equilibrium, especially in the case of asymmet-
ric synthesis (Scheme 1, b), as well as inhibition by certain
carbonyl compounds.
[6] In order to circumvent inhibition,
the kinetic resolution was performed in a biphasic system
with removal of the inhibiting ketone byproduct obtained
from the deaminated amine enantiomer from the aqueous
reaction medium. Two years later, the energy barrier that
had to be overcome in asymmetric synthesis was addressed
(Scheme 1, b).
[7] The target amine was only observed in
/H1102110 % yield with use of conventional amine donors, al-
though up to 30 % conversion was reached when more
elaborate or chiral amines were tested as donors. Sub-
sequently a membrane reactor was employed to minimize

did her master’s thesis under the supervision of Prof. W. Kroutil onω-transaminases. After completing her master’s
studies in 2014 she is now working on her PhD in the same group.
Wolfgang Kroutil is professor at the University of Graz, Austria. He did his master’s studies at the TU Graz and his
doctoral studies at the University of Exeter (S. M. Roberts) and TU Graz (Kurt Faber). After a postdoc in industry
(Syngenta) he worked as an R&D manager (Krems Chemie). In 2000 he became an assistant prof. at the University of
Graz, in 2003 associate and in 2013 full professor. His research interests are in shortening chemical syntheses or in making
them more efficient by using biocatalysts. Bio-oxidation and -reduction, C–C bond formation, cascades, and systems
biocatalysis are some of his research topics.

inhibition by the ketone in a kinetic resolution. [8] However,
none of these developments competed in any way with the –
in those days dominant – ChiPros processes, which employ
lipases and run at BASF .
[9] Nevertheless, these initial studies
marked a milestone in the biocatalytic approach to chiral
amines and represent the finding and the identification of
the hurdles that had to be jumped in order to achieve versa-
tile and applicable synthetic processes.
3. General Developments and Challenges
At the beginning of the millennium, these initial studies
began to attract the attention of several other researchers
in the biocatalytic field. Various groups focused on the
asymmetric synthesis of amines with the aid of ω-transami-
nases – 50 years after the first finding of this class of en-
zymes. The main challenge in the amination of ketones with
alanine, an amine donor widely accepted by the enzymes, is
the unfavorable equilibrium constant (e.g., for the trans-
amination of acetophenone with alanine an equilibrium
constant of 8.81 /H1100310
–4 has been determined). [7,10] This
means that the equilibrium is far on side of the starting
materials and only very small amounts of the desired amine
product are obtained (usually /H110215 %).
[7]
Using an excess of the amine donor was only effective
for selected substrates. For instance, 4-methoxyphenylacet-
one was transformed into the desired amine with 94 % con-
version with use of a 16-fold excess of alanine,
[11] but most
other substrates gave generally rather poor levels of conver-
sion.
[7] Using other amine donors (e.g., 1-aminotetralin) im-
proved the levels of conversion slightly, but no general ap-
proach could be identified and most case studies reported
highly substrate-dependent transamination reactions.
The Industrial Age of Biocatalytic Transamination
A first efficient method for equilibrium displacement was
the removal of pyruvate – the co-product formed from the
amine donor alanine – by use of a lactate dehydrogenase
(LDH).
[7] The LDH converts the pyruvate into lactic acid
at the expense of NADH (nicotinamide adenine dinucleo-
tide). For the recycling of NADH established methods can
be exploited.
[12] In most cases a glucose dehydrogenase
(GDH) in combination with glucose is used nowadays
(Scheme 1, b, pathway I).
[13] The reaction conditions, such
as the pH range of the transaminase and the recycling en-
zyme, must be compatible and a pH shift due to the formed
byproduct (e.g., gluconic acid) has to be considered.
In another approach a pyruvate decarboxylase removes
the pyruvate co-product (Scheme 1, b, pathway II).
[10] The
formed pyruvate is decarboxylated and the equilibrium is
pulled to the product side, delivering the amine in average
to good yields (results are comparable to those obtained
with the LDH system). A significant drawback of this ap-
proach is the formation of acetaldehyde through the decar-
boxylation process, because acetaldehyde competes with the
substrate to be aminated, leading to ethylamine as side
product.
Other efforts focused on the physical removal of the
formed co-product. By using 2-propylamine as amine do-
nor and running the reaction at elevated temperatures, the
co-product acetone can be removed by evaporation. High
levels of conversion as well as perfect enantioselectivities
can be obtained (Scheme 1, b, pathway III).
[5a,13b,14]
To avoid high concentrations of possibly disruptive co-
products, recycling of pyruvate to alanine with the aid of
an alanine dehydrogenase was envisioned.
[15] This recycles
the formed pyruvate back to l-alanine at the expense of
ammonia and NADH (see Scheme 1, b, pathway IV). Recy-
cling of the nicotinamide cofactor was achieved by em-
ploying ammonium formate (which additionally also serves
as a nitrogen source) and a formate dehydrogenase (FDH).
If the complete reaction sequence is considered, this ap-
proach constitutes a formal asymmetric reductive amin-
ation at the expense of ammonia and formate, yielding chi-
ral primary amines.
[13b,16] In the parlance of conventional
organic chemistry, this approach represents a biocatalytic,
asymmetric version of the Leuckart–Wallach reaction, a
highly efficient reaction frequently used to access amines. It
is worth noting that the transition-metal-catalyzed version
of the same reaction uses precious rhodium catalysts that
either give mixtures of the primary amine, the correspond-
ing alcohol, and the carbamate,
[17] or require expensive li-
gand systems.[18] The outlined biocatalytic version delivered
the chiral amines in high yields (mainly /H1102290 %) and with
perfect stereoselectivies as the sole products after extrac-
tion. Very recently the amination of ketones just at the ex-
pense of NH
3 and molecular hydrogen was described, with
a related system in which FDH/formate were substituted
by a hydrogenase and molecular hydrogen.
[19] The [NiFe]-
dehydrogenase reduces the oxidized NAD + cofactor to
NADH at the expense of H2 (2 bar). The S-selective biocat-
alysts gave reasonable results (77–98 % conv., ee 92–99)
whereas the R-selective transaminations were more sensitive
Eur. J. Org. Chem.2015, 6965–6982 © 2015 The Authors. Published by Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim www.eurjoc.org 6967
to the reaction conditions (conv. 32–94 conv.,ee /H1102299); nev-
ertheless, the [NiFe]-dehydrogenase is currently not compet-
itive with established methods.
These reports brought ω-transaminases to the attention
of the chemical community, because optically pure primary
amines became accessible in a single reaction step from the
corresponding ketones. However, one of the challenges for
this enzyme-catalyzed amination was, and partially still re-
mains, the amination of sterically demanding ketones pos-
sessing two bulky substituents (“bulky-bulky ketones”).
Nevertheless, researchers at Merck/Codexis have subjected
an R-selective transaminase from Arthrobacter sp. to di-
rected evolution to provide a variant that accepts bulky-
bulky substrates. They successfully applied it to an im-
proved and more efficient production of sitagliptin ( 2, Fig-
ure 1), and outperformed the previously established transi-
tion-metal-catalyzed process by significantly shortening the
synthetic route to this important drug in diabetes treatment
(for details see Section 5.2).
[14]
Figure 1. An ω-transaminase variant produced by directed evo-
lution enabled the stereoselective amination of a bulky-bulky
ketone for the production of sitagliptin (2), a drug used in the treat-
ment of type II diabetes.
Unfortunately, noS-selective transaminase that generally
accepts such bulky-bulky ketones has yet been described;[20]
nevertheless, initial attempts have been made to engineer
an S-selective transaminase, extending the tolerance from
methyl to propyl and hydroxymethyl.
[21] Therefore, further
efforts to generate S-selective variants could have a signifi-
cant impact, because a more general and broadly applicable
concept for the biocatalytic asymmetric amination of
ketones would be established.
Notably,ω-transaminases can be exploited for regioselec-
tive conversion of a single ketone moiety in a di- or even
triketone system in a more complex molecule. This regiose-
lective approach has been applied to the asymmetric synthe-
sis of all four diastereoisomers of dihydropinidine
(Scheme 2, a).
[22] The diastereoselective reduction of the im-
ine precursor can subsequently be achieved by use either of
Pd/C in the presence of hydrogen ( cis diastereoisomers) or
of LiAlH
4 in the presence of a Lewis acid (e.g., Et 3Al).
Another important aspect – aside from the shift of the
equilibrium – is the identification of the appropriate cata-
lyst. Especially when it comes to the creation of variant li-
braries, fast and reliable detection methods to identify the
best catalyst are essential.
Alongside other protocols, a protocol involving the lact-
ate dehydrogenase/glucose dehydrogenase system for rapid
identification of potential hits among the transaminase en-

zymes has been reported recently. [23] Glucose is converted
into gluconic acid during recycling of the NADH cofactor.
The change in the pH – due to the acidic coproduct – can
be monitored with an appropriate pH-sensitive dye (e.g.,
phenol red). Even quantitative results can be read out from
96-well microtiter plates with a plate reader.
In another approach the amine donor ortho-xylylenedi-
amine ( 3a) gives the corresponding aminoaldehyde 3b,
which spontaneously undergoes a 5- exo-trig cyclization
(Scheme 2, b).
[24] The formed byproduct rearranges to the
energetically more favored aromatic isoindole. The isoind-
ole polymerizes, resulting in colored derivatives and thus
simplifying the identification of positive hits in the tested
library. It is noteworthy that, because the amine donor
spontaneously undergoes the outlined “degradation” after
reaction, no other system is required to shift the equilib-
rium.
In another approach a direct UV-based assay for the de-
tection of acetophenone ( ε =1 2m m
–1cm–1 at 245 nm) was
envisaged. With this assay, reaction conditions can be opti-
mized very quickly. Nevertheless, the method is substrate-
dependent and suffers from interference with the aromatic
amino acid residues of the protein.
[25]
In another assay using glyoxylate as the amine acceptor,
the formed glycine was oxidized back to glyoxylate by a
glycine oxidase (Scheme 2, c). The formed hydrogen perox-
ide was detected by a colorimetric assay based on horserad-
ish peroxidase (HRP). This approach allows the quick iden-
tification of active enzymes, especially because it can be em-
ployed as a solid-phase test by use of nitrocellulose mem-
branes.
[26]

The first R-selective ω-transaminases described by acade-
mia were identified by a computational approach. The cru-
cial amino acids for catalysis having been determined, the
Brookhaven protein database (PDB) was screened electroni-
cally.
[27] By that subtle approach seventeen R-selective ω-
transaminases were identified, representing a milestone for
the identification of R-selective enzymes,
[28] and were then
successfully applied for asymmetric synthesis. [29]
In another approach to identifying a suitable transamin-
ase quickly, a mix of eight amine donors and seven ac-
ceptors was subjected to enzyme transformation in a one-
pot procedure. Analysis of the ketone composition after in-
cubation gave a simple overview of which compounds were
transformed. This allowed the affinities of the different sub-
strates to the enzymes to be determined quickly, and the
catalysts could be arrayed more rapidly with respect to their
substrate scope.
[30]
Another important feature of ω-transaminases is that
they do not only work in buffer but also in organic sol-
vents.
[31,32] For instance, transaminases work in organic sol-
vents such as methyl tert-butyl ether (MTBE) and isopropyl
acetate, with the water activity of the organic solvent used
being of high importance for the reaction outcome.
[32] In
particular, substrates leading to amines, which can form in-
tramolecular hydrogen bonds to a neighboring group, were
transformed with high conversion employing a crude en-
zyme preparation (not immobilized). Other substrates were
converted at slower rates. The stereopreference and -selec-
tivity were not altered in organic media in relation to the
results obtained in buffer. Using an immobilized crude en-
zyme preparation improved the conversion significantly: 1-
The Industrial Age of Biocatalytic Transamination
phenylethylamine, for example, was formed in 87 % yield,
whereas the system without immobilization gave roughly
40 %, even after extended reaction times.
[31] Although or-
ganic solvents seem to be rather appealing, the formation
of the imine between, for example, the substrate ketone and
amine donor in an additional equilibrium reaction has to
be considered.
Aldehydes are superb substrates too and have in particu-
lar been aminated in cascade reactions, in which they were
formed as reactive intermediates by another biocatalyst
through oxidation of a primary alcohol.
[33] For example,
galactose oxidase from Fusarium NRRL 2903 was used to
oxidize allylic and benzylic alcohols to the corresponding
aldehydes at the expense of innocent molecular oxygen
(Scheme 3, a).
[33a] The reaction sequence was completed by
the transamination of the intermediate, yielding the pri-
mary amine. All reactions were run simultaneously in one-
pot fashion, so all biocatalysts were mutually compatible.
In a “borrowing hydrogen” approach the abstracted hydride
of the oxidation step is recycled in the subsequent reductive
amination. Thus, an alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) is used
to oxidize the primary alcohol to the aldehyde at the ex-
pense of NAD
+ to give NADH (Scheme 3, b). [33c] The
formed NADH is reused for the subsequent transamination
reaction (recycling of the alanine cofactor), giving back
NAD
+ for the next oxidation. The result is a redox-self-
sufficient process, which formally aminates the alcohol only
at the expense of ammonium chloride, circumventing the
need for any additional redox reagents.
This approach has been further extended to a biocata-
lytic system for the preparation of hydrolyzed ε-caprolac-
tam, the monomer of nylon (Scheme 3, c).
[33b] This system
additionally contained a Baeyer–Villiger monooxygenase
and an esterase. Again it was shown that all of these biocat-
alysts function in each other’s presence. Comparable chemi-
cal approaches require sophisticated transition-metal cata-
lysts, and high temperature and pressure are unavoidable.
[34]
It is notable that no comparable one-pot route to ε-capro-
lactam by chemical approaches has been reported.
The biocatalytic sequence to aminate primary alcohols
was also extended to secondary alcohols (Scheme 3, d,
Table 1). However, the lower reactivity of the transaminase
towards the ketone, as well as the additional complexity
due to a chiral starting material, required more elaborate
enzymatic systems in order to achieve good levels of conver-
sion.
[35] Either a NADH oxidase (NOX) or a lactate dehy-
drogenase system was required for an efficient amination.
Recent studies have established the potential of ω-trans-
aminases for the dynamic kinetic resolution of α-chiral 2-
phenylpropanals, which are converted into the correspond-
ing β-chiral amines. The stereocenter of the aldehyde pre-
cursor is prone to racemization under the reaction condi-
tions, so up to full conversion can be obtained with ee val-
ues up to 98 %
[36] (Scheme 4).
Additionally, ω-transaminases have been successfully em-
ployed in flow chemistry. The enzyme – immobilized on
polymeric methacrylate beads – was shown to be a perfect
catalytic system: pumping the substrate, dissolved in

and the limited cartridge size (0.5 mL volume) at substrate
concentrations of 25–50 m m resulted in a productivity of
the process of only 50 μmol h–1 (corresponds to 12 mmol
within 10 d). Nevertheless, the proof of the concept and the
successful implementation of ω-transaminases into a flow
process have been provided.
[37]
4. Mechanism and Active Site
To allow a general understanding of the mode of the
transamination, the mechanism is discussed below. [38] The
crucial molecule for the reaction is the cofactor PLP ( 1),
together with its reductively aminated form PMP ( 5,
pyridoxamine 5 /H11032-phosphate). In its resting state, PLP ( 1)
forms a Schiff base with a lysine residue in the enzyme
backbone ( A in Scheme 5). The C=N bond of the Schiff
base is attacked by the substrate amine, leading to imine
formation between substrate amine and PLP ( B). This at-
tack is facilitated by a water molecule in the active site and
the phenolic oxygen of the PLP ( 1) molecule.
[39] The phen-
The Industrial Age of Biocatalytic Transamination
olic hydroxy group in the ortho-position stabilizes the Schiff
base in both cases through a hydrogen bond. A suitably
orientated lysine residue then abstracts the proton at the
amine carbon, which has become more acidic due to the
imine formation, formally creating a carbanion. The proton
abstraction initiates isomerization to the resonance methide
form (D), which is quenched and rearomatized by the pro-
ton of the base from the first deprotonation step (structure
E). The newly formed imine is hydrolyzed, releasing the
ketone product and an enzyme-PMP complex ( F), which is
ready for transferring the amino group to another ketone
substrate by the reverse pathway, because all steps in the
mechanism are reversible. The outlined mechanism has re-
cently been investigated by DFT calculations on an active
site model, which led to similar conclusions.
[39]
A very important feature of the cofactor is its pyridine
nitrogen, because the heterocycle, especially in its proton-
ated form, can stabilize the postulated methide form ( D)o f
the cofactor, which is required for efficient catalysis. For
example, if deaza-PLP (6) is used as cofactor, the enzymatic
activity drops by four to nine orders of magnitude. This
also reveals another mechanistic detail, because the reaction
can be tuned by the strength of the corresponding acid,
which protonates the cofactor, allowing nature to adjust the
reactivity of the enzyme in question.
[40,41]
The substrate binding – in terms of chiral information
transfer – is based on a large (L) pocket and a small (S)
pocket in the active site (see Figure 2). The basic residue
that assists the 1,3-prototropic shift is usually the amine
arm of a lysine, which also binds the PLP cofactor prior to
the entry of the substrate into the active site.

was prepared with Pymol (vs. 0.99rc6)].
These mechanistic investigations have also triggered
interest in biomimetic catalytic systems, leading to investi-
gation of an asymmetric transamination catalyzed by chiral
Lewis acids (e.g., compound 7), albeit with low enantio-
selectivities (/H1102146 % ee, Scheme 6).
[43]
Recent X-ray structures of various transaminases [44] and
the understanding of the substrate binding have opened the
door for rational protein engineering. For example, two
variants of the V . fluvialistransaminase that can convert
bulky-bulky ketones were developed (although only a nar-
row substrate spectrum was presented). The key mutations
were two amino acid residues in the small pocket of the
active site: a valine was changed to an alanine and a tyr-
osine was mutated to phenylalanine. Through these mu-
tations the small pocket chamber was extended in order to
tolerate bulkier residues.
[21]
The same enzyme was used to convert 3-methylcy-
clohexan-1-one into the corresponding amines (for details
M. Fuchs, J. E. Farnberger, W . KroutilMICROREVIEW
see Scheme 7 and Section 5.1). The wild-type enzyme
showed only modest diastereoselectivity (14 % de), whereas
the L56V variant of the enzyme gave the ( R)-amine with
66 % de. Even more interesting was the fact that changing
the same leucine for isoleucine (L56I) inverted the stereo-
preference towards the ( S)-amine, with 70 % de.
[45]
5. Applications
Thanks to the broad substrate scope of ω-transaminases
(ω-TAs), their usually high turnover rate, and their remark-
able stereoselectivity, along with their environmentally
friendly reaction setups, ω-TAs are considered a convenient
alternative to classical chemical approaches for the asym-
metric synthesis of valuable amine building blocks and bio-
active compounds. ω-TA-catalyzed reactions represent key
steps in a wide range of chemo-enzymatic syntheses and,
thanks to their compatibility with other enzymes, they are
often employed in multiple-enzyme cascade reactions.
5.1. Multiple-Enzyme Cascade Reactions Involvingω-TAs
In the last few years, ω-TA-catalyzed reactions have been
combined with other enzymatic transformations in concur-
rent one-pot processes for the preparation of highly func-
tionalized molecules.
[1b,46] Such multi-enzymatic cascades
offer various advantages, such as shortened reaction times
and a reduced number of workup steps, allowing high
atom-efficiency.
ω-TAs have been combined, for example, with an enoate
reductase for the synthesis of 3-methyl-cyclohexylamines
amines containing two stereocenters.
[47] Through the em-
ployment of an engineered ω-TA in the presence of an or-
ganic co-solvent (30 % DMSO) a diastereoselective re-
duction/transamination sequence was successfully per-
formed in one-pot fashion (89 % de max., Scheme 7,b).
ω-TAs have also been successfully combined with other
biocatalysts such as transketolases, lyases, and hydrolases
with particular regard to the formation and cleavage of C–
C bonds. In a recent example, anω-TA was applied together
with a thiamine-diphosphate-dependent (ThDP-dependent)
transketolase in two sequential steps for the production of
various amino alcohols on a preparative scale (100 mL,
300 mm substrate concentration).
[48] Vicinal amino alcohols
are highly valuable intermediates for various pharmaceuti-
cal compounds as well as synthons in organic syntheses.
[49]
Therefore, this cascade was employed for the preparation
of the drugs (1 R,2R)-norpseudoephedrine (NPE, 10) and
(1R,2S)-norephedrine (NE, 10) by starting from the inex-
pensive substrates pyruvate and benzaldehyde (Scheme 8,
a).
[50] In the first step these two molecules were coupled
together by the ThDP-dependent lyase acetohydroxyacid
synthase I (AHAS-I) to yield ( R)-phenylcarbinol (11). This
intermediate keto alcohol was then directly aminated by
one of two stereocomplementary ω-TAs, giving access
either to (1R,2R)-NPE or to (1R,2S)-NE in high yields and
with perfect optical purity. The coproduct pyruvate – which
www.eurjoc.org © 2015 The Authors. Published by Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim Eur. J. Org. Chem.2015, 6965–69826972
is produced in the transamination reaction – was removed
through its consumption as the substrate in the first reac-
tion step.
However, this approach is not suitable for the prepara-
tion of the complementary (1 S,2S)-10 or (1 S,2R)-10, be-
cause of the lack of an enzyme that affords ( S)-11 with suf-
ficient optical purity. As a consequence, a recent report pro-
vides an alternative reaction sequence to overcome this
limitation.
[51] 1-Phenylpropane-1,2-dione (12) was used as
starting material and was converted into all four N(P)E iso-
mers in two sequential steps by combining an ω-TA and
an ADH. Thereby, full stereochemical control was achieved
through the stereopreferences of the two enzymes
(Scheme 8, b).
Very recently, 1,3-amino alcohols were accessed by oxi-
dative kinetic resolution of keto alcohol 50 by a ketoreduct-
ase in the first step (Scheme 8, c). The oxidized diketone 51
was separated and reduced to ( S)-50. Subsequent trans-
amination with the appropriate biocatalyst yielded each of
the four diastereomers of 52 in optically pure form.
[52]
Another concept involves the stereoselective hydrolytic
C–C bond cleavage of prochiral bicyclic β-diketones by a
hydrolase. After bond cleavage as the first step, the esterifi-
cation of the newly formed free acid with MeOH is cata-
lyzed by a CAL-B lipase. Subsequently, an ω-TA converts
the ketone moiety into the corresponding amine with per-
fect diastereoselectivity in the final step of the three-step
cascade. By this approach the corresponding cyclohex-
ylamines could be obtained in either cis or trans configura-
tions in moderate to high yields (Scheme 9).
[53]
Multi-enzymatic cascades also play a significant role in
the deracemization of rac-amines. One example of such a
deracemization is the combination of two stereocomple-
mentary ω-TAs in a one-pot, two-step fashion, which was
successfully applied for the preparation of a broad range of
α-chiral amines in optically pure form (Scheme 10, a).
[54]
Firstly, an R-selective ω-TA transformed one enantiomer
into the corresponding ketone, whereas the S enantiomer
remained untouched. In this process pyruvate had to be em-
ployed in stoichiometric amounts, serving as an amine ac-
ceptor and forming d-alanine as byproduct. After 24 h a
second, S-selective ω-TA was added in order to convert the
obtained ketone into the (S)-amine, thus leading to a single
enantiomer. Because the order of the ω-TAs can be in-
verted, both enantiomers can be prepared with high yields
and perfect stereoselectivities. In initial studies, this one-pot
stepwise deracemization methodology only yielded good re-
sults when the biocatalyst from the first reaction step was
inactivated by heat treatment after the kinetic resolution
had been completed. Otherwise it interfered with the stereo-
complementary ω-TA in the second step and therefore the
optical purity of the final amine product was decreased.
The applicability of this procedure was demonstrated for
the deracemization of the antiarrhythmic drug mexiletine
(13) on preparative scale (100 mg).
[55]
In order to circumvent the heat deactivation procedure,
the first step of the cascade was performed with an immobi-
lized ω-TA (solid support: sol-gel/celite matrix) in a subse-

Scheme 10. a) One-pot, two-step cascade employing two stereocomplementary ω-TAs for the deracemization of racemic amines. b) The
procedure was successfully applied for the preparation of both enantiomers of mexiletine ( 13).
To reduce the amount of pyruvate required for the first
step (kinetic resolution) an amino acid oxidase ( l-o r d-
AAO) was introduced to catalyze the recycling of the
formed l-o r d-alanine to pyruvate.
[23,55] This minimizes the
amount of the co-substrate to catalytic amounts and im-
proves the overall efficiency of the reaction (Scheme 10, b).
Nevertheless, an approach that allows the interference of
the stereocomplementary enzymes to be avoided relies on
a correct and smart selection of the amine acceptor/donor
system.
[57] By using α-ketoglutarate instead of pyruvate as
amine acceptor for the S-selective catalyst both the de-
amination and amination steps can be performed simulta-
neously, because α-ketoglutarate is not accepted by the R-
selective ω-TA.
A different concept for deracemization of amines takes
advantage of the hydrolysis of imines. The S enantiomer of

the racemic amine is selectively oxidized by a monoamine
oxidase to the corresponding imine. The imine spontane-
ously hydrolyzes to the ketone in the aqueous reaction me-
dium. Subsequently, the ketone intermediate is converted
into the (R)-amine by an ω-TA (Scheme 11, a).
[58] Addition-
ally, this cascade was employed for selective N-dealkylation
of secondary amines. The benzylic position of the second-
ary amine was oxidized to produce the imine, which was
again hydrolyzed to afford the corresponding carbonyl
functionality. The latter is then “reaminated” by an appro-
priate ω-TA (Scheme 11, b).
For the amination of alcohols, various cascades combin-
ing the oxidation of an alcohol with a subsequent ω-TA-
catalyzed amination step have been developed. For exam-
ple, an oxidation/transamination cascade via an aldehyde
intermediate was developed for the preparation of benzylic
The Industrial Age of Biocatalytic Transamination
amines (vide supra; see Scheme 3, a). Various benzylic
alcohols (50 mm substrate concentration) were successfully
transformed into the corresponding amines, and the practi-
cal applicability of this enzymatic cascade reaction was also
shown in the synthesis of the antifungal compound naftif-
ine ( 8, Figure 3).
[33a] The already mentioned “borrowing
hydrogen” approach (Scheme 3, b) achieved in a redox-self-
sufficient cascade is based on the oxidation of the alcohol
by an ADH and has been employed, for example, for the
diamination of 1,ω-diols.
[33c] The amination of decane-1,10-
diol was performed successfully on preparative scale
(126 mg) in 70 % isolated yield. The corresponding 1, ω-di-
amines are versatile building blocks in polymer chemistry.
Another successful application of an oxidation/transamin-
ation cascade has been reported for the conversion of the
diol isosorbide ( 9, Figure 3) originating from renewable re-
sources.
[59] Its transformation gave access to isosorbide
monoamine, with 7 % conversion.
Figure 3. Structures of naftifine ( 8) and isosorbide ( 9).
The redox-self-sufficient oxidation/transamination cas-
cades have been improved by co-expression of the three re-
quired enzymes (ADH, ω-TA, and Ala-DH) in a single
E. colihost.
[60] The applicability of the single-cell catalyst
was demonstrated in the amination of aliphatic and aro-
matic mono- and dialcohols. Because this concept simplifies
the catalyst preparation, it represents a more practicable
and economic approach. A single-cell catalyst has also been
used for the ω-functionalization of fatty acids in an in vivo
one-pot, three-step cascade (Scheme 12).
[61] The ω-position
of the fatty acid was hydroxylated by a monooxygenase
(AlkBGT), which also oxidized the primary alcohol to the
corresponding aldehyde, but also to the corresponding acid.
In the presence of an ω-TA, the aldehyde was aminated
before it could be oxidized to the acid. This process was
successfully transferred to a pilot plant by Evonik Indus-
tries in 2013; it yielded ω-aminolauric acid, which is the
monomer of a sustainable high-performance plastic.

4.2. Chemo-Enzymatic Processes
A cascade process can also be based on a subsequent
spontaneous chemical reaction that shifts the thermody-
namically disfavored amination reaction to completion by
removing the product(s) from the reaction mixture. In this
context, a transamination/lactamization cascade has been
successfully applied for the synthesis of various chiral het-
erocycles. The initial reductive amination of carbonyl com-
pounds is followed by spontaneous ring closure to afford
the corresponding lactams (Scheme 13). By this approach,
the amination of ethyl 4-acetylbutyrate ( 14) was ac-
complished at a concentration of 50 g L
–1, and after cycliza-
tion of the intermediate amino ester the product 6-methyl-
piperidin-2-one (15) was obtained optically pure in /H1102290 %
isolated yield.
[63]
These cascades based on the spontaneous subsequent cy-
clization of the amine product represent highly efficient and
scalable methodologies because the equilibrium is driven
towards the product side without a significant excess of the
amine donor.
The combination of biocatalytic steps with common
chemical transformations has been increasingly considered
for manufacturing routes to various building blocks
[64] and
pharmaceuticals.[1c,65] Often these chemo-enzymatic routes
represent scalable, cost-efficient, and green alternatives,
with fewer synthetic steps, reduced waste production, and
an improved overall synthetic efficiency. Consequently, ω-
TA-catalyzed reactions have already been integrated into
classical synthetic routes, resulting in highly successful
chemo-enzymatic processes for the preparation of several
chiral intermediates and active pharmaceutical ingredients
(APIs).
One of the first published examples of a chemo-enzy-
matic route including an ω-TA-catalyzed amination step
was the preparation of the anticholinergic agent ( S)-rivas-
tigmine (16), a potent cholinesterase inhibitor used for the
treatment of Alzheimer’s or Parkinson’s disease.
[66] The
drug was prepared and isolated in 71 % overall yield
through a short reaction sequence including the ω-TA-cata-
lyzed amination of the ketone precursor 17 (45 mm sub-
strate concentration, 100 mg scale) to afford the chiral
amine moiety 18, representing the synthetic key step
(Scheme 14, a).

Scheme 14. Chemo-enzymatic routes involving ω-TA-catalyzed key steps for the synthesis of a) the anticholinergic agent ( S)-rivastigmine,
b) the antidiabetic therapeutic sitagliptin, c) imagabalin, and d) the antiarrhythmic drug vernakalant.
The most prominent transamination-based process im-
plemented on industrial scale, and hence a benchmark in
the biocatalytic research field, was the synthesis of the anti-
diabetic drug sitagliptin (2).
[14] Directed evolution provided
an enzyme that was able to accept the sterically demanding
ketone and to tolerate increased concentrations of organic
co-solvents (e.g., DMSO) and higher temperatures. The
combination of these improvements led to a reductive amin-
ation of 19, a prositagliptin ketone precursor, at elevated
substrate concentration (200 g L
–1) with 2-propylamine as
amine donor. The target amine 2 was obtained in 90–95 %
overall yield and in optically pure form ( ee /H1102299 %,
Scheme 14, b).
An ω-TA was also engineered in order to adapt it to the
demand for a process for the preparation of (3 S,5R)-ethyl
3-amino-5-methyloctanoate (20), a precursor of imagabalin
(21, Scheme 14, c) [68] and the antiarrhythmic compound
www.eurjoc.org © 2015 The Authors. Published by Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim Eur. J. Org. Chem.2015, 6965–69826976
(1R,2R)-vernakalant (22, Scheme 14, d).[69] In the latter ex-
ample, directed evolution was used to provide anω-TA with
inverted diastereoselectivity, and a high selectivity for the
recognition of the adjacent chiral center was achieved.
Careful choice of the right reaction conditions enabled the
racemization of the chiral center α to the ketone, leading to
a dynamic kinetic resolution and the formation of the de-
sired trans isomer with excellent enantio- and diastereo-
selectivity ( /H1102299:1 dr, /H1102299 % ee). Consequently, this trans-
amination represents the asymmetric key reaction in a five-
step chemo-enzymatic route leading to vernakalant ( 22,
56 % overall yield). Identically to the sitagliptin ( 2) process,
2-propylamine turned out to be the ideal amine donor.
However, insome cases the basicity of 2-propylamine has
led to side reactions. For instance, a careful choice of amine
donor was necessary for the asymmetric key step in the
chemo-enzymatic synthesis of the antiallergic drug ramatro-

Scheme 15. Reductive amination of the ketone precursors to a) the antiallergic drug ramatroban ( 23), and b) the JAK2 kinase inhibitor

ban (23, Scheme 15, a). Use of the basic 2-propylamine led
to enol/enamine formation, followed by oxidation in air to
afford the corresponding energetically favored aromatic sys-
tem.
[70] However, by employing the sterically more de-
manding ( R)-1-phenylethylamine (24) as amine donor, the
formation of side products could be decreased dramatically
and, moreover, the thermodynamic equilibrium was shifted
towards the product side even with smaller amounts of
amine donor. By this approach the amine intermediate 25
on the synthetic path to ramatroban (23) was prepared suc-
cessfully on preparative scale (0.5 g) in 96 % isolated yield
and enantiopure form. This substituted three steps of the
previous chemo-enzymatic synthesis, which used lipase- or
oxidoreductase-based techniques.
[71]
The excellent thermodynamic properties of 1-phenyleth-
ylamine ( 24) as amine donor were also exploited for the
multigram preparation of ( S)-1-(5-fluoropyrimidin-2-yl)-
ethanamine (26, 500 g, 20 L scale), a valuable precursor for
the synthesis of the Janus kinase 2 (JAK2) inhibitor
AZD1480 ( 27, Scheme 15, b).
[72] The ketone precursor 28
was aminated by use of an S-selective ω-TA from V . fluvi-
alis. In order to avoid inhibition due to the high substrate
concentration (0.35 m), toluene was added as a co-solvent,
resulting in a 97 % yield of the target amine 26. This ω-
TA-catalyzed transformation was integrated into a recently
proposed chemo-enzymatic long-term manufacturing route
to the JAK2 kinase inhibitor AZD1480 ( 27) as a promising
alternative to the classical route, showing again the great
potential of the combination of bio- and chemocatal-
ysis.
[72a]
As already mentioned, amination/lactamization cas-
cades – or, more generally, amination/cyclization cascades
initiated by an ω-TA-catalyzed step – are quite efficient and
have therefore been used in various chemo-enzymatic syn-
thetic routes. For instance, biologically active γ-amino-
butyric acid (GABA) derivatives such as 29, which play an
important role in nervous system functions, were prepared
by this approach (Scheme 16, a).
[73]
Eur. J. Org. Chem.2015, 6965–6982 © 2015 The Authors. Published by Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim www.eurjoc.org 6977
Another application of that strategy has been reported
for the preparation of niraparib ( 30), an inhibitor of the
poly(ADP-ribose)polymerase involved in numerous cellular
processes.
[74] Thorough the employment of an ω-TA-cata-
lyzed dynamic kinetic resolution starting from the racemic
open-chain aldehyde 31, the ( R)-lactam 32 [chiral building
block for niraparib ( 30)] was obtained on preparative scale
(35 g) with high yields (82 %) and stereoselectivity
(Scheme 16, b). Because of the low stability of aldehyde 31
during the preliminary experiments, the transamination
step was alternatively performed by starting from bisulfite
adduct 33. This aldehyde surrogate is more stable and liber-
ates the corresponding aldehyde 31 in situ under the basic
conditions of the transaminase reaction, resulting in an
84 % yield of ( R)-lactam 32. Using the aldehyde surrogate
33 improved the robustness and reliability of the process,
making it suitable for large-scale applications.
A similar amination/lactamization concept was exploited
for the dual orexin receptor antagonist MK-6096 ( 34), used
for the treatment of insomnia (Scheme 17, a).
[75] The prepa-
ration of this therapeutic agent was accomplished on a kilo-
gram scale, leading to 1.2 kg of MK-6096 ( 34) in nine steps
with an overall yield of 13 %. In the asymmetric key step,
which builds up the α-methylpiperidine core 35, the keto
diester substrate 36 is converted through an ω-TA-catalyzed
transamination reaction into the corresponding amino dies-
ter 37 (50–57 g L
–1). Compound 37 spontaneously cyclizes
to the optically pure ( R)-lactam 35. In addition to the al-
ready favorable thermodynamic equilibrium due to the lact-
amization step, product formation was further supported
by removing the pyruvate byproduct through the action of
the LDH/GDH system.
Suvorexant (38), another dual orexin receptor antagonist
already in phase III clinical trials for the therapy of primary
insomnia, has also been produced on a multigram scale by
a chemo-enzymatic route including a similar amination/cy-
clization step (Scheme 17, b).
[76] A key feature of this com-
pound is the core chiral diazepane ring, which was obtained

through the stereoselective amination of ketone precursor
39 by use of the ω-TA variant from Merck/Codexis [14] fol-
lowed by a spontaneous cyclization of the unstable amino
mesylate intermediate 40. In order to avoid the formation
of various side products in the cyclization step, a thorough
optimization of the pH and the leaving group had to be
performed, ultimately giving the 1,4-diazepane ring 41 in
good yield and perfect enantiopurity.
In this context the amination/imination cascade sequence
already described above (see Scheme 2, a) leading to dihy-

dropiperidines should be mentioned, because it represents
a similar amination/cyclization approach. [22b] Nevertheless,
standard reactions conditions were used, and no investi-
gations of a potential beneficial effect of the spontaneous
cyclization were reported.
Besides the synthesis of natural alkaloids, ω-TAs have
also proven to be suitable catalysts for the enzymatic syn-
thesis of 17α-aminosteroids (Scheme 18), which are used as
intermediates in the preparation of biologically active ste-
roidal derivatives.

Another example showing the potential of combining
classical chemical transformations with biocatalytic steps
for the development of more scalable and cost-efficient
manufacturing routes is the chemo-enzymatic synthesis of
the CRTH2 antagonist MK-7246 ( 42, Scheme 19, a).
[78]
This compound was reported to be a potential therapeutic
agent for the treatment of respiratory diseases. [79] The pre-
vious chemical route, consisting of eighteen steps with a
10 % overall yield, was optimized by introducing a direct
transformation of the ketone precursor 43 into the desired
chiral amine 44 by an ω-TA with excellent stereoselectivity.
Consequently, the number of required reaction steps was
reduced to nine, starting from commercially available mate-
rials. Without the need for any chromatographic purifica-

tions the product was obtained in 49 % overall yield, thus
representing a quite efficient process optimization amenable
to pilot-plant scale production.
[78]
Another concise asymmetric synthesis involving a trans-
amination step has been developed recently for the large-
scale commercial supply of compound 45, a smoothened
receptor (SMO) inhibitor and a new therapeutic for the
treatment of a broad range of human cancers.
[80] The chal-
lenging key step of the synthesis was the establishment of
the anti stereocenters on the 2- and 4-positions of the piper-
idine ring. By means of an ω-TA-catalyzed transamination
of the 4-piperidone precursor 46, both centers – the re-
quired C-4 amino functionality as well as the anti-config-
ured C-2 stereocenter – were generated simultaneously

through a dynamic kinetic resolution process. The targeted
anti-amine intermediate 47 was obtained in /H1102210:1 dr and
99 % ee in a single step, and therefore the SMO inhibitor
45 was prepared in only five steps with 40 % overall yield,
representing a highly attractive alternative route
(Scheme 18, b). An enzyme-catalyzed transamination was
also considered for the preparation of the amine 49, an in-
termediate on the pathway to the pro-drug silodosin ( 48),
which is used for the treatment of dysuria and urinary dis-
turbance (Scheme 18, c).
[81]
Conclusions
Various examples, which have been provided to a signifi-
cant extent by companies, demonstrate the applicability of
ω-transaminases for the synthesis of valuable targets. De-
tailed investigation of the substrate scope, as well as a well-
understood mechanism and detailed crystallographic analy-
sis of the catalysts’ protein structures, have built up a con-
solidated base for the application of transaminase enzymes
on a laboratory scale, as well as on a pilot-plant scale. The
interest results from the high demand for chiral amines as
building blocks or intermediates within synthetic routes.
The broad range of accepted ketone and aldehyde precur-
sors, the robust reaction conditions, and the relatively easy
preparation of the catalysts represent a highly attractive al-
ternative to recent amination methodologies. Therefore the
increasing number of laboratories focusing on the imple-
mentation of this biocatalytic technology is due to the fact
that alternative methods from other fields of catalysis are
less attractive or lack the robustness of the biocatalytic
equivalent. Thus, ω-transaminases show great potential to
become one of the big players in the preparation of (chiral)
amines.
