Abstract 
Background: Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a chronic liver disease characterized by intrahepatic accumulation and 
is closely associated with metabolic problems. Some studies have indicated that Chaihu-Shugan-San (CSS) may have a positive 
effect on NAFLD, but robust evidence-based research to substantiate the application of CSS is scarce. A meta-analysis was 
conducted to assess the clinical efficacy and safety of CSS in the treatment for NAFLD.
Methods: The literature reporting CSS in NAFLD was searched from inception to October 2023 in in 7 Chinese or English 
databases. Studies were screened and incorporated based on predefined criteria. Data were extracted and quality was assessed 
independently by 2 researchers according to the Cochrane risk of bias tools. The changes in outcomes were analyzed using the 
mean difference (MD) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) with a random- or fixed-effects model to examine the effect of CSS. 
RevMan5.4 software was used to perform meta-analyses, and the meta package of R 4.0.0 software was used for publication 
bias analysis.
Results: A total 17 studies involving 1576 participants were screened for meta-analysis. There was high heterogeneity among 
studies for all continuous outcomes. Compared with common treatments, CSS could decrease aspartate-aminotransferase 
(MD = −12.02, 95% CI [−15.97, −8.07]), alanine-aminotransferase (MD = −10.89, 95% CI [−16.35, −5.43]), triglyceride and total 
cholesterol levels. In addition, CSS may increase the high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels. And, CSS was associated with a 
lower incidence of adverse events (RR = 0.79, 95% CI [0.33, 1.91]).
Conclusion: Current evidence shows that single or combined use of CSS is effective for NAFLD liver enzymes and blood lipids. 
Nevertheless, it is challenging to reach a conclusive determination owing to significant heterogeneity and ambiguous risk of bias 
in some trials. Therefore, more high-quality evidence is required for the clinical implementation of CSS.

1. Introduction
Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a pathologi-
cal condition characterized by excessive lipid accumulation 
in liver cells, constituting at least 5% of the liver weight, in 
the absence of a history of alcohol consumption and other 
definitive liver damage factors, such as viral infections, 
drug-induced liver injury, and autoimmune liver diseases. [1,2] 
NAFLD is closely associated with various metabolic disorders, 
including atherosclerotic heart disease, metabolic syndrome, 
and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). [3] Approximately 50% 
of individuals with T2DM are affected by NAFLD. [4] The

global prevalence of NAFLD ranges from 25% to 45%, with 
an increasing incidence in younger populations. [5] Notably, the 
prevalence of NAFLD in China has dramatically increased 
from 18% to nearly 30% over the past decade, more than 
double that of developed countries. [6] NAFLD can be divided 
into simple fatty liver, nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), 
fibrosis and cirrhosis. Simple fatty liver without significant 
clinical symptoms is the best stage of intervention. Fibrosis can 
be blocked or reversed, which is the main pathological stage 
affecting the prognosis of NAFLD. [7] However, once the basic 
fatty liver progresses to liver cirrhosis, it not only increases the 
risk of liver cancer but is also irreversible for life, and patients 
might eventually require liver transplantation. [8,9] Therefore, 
effective prevention of NAFLD occurrence and progression 
of NAFLD is an important public health concern. Currently, 
the latest guidelines recommend treatments that include life-
style interventions, pharmacologic symptomatic treatments, 
and surgical treatments for end-stage cases. [10] Lifestyle thera-
pies, including exercise and dietary modifications, are recom-
mended for NAFLD patients. However, it is hard to adhere to 
long-term lifestyle interventions. [11] Commonly used symptom-
atic drug treatments include vitamin E, liver-preserving drugs 
(silymarin, PPCs, reduced glutathione, etc), and lipid-lowering 
drugs. However, there are unable to completely interrupt the 
progression of NAFLD. [12] The Farnesoid X Receptor agonist 
Obeticholic Acid (OCA) has been approved by the U.S. Food 
and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of NASH.[13] 
Additionally, microbial therapy, including synbiotics, pro-
biotics, and prebiotics, shows great potential for improv-
ing ALT and AST levels in adult patients with NAFLD. [14,15] 
Surgical treatment has problems associated with postoperative 
infection, donor inadequacy, and postoperative recurrence. 
Therefore, it is of great practical significance to study how to 
effectively treat NAFLD.
Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) has been used for cen-
turies to treat patients with chronic liver diseases. [16] Chaihu-
Shugan-San (CSS), which was originally documented in the 
ancient masterpiece “Jing-Yue book” written by Jiebin Zhang 
of the Ming Dynasty, was used to improve liver depression 
symptoms. CSS consists of 7 herbs: Bupleuri Radix (Chaihu, 
Bupleurum falcatum L.), Paeoniae Radix Alba (Baishao, Paeonia 
lactiflora Pall.), Chuanxiong Rhizoma (Chuanxiong, Ligusticum 
chuanxiong Hort), Aurantii Fructus (Zhiqiao, Citrus aurantium 
L.), Citri Reticulatae Pericarpium (Chenpi, Citrus reticulata 
Blanco), Glycyrrhizae Radix et Rhizoma Praeparata Cum Melle 
(Zhigancao, Glycyrrhiza uralensis Fisch.), and Cyperi Rhizoma 
(Xiangfu, Cyperus rotundus L.). CSS has the effect of relaxing 
the liver and regulating qi, invigorating blood circulation and 
relieving pain. Zhang et al found that CSS reduced lipid lev-
els and improved symptoms in patients with NAFLD. [17] Some 
studies have indicated that CSS may significantly decrease fat 
accumulation in NAFLD rat livers by modulating biological 
processes, such as fatty acid production, insulin resistance, 
inflammatory response, and gut microbiology. [18–21] However, 
the clinical effectiveness of CSS in the treatment of NAFLD is 
uncertain owing to a variety of problems, such as limited sample 
numbers, uneven research protocol design, various assessment 
measures, and low methodological quality. As more clinical 
research is carried out, it is necessary to further aggregate and 
update the evidence for CSS in NAFLD treatment. Therefore, 
we conducted a meta-analysis to assess the clinical benefits of 
monotherapy or combination therapy with CSS for the treat-
ment of NAFLD, compared to conventional hepatoprotective or 
lipid-lowering drugs, by evaluating liver enzyme and lipid levels.
2. Materials and methods
The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-
Analysis (PRISMA) statement criteria were followed in this 
meta-analysis. The registration number for this research was 
CRD42024528169 in the International Prospective Register of 
Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO). Published clinical research 
was the source of all data included in this analysis.
2.1. Search strategy
We conducted a thorough search of Chinese databases (CNKI, 
the VIP database, the Wanfang Database, and SinoMed) and 
English databases (EMBASE, Pubmed, Cochrane Library, 
Clinical trials, and Web of Science) from the time of their creation 
until October 31, 2023. Additionally, the Cochrane Library and 
Clinical Trials.gov databases were searched. The searched data-
base connections are shown in Table S1 (Supplemental Digital 
Content, https://links.lww.com/MD/O816, which illustrates the 
link of databases in this meta-analysis). Table 1 provides the 
Embase search approach that will also be used in other elec-
tronic databases.
2.2. Inclusion and exclusion criteria
The inclusion criteria were as follows: adult patients (age >18 
years old) diagnosed with NAFLD/NASH using noninva-
sive techniques, such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), 
ultrasonography (US), and clinical symptoms; data from ran-
domized controlled trials (RCTs), excluding case reports, case 
series, commentaries, reviews, quasiRCTs, and nonrandomized 
controlled studies; and study designs that included at least one 
group receiving a CSS intervention.
The exclusion criteria were as follows: repeated publications 
of the same study, and documents that did not fit the research 
focus.
2.3. Outcomes
The safety and effectiveness of CSS in the treatment of NAFLD 
were evaluated by analyzing liver enzymes levels, blood lipid 
levels, and adverse events.
Primary outcomes were liver enzymes, including alanine 
aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase 
(AST).
Secondary outcomes were blood lipids and the adverse 
events during the experiment. Blood lipids including total 
cholesterol (TC), triglycerides (TG), low-density lipoprotein 
cholesterol (LDL-C), and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol 
(HDL-C).
2.4. Literature screening and data extraction
Two authors independently reviewed the literature, extracted 
the data, and verified information from the included studies. 
Any disputes were resolved by a third investigator. Studies unre-
lated to CSS in the treatment of NAFLD were discarded after

skimming the title and abstract. Potentially eligible studies were 
identified by reading the full text. After reviewing the full text, 
studies that did not satisfy the inclusion criteria were excluded. 
The following information was extracted from each study: title, 
first author, country, publication year, study design, diagnostic 
test features, sample sizes of the case and control groups, age of 
the case and control subjects, country, intervention, follow-up 
duration, and outcomes.
2.5. Risk of bias assessment
Two review authors independently assessed the quality of the lit-
erature using the Cochrane Collaboration’s tool in RevMan5.4 
software.[22] The scoring system consists of 7 biases, including 
random sequence generation, allocation concealment, blinding 
of participants and personnel, blinding of the results assessment, 
incomplete data of the results, selective reporting, and other 
sources of bias. Each item is classified into 3 levels: low-risk, 
unclear, and high-risk.
2.6. Statistical analysis
RevMan5.4 software was used to conduct the meta-analysis. 
The meta package of R 4.0.0 software was used for the pub-
lication bias analysis. Continuous data were reported as mean 
difference (MD) and dichotomous data as relative risk (RR), 
with estimates and 95% confidence interval (CI). Before the 
outcome indicators were synthesized, heterogeneity was tested 
using the chi-square and Higgins I 2 tests owing to natural vari-
ations in the included studies. The fixed-effects model was used 
when there was low heterogeneity among the included studies 
(P > .1, I2 < 50%). A random-effects model was used when the 
degree of heterogeneity across the studies was considerable 
(P ≤ .1, I2≥50%). If more than 10 studies were eligible, Egger 
test and funnel plots were performed to detect publication bias, 
and P < .05 was used to define the presence of possible publica-
tion bias.[23]
Subgroup analysis was used to eliminate heterogeneity, and 
a sensitivity analysis was performed to explore the sources of 
heterogeneity. Subgroup analyses were conducted according to 
the duration of treatment or the western medication used in the 
control group for indicators including more than 9 studies. Each 
study was sequentially removed, and the remaining studies were 
reanalyzed for comparison before and after deletion to clarify 
the stability of the results of the combined analysis.
2.7. Certainty of evidence assessment
The Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, 
and Evaluation (GRADE) approach was used to assess the qual-
ity of evidence for the pooled estimates. The GRADE rating was 
divided into 4 levels: high, moderate, low, or very low.

3. Results
3.1. Database search and literature selection
A comprehensive search yielded 671 articles from both Chinese 
and English databases. Subsequently, 301 duplicates were 
excluded. Forty-five studies were remained for full-text evalu-
ation after the titles and abstracts were screened. Based on the 
eligibility criteria, 17 studies were included in this systematic 
review and meta-analysis.[24–40] The literature screening process 
is illustrated in Figure 1.
3.2. Characteristics of included RCTs
This systematic review included 17 RCTs with a total of 1576 
participants who were diagnosed with NAFLD and met the 
inclusion criteria. The sample sizes of the included studies ranged 
from 40 to 162. The mean age ranged between 38.49 ± 9.47 and 
58.91 ± 3.05 years. The duration of treatment ranged from 30 
to 180 days. All 17 studies included basic exercise and dietary 
therapy. Several treatment options were used in the experimen-
tal group: 7 studies used only CSS, one study used CSS and 
Yueju Wan, 5 studies used CSS and one basic Western medi-
cine, and 3 studies used CSS and 2 to 4 kinds of basic Western 
medicine. In the control group, 9 studies used liver-protective 
drugs, including Dong Bao Gan Tai pills (DBGTP), Polyene 
Phosphatidylcholine Capsules (PPCs), and Silibinin capsules; 3 
studies used anti-lipemic agents (Lovastatin, Fenofibrate, and 
Ezetimibe), and 3 studies used 2 to 4 kinds of basic Western 
medicine. One study used a hypoglycemic agent (exenatide), and 
the detailed characteristics are shown in Table 2.
3.3. Risk of bias assessment
The risk of bias was assessed by the “Cocrane Collaboration’s 
risk of bias” assessment tool. Six studies described the random-
ization method used. One study reported methods for blinding 
participants, and blinding was not reported in the remaining 
studies. A summary and graph of the risk of bias are shown in 
Figure 2.
3.4. Meta-analysis and narrative review
In Xie study, all continuous outcomes were nonnormally dis-
tributed.[35] Therefore, we performed descriptive analysis of the 
data. They found that ALT, AST, TC, and LDL-C levels were 
lower after CSS intervention than after placebo intervention 
(P < .05). The HDL-C level was greater than that in the placebo 
group (P < .05). However, there were no significant differences 
in the TG level between the 2 groups.
3.4.1. Liver enzymes. Fourteen RCTs reported evaluable ALT 
and AST data, including 641 participants and 629 in the in the 
experimental and control groups, respectively.
Because of significant study heterogeneity (P < .00001, 
I2 = 80%), a random-effects model was used for ALT. The 
results showed that the CSS patients had significantly lower 
ALT levels than the controls (MD = −12.02, 95% CI [−15.97, 
−8.07], P < .00001) (Fig. 3). To analyze the source of ALT het-
erogeneity, a subsequent subgroup analysis was conducted. The 
results showed that the medicine used in the control group was 
an important reason for heterogeneity (P < .0001, I2 = 86.9%). 
The results of the sensitivity analysis revealed that the hetero-
geneity decreased (I 2 from 80% to 48%) after the removal of 
the study by Shi and Tan. However, there was no change in the 
conclusion of the meta-analysis when 2 studies were removed 
(MD = −12.02, 95% CI [−15.15, −8.89], P < .00001), which 
suggested that the findings were stable and reliable.
The heterogeneity test for AST revealed considerable het-
erogeneity (I2 = 93%, P < .00001), which was analyzed using 
a random effects model. The results showed that the AST levels 
were significantly lower in the CSS group than in the control 
group (MD = −10.89, 95% CI [−16.35, −5.43], P < .00001) 
(Fig. 4). The results of the subgroup analysis indicated that the 
medicine used in the control group was an important reason for 
Figure 2. Risk of bias for the included studies. Green = low-risk; yellow = 
unclear; red = high-risk.

heterogeneity (P < .0004, I2 = 83.8%). In addition, the results of 
sensitivity analysis showed the heterogeneity decreased (I2 from 
93% to 48%) after the removal of the study by Shi, and Su. 
When these studies were removed from the meta-analysis, there 
was no significant change in the findings (MD = −10.62, 95% 
CI [−13.28, −7.96], P < .00001).
3.4.2. Blood lipids. Fourteen RCTs involving 614 participants 
in the experimental group and 602 in the control group reported 
evaluable TC data. The random-effects model was used because 
of the substantial heterogeneity among the studies (P < .00001, 
I2 = 83%). The results showed that the CSS group had lower TC 
levels than control group (MD = −0.84, 95% CI [−1.10, −0.57]) 
(Fig. 5). The subgroup analysis revealed that the duration of 
treatment was responsible for the heterogeneity (P = .003, 
I2 = 82.8%). After performing a sensitivity analysis, the results 
showed that the heterogeneity decreased among the remaining 
studies after the removal of the studies by Wang, Cao, and 
Lei (I2 from 83% reduced to 44%). The meta-analysis results 
changed after removing these studies (MD = −0.56, 95% CI 
[−0.71, −0.40], P < .00001).
Fourteen studies included TG indicators, involving 647 
participants in the experimental group and 635 participants 
in the control group. The random-effects model was used for 
the analysis because of considerable heterogeneity (I 2 = 88%, 
P < .00001). The results indicated that CSS reduced TC lev-
els compared to the control treatment (MD = −0.69, 95% 
CI [−0.89, −0.48]) (Fig.  6). The subgroup analysis did not 
find the reason for heterogeneity among studies based on 
the duration of follow-up and western medicine used in the 
control group. However, the results of sensitivity analysis 
showed that the heterogeneity decreased (I 2 from 88% to 
27%) after the removal of the study by Wang, Zhu, and Su. 
Unfortunately, the results of the meta-analysis changed after 
these studies were removed (MD = −0.41 95% CI [−0.50, 
−0.33], P < .00001).
Ten RCTs reported evaluable LDL-C data, including 448 par-
ticipants in the experimental group and 437 participants in the 
control group. The random-effects model was used for analysis 
because of the high heterogeneity among the studies (I 2 = 97%, 
P < .00001). The results showed that LDL-C level was lower in 
the CSS group than in the control group (MD = −0.57, 95% CI 
[−0.92, −0.22]) (Fig.  7). The subgroup analysis found that the 
medicine used in the control group was an influential factor for 
heterogeneity (P = .02, I2 = 68.5%). The sensitivity analysis indi-
cated that the heterogeneity was decreased (I2 from 97% to 7%, 
P = .37) with the exclusion of the studies by Pang, Fang, Tan, 
and He. In addition, the results of the meta-analysis changed 
after these studies were removed (MD = −0.36, 95% CI [−0.48, 
−0.24], P < .00001).
Ten studies reported evaluable HDL-C data, involving 473 
participants in the experimental group and 462 in the control 
group. The random-effects model was used for the analysis 
based on considerable heterogeneity (I 2 = 92%, P < .00001). 
The results showed that CSS improved HDL-C levels compared 
to the control group (MD = 0.15, 95% CI [0.04, 0.25]) (Fig. 8). 
The subgroup analysis found that the medicine used in the con-
trol group was the main source of heterogeneity (P < .00001, 
I2 = 90.1%). In addition, the sensitivity analysis found the 
heterogeneity was decreased (I 2 from 92% to 34%) after the 
removal of the study by Shi, Teng, Zhang, Fan, and Tan. The 
results of the meta-analysis did not change significantly after 
these studies were removed (MD = 0.19, 95% CI [0.11, 0.27], 
P < .00001).

3.4.3. Adverse events. Among the 17 studies, only 4 reported 
the occurrence or absence of adverse reactions, and the 
remaining studies did not report adverse reactions. One study 
reported no serious adverse events in either the experimental 
or control groups. Three studies were included in this meta-
analysis (Fig.  9). Considering the limited number of studies 
incorporated in the analysis, a random-effects model was 
employed to account for potential variability across studies. 
The RR of experiencing any adverse event was lower with CSS 
(RR = 0.80, 95% CI [0.33, 1.96]).
3.5. Publication bias
All continuous indicators were included in more than 10 stud-
ies. Egger test and funnel plots were performed to analyze 
publication bias. The results of the Egger test showed that 
ALT (P = .2797), AST (P = .3085), TC (P = .1561), LDL-C 
(P = .4579), and HDL-C (P = .5140) levels had no significant 
publication bias. However, TG (P = .0558) may present some 
potential publication bias. The funnel plots are shown in Figures 
S1 to S6 (Supplemental Digital Content, https://links.lww.com/
MD/O817, which displaying the funnel plots for liver enzyme 
and lipid profile indicators).
3.6. Certainty of evidence assessment
The GRADE approach was employed to ascertain the quality 
of evidence for each outcome measure. Our evaluation revealed 
that the quality of evidence for the outcome measures, including 
ALT, AST, TC, LDL-C, HDL-C, and AE, was consistently rated 
as low (Table 3). Furthermore, the evidence quality for TG was 
deemed to be very low, indicating a greater degree of uncertainty 
and higher potential for bias or imprecision in the findings.
4. Discussion
TCM, deeply rooted in the rich tapestry of traditional Chinese 
practices, offers a compelling alternative approach to clinical 
treatment through its foundational “syndrome differentiation 
and treatment” principles. This approach not only enhances 
liver lipid metabolism but also mitigates inflammation and 
addresses fibrosis, showcasing its potential as a valuable ther -
apeutic option. [41,42] CSS is a traditional Chinese herbal med-
icine formula that has been used to treat a variety of chronic 
diseases, including depression, chronic gastritis, chronic liver 
disease, and functional dyspepsia.[43–45] In 2014, Zhang et al con-
ducted 10 RCTs with 802 subjects, and the results of their meta- 
analysis showed the better beneficial effects of CSS than the 
control group.[17] However, the recently published studies still 
need further evaluation to provide more effective information 
for clinical use. In the present study, we systematically assessed 
the efficacy and safety of CSS in patients with NAFLD, includ-
ing the latest studies.
Seventeen RCTs were included in this meta-analysis and sys-
tematic review. The results showed that CSS was able to sig-
nificantly decrease the levels of ALT, AST, TC, TG and LDL-C 
compared with those in the control, which is a similar conclu-
sion to that of a previous study. In addition, this study revealed 
that CSS may increase the HDL-C level, which plays a protec-
tive role in blood pressure and vessels. Moreover, CSS did not 
increase the incidence of adverse events. These results indicate 
that CSS may be effective in the treatment of mild NAFLD and 
is highly safe.

A potential causal link exists between depression and 
NAFLD.[46] Studies have reported that the prevalence of 
depression among individuals with NAFLD ranges from 
18.21% to 26.1%, highlighting the significant comorbidity 
between these 2 conditions. [47,48] CSS has demonstrated effi-
cacy in alleviating both NAFLD and depressive symptoms, 
indicating its potential as a therapeutic candidate for patients 
with NAFLD and concurrent depression. This could pave the 
way for novel alternatives to traditional psychotropic medica-
tions, potentially minimizing their use. In addition, network 
pharmacology and molecular docking suggest the potential 
therapeutic effects of CSS in liver fibrosis and hepatocellular 
carcinoma. [49,50] Further evidence is required to clarify these 
findings.
All indicators had high heterogeneity in this study, which may 
have resulted from different baseline clinical characteristics and 
intervention designs among the included studies. In the subse-
quent sensitivity analysis, after 2 to 5 studies were rejected, het-
erogeneity was removed, and some results of the meta-analysis 
were changed. In the subgroup analysis, the single or combined 
use of CSS improved ALT and AST levels more effectively than 
liver-protective drugs. A reasonable treatment time may be the 
key to the efficacy of CSS.
The GRADE assessment results showed that the quality 
of the present meta-analysis was unsatisfactory, hence it is 
important to consider the study’s findings and conclusions 
cautiously. Firstly, 6 of the included studies reported the use 
of randomization methods, and only one article reported

blinding of participants and personnel methods. Thus, it 
might create a potential bias in the selection of cases and 
distribution of interventions. Secondly, the lack of uniform 
standards for the relevant components, quality control, dos-
age, and usage of the CSS formula which has an impact on 
the comparability among the included studies. Thirdly, the 
included papers were all published in Chinese and did not 
include any potentially unfavorable literature that was not 
publicly available, which may have some risk of publication 
bias. Therefore, more high-quality, large-sample trials with 
placebo-controlled groups in different countries are needed to 
validate the effect of CSS on NAFLD.
5. Conclusion
In conclusion, CSS is both effective and safe for the treatment 
of NAFLD when used alone or in combination with Western 
medications. However, the high heterogeneity and poor qual-
ity of the studies included in this meta-analysis could have 
had a significant impact on the findings. More standardized 
clinical trials are required to verify this speculation. If the 
favorable effect of CSS is verified in future high-level clinical 
trials, it could be used as a complementary therapy for NAFLD 
treatment.
