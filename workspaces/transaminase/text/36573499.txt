ABSTRACT
Context: Gallic acid (GA) and lecithin showed important roles in antioxidant and drug delivery, respect-
ively. A complex synthesized from GA and soybean lecithin (SL-GAC), significantly improved bioavailability
of GA and pharmacological activities. However, the antioxidant activity of SL-GAC and its effect on iron-
overload-induced liver injury remains unexplored.
Objective: This study investigates the antioxidant properties of SL-GACin vitro and in mice, and its reme-
diating effects against liver injury by iron-overloaded.
Materials and methods:In vitro, free radical scavenging activity, lipid peroxidation inhibition, and ferric
reducing power of SL-GAC were measured by absorbance photometry. In vivo , C57BL/6J mice were
randomized into 4 groups: control, iron-overloaded, iron-overloaded þ deferoxamine, and iron-over-
loaded þ SL-GAC. Treatments with deferoxamine (150 mg/kg/intraperitioneally) and SL-GAC (200 mg/kg/
orally) were given to the desired groups for 12 weeks, daily. Iron levels, oxidative stress, and biochemical
parameters were determined by histopathological examination and molecular biological techniques.
Results: In vitro, SL-GAC showed DPPH and ABTS free radicals scavenging activity with IC
50 values equal
to 24.92 and 128.36 lg/mL, respectively. In C57BL/6J mice, SL-GAC significantly reduced the levels of
serum iron (22.82%), liver iron (50.29%), aspartate transaminase (25.97%), alanine transaminase (38.07%),
gamma glutamyl transferase (42.11%), malondialdehyde (19.82%), total cholesterol (45.96%), triglyceride
(34.90%), ferritin light chain (18.51%) and transferrin receptor (27.39%), while up-regulated the levels of
superoxide dismutase (24.69%), and glutathione (11.91%).
Conclusions: These findings encourage the use of SL-GAC to treat liver injury induced by iron-over-
loaded. Furtherin vivo and in vitro studies are needed to validate its potential in clinical medicine.

Introduction
Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are typical by-products of cellular
metabolism, playing a role as secondary messengers and influ-
encing different normal physiological functions of the body
(Villalpando-Rodriguez and Gibson 2021). Increased levels of
ROS in living cells can damage DNA, RNA, proteins, and
healthy cells, resulting in the development and progression of
several serious diseases (Srinivas et al.2019). Iron is an essential
micronutrient, playing a crucial role in many biological processes
including oxygen transport and storage, oxidative phosphoryl-
ation, and the catalysis of many metabolic redox reactions
(Coffey and Ganz2017), as components of oxygen transport pro-
teins (haemoglobin and myoglobin) and of numerous metabolic
and redox enzymes (Sung et al. 2019). Iron is required for a
number of diverse cellular functions including DNA synthesis,
ATP generation, and cellular proliferation (Puig et al.2017). The
richest sources of iron in the diet are lean meat and seafood.
Other dietary sources of iron also include nuts, beans, vegetables,
and fortified grain products. However, accumulation of iron in
tissues and organs is toxic and can cause organ damage and
disrupt normal function, particularly in the liver which is the
main storage site for iron in body (Zaccone and Gasbarrini
2012). As the body has no active excretion pathways for excess
iron, a continuous load of iron exceeding 1– 2 mg/day will result
in iron overload (Kohgo et al.2008). Free cellular iron can par-
ticipate in the Fenton reaction and catalyse the conversion of
hydrogen peroxide to highly toxic hydroxyl radicals (Beaufay
et al. 2020). Emerging evidence also suggests that oxidative
stress, mediated by free radicals and ROS, may have a role in the
pathophysiology of iron-induced liver injury (Galaris et al.2019).
Therefore, a bioactive compound or a drug that effectively traps
free iron is required to make it unavailable for Fenton reaction,
reduce the formation of highly reactive hydroxyl radicals and the
peroxidation of unsaturated lipids, and acts as an antioxidant.
Gallic acid (GA), a naturally occurring phenolic acid widely
distributed in a variety of foods such as apples, b7lueberries, wal-
nuts, and watercress, is well known as powerful antioxidant
(Sanchez-Martin et al. 2022). It has characteristics of the strong
antioxidant and free radical scavenging activities, and can protect
biological cells, tissues, and organs from damages caused by oxi-
dative stress (Gao et al. 2019). It has been shown to exhibit

numerous biological and pharmacological properties, including
antiviral, antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory, and antitumor activ-
ities in numerous human cancer cell lines (Kahkeshani et al.
2019). However, poor bioavailability of GA is shown because its
poor lipid solubility that don ’t allow its penetration into cell
membranes, which results in an inability to achieve its desired
pharmacological function (Ahmed et al. 2018; Hassani et al.
2020). We previously observed that SL-GAC, a complex synthe-
sized from GA and soybean lecithin, significantly increased bio-
availability of GA and improved pharmacological activities
in vivo, and with no effects on the safety for the organism (Wu
et al. 2019). However, the detailed knowledge of antioxidant
activity of SL-GAC and amelioration of iron-overload-induced
oxidative stress and liver injury remains unexplored. Thus, the
present study was designed to investigate thein vitro antioxidant
properties of SL-GAC and itsin vivo ameliorating effects against
iron-overload induced oxidative stress and liver injury in C57BL/
6J mice.
Materials and methods
Reagents and antibodies
The standard iron chelating drug, deferoxamine (DFO) was
obtained from Novartis International AG (Basel, Switzerland).
Carbonyl iron, GA, soybean lecithin, ethanol, vitamin C, ferric
chloride, ferrous chloride, linoleic acid, 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhy-
drazyl (DPPH), 2, 2-azinobis (3-ethylbenzo-thiozoline-6-sulfonic
acid) (ABTS), potassium ferricyanide and 30% hydrogen perox-
ide were purchased from Sigma Chemical Co. (St. Louis, MO,
USA). The assay kits for alanine transaminase (ALT) (C009-2-1),
aspartate transaminase (AST) (C010-2-1), c-glutamyl transferase
(c-GT) (C017-2-1), and superoxide dismutase (SOD) (A001-3-2),
glutathione (GSH) (A006-2-1), malondialdehyde (MDA) (A003-
1-1), total cholesterol (TC) (A111-1-1), total iron-binding
capacity (TIBC) (A040-1-1), triglyceride (TG) (A110-1-1) were
procured from Nanjing Jiancheng Biotechnology Co., Ltd.
(Nanjing, China). Antibodies against transferrin receptor (TfR1)
(ab84036), Ferritin (ab153976), ferritin light chain (FL)
(ab109373) and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase
(GAPDH) (ab198306) were all purchased from Abcam Inc.
(Cambridge, MA, USA).
Preparation of SL-GAC
The SL-GAC, a stable complex of soybean lecithin and gallic
acid was prepared according to our previously described method
(Wu et al. 2019). The polar ends of gallic acid and lecithin may
interact in the SL– GAC, and gallic acid was completely com-
bined with lecithin, and both retained their characteristic chem-
ical structures and did not undergo a chemical reaction. Further,
SL– GAC did not cause any clinical signs of toxicity and was safe
for the organism.
DPPH radical scavenging assay
The SL-GAC’s ability to scavenge DPPH free radical was deter-
mined using the previous method (Shimada et al. 1992). Fresh
DPPH stock solution (0.25 mM) was prepared in ethanol on
each day of analysis. Stock solutions of SL-GAC was prepared in
ethanol at a concentration of 0.08 mg/mL. Then, 7 separate
10 mL volumetric flasks were taken and aliquots of 0, 0.25, 0.5,
1.0, 2.0, 4.0, and 5.0 mL of 0.08 mg/mL solution of SL-GAC were
added, respectively, to separate volumetric flasks. Then, 2 mL of
freshly prepared DPPH solution (0.25 mM) was added to each of
the mentioned 7 volumetric flasks, and the final volume was
made up to 10 mL in all the flasks by the addition of ethanol.
The mixture was left in the dark at room temperature for 30 min
after the reaction mixture was vortexed thoroughly. Absorbance
was measured immediately at 517 nm by UV spectrophotometer
and the solution containing only anhydrous ethanol served as
the blank. Vitamin C standard antioxidant (2.0, 4.0, 8.0, 16.0,
32.0, and 40.0lg/mL) was used as a reference standard. DPPH
free radical scavenging activity was calculated using the following
formula:
DPPH scavenging activityð%Þ¼½ A
0 /C0 A1ðÞ =A0/C138/C2 100
where A0 ¼ absorbance of the blank sample, and A1 ¼ absorb-
ance of the test sample.
ABTS radical cation scavenging activity
The ABTS radical cation scavenging activity was determined
according to the method of Re et al. (1999). ABTS was dissolved
in deionized water to a 7.0 mM concentration. ABTS radical cat-
ion (ABTS
/C15þ ) was produced by reacting ABTS/C15þ solution with
140 mM potassium persulfate and allowing the mixture to stand
in the dark for 12 – 16 h at room temperature before use.
Subsequently, the ABTS
/C15þ solution was diluted in ethanol to
obtain an absorbance of approximately 0.51 ± 0.02 at 734 nm. A
volume of 0.6 mL of SL-GAC with different concentrations was
added to 2.4 mL amount of ABTS/C15þ solution for 10 s, and stood
for 6 min in the dark. The reference compound (vitamin C) was
used at the same concentration as the SL-GAC. Thereafter, the
absorbance of all test tubes was determined at 734 nm. The solu-
tion containing only anhydrous ethanol served as the blank and
all determinations were carried out in triplicate. The percentage
of inhibition of ABTS
/C15þ was calculated using the following for-
mula:
ABTS radical scavenging activity ð%Þ¼½ A0 /C0 A1ðÞ =A0/C138/C2 100
where A0 ¼ absorbance of the blank sample, and A1 ¼ absorb-
ance of the test sample.
Inhibition of linoleic acid autoxidation
The ferric thiocyanate method (Ozsoy et al. 2008) was used to
determine the inhibition of peroxidation of linoleic acid. Five
mL of SL-GA (10 mg/mL) were added to a solution mixture of
2.5% linoleic acid in ethanol (4 mL), anhydrous ethanol (4 mL),
and 8 mL of 0.05 M phosphate buffer (pH¼ 7.0). Total mixture
was diluted to 25 mL with distilled water, and the final concen-
tration of SL-GAC was 2.0 mg/mL. The solution was incubated
and then placed in an oven at 40
/C14 C in the dark. The degree of
oxidation was measured every 24 h by sequentially adding 0.1 mL
of the SL-GAC sample solution, 9.7 mL of 75% ethanol, 0.1 mL
of 30% ammonium thiocyanate and 0.1 mL of 0.02 M ferrous
chloride in 3.5% hydrochloric acid. The mixture was let to stand
for 3 min, the peroxide concentration was spectrophotometrically
determined by reading the absorbance at 500 nm.
Hydroxyl radical scavenging assay
Different concentrations of the SL-GAC solution (40, 80, 120
and 160 lg/mL) were added to reagent solution (7.5 mM iron
38 C. WU ET AL.
sulphate, 5 M diphenanthrene solution in ethanol, 0.01 M phos-
phate buffer, 1% H2O2) and incubated at 37/C14 C for 1 h. The reac-
tion mixture without sample was used as control. The hydroxyl
radical was investigated by monitoring absorbance at 536 nm.
Ferric reducing antioxidant potential assay
The ferric reducing power of SL-GAC was determined using
Ferric reducing antioxidant potential (FRAP) assay. This method
is based on the reduction of the ferric ion (Fe
3þ) to the ferrous
ion (Fe2þ) by antioxidants in the sample (G €ulc¸in 2015). The
reduction is monitored by measuring the change of absorbance
at 700 nm. The working FRAP reagent was prepared daily by
mixing 30 mL of 10 mg/mL potassium ferricyanide solution, with
7.5 mL of 1 mg/mL ferric chloride solution, with 30 mL of 0.01 M
phosphate buffered solution and with 7.5 mL of 1.2 mM hydro-
chloric acid. Different volumes of SL-GAC reserve solution
(1.6 mg/mL) were mixed with freshly prepared FRAP reagent
(5 mL), and deionized water was added to 10 mL. The reaction
mixture was incubated for 30 min at room temperature, and the
absorbance of the samples was measured at 700 nm. Increased
absorbance of the reaction mixture indicated increased reduc-
ing power.
Establishment of iron overload-induced liver injury in mice
The animal study was performed according to the guidelines
established by the National Institutes of Health, and with permis-
sion from the Animal Experiment Committee of Jilin University
(approval number: 20180303). Healthy male C57BL/6J mice
(8 weeks old) were purchased from Changsheng Experimental
Animal Company (Liaoning, China), and were kept at 23 ± 2
/C14 C
under a 12 h dark/light cycle, with a relative humidity of 50– 55%
and allowed access to normal laboratory pellet diet and waterad
libitum. After acclimatizing for a week and weighing, mice were
randomly divided into four groups: control, model (FE),
model þ DFO (FED), and SL-GAC groups, with each group con-
taining 10 mice. Except for the control group, which was pro-
vided with a regular diet and physiological saline, the other three
groups were fed with ordinary diet supplemented with 3% car-
bonyl iron for 12 weeks to induce iron-overload condition. In
the meantime, from week 2, in addition to the same treatment as
that of the FE group, mice of FED and SL-GAC groups were
intraperitoneally injected with DFO (150 mg/kg body weight),
intragastrically administered with SL-GAC (200 mg/kg body
weight) every day, respectively. DFO is poorly absorbed from the
gastrointestinal tract when taken orally, resulting in a decrease of
its bioavailability. Therefore, iron overload-induced liver injury
mice were treated with DFO via the method of intraperitoneal
injection. Moreover, SL-GAC ameliorated significantly the hep-
atic damage and iron overload in a mouse ALD model induced
by alcohol in our previous study, and the mice were intragastri-
cally administered with SL-GAC. In the present study, we
conducted experiment with reference to the administration of
SL-GAC on mice ALD model, and the selected administration
were effective on iron overload-induced liver injury mice model.
At the end of experiment of the study, and after 12 h of food
deprivation, the excrement of mice was collected and frozen in
liquid nitrogen. Then, all mice were narcotized with lidocaine
and killed by cervical dislocation, the blood was collected from
each of the mice by cardiac puncture for biochemical analysis.
After the clotting of blood samples, serum was separated by cen-
trifugation and stored at /C0 80
/C14 C until analysis. Liver was
immediately excised, weighed, snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen,
and stored at /C0 80 /C14 C for further analyses. One part of the liver
tissues was fixed in 4% neutral formalin for histopatho-
logical analysis.
Measurement of iron indices and serum parameters
Serum samples of mice were prepared by centrifuging the whole
blood for 8 min at 2,000g and stored at /C0 80 /C14 C until used for
biochemical analysis. The level of ALT, AST and c-GT was
measured by automatic biochemical analyzer according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. Serum iron, liver iron and TIBC
were measured with the iron and iron binding – capacity kit.
Serum iron concentration was determined using the assay
based on the generation of an iron-ferrozine complex. Iron
concentration in the digested liver sample was measured spectro-
photometrically at 535 nm, following reaction with 2 mM batho-
phenanthroline disulfonic acid. The TS was directly calculated
from the serum iron and TIBC, and UIBC was equivalent to the
sum of TIBC and serum iron.
Determination of liver MDA, SOD, GSH, TG and TC levels
Liver samples were dissected out and washed immediately with
ice cold saline to remove as much blood as possible. Then, liver
was weighed and homogenized at a ratio of 1:9 (w/v) in 0.9%
saline solution. The homogenates were centrifuged at 3,000 rpm
for 10 min at 4
/C14 C, the supernatant was harvested and the levels
of MDA, GSH, SOD, TG and TC were determined using com-
mercial kits according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
Measurement of ROS production in liver of mice
The smaller liver fragments (3/C2 3 /C2 3 mm) were embedded by
optimal cutting temperature embedding agent in the pre cooled
cryostat. After frozen, the tissue sections were made, the thick-
ness was about 5 mm, and 5 M dihydroethidium (be configured
with PBS) was used at 37
/C14 C. After incubation for 15 min, rinsed
slices with PBS for 3 times and observed under confocal laser
scanning microscope (magnification, 200/C2 ). Fluorescence inten-
sity was observed, each group of three samples, the same expos-
ure intensity and time to take photographs.
Western blot assays
Mice liver tissue samples were removed from/C0 80
/C14 C and lysed
in radioimmunoprecipitation (RIPA) lysis buffer, followed by
grinding with tissue lyser at 60 HZ for 2 min at 4
/C14 C and then
put on ice for 30 min. The lysates were centrifuged for 15 min at
12,000 rpm at 4/C14 C. Bicinchoninic acid kit for determination of
the protein concentrations of collected supernatant. Next, equiva-
lent amounts of protein samples were separated by 10% sodium
dodecyl sulphate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-
PAGE), and transferred to polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) mem-
branes. Membranes were blocked with 5% non-fat milk for at
least 2 h and then incubated with primary antibody at 4
/C14 C over-
night, followed by incubation with a horseradish-peroxidase-con-
jugated secondary antibody at room temperature for 2 h. The
protein bands were visualized using enhanced chemolumines-
cence. The glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH)
antibody was used as a control.
PHARMACEUTICAL BIOLOGY 39
Measurement of hepatic index
Body weights and liver tissues of mice were measured at the ter-
mination of the study. Hepatic index was estimated from the
ratio of liver tissue weight to body weight (liver tissue weight/
body weight /C2 100).
Histopathology and immunohistochemistry assays
Liver specimens from central zone of medial lobe were cut into
about 3 mm thick, fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin for
12 h and then embedded in paraffin. Next, the paraffin block was
sliced into 5lM thick sections, stained with hematoxylin-eosin
according to the manufacturer ’s instructions, and examined
microscopically for histopathological changes. Meantime, immu-
nohistochemistry (IHC) assay for ferritin of sections obtained
from 10% paraffin-embedded tissues was performed by the one
step polymer-HRP Detection Kit (BioGenex) according to the
manufacturer’s protocols. Subsequently, these stained sections
were visualized and photographed under inverted microscope
(100 /C2 magnification).
Statistical analysis
All data were presented as means ± SEM. Differences among
groups were assessed by using Student’s t-test and one-way ana-
lysis of variance. p < 0.05 was considered to indicate a statistic-
ally significant difference. Calculations were performed with the
SPSS, Version 26, statistical software package.
Results
In vitro study
Antioxidant activity of SL-GAC
For the determination of antioxidant capacity of SL-GAC
in vitro, DPPH, ABTS and hydroxyl radical scavenging activities,
linoleic acid autoxidation inhibition capacity and Fe
3þ reduction
capacity were used. As shown inFigure 1A and B, SL-GAC was
identified as the potent antioxidant against DPPH and ABTS
with IC50 values of 24.92 ± 0.46mg/mL and 128.36 ± 6.57mg/mL,
respectively compared to vitamin C (IC50 ¼ 44.78 ± 0.62lg/mL
and 114.30 ± 0.61mg/mL). In addition, scavenging activity of SL-
GAC on Fenton hydroxyl radicals increased with increase in the
concentration of SL-GAC. Excitedly, the ability of SL-GAC to
scavenge hydroxyl radicals in Fenton reaction were stronger than
those of vitamin C at the same concentrations ( Figure 1C).
Moreover, the results of inhibition of linoleic acid autoxidation
showed that the percentage of inhibition of linoleic acid peroxi-
dation by the SL-GAC was comparable with that of vitamin C
during the 14 d of experiment and significantly prolonged the
induction period of autoxidation as compared to control (Figure
1D). Furthermore, Furthermore, the reducing capacity of Fe3þ
showed an accelerating trend with increased concentrations of
SL-GAC (Figure 1E). The results, therefore, indicated that SL-
GAC appeared to possess potent antioxidant activity and free
radical scavenging abilityin vitro.
In vivo study
Iron levels of serum and liver tissue in mice
Compared to normal mice, the serum iron, hepatic iron and TS
levels increased to 63.84%, 1079.31%, and 71.69% in the iron-
overloaded mice, respectively. Administration of SL-GAC signifi-
cantly reduced serum iron content to 29.57%, and liver iron level
to 101.16%, and TS level to 29.18% (p < 0.01) (Figure 2A, B and
C). Additionally, UIBC, a measure of the iron binding reserve of
serum is significantly lower in FE group relative to control mice.
When the iron overloaded mice were treated with SL-GAC, there
was a significant increase in serum UIBC (p <0.01) (Figure 2D).
But TIBC levels in the serum were not significantly different
among the four groups (Figure 2E). These results revealed that
SL-GAC can normalize the liver iron, and the serum iron levels
of iron overloaded mice.
SL-GAC chelates extra-hepatic iron in mice
Ferritin is a hepatic protein that plays vital roles in diagnosing
and predicting diseases, its levels reflect body iron stores and are
elevated with inflammation in chronic liver injury (Cao et al.
2021). Immunohistochemistry evaluation showed that the posi-
tive immunohistochemical reaction (brown color) of liver tissue
in FE group was higher than that in the control group, while the
positive brown staining of liver tissue in SL-GAC group was sig-
nificantly less compared with FE group ( Figure 3A ).
Furthermore, western blot assays showed that the elevated levels
of the ferritin light chain in FE group compared with control
group, was remarkably decreased in SL-GAC group (Figure 3B-
C). The transferrin receptor (TfR1), a type II transmembrane
glycoprotein that binds transferrin (Tf) and mediate cellular iron
uptake through endocytosis of iron-loaded transferrin. Inside the
cell, Tf is trafficked to early endosomes, delivers iron, and then
is subsequently directed to recycling endosomes to be taken back
to the cell surface (Mayle et al. 2012; Candelaria et al. 2021).
Iron overloaded mice showed significantly increased TfR1 level
compared with blank mice, whereas SL-GAC supplementation
significantly reduced TfR1 accumulation (Figure 3B-C).
Biochemical parameters
The ALT, AST andc-GT are enzymes produced by the liver that
indicate liver damage or disease at high concentrations in the
blood (Van Beek et al.2013). Compared to the blank group, lev-
els of these serum markers increased significantly in iron-over-
loaded mice ( p <0.01), interestingly, treatment with SL-GAC
reversed the increase of serum ALT, AST andc-GT that led to
reduced liver injury induced by iron overload in mice (p <0.01)
(Figure 4A– C).
ROS production
Oxidative stress is a major pathogenetic event occurring in sev-
eral liver disorders ranging from metabolic to proliferative ones.
The effects of SL-GAC on ROS levels in liver tissue of iron-over-
loaded mice were detected using the Dihydroethidium staining.
As shown in Figure 5, the intensity of the red fluorescence was
stronger in liver of iron-overload-induced mice compared with
the control group, the increased red fluorescence intensity was
attenuated significantly by SL-GAC ( Figure 5), indicating that
SL-GAC could reduce effectively the excessive ROS production.
Oxidative stress of liver tissue
The levels of SOD, GSH, and lipid peroxidation product MDA
were evaluated to assess the level of oxidative damage and the
antioxidant effects of SL-GAC. As expected, the iron overloaded
mice showed increased MDA while SOD and GSH levels
40 C. WU ET AL.
decreased compared with blank mice. Conversely, the model
mice supplemented with SL-GAC showed markedly reduced
MDA with elevated SOD and GSH levels in comparison to the
FE group (p <0.01) (Figure 6A– C). We further elucidated the
effects of SL-GAC on hepatic steatosis in iron treated mice. As
shown in Figure 6D-E, treatment with iron overload induced a
remarkable increase of TC and TG in the liver compared to
blank group, and the overexpression of total cholesterol (TC)
and triglyceride (TG) in FE group were significantly reversed in
the SL-GAC group (p <0.01). These results demonstrated that
SL-GAC can effectively attenuate lipid peroxidation and reduce
oxidative stress induced by iron-overload in mice.
Histopathological liver damage and physiological indexes
Morphometric analysis of liver tissue via HE staining revealed
that the structure of hepatic lobules was intact in the blank
group, as characterized by the radiating arrangement of hepatic
cells and cords around the central vein, as well as the hepatic
sinusoids were regularly distributed. In FE group, the hepatic
lobule structure appeared disintegrated, meanwhile, proliferating
fibrous tissues and pseudolobules were seen (black arrows), and
scattered lymphocyte infiltration (green arrows) in the liver
interstitium were observed in the liver tissues. Photomicrographs
of the liver in the SL-GAC group showed a relatively normal
hepatic architecture, with a preserved parenchymal structure and

occasional infiltration of inflammatory cells (green arrows)
(Figure 7A), indicating that SL-GAC suppresses liver injury in
iron-overloaded mice by attenuating the morphological abnor-
malities and pathological injury of the liver induced by iron.
Additionally, we found that liver weights were 53.11%, 37.19%,
and 28.38% lower in the blank, FED and SL-GAC groups than
that in FE group (Figure 7B). Along with that, liver index of the
iron overloaded group was significantly higher than blank
(p < 0.01), and while that of FED and SL-GAC groups showed a
significant recovery compared with model group ( p <0.01)
(Figure 7C ). These results suggested that SL-GAC effectively
improved pathological injury and physiological indexes of liver
tissue of mice with iron overload-induced liver injury.
Discussion
Iron plays a crucial role in the body, it is important for us to
maintain an adequate supply of iron to synthesize oxygen trans-
port proteins, and participates in numerous processes necessary
for normal body functions (Wallace2016). As there is no active
mechanism for the excretion of excess iron from the body,
imbalance of iron absorption and excretion leads to a progressive
accumulation of iron in tissues and organs. Numerous epidemio-
logical studies have reported that accumulation of iron in the
organs is toxic and has been linked to a wide variety of life-
threatening conditions, such as liver disease, heart problems and
diabetes (Jaishankar et al. 2014). The damage is particularly
severe to the liver, which is the main site of iron storage in the

body (Anderson and Frazer2005). Free cellular iron can partici-
pate in the Fenton reaction and catalyse the conversion of hydro-
gen peroxide to a more powerful and damaging hydroxyl free
radical (Beaufay et al. 2020). A chronic increase of iron in the
body can induce overproduction of free radicals, which further
causes oxidative stress and leads to the cellular injury and patho-
logic change (Uttara et al. 2009). Emerging evidence also sug-
gests that oxidative stress, mediated by free radicals and ROS,

may have a role in the pathophysiology of iron-induced liver
injury (Galaris et al.2019; Hassani et al.2020). Gallic acid (GA),
a naturally occurring phenolic acid, is well known as a powerful
antioxidant and provides efficient protection against oxidative
damage (Sanchez-Martin et al. 2022). However, poor bioavail-
ability of GA is shown due to its low lipid solubility that does
not allow its penetration into cell membranes, which results in
an inability to achieve its desired pharmacological functions
(Ahmed et al.2018). Our previous studies found that SL-GAC, a
complex synthesized from GA and soybean lecithin, significantly
increased bioavailability of GA, improved pharmacological
effects, and had no effects on safety for the organism (Wu et al.
2019). Presently, we designed an iron-overload induced oxidative
stress model in mice to further evaluate the effects of SL-GAC
on iron-overload induced oxidative stress and liver injury.
Iron is present in the human body and exerts its physiological
functions in both the ferric (Fe
3þ) and ferrous (Fe 2þ) states.
Because iron converts easily between its ferrous (Fe2þ) and ferric
state (Fe3þ), many proteins utilize iron as a cofactor to catalyze
redox reactions (Gulec et al. 2014). In the presence of oxygen,
excess ferrous iron (Fe 2þ) can participate in the Fenton or
Fenton-like reactions to react with H2O2 and generate one of the
most deleterious reactive oxygen species, hydroxyl radical; see
reaction (1) (Zhao2019).

The hydroxyl radical is an extremely reactive free radical
formed in biological systems and has been implicated as a highly
damaging species in free radical pathology, capable of damaging
almost every molecule found in living cells (Wintola and
Afolayan 2011). Among the oxygen radicals, the hydroxyl radical
is the most reactive and induces severe damage to adjacent bio-
molecules (Birben et al. 2012). These radicals have the capacity
to join the nucleosides in DNA and cause strand breakage, which
contributes to carcinogenesis, mutagenesis, and cytotoxicity
(Jeong et al. 2010). Due to the abstraction of hydrogen atom
from unsaturated fatty acid, these radicals also are considered to
be rapid initiators of the lipid peroxidation process (Yamada
et al. 2016). Linoleic acid is the most abundant polyunsaturated
fatty acids (PUFA) in vivo, and susceptible to lipid peroxidation
mediated by oxygen free radicals. Currently, lipid peroxidation is
considered as the main molecular mechanisms involved in the
oxidative damage to cell structures and in the toxicity process
that leads to cell death (Zhang et al.2018). To the best of our
knowledge, among of all antioxidant properties, radical scaveng-
ing, reducing power and inhibition effect upon linoleic acid aut-
oxidation are most commonly used for the evaluation of
antioxidant activity (Islam et al. 2021), including the
determination of DPPH and ABTS which are synthetic stable
free radicals in vitro. Our results showed that SL-GAC may offer
resistance against the oxidative stress by scavenging the Fenton
hydroxyl radicals, inhibiting peroxidation of linoleic acid, and
enhancing ferric reducing powerin vitro (Figure 1).
Approximately 80% of total body iron is functional, located in
haemoglobin, myoglobin and iron-containing enzymes
(Hernando et al. 2014), and the remainder is largely stored as
ferritin in the liver, which contains mainly the light chain and
can store up to 4500 atoms of iron (Anderson and Shah2013).
However, if the storage capacity of ferritin is reached, free iron
will accumulate in the cells and can cause cellular and tissue
injury (Kohgo et al.2008). In addition, an additional fraction of
free iron is absorbed in the intestinal tract and circulated in the
blood (Kohgo et al. 2008). In the circulation, a smaller amount
of iron is usually bound to transferrin (Tf), which is central pro-
teins in the regulation of iron metabolism and involved in trans-
porting iron between absorption, utilization, excretion,
reclamation and storage areas (Gao G et al. 2019). Transferrin
receptor 1 (TfR1) is a classical functional receptor, when serum
Tf-bound iron (Fe
2-Tf) binds to TfR1, Fe2-Tf is internalized by
endocytosis (Candelaria et al. 2021). Internalized Fe 2Tf-TfR1
complexes within the endosome release iron when endosomal
pH is acidified (Kohgo et al.2008). The resulting apotransferrin-
TfR1 complex is then recycled back to the cell surface for reutil-
ization (Kohgo et al. 2008). The TfR1, as the main cellular
importer of iron, delivers iron to cells via receptor-mediated
endocytosis and allows for transferrin-bound iron uptake in
mammalian cells, thereby plays a role in regulating iron homeo-
stasis by balancing iron uptake with intracellular storage and
utilization (Candelaria et al.2021). As expected, the elevated lev-
els of the serum iron, hepatic iron, TS, ferritin, ferritin light
chain and TfR1 in iron-overloaded mice were remarkably
restrained in SL-GAC treated group (Figures 2 and 3), which
indicates that SL-GAC can reduce iron overload in liver and
may be administered as an antidote for management of
iron overload.
When hepatocytes are injured or inflamed, higher amounts of
alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase
(AST) are released into the extracellular compartment, which
increases levels of ALT and AST in serum and further reflects
the degree of hepatocyte injury to a certain extent (Goorden
et al. 2013; Lim 2020). Therefore, the elevation of serum ALT
and AST is considered to be an important index for judging the
severity of hepatic injury (Han et al.2011). The c-GT is a mem-
brane enzyme found in hepatocytes and biliary epithelial cells, it
helps the liver metabolize substances, such as drugs, alcohol, and
toxins (Rajagopal and Rafi 2005). High levels of c-GT in the

blood may be a sign of liver disease or damage to the bile ducts,
as c-GT may leak into the bloodstream when the liver is dam-
aged (Whitfield 2001; Beek et al. 2013). In this study, the
increase of ALT, AST andc-GT in the iron overloaded-mice was
markedly reversed after treatment with SL-GAC (Figure 4).
Excessive iron increases ROS productionvia the Fenton reac-
tion, which causes oxidative damage and even triggers cell death,
ultimately causing hepatic injury (Dixon and Stockwell2014;W u
et al. 2021). Present study found that SL-GAC substantially
decreased the expression level of ROS (Figure 5). To combat the
excessive free radicals, living cells are armed with a group of
intracellular antioxidant enzymes such as SOD and GSH perox-
idase, which act as a first line of defences (Nemmiche 2017).
SOD, a metalloenzyme present in all oxygen-metabolizing cells,
which converts the extremely toxic superoxide radical into
potentially less toxic hydrogen peroxide, and is the key line of

defense for organisms against the toxicity of reactive oxygen spe-
cies (Rahal et al. 2009, 2014). The level of SOD activity can be
used to evaluate the degree of liver injury (Rahal et al. 2014).
GSH, with the enzymes GSH peroxidase and glutathione disul-
fide reductase, serve to detoxify hydrogen peroxide to water and
molecular oxygen and help scavenge free radicals produced in
cells, thereby reducing the damage to the cell membrane
(Narayanankutty et al. 2019). Free radicals initiate the lipid per-
oxidation process in an organism (Gaweł et al. 2004). The MDA
is one of the most important products of membrane lipid peroxi-
dation in the cells and the final product of lipid oxidation, which
can be used to determine the degree of membrane lipid peroxi-
dation and indirectly measure the degree of oxidative damage
(Gaweł et al. 2004; Galaris et al. 2019). Liver injury can lead to
the transfer of fatty acids to the liver, resulting in an increase of
TG content in the liver, while TC reacts to lipid peroxidation in
the liver, and the TC level in the body increases (Gong et al.
2008; Zhou et al. 2021). In this study, the elevated levels of
MDA, TC and TG was observed in iron overloaded mice.
Interestingly, after treatment with SL-GAC, not only significantly
reversed these parameters but also the levels of SOD and GSH in
iron-overload mice were markedly increased (Figure 6), further
suggesting SL-GAC possesses hepatoprotective effects by attenu-
ating oxidative stress in liver.
Liver index is an important indicator to measure hepatic
injury in animal experiments, and it has been used to evaluate
the degree of experimental liver damage (Zhu et al.2021). The
changes in liver weight can directly reflect hepatic damage
(Wang et al.2019). The present study showed that iron overload
caused the increase in the liver weight and liver index in mice,
and SL-GAC effectively alleviated the increase in iron overloaded
mice. Further, our findings confirmed that SL-GAC can protect
the integrity of the structure of liver tissues and alleviate the
damage to the liver organ of iron-overloaded mice (Figure 7).
These results indicated that SL-GAC can protect liver tissue
from iron overload damage.
Conclusions
Accumulation of excess iron causes oxidative damage of biomo-
lecules, which causes tissue injury primarily liver dysfunction.
Observations from in vitro studies concluded that the SL-GAC
possesses promising antioxidant capacity and free radical scav-
enging properties. Further, in vivo studies reported the amelio-
rating effect of SL-GAC against iron-overload-induced liver
damage. Treatment with SL-GAC reduces the accumulation of
excess iron in serum and liver tissue, restored serum parameters,
restrains ROS production and reduces oxidative stress in liver

firmed by physiological indexes and histopathological analyses
(Figure 8). Collectively, SL-GAC has great potential as a prevent-
ive and therapeutic agent for iron-overload-induced liver injury.

Figure 8. Schematic presentation indicates the suggested mechanism by which SL-GAC-induced hepatoprotective effects. Iron-overloaded mice model is successfully
induced by feeding with 3% carbonyl iron-containing diet, followed by intragastric treatment of soybean lecithin with gallic acid (SL-GAC). The SL-GAC significantly
inhibits the increase of liver weight and liver index in mice, and as well as effectively prevented the high expressions of liver injury markers (ALT, AST and c-GT) in
iron overloaded mice, which might be a promising therapeutic agent for liver damage. Mechanically, SL-GAC reduces iron accumulation and mitigates oxidative dam-
age through scavenging radical, attenuating lipid peroxidation, restraining ROS production and decreasing levels of TfR1, FL and Ferritin, resulting in the inhibition of
oxidative stress to suppresses liver injury in mice with iron overload.
