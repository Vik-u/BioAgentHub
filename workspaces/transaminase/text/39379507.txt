The prevalence of alcohol use disorder was found 75% higher among amphetamine dependent 
patients. Alcohol and amphetamine alone have nephrotoxicity and hepatoxicity. But, the degree of 
risk with coabuse of alcohol and amphetamine is unknown. The objective of this study was to assess 
toxic effects of amphetamine-alcohol co-abuse on the liver and kidney. he present study was a cross-
sectional study conducted et al. Amal Hospital for Mental Health, Qassim region, KSA and include one 
hundred participants. Seventy-five participants were patients hospitalized for the treatment of abuse, 
and twenty-five participants, were healthy voluntaries, have no history of abuse. An experienced 
psychiatrist conducted patient interviews and assessed the patients using the DSM-5 criteria. The 
data from healthy participants were considered as a control. The abuse group was paired with the 
control group by age and lifestyle. Participants were split into: Group I: Control group (n = 25); Group 
II: Amphetamine (AMP) abuser group (n = 25); Group III: Alcohol abuser group (n = 25) and Group IV: 
Combined drug abuser group (AMP and alcohol) (n = 25). The socio-demographic data was collected. 
Complete medical examination, Body Mass Index and samples of blood and urine were collected from 
all participants for analytical tests; determination of alcohol and AMP levels, kidney functions and liver 
functions. The mean BMI values in groups II, III, and IV showed no significant change from the control 
group. The serum level of albumin and alkaline phosphatase showed significant decrease in all abuser 
groups. While, alanine transaminase (AL T), Aspartate transaminase (AST) and osteopontin levels 
showed significant increase in all abuser groups. Fasting blood sugar values showed significant increase 
in alcohol abusers. On the other hand, it revealed no significant change in AMP and combined groups. 
The mean values of urea showed no significant change in AMP and alcohol abusers and significant 
increase in combined drug abuser group. The serum creatinine and all abuser groups showed significant 
increase in Cystatin C. The alteration in the most of studied biochemical parameters were more than 
two folds in combined group compared with that of AMP or alcohol groups. Study reveals synergistic 
liver and kidney toxicity. Amphetamine-alcohol co-abuse significantly heightens kidney and liver 
toxicity.

Substance usage and abuse are pervasive health problems. According to research by Stinson et al.1, patients who 
are amphetamine addicted have a 75% greater prevalence of alcohol use disorder. For instance, according to a 
study, almost 60% of amphetamine users in New Y ork City admitted to abusing the drug in addition to alcohol2. 
Amphetamine combined with THC and ethanol was implicated in 52% of deaths, according to Attafi et al.3.
Co-abuse of substances poses significant health risks. Combination alcohol along with other substances of 
abuse are quite common among 4. Public health has recently grown very concerned about the interaction of 
ethanol and other substances of abuse, including AMP , opiates, nicotine and γ-hydroxybutyric acid5.
Amphetamine abusers frequently use alcohol and have a higher risk of reaching alcohol intoxication 
level6.  Alcohol may slow the metabolism of amphetamine by lowering the amount of p-hydroxylated 
amphetamine metabolites in amphetamine abusers’ urine. A higher blood concentration of amphetamine 
may result from this 7. Additionally, amphetamine and its active metabolite were more widely absorbed and 
distributed when alcohol was consumed8.
A study conducted in 2012 by Kirkpatrick et al. 9 showed that abusing alcohol and amphetamine together 
caused tachycardia, elevated mood, and changed sleep and performance. These results highlight the concerning 
possibility of co-abusing amphetamine and alcohol since amphetamine may conceal symptoms of alcohol 
intoxication, such as sedation and compensatory performance, enabling abusers to drink more alcohol at the

risk of becoming toxic. Amphetamines in combination with alcohol abuse induces tachycardia and elevated 
myocardial10. A rat study found that drinking alcohol and amphetamine at the same time can have a synergistic 
effect on spatial memory impairment11.
Alcohol and other drugs of abuse are frequently combined, possibly due to the stronger feelings of “high” 
than those experienced with each drug alone or the less strong experiences of alcohol’s harmful consequences12. 
According to a 2018 Saudi Arabian survey, abuse of two or more substances, such as alcohol and AMP , is the 
most prevalent. 60% of people who abuse multiple drugs13.
A prominent factor in the toxicity of AMP is excessive extracellular dopamine, norepinephrine, and serotonin. 
Secondary consequences include renal, hepatic, muscular, lung, and GI problems in addition to the core clinical 
problems substantial neurological and cardiovascular effects14.
Acute liver injury that is clinically evident and occasionally severe or even fatal has been linked to AMP use. 
Amphetamines metabolized in the liver, primarily through the P450 system (CYP 2D6) and subsequently toxic 
metabolites are produced especially at high doses15.
Acute kidney damage induced by AMP is known to occur through a number of pathways. Myoglobinuria-
associated tubular damage related to rhabdomyolysis was discovered to be the most prevalent mechanism. 
Common nephrotoxic effects include necrotizing vasculitis, prerenal azotemia, hyponatremia, and malignant 
hypertensive nephropathy16.
Alcohol abuse, especially in heavy drinkers, is a significant risk factor for a variety of toxic effects and, as a result, 
contributes significantly to the worldwide burden of illness. Alcohol actually contributes to the development of 
more than 30 diseases. Liver and renal disease, infectious illnesses, cancer, diabetes, neuropsychiatric diseases, 
cardiovascular disease, and unintentional and intentional harm are the most prevalent disease categories that 
are caused by alcohol usage17.
Heavy drinking might result in the most tissue damage to the liver because it is the main location for the 
metabolism of alcohol. Steatosis, hepatitis, and fibrosis/cirrhosis are the most recognizable liver lesions that are 
caused by prolonged and heavy alcohol use18.
The relationship between alcohol use disorder (AUD) and kidney damage is intriguing but debatable, and it 
is not well understood how alcohol may harm the kidneys at the molecular level. There is limited experimental 
data directly connecting alcohol use to kidney damage, and epidemiological research aiming to establish a link 
between AUD and renal disease have so far shown conflicting results. However, research focusing on other 
organs and tissues raises various hypotheses for how alcohol can contribute to kidney disease19.
One potential explanation is oxidative stress brought on by increased reactive oxygen species generation, 
which can result in excessive free radical synthesis and subsequent tissue damage and inflammation. In addition, 
AUD appears to accelerate adverse pathological processes that are damaging to the kidneys in its effects on 
other important organs (liver, heart, intestines, and skeletal muscle) (Varga et al. 2017). It should be noted that 
these pathways have not yet been confirmed in kidney experiments. To determine if alcohol actually encourages 
kidney damage and the potential processes by which alcohol-induced kidney damage can occur, more research 
is required19.
A study with a limited sample size and few animal studies focused on the toxic consequences of co-abuse of 
AMP and alcohol on the heart and brain, despite the fact that there is evidence that the prevalence of co-abuse 
of AMP and alcohol is considerable 19. Limited studies on combined substance abuse toxicity were performed. 
Co-abuse is a serious threat to health as a result of negative interaction with one another and very common 20. 
The aim from co-abuse is to have more euphoric highs. The most frequently included in co-abuse is alcohol. 
Although the situation is grave, it is unknown whether co-abuse of drugs studied, and no prior research has 
looked into the damaging consequences of both on the liver and kidneys. Prior research lacks focus on combined 
toxicity. Therefore, the present study plans to investigate the toxic effects of AMP co-abuse with alcohol on the 
liver and kidney. The objective of this study was to assess toxic effects of amphetamine-alcohol co-abuse on the 
liver and kidney.
Subjects and methods
This study was a cross-sectional study compares abuser groups with controls conducted et al. Amal Hospital 
for Mental Health, Qassim region, KSA and includes 100 participants. Seventy-five participants were patients 
hospitalized for the treatment of addiction and 25 participants were healthy voluntaries with no history of abuse 
and were defined as control group. The Control group was matched with abuse group by age and lifestyle. The 
medical history of all the participants was recorded. Abusers were interviewed by an experienced psychiatrist and 
evaluated according to the DSM-5 criteria. The data from healthy participants were considered as control. The 
samples were collected at first day of admission. The participants were divided into four equal groups (n = 25) as 
follows: Group I Control group (participants designated as control); Group II (AMP abuser group); Group III 
(Alcohol abuser group) and Group IV [Combined drug abuser group (AMP and alcohol)]. All attempts were 
made to exclude from study any subjects who abused other illicit substance and their combination with alcohol 
or amphetamine like opioids, cocaine, cannabis, etc., had past-history of diseases, taken any medications that 
could have an impact on the biochemical parameters and who are less than 18 years and more than 60 years old 
that would affect the measured parameters in this study.
Medical examination
The history of the patients was recorded from their medical record including age, sex, special habits, occupation, 
toxicological history, medical disease, and drug treatments. A complete physical examination was done including 
cardiological and neuropsychological examinations.

Determination of body mass index (BMI)
A carefully calibrated electronic balance (Camry EF711H, China) was used to measure the weight of each 
participant wearing light clothes without shoes. Each person’s height was measured with their shoes off using 
a height measuring tape (Seca 206, USA). Weight divided by the square of height (kg/m2) was used to measure 
the BMI21.
Urine sample collection and storage
Under quality control and safety procedures, 25 cc of urine was collected at admission in a plastic container and 
stored at – 20 °C until analysis22. The initial day of admission saw the collection of the samples.
Blood sample collection and storage
Under strictly sterile settings, blood samples were taken by clean venipuncture with sterile, single-use syringes. 
Each patient, along with the controls, had approximately 5 ml of blood taken. A clean, dry test tube was filled with 
blood, which was then left to clot at room temperature. The serum was extracted and aliquoted into Eppendorf 
tubes after centrifuging at 1600 rpm for 5 min. Until they were used, serum samples were kept at − 80 °C in 
firmly covered tubes21. The initial day of admission saw the collection of the samples.
Determination of amphetamine in urine
A competitive binding-based chromatographic immunoassay using (model 8691C from Macherey–Nagel in 
Dueren, Germany). Amphetamines that might be in the urine sample compete with the drug conjugate for 
antibody binding sites. The urine sample moves upward during the test due to capillary action. Below 1,000 ng/
mL of AMP did not saturate the antibody-coated particles’ binding sites in the test strip. The immobilized AMP 
then caught the antibody-coated particles, conjugated them, and produced a visible colored line in the area of 
the test line. If the AMP concentration was greater than 1,000 ng/ml, the colorful line did not form in the test 
line area due to saturation of all the anti- AMP antibody binding sites. A colored line in the test line area was 
generated for a urine sample that tested positive for drugs, while a line was formed for a sample that tested 
negative for drugs or contained drug concentrations below the cut-off. A colored line always appears in the 
control line region as a procedural control, showing that the proper volume of sample has been introduced and 
membrane wicking has taken place23.
Blood alcohol concentration
In order to determine blood ethyl alcohol concentration, two tubes of venous blood must be drawn as soon 
as patients arrive. Following the use of benzalkonium chloride to disinfect the venepuncture site, matched 
samples were collected into unmarked blood collection tubes. The data management system kept track of the 
collecting time. Following immediate delivery to the laboratory, samples were centrifuged for 10 min at 3000 × g. 
For both specimens, measurements were made immediately following centrifugation. Using the Beckman-
Coulter Olympus AU400 auto analyser and a Synchron Systems Ethanol Assay kit (A-E 474,947), blood ethanol 
concentration was determined (Beckman Coulter Inc., Melville, USA). The conversion of ethanol and NADH 
into acetaldehyde catalyzed by alcohol dehydrogenase and NADH during this process. To determine the amount 
of ethanol present in the sample, the rate of absorbance was recorded at 340 nm24.
Determination of serum albumin level
The serum albumin concentration was determined in accordance with the approach of Bowers and Wong 25 
using commercial kit supplied by Diamond (Egypt).
Determination of serum aspartate aminotransferase (AST) activity
Serum Aspartate aminotransferase was determined spectrophotometrically (Model 6305. Bibby Scientific Ltd, 
Staffordshire, United Kingdom) according to manufacturer’s instructions, using Transaminase kit (Sigma–
Aldrich, Saint Louis, U.S.A.)26.
Determination of serum alanine aminotransferase (AL T) activity
Serum Alanine Aminotransferase was determined according to Modified Reitman & Frankel Method 
spectrophotometrically (Model 6305. Bibby Scientific Ltd, Staffordshire, United Kingdom) according to the 
manufacturer’s instructions, using Transaminase kit (Sigma–Aldrich, Saint Louis, U.S.A.)26.
Determination of serum alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity
Serum Alkaline Phosphatase was analyzed according to King & King Method spectrophotometrically (Model 
6305. Bibby Scientific Ltd, Staffordshire, United Kingdom) according to the manufacturer’s instructions, using 
kits (Sigma–Aldrich, Saint Louis, U.S.A.)27.
Determination of serum osteopontin (OPN)
 The OPN ELISA kit from Sigma-Aldrich uses the quantitative sandwich enzyme immunoassay method. An 
OPN-specific monoclonal antibody has been pre-coated on the microtiter plate. The wells of the microtiter 
plate were then filled with standards or samples, and any OPN that was present bound to the antibody-coated 
wells. A standardized preparation of a polyclonal antibody coupled to horseradish peroxidase (HRP), specific for 
OPN, was added to each well in order to “sandwich” the OPN immobilized on the plate in order to quantify the 
amount of OPN present in the sample. After the microtiter plate has been incubated, any unbound components 
were removed by thoroughly washing the wells. Substratum solutions were then poured into each well. In a 
brief incubation period, the enzyme (HRP) and substrate were allowed to react. Only the wells with enzyme-

conjugated antibody and OPN showed a color shift. The enzyme–substrate reaction was halted by the addition 
of a sulphuric acid solution, and the color change was detected spectrophotometrically. In a nutshell, the needed 
number of coated wells were placed in the holder, and the corresponding well received 50 L of Standards (each 
standard’s bottle was gently shaken by hand before being pipetted up and down three times before adding) or 
samples. In the empty control well, 50 L of PBS (pH 7.0-7.2) was added. 50 mL of samples were filled with 5 l of 
balance solution, and the mixture was thoroughly stirred. To each well, 100 mL of conjugate were added. It was 
thoroughly jumbled. At 37° C, the plate was covered and incubated for an hour. A wavelength of 450 nm was 
used to measure the color shift28.
Determination of fasting blood sugar
With the use of the Glucose Assay Kit, Enzymatic-Colorimetric technique, serum glucose levels were assessed 
(GOD-PAP; Glucose oxidase-phenol, and four aminophenazone)29.
Determination of serum creatinine
When creatinine was combined with picric acid in an alkaline solution, a red tautomer of creatinine picrate was 
created, and its intensity can be quantified spectrophotometrically30.
Determination of serum urea
Acidic reaction nearly at 100 °C occurs when urea and diacetyl monoxime react, resulting in a red product that 
may be quantified colorimetrically25.
Determination of serum cystatin C (CYS-C)
Measurement of Cystatin C by ELISA applies the immunoassay technique by Spectrophotometer (Bibby 
Scientific Ltd, Staffordshire, United Kingdom, Model 6305). A specific anti-cystatin C antibody that was coated 
on latex particles attaches to the sample and induces agglutination. The level of cystatin C in the sample directly 
correlates with the optical measurement of the agglutination-induced turbidity. Bringing all of the reagents to 
room temperature was the first step in getting ready for the experiment. The experiment was carried out at room 
temperature. Sated wells included, sample, standard, and blank wells. To the matching standard wells, 50 μl of 
Standard (S1, S2, S3, S4, S5, S6) was added. Each sample well received a 50 μl addition of sample. It was added 
HRP-conjugate reagent (100 μl) the standard and sample wells. The plate was sealed with a plate membrane 
and heated to 37 °C for 60 min. All wells, including the blank wells, were washed four times in total. Each well 
received equal amounts of chromogen solution A and B (50 μl). The mixture was gradually incorporated. The 
Plate was incubated at 37 °C in the dark for 15 min. Then all wells received 50 μl of stop Solution. After applying 
stop solution, the optical density was recorded at 450 nm with an ELISA reader after 15 min31.
Statistical analysis
Data were gathered, collated, and statistically evaluated using one-way analysis of variance (ANOV A) to look 
for differences that were statistically significant between the abuse groups and the controls and combined 
group. Results were presented as means ± SEM, and a p value of less than 0.05 was used to determine statistical 
significance. The relationships between the study groups in each of the parameters determined using Pearson 
correlation coefficients. For all statistical analysis, the SPSS Version 21.0 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY , USA) 
software package was utilized.

Discussion
According to this study, all the patients were men. This might be as a result of the fact that men have more 
freedom than women to leave the house and remain out late, to visit rest spots, and to travel with their peers 
more readily than women. SUD is seen as a serious issue in Saudi Arabia, and research linking it to psychiatric 
illnesses, a number of diseases, significant losses in educational and occupational opportunities, as well as the 
resulting socioeconomic burden, is well- established32.
This study indicated that the majority of abusers were between the ages of 31 and 40. There has been a 
surge in SUD among Saudi citizens at this range of ages, according to several reports 33. An analysis of patients 
admitted to the Buraidah psychiatric rehabilitation clinic was conducted in the Al-Qassim district. Most 
abusers were between the ages of 20 and 40, unable to finish their high school education, and thus dropped out. 
Additionally, 60% of the study’s subjects were found to be heavy drug users, primarily of alcohol and AMP . This 
study found that most abuser groups had married marital status. According to a study, married AMP users were 
bodybuilders34.
The most commonly abused substances among Saudis are amphetamines, heroin, alcohol, and cannabis, and 
a majority of abusers are addicted to multiple substances. The substance that appears most frequently in many 
polydrug usage repertoires is alcohol. It is essential to be aware of the dangers of combining stimulants and 
depressants. The blend of these substances can have perilous, even lethal, results 32. In recent years, combining 
alcohol with other addictive substances like AMP has become a big public health concern. The perception of 
amplified euphoric and pleasurable effects and diminished negative subjective effects may contribute to drug 
dependence. Antioxidant enzyme levels may decline as a result of co-abuse of alcohol and psychostimulants. 
Alcohol also stimulates inhibitory GABAergic and OPergic neurons while inhibiting excitatory gluergic 
neurons. Additionally, alcohol may alter the liver’s CYP enzymes, which altered the plasma level of medications 
including AMP . Greater organ toxicity could result from AMP and alcohol exposure. Increased formation of 
reactive oxygen species (ROS) that change signal transmission or oxidative stress-related damage to cellular 
macromolecules such lipids, proteins, and DNA, the latter of which results in altered gene expression, may be 
the cause of this interaction35,36.
Alcoholism can lead to disorders of the liver as cirrhosis, hepatitis, and fatty liver 34. The liver performs the 
majority of the metabolism of alcohol. Alcohol-related negative health effects are primarily liver-related. Alcohol 
damages the liver in a wide variety of ways. Acetaldehyde is produced when alcohol is metabolized and both 
substances are harmful to hepatocytes. Due to strong reactivity of acetaldehyde, it can induce a variety of protein 
and DNA adducts37,38. Damaged hepatocytes then emit molecular patterns associated with danger, which attract 
innate and adaptive immune cells and continue liver damage by causing sterile inflammation34.
Alcohol can harm the liver and subsequently alters drug metabolism. So, alcoholics are more vulnerable 
to drug poisoning e.g. AMP . In addition, alcohol causes depletion of glutathione (a hepatoprotective 
compound) storage brought on by alcohol, a person is more vulnerable to the toxicity of medicines e.g. AMP34. 
Amphetamine can also induce toxic effects on the liver. Amphetamine-induced liver damage might occur due to 
direct dose-dependent liver damage or auto-immune hepatitis-like injury, which resolves on its own upon drug 
withdrawal39,40. Many cases may be asymptomatic and go undetected 41. Numerous studies have revealed how 
AMP affects all the body’s organs by increasing free radical generation and oxidative stress42. In this study AMP , 
alcohol and combination groups demonstrated significant increase in alanine aminotransferase and aspartate 
aminotransferase an indicative of hepatotoxicity and significant decrease in alkaline phosphatase activities. A 
study reported that alcohol abusers had significantly lower levels of ALP and higher levels of AST, GGT and 
bilirubin43. Our results also confirmed earlier reports in which the authors paid attention to the toxic effects of 
drugs and alcohol on the liver 44, these results agree with, who observed significantly elevated ALT and AST of 
alcoholic consumptions to control subjects45.
The current study revealed that, AMP significantly increases hepatic AST and ALT. This study confirmed 
earlier reports in which the authors paid attention to the toxic effects of AMP and alcohol on the liver 46. The 
study was consistent with the results of our study. They discovered that AMP users had better biochemical liver 
functioning values than alcoholics28.
Alcohol abuse is regarded as a potential risk factor for the development of type 2 diabetes mellitus. However, 
drinking alcohol leads to the dysregulation of a number of metabolic processes, including a failure in the insulin-
mediated glucose function of adipocytes and a liver-specific impairment of insulin action. Additionally, the 
impacts of impaired glucose homeostasis and insulin resistance, which are impacted by changed appetite that 
controls peptides and neurotrophic factors, are linked to the neuronal profiles of alcoholism 47. Alcoholism has 
been linked to increased glucose levels, which raises the risk of metabolic syndrome and diabetes. These data 
agree with the study’s findings. Amphetamine and its derivatives have been shown in numerous investigations 
to significantly lower blood glucose levels in experimental mice. Another study found that, in part because of 
a direct impact on the pancreas, AMP increased the secretion of insulin in rats and mice 48. The present study’s 
findings corroborate past studies about the drop in blood glucose levels. However, our research does not back up 
the assertion that administering AMP to animals resulted in a momentary increase in blood sugar levels.
The serum albumin levels of the alcohol group significantly decreased, according to the current study. Our 
findings are consistent with earlier studies that showed acute alcohol consumption in humans significantly 
decreased plasma total protein and albumin levels 49. According to data, drinking alcohol may prevent the 
production of proteins, particularly in heavy drinkers 50. Despite the fact that AMP poisoning cases have been

www.nature.com/scientificreports/
documented in the literature. Our findings demonstrated that the AMP group’s serum albumin level was much 
lower, and Nabavizadeha et al.44 corroborated these findings.
Osteopontin (OPN) is a predictor in a variety of hepatic illnesses. OPN concentrations are substantially 
correlated with hepatocellular carcinoma, hepatic insufficiency, fibrosis stage and portal hypertension. OPN plays 
a role in the etiology of numerous chronic hepatic illnesses, including drug-induced liver injury, alcoholic and 
non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, and viral hepatitis. OPN correlates with alcoholic hepatitis, hepatic inflammation 
and hepatic fibrosis, as has already been shown in alcoholic patients51. These results supported ours and showed 
that patients with alcoholic hepatitis had higher OPN levels.
There is debate over whether drinking excessively leads to kidney damage. The suggested mechanism is 
oxidative stress, which causes an excessive amount of free radical production, increasing inflammation and 
causing tissue damage52. The combined abuse of alcohol and AMP may severely elevate the liberation of free 
radical and induce impairment of kidney function tests 53. Our investigation established a link between the 
disordered use of alcohol and AMP and abnormal kidney function tests.
Patients with liver impairment may benefit from using Cystatin C, a novel serum biomarker that increases 
in the presence of kidney disease, as a better surrogate marker to measure kidney function9. These data support 
our findings.
Hyperpyrexia and fibrinolysis are linked to the renal side effects of AMP use disorder. Renal failure can also 
be brought on by microvascular blockage brought on by myoglobinuria, systemic hypotension, or hyperpyrexia. 
Amphetamine use may result in increased oxidative stress or mitochondrial malfunction, which can lead to 
tubular damage in kidney tissue54,55. Combined abuse causes greater biochemical alterations.
Conclusion
The outcome of this study revealed that the addiction of alcohol, AMP and combined AMP plus alcohol was 
associated hepatotoxicity and nephrotoxicity. Amphetamine-alcohol co-abuse significantly heightens kidney 
and liver toxicity. Addiction of combined AMP plus alcohol had a synergistic hepatotoxicity and nephrotoxicity; 
so therapeutic plan should be focusing on how to manage this synergistic hepatotoxicity and nephrotoxicity. 
Understanding the dangers implied can assist people with pursuing informed choices and look for suitable 
assistance and treatment.
