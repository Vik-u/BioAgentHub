Introduction
Given their wide availability and structural versatility,c arbohy-
drates from plant cell walls are an important raw material for
the production of new biobased products that reduce reliance
on petroleum. To date, most applications of plant carbohy-
drates begin by deconstructing polysaccharides to monomers
for fermentation to fuels and platform chemicals.[1–5] Bifunc-
tional molecules containing at erminal acid and an amine func-
tionality are among the desired products, because they are key
building blocks in the synthesis of different types of poly-
mers.[6, 7] For example, diacids, diamines,a nd AB monomers
(e.g.,m olecules containing both carboxylic acid and amino
groups)a re required for polyamide synthesis,[8] andd iacids
and diols for polyester synthesis.[9–13]
An emerging area of research aims to utilize the versatility
and ensuingu seful properties of native structures present in
plant carbohydrates instead of degrading the structurest o
monomers.[14–17] Bifunctional carbohydrates (e.g.,d iacids, dia-
mines, or AB monomers) from native carbohydrate structures
are among the desired products. Besides enzymatic synthesis
of amino sugars from activated sugar nucleotides and sugar
phosphates,[18–20] biocatalytic cascades to amino carbohydrates
directly from biomass-derived carbohydrates are still missing. If
established, these pathways would create an ew class of tele-
chelic, amino-functionalized buildingb locks that retain inher-
ent attributes of native carbohydrate structures (e.g.,b iocom-
patibility,h ydrophilicity), while being primed for assembly
(e.g.,t hrough stable amide linkages) with other building
blockso rp olymers with complementary functionalities (e.g.,
carboxyl groups).[15, 21, 22]
Existing chemical pathways for carbohydrate amination in-
clude applications of 2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine-1-oxyl
(TEMPO) to oxidize primary hydroxyl groups[23] and sodium pe-
riodate to oxidize secondary hydroxyl groups,[24] followedb y
reductivea minationt oa ssemble the correspondinga mines.[25]
These routes, however, often requiret oxic transition metal cat-
alysts,p roduce volatile organic compounds, and result in de-
creasedp olymer chain length.[26] As ag entle alternative to
chemicalo xidation procedures, the galactose oxidase from Fu-
Plant-derived carbohydrates are an abundant renewable re-
source.T ransformation of carbohydrates into new products, in-
cluding amine-functionalized building blocks for biomaterials
applications, can lower reliance on fossil resources. Herein, bio-
catalytic production routest oa mino carbohydrates, including
oligosaccharides, are demonstrated. In each case, two-stepb io-
catalysis was performedt of unctionalize d-galactose-contain-
ing carbohydrates by employing the galactose oxidasef rom
Fusariumg raminearum or ap yranose dehydrogenase from
Agaricusb isporus followed by the w-transaminase from Chro-
mobacterium violaceum (Cvi-w-TA). Formation of 6-amino-6-
deoxy-d-galactose, 2-amino-2-deoxy-d-galactose, and 2-amino-
2-deoxy-6-aldo-d-galactose was confirmed by mass spectrome-
try.T he activity of Cvi-w-TAw as highest towards 6-aldo-d-gal-
actose,f or which the highest yield of 6-amino-6-deoxy-d-galac-
tose (67 %) was achieved in reactions permitting simultaneous
oxidation of d-galactose and transamination of the resulting 6-
aldo-d-galactose.

sarium graminearum (FgrGaOx, UniProt:A 0A2H3HJK8) has
been used to introduce an aldehyde functionality at the C-6
positiono f d-galactose and in d-galactose-containing oligo-
and polysaccharides.[15, 27, 28] Specificity of FgrGaOxt owards the
C-6 position of d-galactoseh as been well documented,[29] and
the resulting oxidized positions have served as sites for further
derivatization, includingr eductive amination,c ross-linking
througha cetal formation,a nd phosphorylation.[15, 30,31] Further-
more, we recently described the application of the oligosac-
charide oxidase from Sarocladium strictum to permit amide
bond formation with clickable monomers, leadingt ot elechelic
molecules from xylo-oligosaccharides that are primed for reas-
sembly throughc opper-catalyzed azide–alkyne cycloaddi-
tion.[22] Thus, chemo-enzymatic routes to aminated carbohy-
drates have been demonstrated;h owever,f ully biocatalytic
cascadesf or amination of nonactivated carbohydrates are un-
precedented yet highly desirable to simplifyr eaction pathways,
increases ustainability,a nd to achieveg reater control over re-
action products.
Transaminases are pyridoxal 5’-phosphate (PLP)-dependent
enzymes that catalyze the transfer of an amino group from pri-
mary amines acting as the amine donor to carbonyl com-
pounds acting as amine acceptor.[32] Briefly,t ransaminases op-
erate through ap ing-pong, bi-bi reaction in which the first
half-reaction involves the transfer of the amino group from the
amine donor to the PLP cofactor.T he deaminated amine
donor (i.e.,t he respective ketone/aldehyde product) is then re-
leased, leaving the cofactor as pyridoxamine 5’-phosphate
(PMP). In the second half-reaction, the amino group is trans-
ferred from enzyme-bound PMP to the acceptor,r egenerating
the PLP cofactor and completing the transamination cycle.
Transaminases have been functionally classified as a-transami-
nases (a-TAs) and w-transaminases (w-TAs), on the basis of
amine donor anda cceptor specificity.W hereas a-TAs transfer
amino groupsf rom the a-carbon atom of amino acids to a-
keto acids, w-TAs are more versatile as they do not requirea
carboxylate group in the amine acceptor andc an donate
the amino group to a-keto acids as well as other ketones
and aldehydes.[32–34] In addition to substrate versatility,n or e-
quirementf or cofactor regenerationo rn ucleotide sugars as
substrates is ad istinguishing advantage of w-TAs relative to
other types of enzymes potentially capable of producing car-
bohydrate amines (e.g.,r eductivea minases).[35–37] So-called
sugar transaminases have been shownt oa ccept nucleotide
sugars as amine donors and acceptors;[19, 20] however,t hese are
not suitable for direct amination of biomass-derived carbohy-
drates.
Aminesi ng eneral are greatly underrepresented in renewa-
ble biomass compared with the frequent need for amines in
chemicals and polymer synthesis.[38, 39] This makes biocatalytic
production of amines from alcohols highly desirable,y et chal-
lenging,b ecause no known single enzyme can catalyzes uch a
transformation, and the chemical or chemo-enzymatic meth-
ods involving oxidation and reductive amination often involve
toxic chemicals and requirec omplicated synthetic proce-
dures.[40–42] To date, w-TAs have been studied extensively for
asymmetrics ynthesis of pharmaceuticals, which has been sum-
marizedi ns everalr eviews.[41, 43–45] In this context, enzymatic
pathways from primary and secondary alcohols to the corre-
sponding amines,b yu tilizing oxidases or alcohold ehydrogen-
ases coupled with an w-TA, have been demonstrated.[46–48] By
contrast, application of w-TAs for bioproduct development
from renewable biomass has only been investigated in af ew
studies.[49, 50] For example, Lerchner et al. showedt he two-step
conversion of isosorbide to the corresponding diamine using
an alcohol dehydrogenase and an w-TA.[49, 51]More recently,
Dunbabin et al. demonstrated transaminase-catalyzed produc-
tion of furfurylamines from furfurals.[52] On the other hand, the
ability of FgrGaOx to oxidize C-6 hydroxyl groupso ng alactose-
containing mono-, oligo-,a nd polysaccharide substrates has
been shown to be an efficient way to produce aldehyde-func-
tionalized carbohydrates,[27, 28] which might be accepted by w-
TAs. Moreover,c arbohydrate oxidoreductases with different
regio- and substrate specificities beyondt he oxidation of the
primary C-6 hydroxyl group (e.g.,p yranose dehydrogenases)
can helpe xtend the range of available carbonyl-containingc ar-
bohydrates to ketone-functionalized carbohydrates, which are
also potentials ubstrates for w-TAs.[53–55]
The w-TAf rom Chromobacterium violaceum (Cvi-w-TA, Uni-
Prot:Q 7NWG4) is recognized as having ab road substrate
range and has activity towards hydroxylated aldehydes such as
d-erythrose (1), glycolaldehyde, and glyceraldehyde.[47, 48,56] In
the presents tudy, Cvi-w-TAw as investigated for its potentialt o
aminate aldol- and keto-carbohydrates initially formed through
oxidation by FgrGaOx or the pyranose dehydrogenase from
Agaricusb isporus (AbiPDH1,U niProt: Q3L1D1),[53] respectively.
Cvi-w-TAa ctivity on oxidized carbohydrates was also compared
against the M1 variant of the w-TAf rom Vibrio fluvialis (Vfl-w-
TA,U niProt: F2XBU9) engineered by the group of Bornscheuer
for improved preference towards substrates other than pyr-
uvate and generally improved activity in the neutral pH
range.[57] Our analysisd emonstrates biocatalytic cascades to
aminated cyclic carbohydrates, including oligosaccharides
(Scheme 1). Corresponding pathways generate an ew class of
renewable telechelic molecules that were missing from the ar-
senal of buildingb locks to new biobased polymers.
Results and Discussion
Activityo f Cvi-w-TAt owards oxidized d-galactose and
d-galactosamine
The yields of FgrGaOx and AbiPDH1 produced in Pichia pastoris
were 108 and 3.9 mg L@1,r espectively, and the yields of Cvi-w-
TA and Vfl-w-TAM 1p roduced in E. coli were 115a nd
98 mg L@1,r espectively (Figure S1 in Supporting Information).
These valuesa re in the same range as previous reports de-
scribing the recombinant production of these enzymes.[58, 59]
Activity of Cvi-w-TAt owards the oxidized carbohydrates pro-
duced by FgrGaOx or AbiPDH1,a nd towards pyruvate and d-
erythrose (1), was measured by using the acetophenone
assay.[60] Here, Cvi-w-TAe xhibited significant activity towarda l-
dehyde 2b (160 :1U g@1), which, albeit lower than the Cvi-w-
TA activity measured towardp yruvate( 2995 :90 Ug @1), was in

the same order of magnitude as that toward 1,w hich is ap re-
ferred substrate of Cvi-w-TA( Table 1; Scheme 1).[56] Importantly,
formation of hydrateda nd oxidized derivatives of 2b in the re-
action mixture effectively lowers the concentration of inter-
mediate aldehyde 2b in reactions involving d-galactose (2a )
compared with pyruvate and 1.[28] AbiPDH1 was previously
shown to primarilyt arget the C2 positiono f 2a,[53] and this
suggestst hat 2-ketogalactose (2d)s erved as the main sub-
strate for subsequent transamination by Cvi-w-TA. Although
the activity of Cvi-w-TAt oward 2d was about3 0% of that
measured with 2b (Table 1), Cvi-w-TAa lso showeda ctivity
toward this sugar substrate yielding amine 2e in the multi-
enzyme cascade (Figure 1B ). Although am inor fraction of 2a
is expected to be in the open-chain conformation, transamina-
tion of the C1 aldehyde was not observedb yt he acetophe-
none assay,n or were the corresponding products detected by
high-performance anion-exchange chromatography with
pulsed amperometricd etection (HPAEC-PAD) or mass spec-
trometry.A ctivity of Vfl-w-TAM 1t owards the FgrGaOx and
AbiPDH1 products was tested, butw as found to be lesst han
10 %o ft hat of Cvi-w-TA, which is why experiments
with Vfl-w-TAM 1w ere not continued.
The purified FgrGaOx and Cvi-w-TA, or AbiPDH1
and Cvi-w-TA, were then tested in combination to
establish at wo-step pathway to amino carbohy-
drates. Specifically, 2a was oxidized to aldehyde 2b
by FgrGaOx and then treated with Cvi-w-TAi na na t-
tempt to produce amine 2c.A lternatively, d-galac-
tose was oxidized to ketone 2d by AbiPDH1 and
then treated with Cvi-w-TAi na na ttempt to produce
amine 2e .I nt he case of each sequential reaction, a
near-quantitative yield for the oxidation of 2a was
confirmed by TLC before initiating the transaminase
reaction( data not shown).
Mass spectrometric ESI-Q-TOF analysis verified the
enzymatic production of both amines 2c and 2e .
The masses of protonated and sodiated ion adducts
of amines 2c (Figure 1A )a nd 2e (Figure 1B), as well
as the expected isotopes, were all found for corre-
sponding reactionm ixture and confirmed their pro-
ductiont hrough the oxidoreductase-transaminase
cascade reactions.

tured to produce diamine 2g,w hich is expected to
permitc arbohydrate coupling through imine bond
formation.[61] The activity of FgrGaOx toward 50 mm
2e was determined with the ABTS assay to be

that of FgrGaOx toward 2a.F ormation of the corre-
sponding bifunctionali ntermediate product 2f was

complete conversion in the subsequent transami-
nase reaction wasv erified by HPAEC-PAD (Figure S3

Although depletion of intermediate 2f through formation of
imine derivatives can not be ruled out, Cvi-w-TAa ccepted 2f
as as ubstrate, as shown by using the acetophenone assay
(Table 1).
Quantification of 6-amino-6-deoxy-d-galactosef rom
d-galactose
The comparison of different oxidized forms of 2a showedt hat
the highest Cvi-w-TAa ctivity was obtainedw ith aldehyde 2b
(Table 1). Therefore, the sequential, two-step enzymatic conver-
sion of 2a to amine 2c was monitored by HPAEC-PAD to quan-
tify product formation (Figure 2).
As previously reported,[28, 29,62] oxidation of 2a by FgrGaOx
generated severald ifferent derivatives of the aldehyde group,
including the hydrate (geminal diol) and the corresponding
uronic acid due to furthero xidation (data not shown). Accord-
ingly, 2a and chemically synthesized 2c were used to generate
standard curves to calculate substrate depletion in the oxida-
tion reactiona nd product formation in the amination reaction
(Figure S2 in Supporting Information). Nearly all (95 :2m ol %)
of 2a was depleted in the sequential oxidation and amination
reaction, in which the formationo f 2c from 2a was 18 :
2m ol %p rior to any optimization.N otably,c alculating the for-
mation of 2c on the basis of the consumption of 2a inevitably
underestimates the efficiency of the amination step, as side re-
actions can occur after formation of intermediate 2b,[28] and so
not all of this intermediate is available for the desired transami-
nation step. In an attempt to reduce the formation of side
products from 2b by reducing the time 2b remains in aque-
ous solution, the sequential, two-step enzymatic reactions
were instead performed simultaneously.I ndeed, performing
the oxidization and transamination steps simultaneously in-
creasedt he formation of 2c nearly 2.5-fold (Table 2). As imilar
relative increasef rom sequential tos imultaneous reactionw as
observed when l-alanine was used as the amine donor,b ut
the yields obtained with l-alanine were roughlyt en times
lower than those with 1-PEA as amine donor. Thisw as consis-
tent with the unfavorable equilibrium for this reaction.[47, 48, 63]
It is also notable that increasingt he concentration of the PLP
cofactorf rom 20 mm to 1m m only moderately increased prod-
uct yields in sequential reactions (Table 2) Because isopropyla-
mine (IPA) is the preferred amined onor used by industry to
push reaction equilibria towards the aminated product owing
to its low cost and easyr emoval of the acetone byproduct,[63]
IPAw as tested herein as am eanst of urther increase the forma-

Activityo f Cvi-w-TAt oward selectedo xidized6 -aldo-d-galac-

Besides monosaccharide substrates, Cvi-w-TAw as tested on a
series of d-galactose-containing oligosaccharides, each of
which was first oxidized with FgrGaOx. As done for 2a,n ear-
quantitative oxidation of each oligosaccharide was confirmed
by TLC (data not shown), and subsequent Cvi-w-TAa ctivity
toward each oxidized carbohydrate was measured by using
the acetophenone assay with 1-PEA as amine donor.
Cvi-w-TAa ctivity was detected for all tested oxidized oligo-
saccharides generated by using FgrGaO, including aldo-meli-
biose (20 :4U mg@1), aldo-lactose (50 :6U g@1), aldo-raffinose
(50 :3U g@1), and aldo-xyloglucan oligosaccharides (32 :

mized to unequivocally confirmt he identityo fr esulting prod-
ucts, substrate docking studies showedt hat all investigated
saccharides dock similarly,w ith the catalytically relevant alde-
hyde group orientated towards the catalytically active exocy-
clic amino group of PMP (Figure S4 in the Supporting Informa-
tion). Notably,c omparison with the docked aldo-xyloglucan oli-
gosaccharide and the crystal structure of Vfl-w-TA( PDB ID:

Cvi-w-TAt owards oligosaccharides, since the active site of Cvi-
w-TAi sm ore exposed (FigureS 5).
Conclusions
We have demonstrated the applicationo ft wo different fully
biocatalytic cascades that employ carbohydrate oxidoreductas-
es to transform specifich ydroxyl groups into carbonyl groups,
and Cvi-w-TAt oi ntroduce amine functionality at the oxidized
positions of the substrates. The pathways produced amino gal-
actosesw ith two different regioselectivities:1 )t he combina-
tion of FgrGaOx and Cvi-w-TAy ielded galactose derivatives
aminateda tt he C-6 position, and 2) the combinationo f
AbiPDH1 with Cvi-w-TAy ielded galactose derivatives aminated
at the C-2 position. Production of 6-amino-6-deoxy-d-galacto-
syl-containing oligosaccharides through pathway 1w as also
detected by acetophenone activity assay.N otably, am ultistep
synthetic route was required to synthesize the aminogalactose
derivativeu sed as an analytical standard in the current study,
and this further highlightst he benefits of the biocatalytic ap-
proach.S teps taken to maximize product formation included
1) establishing as imultaneous oxidation plus transaminase re-
action to the aminated carbohydrate, 2) increasingP LP concen-
tration,a nd 3) testing of different amine donors. The greatest
gains in the formation of product 2c were achieved by per-
forming the oxidation and transamination steps simultaneously
rather than sequentially,c onsistent with reduced formation of
undesired side products from aldehyde intermediate 2b.[28]
This work takes the first step in unlocking the potential of w-
TAsf or carbohydrate functionalization and thus expands the
pool of buildingb locks available for new biobased materials.

were of reagent grade, obtained from Sigma-Aldrich (Germany),
and used without further purification unless otherwise specified.
Production and purification of Fusarium graminearum galac-
tose oxidase (FgrGaOx) and Agaricus bisporus pyranose de-
hydrogenase (AbiPDH1)
F. graminearum (FgrGaOx; d-galactose:oxygen 6-oxidoreductase, EC
1.1.13.9, CAZy family AA5_2) and A. bisporus pyranose dehydrogen-
ase (AbiPDH1;p yranose:acceptor oxidoreductase, EC 1.1.99.29
CAZy family AA3_2) were heterologously expressed in Pichia pasto-
ris KM71H. Genes (GenBank accession number:A H005781.2 coding
FgrGaOx;K M851045 AbiPDH1) with C-terminal 6 /C148 His tags were
obtained from GenScript (New Jersey,U SA) subcloned into pPIC-
ZaAo rp PICZB vectors, respectively.B oth enzymes were produced
in shake-flask cultivations, as previously described.[69] Briefly,p recul-
tures were grown in up to 750 mL of buffered glycerol-complex
medium (BMGY;1 00 mm potassium phosphate buffer,p H6 .0, 2%
(w/v)p eptone, 1% (w/v)y east extract, 4 /C148 10@5 %( w/v)b iotin, 1%
(v/v)g lycerol) at 30 8C, 220 rpm. Methanol induction was per-
formed over 4d at 25 8C, 220 rpm, in buffered methanol-complex
medium (BMMY with 0.5 %( v/v)m ethanol), whereby 0.5 %( v/v)
methanol was added every 24 ht or eplenish the inducer.
After induction and spinning down the cells, the supernatant was
recovered, adjusted to pH 7.4, and filtered through aS terivex-GP
0.45 mmP ES filter unit (Millipore, Germany). The filtrate was loaded
directly onto 6m Lo fN i-NTAr esin (Qiagen, Germany) equilibrated
in binding buffer (50 mm sodium phosphate buffer,p H7 .4,
500 mm NaCl, 20 mm imidazole) and packed in aX K-16/10 column
(GE Life Sciences, Germany). Bound protein was eluted with a
linear gradient of 0–100 %N i-NTAe lution buffer (50 mm sodium
phosphate, pH 7.4 with 500 mm imidazole, 500 mm NaCl). Purified
fractions were then exchanged to 50 mm phosphate buffer
(pH 7.5) by using a1 0o r3 0k Da Vivaspin 20 spin column (Sartorius
AG, Germany).
FgrGaOx and AbiPDH1 were concentrated to 13.5 mg mL@1 and
1.8 mg mL@1,r espectively,a nd stored at @80 8Cu ntil further use.
Protein concentration was measured by the Bradford method (Bio-
Rad Laboratories, US), and protein purity was assessed by SDS-
PAGE (Figure S1).

tent E. coli BL21. Selected E. coli transformants containing each
plasmid were grown at 37 8C, 220 rpm in shake flasks containing
250 mL LB medium supplemented with 50 mgm L@1 kanamycin and
30 mgm L@1 chloramphenicol. When the OD600 reached 0.8–1, the
E. coli transformant was induced to express the protein of interest
by addition of 1m m isopropyl-b-d-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG).
After 15 ho fi nduction at 30 8C, the cells were harvested by centri-
fugation (5000 g and 4 8Cf or 45 min). For each production, the cell
pellet was suspended in 50 mL of 50 mm potassium phosphate
buffer (pH 7.5) containing 0.1 mm PLP and lysed by using an Emul-
siflex-C3 French press (Avestin Inc.,C anada) at 10 000 PSI for
20 min.
Immediately after cell lysis, the lysates were clarified by centrifuga-
tion at 15 000 g and 4 8Cf or 45 min. The supernatants each con-
taining the soluble protein were filtered through Sterivex-GP
0.22 mmP ES filter units (Millipore). Cvi-w-TAa nd Vfl-w-TAM 1, each
containing aC -terminal His tag, were purified to homogeneity by
using Ni-NTAr esin as described above, except this time 0.1 mm
PLP was added to the binding buffer and elution buffer.P urified
fractions were then exchanged to 50 mm phosphate buffer
(pH 7.5) with 0.1 mm PLP by using a1 0k Da Vivaspin 20 spin
column (Sartorius AG, Germany). Cvi-w-TAw as concentrated to
9.5 mg mL@1 and Vfl-w-TAM 1t o3 .3 mg mL@1 and then stored at
@80 8Cu ntil further use. Protein concentration was measured by
the Bradford method (Bio-Rad Laboratories, USA), and protein
purity was assessed by SDS-PAGE (Figure S1 in Supporting Informa-
tion).
Galactose oxidase assay
The activity of FgrGaOx was measured by the chromogenic ABTS
[2,2’-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid)] assay,o rigi-
nally described by Baron et al.,[70] with modifications. The standard
reaction mixture (final volume:2 00 mL) contained 270 mg( 31 mm,
assuming purity) horseradish peroxidase (HRP,f rom horseradish,
Sigma-Aldrich, Germany), 2m m ABTS, and 50 mm 2a in 50 mm
HEPES (4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazineethanesulfonic acid) buffer
(pH 7.5);r eactions were initiated by adding 5 mLo fa ppropriately
diluted enzyme sample to obtain initial rates of reaction. Absorb-
ance was measured at 420 nm at 30 8Cf or 20 min in an Eon micro-
plate reader (BioTek, US). Activity values were calculated on the
basis of the extinction coefficient (36000 Lm ol@1 cm@1 at
420 nm).[71] Each reaction was performed in triplicate, at minimum.
Enzymatic production of oxidized carbohydrates
Enzymatic oxidation of d-galactosyl-containing substrates with
FgrGaOx (reaction volume:3 or 5m L) was performed in 15 mL
Cellstar tubes (Greiner BioOne) containing 20 mmd -galactose
equivalents of substrates (i.e., d-galactose, melibiose, lactose, raffi-
nose, or xyloglucan oligosaccharides), 150 mg( 0.44 mm) FgrGaOx,
160 mg( 0.53 mm,a ssuming purity and based on molecular weight
of the catalase monomer) catalase (from bovine liver,S igma-Al-
drich, Germany), and 27 mg( 0.12 mm)H RP in 50 mm HEPES–NaOH
(pH 7.5). Catalase was used as the primary means of removing hy-
drogen peroxide in the cascade, and HRP was included owing to
its known ability to activate FgrGaOx.[72] The effect is based on the
ability of HRP to maintain the copper radical in the active site of
FgrGaOx in the correct oxidation state (CuII).[73] The enzyme con-
centrations were chosen on the basis of previous experience to
achieve maximum oxidation of the galactosyl residues in each sub-
strate.[27,28] Reaction mixtures were incubated for 4h at 30 8Cw ith
shaking (700 rpm). Conversion of each oxidation reaction was eval-
uated by TLC (data not shown) on Macherey–Nagel precoated
silica gel plates (TLC Silica gel 60 F254). AbiPDH1 oxidation of d-
galactose was performed as described by Sygmund and co-work-
ers,[74] with minor modification. Specifically,r eaction mixtures con-
tained 58 mg( 3.61 mm)o f AbiPDH1, 50 mmd -galactose, and 5m m
benzoquinone in double-distilled water (ddH2O). The small laccase
(ScoSLAC;2 60 mg, 32.5 mm)f rom Streptomyces coelicolor was used
to recycle the electron acceptor (benzoquinone), as shown in
Scheme 1.[75, 76]
w-TAr eactions and activity assays
After verifying that the oxidation reaction had reached maximum
conversion (evaluated by TLC, data not shown), the activity of the
purified Cvi-w-TAt owards oxidized carbohydrates was measured
by chromogenic detection of acetophenone from 1-phenylethyla-
mine (1-PEA).[60] Activity of Vfl-w-TAM 1t owards aldehyde 2b was
also measured. Briefly,t ransaminase reactions (200 mLf inal volume)
were carried out at 37 8Ci n 96-well microtiter plates (96-Well UV
Microplate, Thermo Scientific, US) incubated in ap late reader
(Biotek Eon, US). The reaction mixture contained 10 mm 1-PEA (i.e.,
amine donor substrate), up to 10 mm 2b,o r6 -aldo-d-galactosyl
groups in oligosaccharide substrates, 20 mm PLP,a nd 30 mg
(2.9 mm)o fp urified Cvi-w-TAo r Vfl-w-TAM 1. The reaction was buf-
fered with 50 mm HEPES–NaOH (pH 7.5). In sequential reactions,
products of the oxidation reactions were formed over 4h as de-
scribed above and then directly used as substrates in the transami-
nase reaction. Reactions (200 mL) in which the oxidized carbohy-
drate was substituted with 10 mm pyruvate and 30 ng w-TAw as
added served as positive controls, whereas reactions in which w-TA
was substituted by ddH2Os erved as negative controls. Initial rates
were determined by colorimetric detection of acetophenone over
30 min at 245 nm.[60] Reaction mixtures were then transferred to a
Thermomixer (Eppendorf, Germany) to continue incubation at
37 8Ca nd 700 rpm for af urther 1h prior to product measurement
by HPAEC-PAD and ESI-Q-TOFm ass spectrometry as described
below.A ll reactions were performed in triplicate at minimum.
Reactions (500 mL) permitting simultaneous oxidation of galactose
(2a)t ot he aldehyde (2b)a nd transamination of 2b to the corre-
sponding amine (2c)w ere performed for 5.5 ha t3 0 8Ca nd
700 rpm in 50 mm HEPES-NaOH (pH 7.0), and the reaction mixtures
contained 10 mm 2a,1 mm PLP,a nd 10 mm 1-PEA or 10 mml -ala-
nine. Enzyme concentrations were 0.44 mm FgrGaOx, 0.53 mm cata-
lase, 0.12 mm HRP,a nd 2.9 mm Cvi-w-TA. For each simultaneous oxi-
dation–transamination reaction, as equential oxidation–transamina-
tion reaction was performed under otherwise identical conditions,
but by first running the oxidation reaction for 4h ,a nd then initiat-
ing the transaminase reaction by addition of PLP,1 -PEA, and Cvi-w-
TA,a nd allowing the transamination reaction proceed for 1.5 h.
Product formation was quantified by HPAEC-PAD.
Confirmation of the oxidation and amination products by
ESI-Q-TOF mass spectrometry
The following samples were analyzed by direct-injection ESI-Q-TOF
(Agilent 6530 Q-TOF,S ingapore): 1) 100 ppm 2a,2 )p roduct from
FgrGaOx oxidation of 2a containing up to 100 ppm 2b,3 )p roduct
of the amination reaction containing up to 100 ppm of the pro-
spective amine 2c formed in the reaction (reaction conditions
specified above). The product compounds were not isolated prior
to analysis. Prior to dilution, samples 2) and 3) were desalted with
AG 2-X8 anion-exchange resin (BioRad, US), and proteins removed
by filtration with aS artorius Vivaspin 500 spin column (10000 kDa

cutoff). Electrospray ionization was performed in positive mode,
and nitrogen gas was used as both the nebulizing and drying gas.
The following ionization parameters were used:t he drying gas
temperature was 250 8C, the drying gas flow was 3L min@1,t he ca-
pillary voltage was 3500 V, and nebulizer pressure was 103.4 kPa.
Samples were injected directly to the ion source by the infusion
pump at af low rate of 250 mLm in@1 by elution with 0.1 %f ormic
acid in 50 %a cetonitrile. Agilent Masshunter Qualitative Analysis
(version B.07.00.Ink) was used for the data analysis. All samples
were prepared and analyzed in triplicate.
Synthesis of 6-amino-6-deoxy-d-galactopyranose trifluoro-
acetate salt (2c·TFA)
Commercially available reagents were used without further purifi-
cation. Column chromatography over silica gel was performed
with Merck Millipore 60, 40–60 mm, 240–400 mesh silica gel. Reac-
tions were monitored by TLC. Visualization of the TLC plates was
achieved by UV light or staining with ab asic potassium permanga-
nate solution. 1Ha nd 13CN MR spectra were recorded with aB ruker
AV-400 (Germany) instrument at 20 8C( see Supporting Informa-
tion).
1,2,3,4-Di-O-isopropylidene-a-d-galactopyranose (1.5 g, 5.7 mmol)
was dissolved in EtOAc (38 mL) and iodoxybenzoic acid (4.8 g,
17 mmol) was added. After complete oxidation, monitored by TLC,
yielding 1,2,3,4-di-O-isopropylidene-a-d-galactohexodialdo-1,5-pyr-
anose,[77] the precipitate was removed by filtration and the crude
reaction mixture was concentrated under reduced pressure. The
crude product was purified by column chromatography (SiO2,c y-
clohexane/EtOAc 85:15 to 70:30), which afforded the product as a
clear,v iscous oil (1.00 g, 3.87 mmol, 67 %). Rf =0.51 (n-hexane/
EtOAc 2:1).
1,2,3,4-Di-O-isopropylidene-a-d-galactohexodialdo-1,5-pyranose
(250 mg, 0.97 mmol) was dissolved in as olution of ammonium
acetate (800 mg, 10.4 mmol) in methanol (5 mL). After 15 min,
NaCNBH3 (100 mg, 1.6 mmol) was added. The reaction mixture was
stirred for 24 ha tr oom temperature, after which all volatile sub-
stances were removed under reduced pressure. The residue was re-
dissolved in water (15 mL) and extracted with EtOAc (10 mL). This
organic layer was discarded. The aqueous phase was basified
(pH >12) by addition of solid sodium hydroxide. The aqueous layer
was extracted with EtOAc (3 /C148 10 mL), the combined organic layers
were dried over anhydrous MgSO4,a nd the volatile substances
were removed under reduced pressure. The product, 6-amino-6-
deoxy-1,2,3,4-di-O-isopropylidene-a-d-galactopyranose, was ob-
tained as clear,v iscous oil (180 mg, 0.69 mmol, 71 %).
The protected amino sugar (35 mg, 0.14 mmol) was dissolved in
deuterium oxide (0.7 mL), and trifluoroacetic acid (11 mL,
0.14 mmol) was added. After stirring for 24 ha tr oom temperature,
1HN MR analysis confirmed completion of the deprotection and
quantitative formation of the trifluoroacetate salt of 6-amino-6-
deoxy-d-galactopyranose. The thus-obtained solution of the syn-
thetic reference of 2c (0.2 m,0 .14 mmol, 99 %) was used without
further manipulation as stock solution (Supporting Information,
section 1).
Quantification of reaction yields by HPAEC-PAD
Amination reactions were performed as described above. Prior to
analysis, the reaction samples for HPAEC-PAD were diluted with
ddH2Ot o5 0–100 ppm of carbohydrate. Eluents used were 100 mm
NaOH (A) and 100 mm NaOH with 1 m NaOAc (B). The chromato-
graphic runs were performed with aD ionex CarboPac PA1I C
column and with af low rate of 0.6 mL min@1,w hereby 100 %e lu-
ent Aw as used for the first 5m in followed by 0–100 %e luent B
over the next 50 min. Thermo Scientific Dionex Chromeleon 7
Chromatography Data System (version 7.2 SR4, Thermo Fisher Sci-
entific) was used for data analysis. The conversion of d-galactose in
the oxidation reaction was calculated from decrease in area of the
d-galactose peak, and the yield of 6-amino-6-deoxy-d-galactose
was calculated on the basis of the peak area of the 6-amino-6-
deoxy-d-galactose standard 2c·TFA( Figure S2).
Enzyme–substrate docking
For visualization of the substrates in the active site of the Cvi-w-TA,
ar eceptor was constructed by using the crystallized transaminase
structure (PDB ID:4 A6T). The crystal structure was slightly altered
by modifying the PLP–lysine complex structure to obtain PMP and
the unbound K288 residue. Subsequently,t he modified receptor
was energy-minimized by using the YASARA[78, 79] built-in energy-
minimization function. The R416 (flipping arginine) side chain was
turned slightly upwards away from the PMP to gain space in the
large binding pocket, since the sugar substrates did not contain
charged residues.[80,81] The docking ligands 2b (6-aldo-d-galactose)
and the corresponding 6-aldo-d-galactosyl-containing aldo-lactose
and aldo-raffinose were constructed with the built-in oligosacchar-
ide building tool of YASARA, by using the b-d-conformation of
each sugar.T he docking ligand aldo-melibiose was constructed by
oxidizing the corresponding melibiose structure (PubChem Identifi-
er:C ID 11458). The XLLG molecule (Figure S6) was extracted as a
ligand from the crystal structure PDB ID:2 VH9 and subsequently
oxidized to obtain aldo-XLLG. All ligands were energy-minimized
prior to the docking experiments. The docking was performed
with YASARA by using the dock runensemble.mcr macro utilizing
the VINA docking method with appropriate simulation cells cover-
ing the active site of the receptor.T he flexible R416 residue was
fixed in place. Plausible docking results were selected by evaluat-
ing orientation of the substrate to the PMP cofactor in the active
site. In addition to the location and orientation of the substrate,
binding energies and dissociation constants reported by YASARA
were also considered (Table S2 in Supporting Information). Figures
of the dockings were created with PyMOL (The PyMOL Molecular
Graphics System, Version 2.2.0 Schrçdinger,L LC).
