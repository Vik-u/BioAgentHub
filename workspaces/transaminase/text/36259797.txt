Abstract
Naringin (Nar) has been reported to exert potential hepatoprotective effects against acetaminophen (APAP)-induced injury.
Mitochondrial dysfunction plays an important role in APAP-induced liver injury. However, the protective mechanism of Nar
against mitochondrial damage has not been elucidated. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the hepatoprotective
effects of Nar against APAP and the possible mechanisms of actions. Primary rat hepatocytes and HepG2 cells were utilized to
establish an in vitro model of APAP-induced hepatotoxicity. The effect of APAP and Nar on cell viability was evaluated by
a CCK8 assay and detection of the concentrations of alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, and lactate
dehydrogenase. The cellular concentrations of biomarkers of oxidative stress were measured by ELISA. The mRNA expression
levels of APAP-related phase II enzymes were determined by real-time PCR. The protein levels of Nrf2, phospho (p)-AMPK/
AMPK, and biomarkers of mitochondrial dynamics were determined by western blot analysis. The mitochondrial membrane
potential (MMP) was measured by high-content analysis and confocal microscopy. JC-1 staining was performed to evaluate
mitochondrial depolarization. Nar pretreatment notably prevented the marked APAP-induced hepatocyte injury, increases in
oxidative stress marker expression, reductions in the expression of phase II enzymes, signiﬁcant loss of MMP, mitochondrial
depolarization, and mitochondrial ﬁssion in vitro. In conclusion, Nar alleviated APAP-induced hepatocyte and mitochondrial
injury by activating the AMPK/Nrf2 pathway to reduce oxidative stressin vitro. Applying Nar for the treatment of APAP-induced
liver injury might be promising.

Introduction
Acetaminophen (APAP) is widely used as an over-the-
counter analgesic and antipyretic drug (1). APAP is
responsible for 46% of all acute liver failure (ALF) toxicity
in the United States (2,3) and 40–70% of all cases in the
United Kingdom and Europe (1). Currently, oxidative
stress and mitochondrial malfunction are considered the
main cellular processes mediating APAP-induced hepa-
tocytotoxicity (4–6). APAP metabolism involves hepatic
phase I and II enzyme-related detoxiﬁcation pathways (7).
Approximately 85% of APAP is converted into APAP-gluc
and APAP-sulfur via liver II binding enzymes (including
UDP-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) and sulfotransferase
(SULT)) and is then excreted in the urine (8). It is widely
believed that the toxic product of APAP , N-acetyl-p-
benzoquinone imine (NAPQI), is produced mainly via the
hepatic phase I metabolism through the cytochrome P-450
pathway (mainly through CYP2E1) (9). Under conditions
of excessive APAP , phase II metabolism is saturated, but
overproduction of NAPQI uses up liver glutathione (GSH)
and modiﬁes cellular proteins (9). Studies have shown
that protein adducts in mitochondria disrupt the electron
transport chain, generate oxidative stress and trigger
changes in mitochondrial membrane permeability, causing
pore opening, changes in the MMP , and mitochondrial

ﬁssion (7). Eventually, mitochondrial malfunction leads to
cell necrosis. Therefore, inhibiting oxidative stress and
ameliorating mitochondrial malfunction may play a crucial
role in reducing APAP-induced acute liver damage (10).
N-acetylcysteine (NAC) is an acknowledged antioxidant
that has a valid therapeutic effect on early APAP-induced
acute liver damage. However, its use is limited by its narrow
therapeutic window and side effects (11). Therefore, there
is an obvious need for new treatments that can prevent
APAP-induced acute liver damage.
Natural products, including herbs, have contributed
signiﬁcantly to drug discovery (11). Compared with
chemical compound drugs, natural products have the
advantages of few side effects, low toxicity after long-term
use, and variable bioavailability and biological activity.
Naringin (Nar) has been approved for clinical trials by the
Chinese Food and Drug Administration over the past
20 years (12). Clinical studies (registration numbers:
CTR20130704 for single-dose studies and CTR20190127
for multiple-dose studies, http://www.chinadrugtrials.org.cn/
eap/main) were conducted. Recently, numerous studies
have shown that natural products exert a protective effect
against APAP-induced hepatotoxicity and play multiple
roles in inﬂammation, the oxidant/antioxidant balance, and
damage responses (13,14). The key mechanisms of APAP-
induced liver injury include APAP metabolism, oxidative
stress, and mitochondrial dynamics, which can be regu-
lated by natural products. Nar is a dihydroﬂavonoid derived
mainly from Citrus grandis (L.) Osbeckand the immature
or nearly mature dry outer peel of grapefruit (C. paradisi
Macfad). Nar is the main active component of ganshuang
granule, an herbal prescription known for its hepatoprotec-
tive effects (15). Nar not only exhibits antioxidant activity
(15–17) but also exerts inhibitory effects on cytochrome
P450 (18). Moreover, Nar can ameliorate APAP-induced
oxidative stress and liver tissue damagein vivo (19,20).
Although both Nrf2 and AMPK proteins are reported to be
activated by Nar, no reports have addressed the mecha-
nism by which Nar affects the AMPK/Nrf2 signaling
pathway (21,22). Since mitochondrial dysfunction plays an
important role in APAP-induced liver injury, we investigated
the hepatoprotective mechanism of Nar from the perspec-
tive of regulating mitochondrial dynamics via AMPK/Nrf2
signaling pathway activationin vitro.

Isolation and culture of primary rat hepatocytes
After anesthetization with pentobarbital sodium, the liver
portal vein was exposed and a 22G type Y catheter was
inserted (BD, USA) to provide a perfusion inlet to the
vasculature of the liver. HBSS was pumped in at a rate of
18 mL/min to ﬂush the rat liver. After 15 min, type IV
collagenase was pumped in at the same rate. The liver was
cut into pieces, and hepatocytes were isolated. Hepatocyte
medium (ScienCell, USA) was added to the hepatocyte
precipitate and mixed gently. The sample was centrifuged
twice at 50g for two minutes each at 4°C. After seeding,
cells (4/C210
5 cells/well) were cultured in a 6-well plate
treated with tail collagen in a cell incubator at 37°C in 5%
CO
2. The solution was changed once at 12 h, and the mor-
phology of hepatocytes was observed prior to treatment.
Culture of HepG2 cells
HepG2 cells were maintained in our laboratory and
cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine
serum at 37°C in a cell incubator with 95% humidity and
5% CO
2 (Thermo Forma, USA). EDTA-trypsin was used to
digest cells when adherent to the wall at 85 B90%
conﬂuence, and the cell survival rate was greater than
90% for 1:4 subculture.
Establishment ofin vitro cell models
The original generation of primary rat hepatocytes or
HepG2 cells was used in the follow-up experiments. In all
Braz J Med Biol Res | doi: 10.1590/1414-431X2022e12040

experiments, cells were seeded at a proper density as
needed and used at a conﬂuence of 70–80%. Cells were
randomly assigned to ﬁve groups: 1) the control group,
which was cultured in normal culture medium; 2) the injury
group (APAP group), which was treated with 20 mM APAP
for 24 h; and 3) the three Nar groups, which were
pretreated with 1, 10, or 100mM Nar for 8 h before APAP
treatment. In addition, HepG2 cells were treated with
dorsomorphin (30mM), which inhibits AMPK phosphoryla-
tion, or brusatol (200 nM), an Nrf2 inhibitor, according to
the experimental design.
CCK8 assay
For cell viability assays, primary rat hepatocytes or
HepG2 cells were plated onto a 96-well plate at 1/C210
4
cells/mL in 100mL of medium per well and incubated for
24 h. All cells were attached to the wall. After the plate was
prepared as described in establishment of in vitro cell
models, CCK8 working solution was added, and the
absorbance at a wavelength of 450 nm was then
measured in an ELISA plate reader (Bio-Rad, USA).
ALT, AST, LDH, and GDH assays
The supernatants of the control group and the APAP
group were collected. The relevant experimental steps
were performed according to the assay methods and
instructions. The levels of alanine aminotransferase (ALT),
aspartate aminotransferase (AST), lactate dehydrogenase
(LDH), and glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH) were meas-
ured in a multifunctional plate reader.
Analysis of GSH, SOD, MDA, and ROS
The precipitated cells were washed 1–2 times with
PBS and lysed with RIPA buffer. Then, the supernatant
was taken, and the relevant experimental steps were
performed according to the test methods and instructions.
The concentrations of MDA, GSH, and ROS and the
activity of SOD in cells were measured in a multifunctional
plate reader.
Measurement of the MMP
TMRE and MitoTracker Green (Invitrogen) were added
to the different groups of cells, and the cells were
incubated in a cell culture chamber for 30 min at 37°C.
After 3 washes with HBSS, normal medium was added,
and images were acquired by confocal microscopy.
After 8 h of Nar pretreatment and 1–2 washes with
HBSS, MMP dye (Image-iT-TM TMRM reagent, 1:1000
dilution; Invitrogen) was added to the cells, and the cells
were incubated in the cell culture chamber for 0.5 h at
37°C. The cells were washed 3 times with HBSS, normal
medium or 20 mM APAP was added, and images of
high-content analysis were acquired within 3 h.
Mitochondrial depolarization was detected using a
mitochondria-speciﬁc cationic dye, JC-1, which is a new
type of cationic carbocyanine dye that aggregates in
mitochondria. HepG2 cells were pretreated with 1, 10, or
100 mM Nar for 8 h before APAP treatment. After 8 h of
incubation with APAP, 10 mg/mL JC-1 was added and
incubated in a 37°C incubator for 10 min. Then, the
charging solution was replaced with fresh medium. We
used ﬂuorescence microscopy to detect andﬂuorescence
microplate reader to analyze the ﬂuorescence signal.
A reduction in the red/greenﬂuorescence intensity ratio
indicated mitochondrial depolarization.
Western blot analysis
All samples were collected, and total protein was
extracted for concentration determination by the BCA
method. Proteins (34 mg of protein per sample) were
separated by 30% acrylamide-methylene bisacrylamide
gel electrophoresis. Membrane transfer was performed
with the wet transfer method. After transfer, Lichun red
staining reagent was used to stain the membrane, and the
transfer efﬁciency was visualized. The membrane was
incubated with the monoclonal antibody diluted with 5%
BSA-TBST overnight at 4°C. The next day, the membrane
was washed and incubated with the secondary antibody
with shaking for 40 min at room temperature and washed
3 times with TBST. A chemiluminescence solution was
used for chemical color development and imaging.
Real-time ﬂuorescent quantitative polymerase chain
reaction (RT-qPCR)
All groups of cells were collected, and total RNA was
extracted using TRIzol reagent. cDNA was synthesized
from 1 g RNA with primers and an AMV reverse
transcriptase system. An ABI StepOnePlus real-time
PCR system (TaKaRa, Japan) was used for real-time
reverse transcription PCR with SYBR Green. The primers
provided by Shanghai Sangon Company were used and
are listed in Table 1. The relative expression levels of
target genes were calculated by using theDDCt method
with the housekeeping gene GAPDH as the internal
control.
Data analysis
All results are reported as means±SD values. SPSS
23.0 software (IBM, USA) was used for statistical analysis.
Differences among groups were compared by one-way
analysis of variance (ANOVA), and pairwise comparisons
were performed withpost hocBonferroni tests. A P-value
of
o0.05 was deﬁned as statistically signiﬁcant.
Results
Nar ameliorated APAP-induced hepatotoxicity and
increased the viability of primary rat hepatocytes and
HepG2 cells
As shown in Figure 1A and D, cells in the control group
showed good growth, clear background,ﬁrm cell apposi-
tion, were ﬂattened, with high transparency and uniform

shading. Cells in the model group (APAP, 20 mmol/L)
showed signiﬁcant apoptosis, reduced cell numbers, and
reduced rounded cytosomes. Compared with the APAP
group, the cells in the Nar group showed a signiﬁcantly
improved state, with a signiﬁcant recovery of the ability
to adhere to the wall, an enlarged cytosol, and most
cells were shuttle-shaped. The morphological changes of
primary hepatocytes and HepG2 cells showed that Nar
signiﬁcantly reduced the damaging effect of APAP and
improved cell survival to a certain extent, indicating that
Nar had a certain protective effect on liver cells damaged
by APAP. The ALT, AST, and LDH activity levels in the
culture supernatant were also signiﬁcantly increased and
cell viability was signiﬁcantly decreased by administration
of APAP compared with control cells (Figure 1B, C, E,
and F). In contrast, the lower ALT, AST and LDH activities
reduced the hepatotoxic effects of APAP in cells pre-
treated with Nar.
Nar suppressed APAP-induced oxidative stress in
primary rat hepatocytes and HepG2 cells
Signiﬁcantly increased concentrations of ROS and
MDA and reduced concentrations of GSH resulted from
the addition of APAP, indicating that APAP induced oxidative
stress in hepatocytes. Moreover, APAP decreased the
SOD activity level by 35 and 25%, respectively. In the Nar
pretreatment groups, APAP-induced oxidative stress was
signiﬁcantly reduced (Figure 2).
Nar suppressed the expression of CYP2E1 in primary
rat hepatocytes and HepG2 cells
According to the data of mRNA levels of CYP2E1
using RT-qPCR, we observed that APAP alone increased
the expression of CYP2E1 in both types of cells. In
addition, with dose-dependent Nar, CYP2E1 was signiﬁ-
cantly suppressed (Figure 3A).
Nar increased the mRNA levels of phase II enzymes in
HepG2 cells
Due to the signiﬁcant differences in the levels of phase
II enzymes between rat hepatocytes and human hepato-
cytes (23), we evaluated the changes in the levels of
phase II enzymes caused by Nar in HepG2 cells. As
indicated in Figure 3B, phase II enzyme levels were
affected by even the lowest concentration of Nar.
Compared to treatment with APAP alone, pretreatment
with the highest dose of Nar resulted in increases of 46%
(UGT1A1), 109% (UGT1A3), 146% (UGT1A6), 285%
(SULT1A1), 407% (SULT2A1), 108% (GSTa1), and 76%
(GSTm1) in the levels of these enzymes. Collectively,
these results indicated that Nar induced upregulation of
phase II enzymes mRNA expression levels in the setting
of APAP-induced damage.
Nar prevented and reversed APAP-induced
mitochondrial and hepatocyte damage by regulating
mitochondrial dynamics
A decrease in the MMP is an important manifestation
of mitochondrial injury and inhibiting the decrease in
the MMP can prevent cell death. Previous studies have
suggested that APAP reduces the MMP. To explore the
effects of APAP on mitochondrial function, the MMP was
measured by two approaches. Regardless of whether
high-content analysis was used to monitor changes in
the MMP (Figure 4B, C, and D) or confocal microscopy
was used to detect changes in the TMRE/MitoTracker
Green ﬂuorescence signal (Figure 4A), APAP signiﬁcantly
reduced the MMP, while Nar increased the MMP in a
dose-dependent manner.
To evaluate the effects of APAP and Nar treatment on
mitochondrial depolarization in HepG2 cells, we used
JC-1 assay, as shown in Figure 4F. The ratio of red to
green ﬂuorescence can be used to monitor the integrity of
Table 1.Primers used in this study.

the mitochondrial membrane. After 8 h of treatment with
20 mM APAP, the red/greenﬂuorescence ratio in HepG2
cells was signi ﬁcantly reduced, while Nar treatment
increased the red/green ﬂuorescence ratio in a dose-
dependent manner.
To investigate the protective effect of Nar against
APAP-induced mitochondrial malfunction, mitochondrial
dynamics were examined in HepG2 cells. Western blot
analysis showed that APAP signiﬁcantly decreased the
expression levels of the fusion proteins Mfn1 and Opa1 to
33.7 and 78.9% of the levels in control cells (Figure 5D,
E, and F). These results demonstrated that APAP down-
regulated the fusion machinery. Despite the presence of
APAP, the administration of Nar markedly increased Mfn1
expression by 66% compared with that in control cells
(Figure 5D, E, and F). Nar also prevented the APAP-
induced decrease in Opa1 expression, increasing its
expression by 69% compared with that in control cells
(Figure 5D and F). These results showed that Nar
inhibited the APAP-induced decrease in mitochondrial
fusion protein expression. In addition, APAP affected the
activity of the ﬁssion protein Drp1, as measured by the
Figure 1. Cells pretreated with different concentrations of naringin (Nar) (1, 10, or 100mM) for 8 h were exposed to acetaminophen

Taken together, these results showed that APAP induced
mitochondrial fragmentation via downregulation of mito-
chondrial fusion proteins. Nar promoted mitochondrial
fusion, thus ameliorating mitochondrial malfunction under
APAP-induced oxidative stress.
Nar treatment induced phosphorylation of AMPK and
upregulation of Nrf2 in APAP-induced hepatotoxicity
Because Nrf2 plays a key role in regulating the
expression of numerous antioxidant enzymes (21), we
sought to determine whether Nar treatment can upregu-
late Nrf2 (Figure 6A and B). Our experiments indicated

Compared to those in the APAP group, the protein levels
of Nrf2 were increased by 101 and 105% in the groups
pretreated with 10 and 100 mM Nar, respectively. Nar
promoted the phosphorylation of AMPK in HepG2 cells
(Figure 6A and C). To further determine the link between
Nar-mediated Nrf2 and AMPK, HepG2 cells were incu-
bated with dorsomorphin (an inhibitor of AMPK) or
brusatol (an inhibitor of Nrf2). Then, we veriﬁed the effects
of these two inhibitors on Nrf2 expression and AMPK
phosphorylation and found that dorsomorphin effectively
blocked Nar-mediated Nrf2 activation and AMPK phos-
phorylation (Figure 6D, E, and F). However, brusatol had
no signiﬁcant effect on Nar-mediated AMPK phosphoryla-
tion, demonstrating that AMPK can act as an upstream
regulator of Nrf2 (Figure 6G, H, and I).
Discussion
APAP-induced liver injury is the main reason of acute
liver failure in developed countries, and existing treat-
ments are limited. Therefore, there is an urgent need
to develop new therapies (1). Normally, oxidation helps
balance signal transduction, but excessive oxidant
expression leads to disease process. Extreme oxidative
stress is crucial in APAP-induced liver injury (6). Nar has
shown the ability to reduce oxidative stress in previous
research (19,20). APAP can be metabolized by the
CYP2E1 enzyme to NAPQI, and chemically and enzymat-
ically combined with GSH, which may lead to lipid
peroxidation, nitrated protein, and subsequent liver cell
damage. Studies have shown that excessive APAP can
reduce the activity of antioxidant enzymes, and some
drugs have been proven to restore part of the enzyme’s
function (13,14,24). In this study, APAP reduced the
concentrations of GSH and SOD in hepatocytes, and
increased the concentrations of MDA and ROS, all of
which are indicators of oxidative stress. Antioxidant
enzyme levels increased in cell groups pretreated with
Nar, while MDA concentration decreased. The data
showed that an increase in the level of antioxidant
enzymes was the result of the protective effect of Nar
against APAP-induced liver cell damage. APAP increased
the expression of CYP2E1 in the liver. Nar signiﬁcantly
inhibited the expression of CYP2E1 and increased the
levels of antioxidant enzymes. This may be due to the
strong antioxidant effect of Nar. The catalytic metabolism
of phase II enzymes such as UGTs, SULTs, and GST
plays an important role in the nontoxic metabolism of
APAP. APAP was detoxiﬁed by the phase II enzymes in
the liver. Approximately 85% of APAP is transformed into
APAP-sulfur and APAP-gluc by phase II enzymes includ-
ing UGTs and SULTs (13). In this study, there were 7 kinds
of phase II enzymes involved in the detoxiﬁcation of APAP,
which were all main enzymes and main subtypes of
UGTs, SULTs, and GSTs. This study conﬁrmed that mRNA
expression of most of phase II enzymes increased in a
dose-dependent manner with Nar. At the same time, Nar
signiﬁcantly increased the mRNA levels of UGT1A9 and
SULT2A1. These results indicated that regulation of phase
II enzymes might be involved in the mechanisms by which
Nar prevents liver cell damage.
Nrf2 activation is the key to inducing phase II enzyme
expression. The importance of Nrf2 is very clear. There
are reports showing that in Nrf2-deﬁcient mice, the level of
phase II enzyme genes is signiﬁcantly reduced (25,26).

Naringin alleviates APAP-induced hepatotoxicity 9/12
The experimental results showed that Nar signiﬁcantly
upregulated the expression levels of SULTs and UGTs, as
shown in Figure 3. In addition, there are reports showing
that Nrf2-deﬁcient mice are more susceptible to APAP-
induced liver injury, which indicates that Nrf2 is a target for
liver protection (25). Nrf2 is a CNC-bZIP protein that is
considered to be the main regulator of oxidative defense
(27). Pretreatment with Nar induced the upregulation of
Nrf2 protein level. We also tested how AMPK/Nrf2 signaling
pathway affected APAP-related phase II enzymes. We
used RT-qPCR to verify that Nrf2, instead of AMPK,
upregulated the expression of related phase II enzymes
(Supplementary Figure S1). Some reports have found that
Nrf2 modulates the synthesis of GSH (24). Nar increased
the GSH levels by upregulating Nrf2 expression. These
results indicated that Nrf2 participates in the detoxiﬁcation
and antioxidant signaling pathways induced by Nar.
Mitochondrial malfunction plays an important role in
APAP-induced hepatotoxicity (5). In APAP-induced liver
injury, AMPK activation is bene ﬁcial for hepatocyte
survival and therapeutic outcome to minimize mitochon-
drial damage and/or enhance mitochondrial function (28).
The mitochondrial quality control system, which regulates
mitochondrial fusion/ﬁssion dynamics, is helpful for keep-
ing mitochondria healthy within cells (29). The outer
membrane fusion protein Mfn1 and the inner membrane
fusion protein Opa1 are involved in mitochondrial fusion,
while the ﬁssion protein Drp1, a protein that only has
biological activity after phosphorylation, participates in
mitochondrial ﬁssion. When a mitochondrion is slightly
damaged, it will fuse with a healthy mitochondrion to
replenish the damaged components and maintain the
normal function. When the mitochondria are severely
damaged and overloaded, they will actively ﬁssion,
thereby producing a healthy and a damaged mitochondria
and facilitating their separation. Healthy mitochondria can
refuse and perform their functions again. In addition, the
severely damaged mitochondria are degraded to produce
biomaterials that can be further used to synthesize new
mitochondria. Through these mechanisms of ‘‘quality
control’’, mitochondria diminish or eradicate injury from
intra- and extracellular stress. APAP can promote the ex-
pression of ﬁssion proteins (phosDrp/Drp), impair mito-
chondrial fusion, lead to mitochondrial fragmentation and
malfunction, and ultimately result in hepatocyte damage
(28). Some studies have reported that the activation of
AMPK maintains normal mitochondrial morphology and
function and prevents drug-induced mitochondrial and
hepatocellular injury (4,30). Nar can activate AMPK and
reverse the early stage of APAP-induced mitochondrial
and hepatocellular injury through several mechanisms
including the promotion of mitochondrial fusion by
increasing expression of fusion proteins (i.e., Mfn1 and
Opa1), and the downregulation of the expression of
ﬁssion proteins (phosDrp/Drp). These mechanisms
partly restore MMP and maintain mitochondrial function.
These observations suggest that Nar activates AMPK to
help reverse drug-induced mitochondrial injury and con-
stitutes a viable approach for treating APAP-induced liver
injury.
Recent studies have shown that AMPK is involved in
the activation of Nrf2 mediated by different compounds
(30,31). To verify whether AMPK mediates Nrf2 activa-
tion by Nar, we measured the effect of Nar on AMPK
phosphorylation in HepG2 cells. Nar could upregulate the
expression of pAMPK in a dose-dependent manner,
demonstrating that AMPK may activate Nrf2 signaling
pathway. In this study, the plant product Nar notably
resisted APAP-induced decrease of cell viability in primary
rat hepatocytes and HepG2 cells. The hepatoprotective
effect of Nar against APAP injury was associated with
inhibition of ROS production. Nar activates pAMPK, leading
to the increase of the vital anti-oxidant regulator, Nrf-2.
The results of this study suggested that Nar can
prevent APAP-induced hepatocyte damage in multiple
ways, as shown in Figure 7. The mechanism of Nar-
mediated expression of toxic pathways is the activation of
Nrf2 to upregulate the expression of antioxidant enzymes
and phase II enzymes, thereby accelerating the non-toxic
metabolism of APAP. Moreover, Nar can restore MMP and
maintain mitochondrial function by activating AMPK and
improving mitochondrial fusion (Mfn1/Opa1).
In summary, our experiments suggested that Nar
prevented APAP-induced hepatotoxicity through the inhi-
bition of oxidative stress, the upregulation of antioxidant
enzymes and phase II enzymes, and the promotion of
mitochondrial fusion. The compound might be a potential
protective agent against APAP-induced liver injury. To
improve clinical signiﬁcance of ourﬁndings, further studies
need to investigate the therapeutic effect of Nar against
the diseasein vivo.
