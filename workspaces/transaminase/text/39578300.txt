Abstract
Aims Our aim was to describe the pharmacokinetics of paracetamol and its metabolites in extreme preterm neonates in the 
context of patent ductus arteriosus treatment. Factors associated with inter-individual variability and metabolic pathways 
were studied. The association between drug exposure and clinical outcomes were investigated.
Methods Preterm neonates of 23–26 weeks’ gestational age received paracetamol within 12 h after birth. Plasma concen-
trations of paracetamol and its metabolites were measured throughout 5 days of treatment. Clinical success was defined as 
ductus closure on two consecutive days or at day 7. Aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase levels were 
used as surrogates for liver damage.
Results Data from 30 preterm neonates were available for pharmacokinetic analysis. Paracetamol pharmacokinetics were 
described using a two-compartment model with significant positive effects of weight on clearance and of birth length on 
peripheral compartment volume. Paracetamol was mainly metabolised into sulphate (89%) then glucuronide (6%), and the 
oxidative metabolic pathway was reduced (4%). The glucuronidation pathway increased with gestational age, whereas the 
sulfation pathway decreased. No difference was observed in drug exposure between successful and unsuccessful patients. No 
increase in aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase levels were observed during treatment, and no associa-
tion was found with either paracetamol or oxidative metabolite exposures.
Conclusion The relative proportions of the metabolic pathways were characterised with gestational age. In the range of 
observed drug exposures, no association was found with clinical response or liver biomarkers. These findings may suggest 
that paracetamol concentrations were within the range that already guarantee a maximum effect on ductus closure.
1 Introduction
Patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) is a common complication 
in preterm neonates. In the foetus, the ductus arteriosus is a 
blood vessel connecting the aorta to the pulmonary artery. 
The right atrium of the heart received oxygenated blood 
from the placenta, which then partially passes through the 
ductus arteriosus to detour away from the lungs and be dis-
tributed throughout the body. The ductus arteriosus is open 
in all newborns at birth and normally constricts itself within 
the first few days of birth. However, in many extremely 
preterm infants, the ductus arteriosus remains open. The 
persistence of the opening is associated with mortality and 
morbidity and can lead to the development of pulmonary 
arterial hypertension or heart failure, resulting in the death 
of the child [1].
Ductal constriction can be obtained with inhibition of 
prostaglandin synthesis, through inhibition of the cyclooxy-
genase (COX) enzymes. The two most frequently used COX 
inhibitors for the closure of a hemodynamically significant 
PDA are indomethacin and ibuprofen. However, these treat-
ments may cause numerous adverse effects such as bleed-
ing, immune disorders, renal impairment, gastrointestinal

Key Summary Points 
In extreme preterm neonates of 23–26 weeks’ gestational 
age, paracetamol was mainly metabolised into sulfate 
(89%) then glucuronide (6%), and the oxidative meta-
bolic pathway was reduced (4%).
The glucuronidation pathway increased with gestational 
age, whereas the sulfation pathway decreased and other 
pathways remained stable.
In the range of observed drug exposures, no association 
was found with clinical response or liver biomarkers.
Paracetamol concentrations may fall within the range 
that already guarantee a maximum effect on ductus 
closure.
haemorrhage, necrotising enterocolitis, intestinal perfora-
tion, and, in some cases, pulmonary hypertension [2 , 3]. 
Treatments intended to close the PDA have failed to dem-
onstrate significant long-term clinical benefits [4 ], and pro-
phylactic use of indomethacin or ibuprofen is currently not 
recommended.
Paracetamol could be a safe pharmacological alternative 
to COX inhibitors for early prophylactic treatment of PDA. 
According to a recent meta-analysis, paracetamol appears 
to be as effective as indomethacin and ibuprofen for clo-
sure of PDA and with less renal and gastrointestinal harm-
ful effects [5 ]. However, the number of extremely preterm 
infants included in this meta-analysis was very low. There-
fore, additional research on the efficacy and safety of par -
acetamol for PDA treatment in this population is required.
Paracetamol is metabolised mainly in the liver by glucu-
ronidation and sulfation and then eliminated in the urine. 
A minor metabolic pathway of oxidation catalysed by 
cytochrome P450 (CYP) leads to the formation of a toxic 
metabolite, N-acetyl-p-benzoquinone imine (NAPQI), which 
can rapidly be detoxified by conjugation with glutathione 
stored in the liver. The rapid and subsequent metabolism of 
glutathione produces cysteine and mercapturate conjugates. 
A small amount (less than 5%) is excreted unchanged in the 
urine [6].
To date, no pharmacokinetics of paracetamol for the high-
risk preterm population born at 23–26 weeks’ gestation are 
specifically available.
The objectives of this study were to describe the popu-
lation pharmacokinetics (pop-PK) of intravenous paraceta-
mol and its metabolites in extreme preterm neonates and 
identify factors associated with inter-individual variability. 
Association between drug exposure and clinical response as 
well as liver biomarkers were also investigated.
2  Methods
2.1  Study Participants
The Prophylactic Treatment of the Ductus Arteriosus in 
Preterm Infants by Acetaminophen (TREOCAPA) study 
was approved by the ethics committee of Centre Hospitalier 
La Chartreuse (SI 20.03.09.40128) for France and by the 
regional medical research ethics committee of North Ostro-
bothnia (68/06.00.00/20 19) for Finland. This phase II trial 
was registered in the clinicaltrials.gov database under the 
reference NCT04459117.
Preterm neonates with a gestational age 23–26 weeks 
were included in the first 12 h after birth and received treat-
ment with paracetamol. This study was conducted in two 
countries (France and Finland) and eight neonatal intensive 
care units. Patients with birth defects or congenital anoma-
lies, twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome, suspicion of pulmo-
nary hypoplasia, or clinical instability that can lead to rapid 
death were not included in the study.
This pharmacokinetic study was part of a dose-escalation 
trial with the Bayesian continual reassessment method that 
evaluated the efficacy, safety, and tolerability profile of pro-
phylactic paracetamol to close the ductus [7 ]. In this study, 
patients were assigned to intravenous paracetamol with pre-
defined doses. The first level was 20 mg/kg followed by 7.5 
mg/kg four times daily (QID) for 5 days (total 20 doses). The 
second, third, and fourth predefined level doses stand for 25 
mg/kg followed by 10 mg/kg QID, 30 mg/kg followed by 
12 mg/kg QID, and 35 mg/kg followed by 15 mg/kg QID, 
respectively. Escalation stopped at the second level because 
analysis showed that no efficacy gains would be observed 
with further increases.
2.2  Data Collection and Sampling
Baseline data such as gestational age, birth weight, birth 
length, head circumference, and sex were collected at inclu-
sion, as were data on pregnancy, antenatal care, delivery, and 
care in the delivery room. Bodyweight and body length were 
also collected every day during treatment. Systemic blood 
pressure was measured before the loading dose and 30, 60, 
90, and 120 minutes after each dose.
For the study, a blood sample was collected after the end 
of the loading dose and after dose 10 (ideally between 15 
min and 4 h after the start of infusion) to measure aspar -
tate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase 
(ALT) levels and paracetamol and its metabolites plasma 
1691

levels. A blood sample was also collected after the last dose 
(ideally 6 h after the start of the last infusion) to analyse 
paracetamol and metabolite plasma levels. Opportunistic 
blood samples collected for routine care during treatment 
were also analysed to determine paracetamol and metabolite 
plasma levels.
Echocardiography was performed each day until day 7 
after birth. Echocardiograph were reviewed by two experts 
in paediatric cardiology, in Nantes University Hospital, to 
confirm the primary outcome (ductus arteriosus closure or 
non-closure). If the two experts disagreed, a third expert 
gave his opinion to decide.
2.3  Analytical Method
Paracetamol, acetamidophenyl β- d-glucuronide, paraceta-
mol-sulfate, 3-cysteinylacetaminophen, and paracetamol-
mercapturate plasma concentrations were quantified using a 
validated method on an ACQUITY ultra-performance liquid 
chromatography system coupled with a triple quadrupole 
mass spectrometer (XEVO-TQD) with electrospray ionisa-
tion source (UPLC-MS/MS) (Waters, Milford, USA).
Paracetamol-d3, paracetamol-d3 sulfate, 3-cysteiny -
lacetaminophen-d5, paracetamol-mercapturate-d5, and 
4-acetamidophenyl-β-d-glucuronide-d3 were used as inter -
nal standards (IS).
Sample preparation consisted of a protein precipitation 
and phospholipid removal on column. We mixed 40 µL of 
sample with 100 µL methanol containing the IS and agitated 
for 5 min. The purification was realised through Phree phos-
pholipid removal tubes (Phenomenex, Le Pecq, France) by 
centrifugation at 2500 rpm for 5 min at room temperature. 
The eluates were evaporated to dryness, and reconstituted 
with 100 µL of mobile phase, composed of  H2O (95%) with 
ammonium formate (10 mM) and methanol (5%). Finally, 
we injected 20 µL of each sample into the UPLC-MS/MS 
system. The separation was conducted on an Atlantis T3 
C18 analytical column (100 × 2.1 mm, 3 µm;  Waters®). The 
mobile phase consisted of water with ammonium formate 
(10 mM) and methanol. The analytes were eluted using a lin-
ear gradient for 3.5 min. Detection was operated in positive 
ion mode using multiple reaction monitoring. The follow -
ing transitions were monitored: m /z 151.968 → 109.96 for 
paracetamol, m/z 154.946 → 111.368 for paracetamol-d3, 
m/z 312.946 → 208.014 for paracetamol-mercapturate, m/z 
318.096 → 212.192 for paracetamol-mercapturate-d5, m/z 
231.968 → 152.05 for paracetamol-sulfate, m/z 234,818 → 
110.967 for paracetamol-d3-sulfate, m/z 271.01 → 140.001 
for 3-cysteinylacetaminophen, m /z 276.01 →  142.8 for 
3-cysteinylacetaminophen-d5, m/z 328.096 → 152.03 for 
paracetamol-glucuronide, and m /z 330.968 → 155.056 for 
acetamidophenyl-β-d-glucuronide-d3.
The technique was validated according to US Food and 
Drug Administration and European Medicines Agency 
guidelines in the range of 20–20 000 ng/mL for paraceta-
mol and paracetamol-mercapturate, of 40–40 000 ng/mL 
for 3-cysteinylacetaminophen, and 100–100,000 ng/mL for 
paracetamol-sulfate and acetamidophenyl β-d-glucuronide.
2.4  Pharmacokinetic Modelling
The paracetamol parent-metabolite modelling was achieved 
after converting doses and concentrations to micromoles per 
litre (µmol/L) using paracetamol and metabolite molecu-
lar weights [8 ]. The metabolite distribution volumes are 
not identifiable in parent-metabolite models, so they were 
fixed to the parent volume. Oxidative metabolites were 
considered as the molar sum of paracetamol-cysteine and 
paracetamol-mercapturate.
A population approach was used to analyse the concen -
trations of paracetamol and its metabolites. We tested both 
one- and two-compartment models and analysed data using 
the nonlinear mixed-effect modelling software program 
Monolix version 2021R2 (http:// lixoft. com). Parameters 
were estimated by computing the maximum likelihood 
estimator using the stochastic approximation expectation 
maximisation algorithm combined with a Markov chain 
Monte Carlo procedure. Confidence intervals for popula-
tion pharmacokinetic parameters were estimated using the 
bootstrap method (n = 100). For each bootstrap sample, we 
estimated the population pharmacokinetic parameters, and 
then obtained parameter statistics from the whole bootstrap 
set. We obtained individual pharmacokinetic parameter esti-
mates from a Bayesian estimation.
The between-subject variability was ascribed to an expo-
nential model:
where /u1D703i is the parameter for the i th individual, /u1D703pop is the 
population estimate of the parameter /u1D703 , and /u1D702i is a random 
variable for the i th individual normally distributed with a 
mean of zero and an estimated variance of /u1D7142.
To describe the residual variability, additive, proportional, 
and combined error models were investigated. Data below the 
lower limit of quantification were handled as left-censored data 
by Monolix.
The parent-metabolite model was developed by setting the 
parameters of the previously constructed parent model. Total 
clearance of paracetamol was divided into three metabolic 
pathways (glucuronidation, sulfation, and oxidation) and one 
unchanged elimination pathway.
To estimate the different metabolic pathways, the metabo-
lisation fractions were calculated using the parameters t1, t2, 
and t3 estimated by the parent-metabolite model as follows:
/u1D703i = /u1D703pop × e/u1D702i ,
1692 F . Padavia et al.
The clearance associated with each elimination pathway is 
obtained by multiplying total clearance of paracetamol (CL) 
by the corresponding metabolisation fraction. Thus, the sum 
of the clearances associated with each elimination pathway 
should not exceed the total clearance of paracetamol:
Covariates such as gestational age, weight, height, sex, 
5-min Apgar score, total and conjugated bilirubin level, and 
blood pressure measurements (systolic and diastolic) were 
tested in the model. A power function centred on the median 
was used for continuous covariates:
where /u1D703 is the parameter to estimate, /u1D703pop is the typical 
value of the parameter for a patient with the median covari-
ate value, cov is the value of the covariate, Me (cov) is the 
median value for the covariate, and /u1D6FD/u1D703
cov is the estimated 
influential factor for the continuous covariate. Effects of the 
covariates were tested using a stepwise procedure.
The corrected Bayesian information criterion was 
used to test different hypotheses regarding the structural 
model, residual variability model, and structure of the vari-
ance–covariance matrix for the between-subject variance 
parameters. A covariate was retained in the model if its 
effect was biologically plausible, if it reduced the variability 
of the pharmacokinetic parameters, and if the objective func-
tion value dropped by at least 3.84 (i.e. χ 2 with one degree 
of freedom, p < 0.05).
2.5  Evaluation and Validation
The quality of each model was evaluated by visual inspec-
tion of the observed versus predicted (population and indi-
vidual) concentrations and the normalised prediction distri-
bution error (NPDE) metrics versus population predicted 
concentrations and time scatter plots.

The prediction corrected visual predictive checks 
(pcVPC) plots were also used to evaluate the predictive 
performance of the models. Plasma concentrations of par -
acetamol and its metabolites were simulated by the model, 
and the 95% confidence intervals of the 10th, 50th, and 
90th percentiles of the simulated concentrations were over-
laid to the 10th, 50th, and 90th percentiles of the observed 
concentrations.
2.6  Statistical Analysis and Clinical Outcomes
Statistical analysis was performed using R software ver -
sion 4.2. Categorical data were summarised in numbers and 
percentages, and continuous data were described as median 
(interquartile range [IQR]) and range.
Cumulative areas under the concentration curves (AUCs) 
of paracetamol and its metabolites were computed for each 
patient from the start of treatment to time of AST/ALT 
measurement. Furthermore, AUC over the last 24 h before 
AST/ALT measurement was also computed. Associations 
between drug exposure and both AST and ALT levels were 
investigated to assess liver toxicity.
Clinical success was defined as closure of ductus on 2 
consecutive days or closure at day 7. Associations between 
exposure and clinical success were investigated by analysing 
the mean concentration over the duration of treatment, AUC 
during the first 24 h of treatment, predicted peak concentra-
tion at loading dose, and predicted minimal concentration 
at steady state.
Spearman’s rank correlation was used to evaluate the 
association between drug exposure and liver biomarkers, 
and Wilcoxon’s test was used to evaluate associations with 
clinical success.
3  Results
3.1  Population Characteristics
Between November 2020 and September 2021, a total 
of 31 preterm neonates were enrolled in the study. One 
patient was excluded from analysis because no paraceta-
mol plasma level was available. A total of 30 preterm neo-
nates (17 boys and 13 girls) with a median weight of 800 
g (range 470–920) and a median height of 32.8 cm (range 
28–36.5) were included in this pharmacokinetic study. In 
total, 21 patients received the first dose level and nine 
patients received the second dose level. The character -
istics of patients are summarised in Table  1. A total of 
121 paracetamol and 484 metabolite plasma concentra-
tions were available for pharmacokinetic modelling. The 
median number of samples per patient was 4 (range 2–6).

3.2  Population Pharmacokinetic Modelling
The pharmacokinetics of paracetamol were best described 
by a two-compartment model with first-order elimination. 
Between-subject variability was estimated for both clearance 
and volume of distribution of the peripheral compartment. 
The most significant covariate effect was that of bodyweight 
on clearance, which dropped the objective function by 15.9 
units, and then the effect of birth length on peripheral vol-
ume of distribution, with an additional decrease of 8.8 
units. Clearance increased significantly with bodyweight, 
and peripheral volume of distribution increased signifi-
cantly with birth length. Bodyweight effect decreased the 
unexplained between-subject variability on clearance from 
0.494 to 0.409, and birth length decreased the unexplained 
between-subject variability on peripheral volume of distri-
bution from 0.515 to 0.325. Residual variabilities were best 
described by a proportional error model. The results are 
summarised in Table 2.
The final parent-metabolite model was a five-compart-
ment model (two compartments from the parent model and 
three compartments for the glucuronide, sulfate, and oxida-
tive metabolites). Paracetamol was mainly metabolised into 
sulfate, then glucuronide, and oxidative metabolites, and a 
small amount was eliminated unchanged. The corresponding 
structural model is shown in supplemental Figure 1. Appar-
ent metabolisation fractions were estimated at 89.45% for 
sulfate, 6.07% for glucuronide, 3.67% for oxidation, and

Pharmacokinetics of Paracetamol and Its Metabolites in Preterm Neonates of 23–26 Weeks
0.81% for unchanged elimination for a typical preterm neo-
nate of 25 weeks. The proportion of these different meta-
bolic pathways varied according to gestational age. The 
apparent metabolisation fractions varied between 87.8 and 
91.9% for sulfation, between 3.51 and 7.8% for glucuroni-
dation, between 3.61 and 3.78% for oxidation, and between 
0.79 and 0.83% for unchanged elimination. The metaboli -
sation fraction according to gestational age is presented in 
Fig. 1. Table 2 summarises the specific elimination clear -
ances for each compound. After inclusion of gestational age 
in the model, no other covariate was significant on elimina-
tion pathways.
Between-subject variability was estimated on the clear -
ances associated with the different elimination, unchanged, 
and metabolic, pathways. A significant effect of gesta-
tional age was observed on the clearance of each metabolic 
and unchanged paracetamol elimination pathways. With 
increasing age, the glucuronide pathway increased and the 
sulfate pathway decreased. An additional effect of gesta-
tional age was observed on elimination clearance of sulfate 
metabolite.
Final population pharmacokinetic estimates for both 
parent and parent-metabolite models are summarised in 
Table 2. The parameters are well estimated given their low 
relative standard errors. Individual pharmacokinetic expo -
sure parameters were provided in Table S1 in the supple-
mentary material.
3.3  Model Evaluation
Diagnostic plots for paracetamol and metabolites are shown 
in Figures S2 and S3 in the supplementary material. The 
population and individual predictions match the observed 
concentrations, and the NPDE metrics are evenly distributed 
around zero.

The pcVPC plots show that the average prediction 
matches the observed concentration time-courses, and the 
variability is within the expected range for paracetamol and 
its metabolites. The 10th, 50th, and 90th percentiles of the 
observed data are well within the 90% confidence intervals 
of the 10th, 50th, and 90th simulated percentiles (Figure S4 
in the supplementary material).
3.4  Clinical Outcomes
Median AST and ALT levels were 28.5 IU/L (IQR 
18.8–36.4) and 7.0 IU/L (IQR 5.0–9.0), respectively. No 
significant correlation was found with paracetamol’s cumu-
lative AUC or with the paracetamol AUC during the last 24 
h (Fig.  2). The oxidative metabolite’s exposition was also 
compared with the liver biomarker levels, and no signifi-
cant correlation was found (Figure S5 in the supplementary 
material).
Clinical response regarding ductus closure was available 
for 28 patients. One patient was excluded from analysis 
because they met the exclusion criteria, and one patient 
stopped the treatment earlier for suspicion of safety con-
cerns. Treatment was considered successful for 14 patients 
(50%). The median number of days before ductus closure 
was 1.5 (IQR 1–3; range 1–7) days. No significant associa-
tion was found between clinical success and the paraceta -
mol exposure parameters considered (mean concentration 
over the duration of treatment and AUC over the first 24 h 
of treatment, predicted peak concentration after the load-
ing dose, minimum predicted concentration at steady state). 
Boxplots are shown in Fig. 3.
4  Discussion
This is the first study to model the population pharmacoki-
netics of paracetamol and its metabolites in a population 
of extremely preterm neonates with a gestational age of 
23–26 weeks. A two-compartment model best described 
the pharmacokinetics of paracetamol. The total clearance

Pharmacokinetics of Paracetamol and Its Metabolites in Preterm Neonates of 23–26 Weeks
of paracetamol was estimated at 0.08 L/h with a signifi-
cant effect of weight on this parameter. These results are 
comparable to those published in the literature. Currently, 
there are four studies with pharmacological data including 
extremely preterm infants [9–12]. By extrapolating the esti-
mated clearances of these studies to a typical patient in our 
population (25 weeks of gestation and weight of 800 g), 
these ranged from 0.09 to 0.17 L/h on average. However, 
fewer than five patients under 26 weeks of gestation were 
included in these studies. The effect of weight on total clear-
ance was also found in these publications [9 , 11, 12]. After 
inclusion of bodyweight and height in the model, the unex-
plained inter-individual variability in this extremely preterm 
population remained high. Other covariates of interest could 
have been valuable, such as both fluid volume inputs and 
outputs, which could affect the volume of distribution of 
paracetamol.

comparison

Our results indicate that the main metabolic pathway of 
paracetamol in this population is sulfation, which is consist-
ent with results from previous studies [ 9–11, 13]. A sig -
nificant effect of gestational age was found on the differ -
ent metabolic pathways, and a significant effect of weight 
was also found in another study [ 9]. Cook et al. present 
the weight-dependent evolution of the metabolisation frac-
tions. The glucuronide metabolisation fraction increases 
with weight, whereas the sulfate metabolisation fraction 
decreases. As weight and gestational age are strongly cor -
related, these results are consistent with those found in our 
study. These results suggest a lower maturation process of 
the glucuronidation pathway.
A reversal between those two metabolisation fractions 
would occur by extrapolating to older ages according to our 
modelling. Miller et al [14] reported metabolisation rates of 
paracetamol in glucuronide and sulfate metabolites after oral 
administration of 10 mg/kg. Sulfate excretion of paracetamol 
was highest in neonates (0–2 days) and children (3–9 years), 
whereas glucuronide excretion was highest for children aged 
12 years and adults. Other studies have demonstrated that the 
glucuronide excretion pathway is major in adults [6, 15–17].
The hepatotoxicity of paracetamol is a major concern in 
this population. It is attributed to the production of the highly 
reactive electrophile metabolite NAPQI by the hepatic CYP 
enzymes, specifically CYP2E1. NAPQI is rapidly detoxified 
in the liver by conjugation with glutathione and eliminated 
in the urine as cysteine and mercapturate metabolite con-
jugates. Excess of NAPQI depletes glutathione and causes 
liver damage [6].
In our study, the oxidative metabolic pathway of par -
acetamol seems remarkably reduced in extremely pre-
term neonates. It accounts for less than 4% of paracetamol 
metabolism. This is consistent with results from previous 
studies [9 , 13]. A scoping review of drug metabolism in 
preterm newborns suggested that the CYP2E1 pathway is 
minimal. The degree of maturation of the CYP450 enzymes 
responsible for drug metabolism depends on both postna -
tal and gestational age. The adult level of CYP expression 
is generally reached at 2 years of age [18]. Moreover, glu-
tathione concentrations are higher in preterm neonates at 
birth [19], suggesting rapid conjugation of NAPQI into non-
toxic metabolites. However, the benefit–risk balance should 
always be considered with the aim of avoiding unnecessary 
overexposure to paracetamol in this vulnerable population.
A good tolerance profile for paracetamol within the range 
of exposures was observed in this study. The AST and ALT 
levels measured were within the normal range, and no asso-
ciation was found with the AUCs of paracetamol or its oxi-
dative metabolites. This has also been reported in previous 
publications [10, 11].
No association was observed between predicted exposure 
levels and clinical response defined as success or failure. 
These findings may suggest that paracetamol concentrations 
were within the range that already guarantee a maximum 
effect, so further increasing the doses would not improve 
efficacy. However, more complex pharmacokinetic–pharma-
codynamic modelling that simultaneously models the lon-
gitudinal data from both plasma drug concentrations and 
diameter of the ductus arteriosus may be considered to find 
a significant relationship [20].
5  Conclusion
This study is the first to describe the pharmacokinetics of 
paracetamol and its metabolites in a population of extremely 
preterm neonates with a gestational age of 23–26 weeks. Par-
acetamol total clearance increased with weight, and the vol-
ume of distribution of the peripheral compartment increased 
with birth length. Paracetamol was mainly metabolised in 
sulfate, and the oxidative metabolic pathway was reduced. 
Gestational age influenced the proportion of different meta-
bolic pathways. In the range of observed drug exposures, no 
association was found with clinical response, defined as suc-
cess or failure, or with liver biochemical parameters. These 
findings may suggest that paracetamol concentrations were 
within the range that already guarantee a maximum effect 
on ductus closure.
