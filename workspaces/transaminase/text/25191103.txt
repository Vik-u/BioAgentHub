A short and efficient total synthesis of the alkaloid isosolen-
opsin and its enantiomer has been achieved. The key step
was a ω-transaminase-catalysed regioselective monoamin-
ation of the diketone pentadecane-2,6-dione, which was ob-
tained in a single step through the application of a Grignard
reaction. Initial low conversions in the biotransformation
could be overcome by optimisation of the reaction conditions
employing suitable cosolvents. In the presence of 20 vol.-%

Introduction
Functionalised chiral piperidines are popular key ele-
ments in a vast number of synthetic protocols and are
among the most common skeletal fragments found in na-
tural products.
[1] Due to the wide range of useful pharma-
cological properties, extensive efforts have been devoted to
the (stereoselective) synthesis of such compounds.
[2] In par-
ticular, simple 2,6-disubstituted piperidines constitute an
important class of natural products due to their biological
activity and abundant occurrence in nature. Prominent ex-
amples are the secreted fire ant venom alkaloids from
Solenopsis invitica; selected members of this family were
found to display cytotoxic, insecticidal, hemolytic, antibac-
terial, antifungal and necrotic properties.
[3] Furthermore,
physiological investigationsrevealed that for example, iso-
solenopsin A (1b) selectively inhibits designated neuronal
nitric oxide synthases (nNOS),[4] whereas solenopsin A (2b)
inhibits the regulator protein phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase

were obtained by employing two enantiocomplementaryω-
transaminases originating fromArthrobacter at 30–40 °C; un-
der these conditions, conversions of more than 99% and per-
fect stereocontrol (ee /H1102299%) were achieved. Diastereoselec-
tive chemical reduction (H
2/Pd/C) of the biocatalytic product
gave the target compound. The linear three-step synthesis
provided the natural product isosolenopsin in dia-
stereomerically pure form (ee /H1102299%, dr = 99:1) with an over-

(PI3K); the latter is involved in controlling apoptosis, pro-
liferation and angiogenesis.[5]
These diverse biological activities and the apparent
simple structure of piperidines (Figure 1) have made attract-
ive targets to study and showcase new synthetic methods.
Several racemic and asymmetric total syntheses have been
reported based on chiral pool precursors and catalytic
(asymmetric) transformations, in addition to electrochemi-
cal and auxiliary controlled methods.
[6] Although several
routes are very elegant and involve highly sophisticated key
steps, the long reaction sequences and the use of an orthog-
onal protecting-group strategy has hampered their overall
efficiency. Hence, more capable and environmental begin
methods are still desired.

Recently, we demonstrated that 2,6-diketones3 serve as
useful precursors for the synthesis of the optically pure
2,6-disubstituted piperidine scaffold 8 through enzymatic
reductive amination (Scheme 1).
[7] A ω-transaminase (ω-
TA)[8–10] catalysed regio- and stereoselective monoamin-
ation of3 at the sterically less demanding (ω-1)-keto moiety,
yielding preferentially amino-ketone 4, which underwent
spontaneous ring-closure to give the corresponding Δ1-
piperideines 6 in enantiomerically pure form. Based on this

concept, we now report an extension of this method for the
total synthesis of isosolenopsin [(2 S,6R)-1a] and its
enantiomer (2R,6S)-1a.[11]

Results and Discussion
Various enantiocomplementary ω-TAs were tested for
the transformation of diketone3a into the corresponding
Δ1-piperideines 6a and 7a under designated reaction condi-
tions by employing alanine as amine donor (Scheme 2). The
equilibrium was shifted towards the product side by re-
moval/recycling of the formed pyruvate with an alanine-de-
hydrogenase (AlaDH).
[12] Unfortunately, only low conver-
sions were achieved, probably due to the low solubility of
diketone 3a in pure buffer solution. Subsequently, various
water-miscible organic solvents [acetonitrile, tetra-
hydrofuran (THF), N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF), 1,2-
dimethoxyethane (DME), dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO)] and
immiscible solvents (EtOAc, toluene) were assayed at
10 vol.-%. Although most of the investigatedω-TAs gave
insufficient conversions (less than 5 %), four showed conver-
sions of around 25%, rendering them targets for a more
detailed study. Notably, regioisomer7a was not detected for
any enzyme investigated (see the Supporting Information).

Focussing on the four most promisingω-TAs identified,
originating from Arthrobacter citreus ,[13c] Arthrobacter
sp.[13d] Pseudomonas fluorescens,[13a,13b] and Hyphomonas
neptunium,[9f] the influence of the concentration of water-
miscible (DMF, DME, DMSO) and immiscible (toluene)
solvents at concentrations in the range 5–40 vol.-% was in-
vestigated [for the analytical scale: 25 mm 3a (6 mg/mL);
1.00 mL total volume]. The first two enzymes are (S)-selec-
tive, whereas the latter two are (R)-selective. The conversion
obtained depended on the solvent and on the enzyme em-
ployed (Figure 2); whereas the use of enzymes from P.
fluorescens and H. neptunium led to conversions of 25% at
maximum, the two enantiocomplementary ω-TAs from
Arthrobacter turned out to be superior. For example, the
(S)-selective ω-TA from A. citreus gave conversions up to
60% when DMF was applied. Notably, increasing the con-
centration of DMF led to higher conversions, whereas the
reverse trend was observed for toluene or DME as cosol-
vent. In the case of toluene, this is probably due to the lower
availability of the organic substrate in the aqueous phase.
An analogous observation was made for theω-TA from
(R)-Arthrobacter sp. For this enzyme, piperidine6a was ob-
tained with 60 % conversion by applying 5 vol.-% toluene
and 80% conversion in the presence of 40 vol.-% DMF .
Having identified two suitable enzymes with opposite
stereopreference [ Arthrobacter citreus for the ( S)- and
www.eurjic.org FULL PAPER
Arthrobacter sp. for the (R)-enantiomer] and cosolvents,
further optimisation of temperature and pH was conducted.
The biocatalytic monoamination of 3a was tested at dif-
ferent pH values (ranging from 6.5 to 9.9) at varied DMF
concentrations (20 and 40 vol.-%) (Figure 3). Subsequently,
the conversion was studied as a function of temperature at
varied DMF concentrations (20 and 40 vol.-%; Figure 4).
Thereby, the highest conversion was obtained for the asym-
metric reductive amination of diketone 3a at 20 vol.-%
DMF, pH 6.5, and 30 °C with theω-TA originating from
(R)-Arthrobacter sp., whereas 20 vol.-% DMF (pH 7.0) and
elevated temperatures of 40 °C were best suited for the (S)-
selective ω-TA ofArthrobacter citreus.

ing DMF concentrations: (/H17033) 20 vol.-% DMF, (R)-Arthrobacter

A. citreus,( /H17010) 40 vol.-% DMF,A. citreus. Reagents and conditions:
diketone 3a (25 mm), lyophilisedE. colicells containing the overex-
pressed ω-TA (20 mg), PLP (1 mm), NAD+ (1 mm), ammonium for-
mate (150 mm), d-o r l-alanine (500 mm), AlaDH (12 U), FDH
(11 U), 20–40 vol.-% DMF, KPi buffer (100 mm), 30 °C, 24 h,
700 rpm.
Although conversions above 95% were achieved by em-
ploying the reaction conditions mentioned above,n-heptane
was also investigated due to the similarity in polarity of the
solvent to the starting material3a (Figure 5). For solubility
reasons, the substrate still needed to be predissolved in
DMF (5 vol.-% final conc.). Despite the formation of a bi-
phasic system, the reaction resulted in full conversion
(/H1102299%) at 20 vol.-% n-heptane for the ω-TA from (R)-
Arthrobacter sp. and 85% conversion for the (S)-ω-TA from
Arthrobacter.
The synthetic potential was finally demonstrated in the
total synthesis of both enantiomers of isosolenopsin
[(2S,6R)-1a and (2R,6S)-1a]. Starting with a Grignard reac-
tion, the required diketone3a was obtained in a single step
from commercially available dihydropyrane-2-one9 in 65%
yield (Scheme 3). The subsequent biotransformation was
conducted under the optimised conditions on an increased
scale (36 mg, 0.15 mmol, 25 mm); theω-TA ofArthrobacter
sp. gave access to the (R)-enantiomer, whereas theω-TA of
Arthrobacter citreus gave the (S)-enantiomer of piperidine

6a. Both reactions yielded the corresponding cyclic imine
(R)- and (S)-6a, respectively, in optically pure form (ee /H11022
99 %) at full conversion (/H1102299% in both cases). Notably, the
reaction times were prolonged (48 h) to ensure full conver-
sion and hence simplify the work up procedures. Due to the
instability of imine6a, it was directly subjected to diastereo-
selective reduction using hydrogen with Pd/C as catalyst af-
ter extraction. Under these conditions, the second stereo-
centre was established under perfect substrate control, af-
fording the natural product (2S,6R)-1a and (2S,6R)-1a in

diastereomerically pure form [dr (syn/anti)=9 9 %a sd e -
duced by GC and NMR analysis] in an excellent yield of
94–98 % (over two steps). Thus, starting from pyranone9,
the natural alkaloids (+)-1a and (–)-1a were obtained in
optically pure form in 64% overall yield.

Conclusions
An efficient chemoenzymatic total synthesis of the alk-
aloid isosolenopsin and its enantiomer has been achieved
by using a regioselective monoamination of the correspond-
ing diketone in the key step. Optimisation of the biocata-
lytic reaction conditions through medium engineering al-
lowed initial low conversions to be overcome. Among vari-
ous organic solvents tested,n-heptane and DMF turned out
to be best suited at 30 °C for the (R)-selective ω-TA from
Arthrobacter sp. and at 40 °C for the (S)-selective ω-TA
from Arthrobacter citreus. The final asymmetric reductive
monoamination of diketone3a proceeded with perfect re-
gio- and stereoselectivity at full conversions. This strategy
afforded the natural product in optically pure form with an
overall yield of 64–65% over three steps.
Experimental Section
General: All starting materials were obtained from commercial
suppliers and used as received unless stated otherwise. Petroleum
ether (PE), where used, had a boiling range 63–69 °C. The reactions
were carried out with standard Schlenk techniques under an N
2
atmosphere in oven-dried (120 °C) glassware. Preparative chroma-
tographic separations were performed by column chromatography
on Merck silica gel 60 (0.063–0.200 mm). TLC was carried out with
precoated aluminium sheets (TLC Silica gel 60 F254, Merck) with
detection by staining with cerium molybdenum solution or visualis-

ation by UV . Optical rotation was measured at 20 °C with a Perkin–
Elmer Polarimeter 341. GC–MS spectra were recorded with an
Agilent 7890A GC-system, equipped with an Agilent 5975C
mass-selective detector and a HP-5 MS column
(30 m/H110030.25 mm/H110030.25 μm; hydrogen as carrier gas [flow =
0.55 mL/min]).
1H and 13C NMR spectra were recorded at 20 °C
with a 300 Bruker NMR unit spectrometer; chemical shifts are
given in ppm relative to Me
4Si (1H: Me4Si = 0 ppm) or relative to
the resonance of the solvent (1H: CDCl3 = 7.26 ppm;13C: CDCl3
= 77.0 ppm). Formate dehydrogenase fromCandida boidinii (2.2
Umg–1) [one unit will oxidize 1.0μmol of formate to CO2 per min
at pH 7.6 at 37 °C] was purchased from Codexis (catalogue no.
FDH 002). LyophilisedE. colicells containing overexpressedω-TA
were prepared as previously reported.
[9a,9b,9g] Purified recombinant
l-alanine dehydrogenase was prepared as described in the literature
(15 μL of the crude solution are equal to 12 U).[9b]
Pentadecane-2,6-dione (3b):CuI (340 mg, 1.78 mmol) was added to
a stirred solution of n-C9H19MgBr (1 m in Et 2O, 8.82 mL,
8.82 mmol)] in Et2O (30 mL) and MS 3 Å (50 mg) in one portion.
The mixture was stirred for 30 min at 21 °C and then cooled to
–78 °C. Dihydro-2H-pyran-2-one 9 (1.00 g, 8.92 mmol) was added
dropwise by using a syringe over a period of 15 min. The reaction
mixture was kept at –78 °C, then Grignard reagent (0.5 equiv.,
4.46 mL, 4.46 mmol) was added after 4 h and a further portion of
Grignard reagent (0.5 equiv., 4.46 mL, 4.46 mmol) was added after
8 h. When TLC monitoringrevealed full conversion of the starting
material (10 h), the mixture was treated with aqueous HCl solution
(1 n, 30 mL) and allowed to warm to room temperature. The reac-
tion mixture was extracted with small portions of EtOAc (4/H11003) and
the organic layer was dried with MgSO
4. Subsequent filter flash
chromatography (PE/EtOAc, 90:10) of the concentrated solution
afforded the diketone in 65% yield (1.39 g, 5.79 mmol) as a colour-
less powder. Spectroscopic data are in agreement with those pre-
viously published.

Diastereoselective Reduction; Typical Synthesis of (–)-Isosolenopsin
[(2S,6R)-1a]: A crude solution of the biotransformation containing
the corresponding cyclic imine (S)-6a was treated with palladium
on activated charcoal (10wt.-%). The mixture was stirred vigor-
ously and a stream of hydrogen was bubbled through the solution
for 4 h. After full conversion of the starting material (monitored
by GC and GC–MS analyses), the solution was filtered through a
small plug of Celite 545 and cooled to 0 °C. Etherial HCl solution
was added dropwise (ca. 5 equiv.), the solvent removed, and the
precipitate was collected. If necessary, the product was recrystal-
lised from pure CHCl
3 or purified by filter flash chromatography
(Et2O + 1 vol.-% 2-PrNH2). (+)-Isosolenopsin [(2S,6R)-1a] was ob-
tained as a colourless solid in 98% yield (38.5 mg, 0.15 mmol) over
two steps. Analytical data are in full agreement with those pre-
