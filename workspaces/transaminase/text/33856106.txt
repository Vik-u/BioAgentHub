Abstract: Ak ey aim of biocatalysis is to mimic the ability of
eukaryotic cells to carry out multistep cascades in ac ontrolled
and selective way.A sb iocatalytic cascades get more complex,
reactions become unattainable under typical batch conditions.
Here an umber of continuous flows ystems were used to
overcome batch incompatibility,t hus allowing for successful
biocatalytic cascades.A sp roof-of-principle,r eactive carbonyl
intermediates were generated in situ using alcohol oxidases,
then passed directly to as eries of packed-bed modules
containing different aminating biocatalysts whicha ccordingly
produced ar ange of structurally distinct amines.T he method
was expanded to employ ab atch incompatible sequential
amination cascade via an oxidase/transaminase/imine reduc-
tase sequence,i ntroducing different amine reagents at eachs tep
without cross-reactivity.T he combined approaches allowed for
the biocatalytic synthesis of the natural product 4O-methyl-
norbelladine.
Introduction
Multi-step synthesis in biocatalysis has been made more
efficient through the utilization of enzymatic cascades.N o
longer are reactions limited by intermediate isolation, thus
significantly reducing time and waste.[1,2] Thed esign of
multienzyme systems has provided convenient syntheses of
an umber of high value compounds and are now seen as the
method of choice in implementing biocatalytic reactions.[3,4]
Computer-aided synthesis planning (CASP) is also poised to
revolutionize biocatalytic synthesis planning,a llowing in
silico prediction of novel biocatalytic cascades.[5] Neverthe-
less,w hile biocatalytic cascades are increasingly considered as
the method of choice for more complex syntheses,t here are
still limitations to one-pot systems due to incompatible
enzyme/substrate combinations.
Flow chemistry has seen rapid development in recent
years,w ith the potential to improve about 50%o fc hemical
processes.[6] Small scale flow systems can be translated into
larger scale production with minimal optimization as the
systems can be run for longer to increase productivity,a luxury
not afforded in batch processes which need to be scaled up.[7,8]
Another advantage is that continuous flow systems can be
composed of different modules (different reactor types),
which can enable the combination of ab road range of
chemistries that are incompatible under batch conditions
(Figure 1).[9] Further to this,t he utilization of continuous flow
systems facilitates the integration of several reaction steps
resulting in telescoped synthetic sequences.[10]
Issues that arise with analytical biotransformations not
being translatable to scale or different biocatalytic reaction
types being incompatible,h as led to the emergence of
continuous flow biocatalysis as af avorable option to alleviate
these issues.[11] Operating under ac ontinuous regime allows
for greater control of reaction conditions as well as providing
opportunities for inline analysis and purification, as well as
Figure 1. Advanced compartmentalized continuousf low systemsc an
be used to overcome incompatible enzyme combinations/chemistries
can deliver the lab-based technological advancementn ecessary to fully
realize this transformation.

automation.[12,13] Most flow biocatalysis systems utilize im-
mobilized enzymes,w hich vastly improves reusability and
often increases thermal stability and solvent tolerance.[14–16]
Thec ombination of immobilization and continuous flow
reactors means that enzymes can be compartmentalized and
segregated, allowing access to previously incompatible reac-
tions in sequential reactor modules.H erein, efforts to exploit
the power of biosynthetic cascades with ac ontinuous,c om-
partmentalization approach containing multiple reactor types
and ac ombination of free and immobilized enzyme are
described. Issues of cross reactivity and reaction incompati-
bility in linear enzymatic cascades are addressed whilst also
showing compartmentalized flow systems can be used to
overcome metabolic flux issues associated with in vitro
cascades (Figure 1).[17] Thea im was to adopt am odular
approach using standard laboratory equipment to generate
versatile systems which enable access to ab road range of
chemistries.
Results and Discussion
Ther eaction cascades described here started with the
generation of aldehydes from stable and commercially
available alcohols.A sa ldehydes are versatile yet unstable
intermediates,i tw as thought ac ontinuous flow system that
generated this group in situ at high concentrations could allow
for ar ange of subsequent enzymatic modifications.B iocata-
lytic oxidations are fundamental in transitioning to ab io-
based economy,i np articular the use of oxidases which carry
out selective oxidation using molecular oxygen as the sole
oxidant.[18,19] To overcome potential limitations of oxygen
concentration, ap reviously described multipoint injection
reactor (MPIR) was employed;i tw as shown to greatly
improve the productivity of oxidase biocatalysts by negating
low aqueous oxygen availability through in situ biocatalytic
generation from hydrogen peroxide (Table 1).[20–22] An engi-
neered choline oxidase (AcCO6)w as initially chosen as an
ideal biocatalyst to test in the MPIR due to its broad substrate
scope and as it has been applied in biocatalytic cascades.[23,24]
Using the MPIR, AcCO6 productivity was vastly improved
for the oxidation of an umber of aromatic and aliphatic
primary alcohols with a5 8f old improvement in space time
yield and 4f old improvement in productivity in the oxidation
of phenylethanol (see the Supporting Information). Theb io-
oxidations were further optimized to ensure no over-oxida-
tion to the corresponding acid was observed, an issue
associated with batch reactions and ap revious flow report
for this enzyme.[14]
Following the successful implementation of the MPIR for
the generation of aldehydes,t he system was expanded by
carrying out subsequent continuous bio-reductive aminations.
Amines are important molecules in synthetic chemistry,w ith
as ignificant proportion of the reactions performed by
medicinal chemists reported to be associated with amino-
group chemistry.[25] Biocatalytic amine synthesis has been
advanced by transaminases and imine reductases/reductive
aminases (IREDs/RedAms), with the use of aminating
biocatalysts providing selective and sustainable options for
the synthesis of chiral amines.[26,27] One of the most frequently
applied aminating enzymes in flow is transaminase.[28,29]
Therefore,t he transaminase from Bacillus megaterium
(BmTA)w as immobilized and loaded it into ap acked-bed
reactor.[23,30] This was connected to the output of the MPIR
(with inline mixing via am icro static mixer), generating an
MPIR-packed bed system (MPBS). Pleasingly,f ull conver-
sion to the corresponding primary amine 2 was achieved at
steady state and maintained for four hours (STY:
1.58 gL@1 h@1).
Fort he generation of secondary amines such as 3 from
aldehyde 1,R edAm and glucose dehydrogenase (GDH)
combinations can be used and have also been demonstrated in
flow systems previously.[14,31,32] Here,t he reductive aminase
from Ajellomyces dermatitidis (AdRedAm, 200 mg, 10 wt%)
and the GDH from Bacillus megaterium (BsGDH, 10 mg,
10 wt%) were immobilized and both loaded into ap acked
bed reactor. Pleasingly,t his also gave full conversion of the in
situ generated hydrocinnamaldehyde 1 to the corresponding
N-allyl amine 3 at steady state which was maintained for four
hours (STY: 2.1 gL@1 h@1)( Table 1).
Following the optimization of AcCO6-amination cascades
in continuous flow,t he combination of previously batch-
incompatible enzyme systems was investigated. Galactose
oxidase (GOase), ac opper-dependent alcohol oxidase,h as
been shown to be au seful tool in biocatalysis with an umber
of variants displaying ab road substrate scope.[33–35] Using
GOase instead of choline oxidase would lead to ap anel of
benzylic amines as shown in Scheme 1. However, due to the
reactive copper center in GOase,a mines can inhibit the
biocatalyst meaning one-pot batch reactions are not feasible
with aminating enzymes.I ndeed, when the cascades were
carried out in batch, performance as expected was poor,w ith
no observable conversion to the corresponding amines (see
Supporting Information).

To overcome these issues the use of compartmentalized
MPBS was investigated. Pleasingly,e xtremely efficient cas-
cades were observed with >95%c onversion achieved in the
reductive amination of five benzaldehydes 4 (generated in
situ by GOase in the MPIR, Scheme 1), using the trans-
aminase from Vibrio fluvialis (VfTA)a nd AdRedAm to
generate the primary 5 and secondary amines 6,r espectively.
Fresh samples of immobilized enzyme preparations were used
for each of the described systems to avoid the need to study
long term stability between experiments.I mportantly,d ue to
immobilization of the enzymes,s everal substrates could be
screened using the same columns.T his approach efficiently
surveyed the activity of VfTA and AdRedAm in the reductive
amination of the benzaldehyes 4a–e (20 mM:f ive or 10 equiv.
amine). At otal system residence time of <38 mins was
enough to obtain >90%c onversion in all instances.A panel
of 10 primary 5a–e/secondary amines 6a–e (10 mM) were
generated merely by changing the flow path and the initial
benzyl alcohol, an approach far less
time consuming than the preparation
of individual batch reactions and en-
zyme preparations.T of urther increase
efficiency and automation, three-way
switching valves (including ar etrofitted
HPLC waste valve) were added to the
system (Scheme 1);t his enabled exqui-
site control of the flow path without the
laborious need of changing lines or
columns.U sing this approach, the sys-
tem could be quickly switched between
“RedAm” and “TA” flow paths with-
out intermittent washing steps,t hus
vastly improving efficiency.T he same
approach was also used for substrate
feeding to the MPIR again greatly
improving the efficiencyo ft he system.
These cascades represent the first dem-
onstration of continuous biocatalyst
substrate screening. This streamlined
flow system has the potential to com-
plement current high throughput bio-
catalytic screening methods in fu-
ture,[36] and ultimately facilitate auto-
mation for biocatalytic cascade discov-
ery in ah ighly efficient manner.
Following the successful implemen-
tation of the oxidase-bioamination cas-
cades,t he wide scope of the system was
demonstrated with in situ amine donor
generation in aT A-RedAm cascade
(Table 2). Combinations of TA and
RedAm/IRED in batch are not com-
patible because both enzymes use
amine substrates with potential for
cross reactivity.H ence,t he in situ
generation of primary amines by TAs
for use in subsequent reductive amina-
tions by RedAm/IRED has yet to be
explored. Fort he initial flow bioami-
nation cascade, BmTA and AdRedAm (with BsGDH) were
immobilized on EziG amber support (200 mg 10 wt%) and
placed in separate packed bed reactors,t op revent the
previously mentioned potential issues for cross amination.
Initially,a solution containing butanal (40 mM), racemic
alanine (400 mM) and PLP (1 mM) was passed through the
TA module,a chieving full conversion to butylamine 7 at
steady state with ar esidence time of 12 minutes.T he effluent
of this reaction was mixed via am icrostatic mixer (see
Supporting Information) with another solution containing
cyclohexanone (10 mM), NADP+ (1 mM) and glucose
(50 mM). Initial results with AdRedAm showed about 20%
conversion at steady state,w ith four equivalents of amine 7
necessary (20 mM butylamine 7,a nd 5m Mk etone in RedAm
module). To further improve the productivity of this reaction
am ore suitable RedAm was selected from am etagenomics
panel.[37] TheR edAms were identified using ap reviously
described screen containing 384 different enzymes,w hich
Scheme 1. GOase M3-5 and AdRedAm/VfTA were applied in the MPBS continuous flow system
and used for cascade screening. Steady state conversions determined by GC-FID analysis.

gives ac olourimetric indication of activity using ac oupled
diaphorase system (see supporting information and referen-
ces).[37,38] Fort he generation of N-
butylcylohexlyamine 10,I R-79 was
selected and immobilized on the
EziG amber support (100 mg,
10 wt%), with 85%c onversion to
the secondary amine 10 observed
and maintained for three hours at
steady state (Table 2). This repre-
sented at otal system residence time
of 21 mins (STY: 1.87 gL@1 h@1), and
only required two equivalents of
butylamine 7 (20 mM butylamine
and 10 mM ketone in RedAm mod-
ule). This approach was expanded
to generate N-(2-phenyl)ethyl cy-
clohexylamine 11 using another
metagenomic RedAm (IR-23),
again only requiring two equiva-
lents of amine with as ystem resi-
dence time of 24 mins (STY:
2.53 gL@1 h@1). At hird approach
was then used to generate N-ben-
zylcyclohexylamine 12 with the
transaminase from Pseudomonas
putida (PpTA)[39] mediated trans-
amination of benzaldehyde followed by reductive amination
with cyclohexanone using IR-79. Pleasingly 95%c onversion
to 12 was achieved and maintained for four hours with
as ystem residence time of 24 mins (STY: 2.24 gL@1 h@1).
Again, the implementation of several switching valves
allowed rapid change of flow path and enabled the generation
of three RedAm products (10, 11, 12)w ithout isolation or
purification of any intermediates.
De novo designed biocatalytic cascades are often limited
to 2–4 steps due to incompatibility issues as discussed above,
which become more limiting as the number of steps increases.
After demonstrating that MPBS could over-come these
issues,ac ompartmentalized six-enzyme cascade was targeted,
highlighting that multiple reactor technologies can be com-
bined to enable previously inaccessible reaction sequences.A
synthetic sequence that was able to convert primary alcohols
into amines via an oxidase-TAs equence,w hich could then be
used as the amine substrate for aR edAm reaction was
envisaged (Table 3). Using the compartmentalized MPBS,
AcCO6 efficiently oxidized phenylethanol (120 mM). The
resulting aldehyde 14 was mixed with racemic alanine
(400 mM) and PLP (1 mM) via am icrostatic mixer, which
then passed through immobilized BmTA forming 2-phenyl-
ethylamine 8.T he effluent from this reaction was mixed with
aR edAm line (glucose (50 mM), NADP+ (1 mM), cyclo-
hexanone (10 mM)) and passed through immobilized IR-79
to quantitatively generate 11 under continuous conditions.
Pleasingly,a mine donors were generated in two biocatalytic
steps from the alcohols,w hich then fed directly into the
RedAm reactors that successfully utilized the in situ gener-
ated amine substrates.A ll three examples reached steady
state conversions of >90%.

17 via an Oxidase-RedAm cascade was designed
(Scheme 2).[5] 4O-Methylnorbelladine is an important pre-
cursor in the synthesis of an umber of pharmacologically
active alkaloid scaffolds,s uch as the dementia drug galant-
amine.[40,41] Fort his cascade,i tw as thought tyramine 16 could
be generated via ac ontinuous oxidase-TAc ascade.C holine
oxidase activity was tested against tyrinol in the MPIR. The
resulting biogenic aldehyde is ak ey intermediate in the
biosynthesis of benzylisoquinoline alkaloids and often re-
quires multistep syntheses.[42,43] Despite the biooxidation
proving highly efficient (120 mM substrate loading; >90%
conversion;S TY: 8.37 gL@1 h@1;p roductivity:
5.1 gproduct genzyme
@1)t yramine was commercially available at
al ower cost than the alcohol so this step was not necessary.
Fort he reductive amination of isovanillin and tyramine
16,t he previously described high throughput colorimetric
assay was used to identify potential RedAms.[38] From this
screen IR-80 was selected and the reaction validated with an
analytical scale biotransformation. Thep roduct 17 was found
to be insoluble in aqueous buffer and proved difficult to
analyze by HPLC.A sa na lternative,t he crude biotransfor-
mation was filtered, and the residue suspended in DMSO/
MeOH for MALDI analysis with an observed m/z of 274.2
corresponding to the protonated adduct of the product 17 (see
Supporting Information). Encouraged by this result, IR-80
was immobilized on EziG amber (150 mg, 10 wt%) for
translation into continuous flow (Scheme 2). To implement
ac ascade for this synthesis,a GOase M3-5 (5 mgmL@1)
mediated biooxidation of isovanilyl alcohol 15 (30 mM) was
carried out in the MPIR. Thee ffluent was mixed with the
RedAm feed (tyramine 16 (50 mM), NADP+ (0.1 mM) and
glucose (50 mM)) which was flowed through an IR-80 module
to quantitatively generate 17 for four hours with as ystem
residence time of 36 min (STY: 2.26 gL@1 h@1). Filtration of
the effluent allowed recovery of the excess tyramine and
provided as imple purification method for the isolation of 17.
Conclusion
Fort he first time it has been shown that previously
incompatible enzyme cascades can be run continuously,
greatly improving the metrics (up to 58-fold for STY and 4-
fold for enzyme productivity) when compared to the equiv-
alent batch reactions.T his system is extremely versatile with
several enzyme combinations tested that enabled the gen-
eration of ar ange of amine intermediates.T he reactors were
also extended to demonstrate proof-of-concept, high through-
put reaction screening in continuous flow.A continuous
synthesis of the biologically relevant molecule 4O-methyl-
norbelladine was also successfully demonstrated. Using
ac ontinuous approach allows many additional benefits to
those discussed here to further improve biocatalytic reaction
efficiency.I np articular,r ecycling of co-factors is made
operationally more simple with flow systems which signifi-
cantly reduces the economic impact.[29,44] Furthermore,c om-
bination with automated high throughput biocatalyst screen-
ing,[36] and computer aided synthesis planning,[5] paves the
way for fully autonomous biocatalytic synthesis.
