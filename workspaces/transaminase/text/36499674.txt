Abstract: Amine transaminases (ATAs) are powerful biocatalysts for the stereoselective synthesis
of chiral amines. However, wild-type ATAs usually show pH optima at slightly alkaline values
and exhibit low catalytic activity under physiological conditions. For efﬁcient asymmetric synthesis
ATAs are commonly used in combination with lactate dehydrogenase (LDH, optimal pH: 7.5) and
glucose dehydrogenase (GDH, optimal pH: 7.75) to shift the equilibrium towards the synthesis of
the target chiral amine and hence their pH optima should ﬁt to each other. Based on a protein
structure alignment, variants of (R)-selective transaminases were rationally designed, produced in
E. coli, puriﬁed and subjected to biochemical characterization. This resulted in the discovery of the
variant E49Q of the ATA from Aspergillus fumigatus, for which the pH optimum was successfully
shifted from pH 8.5 to 7.5 and this variant furthermore had a two times higher speciﬁc activity than
the wild-type protein at pH 7.5. A possible mechanism for this shift of the optimal pH is proposed.
Asymmetric synthesis of ( R)-1-phenylethylamine from acetophenone in combination with LDH
and GDH conﬁrmed that the variant E49Q shows superior performance at pH 7.5 compared to the
wild-type enzyme.

1. Introduction
The chiral amine group occurs as the core structure in numerous natural products
and synthetic pharmaceuticals and chemicals. Enantiopure amines are frequently used
as key chiral building blocks for these bioactive drugs and agrochemicals, and therefore
have attracted particular attention for synthetic chemists [ 1]. Many chemical synthetic
strategies have been developed to access chiral amines, including traditional resolution
processes using chiral acids or asymmetric synthesis using transition metals or organic
small molecule catalysts, but these methods suffer from the use of stoichiometric chiral res-
olution reagents or toxic components [2,3]. On the other hand, various enzymes, including
hydrolases, oxidoreductases and transferases, can be employed to make chiral amines using
environmentally friendly and highly selective methods [4–6]. This includes transaminases,
pyridoxal-5′-phosphate (PLP)-dependent enzymes that catalyze the asymmetric amination
of a ketone to the corresponding amine. These biocatalysts exhibit high enantioselectivity
and broad substrate tolerance and are thus widely applied for the preparation of optically
pure amines [7–10]. The most popular example is the transaminase-catalytic asymmetric
synthesis of the antidiabetic drug (R)-sitagliptin, with >99.95% optical purity developed
by researchers from Merck & Co. Inc. (Rahway, NJ, USA) and Codexis, Inc. (Redwood

City, CA, USA), which replaced the previously developed asymmetric chemical hydrogena-
tion [11]. Based on their enantiopreference, transaminases are classiﬁed into two types, (S)-
and (R)-selective enzymes, which belong to the fold types I and IV , respectively, and they
differ substantially in their protein structure [7–10].
Transaminases usually show highest speciﬁc activity under slightly basic conditions,
as reported by us for seven (R)-selective transaminases [12–14]. For efﬁcient asymmetric
synthesis, the equilibrium must be shifted towards product synthesis and commonly lactate
dehydrogenase (LDH, optimal pH: 7.5) and glucose dehydrogenase (GDH, optimal pH:
7.75) are used together with the TA to convert the pyruvate formed from the amine donor (D-
or L-Ala) into lactic acid [15]. Furthermore, transaminases are also used in enzyme cascade
reactions, for instance in combination with enoate reductases [16] or ketoreductases [17,18],
to make chiral products. This prompted us to use methods of protein engineering to shift
the pH optimum of TAs towards neutral pH values.
Protein engineering is powerful in improving various enzymatic catalytic features
such as substrate promiscuity, catalytic activity and selectivity, enzymatic stability and pH
optimum [19–21]. Generally, the most universal and effective method of modifying pH
optimum is to change the electrostatic environment of the active site by protein engineering
to alter the pKa values of amino acid side chains in the protein [22–37]. So far, a series of
enzymes such as serine proteases [22–24], xylanases [25–28], phytases [29,30], DNase I [31],
phospholipase [32] or an aspartase [ 33], have been successfully engineered for optimal
pH values through modifying their surface charge or mutating crucial residues adjacent
to their active site. Most of these enzymes have a Ser or Glu residue in the active site
and follow a general acid-base catalytic mechanism. However, the mechanisms of PLP-
dependent enzymes are quite different, and few reports have exploited alteration of their
pH optima [38].
For transaminases, the Kagamiyama group [39–42] has explored the catalytic mech-
anism of an aspartate aminotransferase and found that the imine-pyridine torsion of the
Schiff base intermediate, other than electrostatic interaction, is crucial for the low pKa value
of the aldimine group of the PLP-cofactor, which results in the amino-transfer reaction
under neutral or slightly alkaline condition but without a focus on pH optimum. As far as
we know, the only literature report is from the Berglund group [43], who found that the
(S)-selective wild-type Chromobacterium violaceum ATA has an optimum pH at 8.3, but its
Trp60Cys variant showed an optimum at pH 7.0. They offered the possible explanation
that the introduced cysteine residue participates in the reaction and affects the binding of
the cofactor to the enzyme.
In contrast, although many reports have been published about the improvement of
catalytic activity, substrate scope and selectivity of (R)-selective transaminase by protein
engineering [44], pH optimum adjustments remained unexplored. We have thus aimed
to alter the pH optimum of ( R)-TAs using rational protein design for the creation of
biocatalysts active around neutral pH-values.
2. Results and Discussion
In our previous study we have found several (R)-selective transaminases and inves-
tigated their pH-activity proﬁles [12,13]. Interestingly, three of these highly homologous
transaminases (ATA-Afu from Aspergillus fumigatus, ATA-Gze from Gibberella zeae and
ATA-Ate fromAspergillus terreus) showed different pH proﬁles. ATA-Afu possessed an op-
timum at pH 8.5 while ATA-Gze or ATA-Ate showed an optimum at pH 7.5. We compared
the 3D structures of ATA-Afu (PDB: 4CHI), ATA-Gze (homology modeling byYASARA
17.1.28 [45]) and ATA-Ate (PDB: 4CE5), but all the residues in the catalytic cavity are con-
served. Therefore, we expanded our search to the entire tunnel area and found surface
residues that differ in their charge, which may affect the surface electrostatic environment
(Figures 1 and 2). As shown in Figure 2, the residues E49, T123 and G127 present in
ATA-Afu have different charges and sizes compared to Q49, K123 and E127 present in
ATA-Gze. An evolutionary conservation analysis [ 46] also indicates that these residues
Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2022, 23, 15347 3 of 11
are not conserved (Figure S6). We thus expected that an exchange of these key residues
may alter the pH optimum of ATA-Afu. According to this hypothesis, we created the
variants encoding for the substitutions E49Q, T123K and G127E of ATA-Afu, Q49E, K123T
and E127G of ATA-Gze and Q51E, K125T and G129E of ATA-Ate to investigate how these
positions affect the pH optimum in general. All variants were functionally expressed in E.
coli, puriﬁed and subjected to biochemical characterization with a special focus on their
pH optima.
Figure 1. Amino acid sequence alignments of ATA-Afu, ATA-Gze and ATA-Ate. The residues in
the substrates tunnel area are marked with triangles. Among them, E49, T123 and G127 present
in ATA-Afu (red colored triangles) have differently charged side chains compared to the other two
ATAs. The red box and white character mean that the residues are identical. The yellow box and
black character mean that the residues are similar in size and charge. The ﬁgure was created using
the online alignment tools Cobalt [47] and ESPript 3.0 [48].

Figure 2. Targeted residues in the substrates tunnel area of ATA-Afu and ATA-Gze. The proteins
ATA-Afu and ATA-Gze are shown as cyan and white cartoons, respectively. The oxygen and nitrogen
atoms of different residues are colored red and blue. The carbon atoms of the cofactor PLP are colored
purple. The substrate tunnel is colored light purple. The ﬁgure was created using PyMOL 2.3.0 [49].
Activity tests were performed using Davies buffer [50] at pH values ranging from 6.0
to 9.5 using the photometric acetophenone assay in the transaminase-catalyzed reaction
between (R)-1-phenylethylamine and pyruvate [51].
As shown in Figure 3A, wild-type ATA-Afu exhibited its maximum activity at pH 8.5.
To our delight, replacing the acidic residue E49 with the neutral residue Q lowered the
pH optimum by 1.0 unit to pH 7.5. Moreover, the speciﬁc activity of the ATA-Afu-E49Q
variant was two times higher than for the wild-type at pH 7.5. When the neutral residue
T123 of this enzyme was replaced by the basic residue K, no change in the optimal pH was
observed, but the speciﬁc activity was 1.5-fold higher at pH 7.5. On the contrary, variant
G127E showed a ﬂat pH proﬁle and the speciﬁc activity is lower than for the other variants.
A combination of the substitutions E49Q and T123K resulted in a pH optimum of 7.5, but
its speciﬁc activity was slightly lower than that determined for the variant E49Q.
Both wild-type ATA-Gze and ATA-Ate exhibit their maximum activity at pH 7.5
(Figure 3B,C). When their neutral residues Q49 or Q51 were replaced by the acidic residue
E, the pH optima were shifted to 8.0 or 8.5, respectively, and pH-activity proﬁles were
similar to wild-type ATA-Afu. Substitution of residue K123/125 in ATA-Gze/ATA-Ate to
threonine did not show a shift of their pH optima, but ATA-Gze-K123T displayed slightly
increased speciﬁc activity at the optimal pH, consistent with the experimental results found
for ATA-Afu (variant E49Q and E49Q/T123K). The substitutions E127G in ATA-Gze and
G129E in ATA-Ate also showed the same pH optima but lower speciﬁc activities. The
double variant ATA-Ate-Q51E/K125T showed a rather ﬂat pH proﬁle and its maximum
value appeared at 8.5; its activity was slightly higher than found for variant ATA-Ate-Q51E.
In summary, the trend of the pH-optima shifting observed for ATA-Gze or the ATA-Ate
variants was consistent with the results found for the ATA-Afu variants.
To study the origins of the shifted pH optima we performed molecular docking of the
substrate (R)-1-phenylethylamine (R-PEA) into the catalytic cavity of ATA-Afu (Figure 4).
To initiate the ﬁrst half reaction of the catalytic cycle, the substrate’s amino group must be
deprotonated so that it can act as nucleophile and attack the cofactor PLP (in its internal
aldimine form). We speculated that the amino acid substitutions affect the enzyme’s ability:
(i) to bind the substrate (R)-PEA in its deprotonated form; or (ii) to deprotonate (R)-PEA so
that the catalytic cycle can be initiated. Interestingly, residue E49 is rather far away from
either the amino group of the substrate (11 Å) or the PLP cofactor (14 Å). This long distance
Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2022, 23, 15347 5 of 11
means either further residues in the vicinity or water molecules have to mediate the effect
of the E49 substitution onto the cofactor/(R)-PEA interaction. As shown in Figure 4, H53,
which is located between E49 and the amino group of the substrate, probably acts as a base
and deprotonates the incoming (R)-PEA, and the pKa of H53′s imidazole side chain might
increase by the interaction between E49 and H53. Furthermore, the variants ATA-Afu-H53L
and H53F were constructed, puriﬁed, and their activities measured in Davies buffers (pH
range from 6.0 to 9.5). Both variants lost virtually all activity (Figure 3D). Considering
the similar sterical hindrance but different electronic properties between residues H and
L/F, we prefer to attribute the reduced activity to the role of H53 as a base, although we
cannot exclude that this is due to a less accessible active site or non-competent binding of
the substrate. Moreover, the double variant ATA-Afu-H53L/E49Q also exhibited extremely
low speciﬁc activity. For ATA-Gze and ATA-Ate, variants H53L and H55L, respectively,
showed similar pH proﬁles as ATA-Afu-H53L/E49Q (Figure S2, Supplementary Materials).
Due to the low activities observed for the above three variants, their pH proﬁles are difﬁcult
to interpret.
Figure 3. pH activity proﬁles of wild-type and variants of ATA-Afu (A,D), ATA-Gze (B) and ATA-Ate
(C). The pH optimum was determined by assessing the speciﬁc activities using the acetophenone
assay at different pH conditions. Data points correspond to the mean values of three independent
experiments. The error bars are shown in the ﬁgure and the detailed data for speciﬁc activity
measurements are given in Table S2. The kinetic parameters are shown in Table S3 and Figure S1.
To further study the function of residue H55, we used the program PropKa 3.3 [52],
which calculated a predicted pKa value of 7.83 for the H53 side chain of wild-type ATA-Afu.
When substituting the neighboring E49 residue by a glutamine (E49Q), PropKa predicted
a signiﬁcantly lowered p Ka value of 6.44 for the H53 imidazole group. According to
this analysis, we propose the following hypothesis (Figure 5): (1) the E49Q substitution
destabilizes the positively charged form of the imidazole group of H53. As this residue
is partially exposed to water molecules and via the substrate entrance tunnel in contact
with the bulk solvent, pH changes of the reaction medium will affect its protonation state
in the following way: In the wild-type ATA-Afu, H53′s imidazole group is mainly in its
protonated form if the pH value is below 7.83. This explains the lower activity at pH 7.5
than at 8.5.

cyan. The tunnel is colored light purple. The oxygen and nitrogen atoms of residues and substrates

are represented by yellow dashed lines. The ﬁgure was created using PyMOL [49]. The position of
the water molecule was assumed from the crystal structure of ATA-Afu (PDB: 4CHI). The superposed
structure of the substrate is shown in Figure S5.

and E49 mediate the deprotonation of the substrate’s amino group. (B) The pKa value of the imidazole
group of residue H53 is lowered by the E49Q substitution. (C) Internal aldimine of the PLP-cofactor.
The negative charge is presumably stabilized by the neighboring residue Y58.
As the predicted p Ka of residue H53 in ATA-Afu-E49Q is 6.44 it is mainly (>90%)
deprotonated at pH 7.5, corresponding to the lower pH optimum compared to the wild type
and a higher activity at pH 7.5; (2) The cofactor PLP forms a Schiff base with the ε-amino
group of residue K179—the so-called internal aldimine. This internal aldimine exhibits a
pKa value of 9.0 for ATA-Afu-E49Q, similar to the reported pKa value (8.8) for the internal
aldimine of an aspartate aminotransferase [ 42]. When the iminium ion is deprotonated
under basic conditions, the resulting imine group shows a weaker electrophilicity, which
corresponds to a lower catalytic activity. This is in line with the rapid decrease in catalytic
activity at more basic conditions. It is worth noting that the pH proﬁle of transaminases is
inﬂuenced by all dissociable groups in the enzyme, and the mechanism of transaminase-
catalysis is also very complex [53]. Although it is hard to provide a clear explanation for
the shift of the pH optima, the pKa value of E49 indeed shows a positive inﬂuence on the
Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2022, 23, 15347 7 of 11
pH proﬁle and the above proposed mechanism provides a reasonable explanation for the
experimental results.
To demonstrate the synthetic applicability of the optimized variant ATA-Afu-E49Q
we performed the asymmetric synthesis of (R)-PEA at pH 7.5 and 8.5 using the wild type
transaminase as a control (Figure 6). To shift the equilibrium, the pyruvate removal system
comprising LDH and GDH [14] was applied and the reaction progress was monitored by
HPLC (Table S4). As already observed in the acetophenone assay experiments, the E49Q
variant exhibited two times higher reaction rates compared to the wild-type at pH 7.5 and
nearly 1.5-fold higher rates than the wild-type at pH 8.5. As reported in literature [54], the
pH optima of LDH and GDH are 7.5 and 7.75, respectively, in line with the pH optimum of
the newly designed ATA-Afu-E49Q variant, which explains its superior performance at
pH 7.5.

synthesis: 10 mL ﬁnal volume, 50 mM phosphate buffer at pH 7.5 or 8.5, 0.1 mM PLP , 5 mM ketone,

DMSO 5%, 5 mg puriﬁed enzyme, 30 ◦C under stirring.
3. Materials and Methods
3.1. Site-Directed Mutagenesis
All variants were prepared using the Q5® site-directed mutagenesis kit from New Eng-
land BioLabs. Degenerate primers were designed non-overlapping by using the standard
setting of the NEBaseChanger. For the PCR, 0.25 ng µL−1 template plasmid (carrying the
ATA-Afu, ATA-Gze, and ATA-Ate gene), 0.5µM forward and reverse primers (Table S1),
Q5® hot start high-ﬁdelity 2×master mix were used. The PCR was performed as follows:
(i) 98 ◦C, 30 s; (ii) 30 cycles: 98 ◦C, 10 s; 50–72 ◦C, 30 s; 72 ◦C, 0.5 min/kbp; (iii) 72 ◦C, 2
min. The resulting PCR product was directly treated with the kinase, ligase and DpnI (KLD
enzyme mix) (100 µL mL−1; NEB) at room temperature for 30 min and then used for the
transformation of chemically competent E. coli TOP10 cells. After conﬁrming the intro-
duced mutation by single colonies sequence detection, the aimed plasmids were used in
the transformation of chemical competent E. coli BL21(DE3) cells by the heat shock method.

3.2. Gene Expression and Puriﬁcation of the Enzyme Variants
For the protein biosynthesis of the ATA-Afu, ATA-Gze, and ATA-Ate and variants,
transformed E. coli BL21(DE3) cells were incubated overnight at 37◦C in a 5 mL LB-medium
(Lysogeny Broth) preculture with ampicillin (100 µg mL−1). An amount of 1 mL of the
preculture was used for the inoculation of 100 mL TB-medium (supplemented with the
corresponding antibiotic) and incubated at 37 ◦C, 180 rpm. The expression of the ATA-Afu,
ATA-Gze, and ATA-Ate variants was induced at an optical density of approx. 0.6 (measured
at 600 nm) with 0.2% L-rhamnose and incubated at 20 ◦C for 20 h. The cells were harvested
by centrifugation (20 min, 4000×g, 4 ◦C).
For puriﬁcation, the harvested cells were resuspended in 50 mM HEPES buffer pH 7.5
containing 0.1 mM PLP , 0.3 M NaCl, 0.01 M imidazole and lysed via ultrasound (50% pulse,
50% power, 2 ×5 min; Sonoplus HD2070, Bandelin Electronic GmbH, Berlin, Germany).
The lysate was clariﬁed by centrifugation (0.5 h, 10,000×g, 4 ◦C) and puriﬁed by immobi-
lized metal afﬁnity chromatography with the following buffers: washing buffer (50 mM
HEPES buffer pH 7.5 containing 0.1 mM PLP , 0.3 M NaCl, 0.02 M imidazole), elution buffer
(50 mM HEPES buffer pH 7.5 containing 0.1 mM PLP , 0.3 M NaCl, 0.3 M imidazole). The
proteins were desalted in 50 mM HEPES buffer pH 7.5, 0.1 mM PLP using PD-10 desalting
columns (GE Healthcare). The puriﬁed and desalted proteins were stored at −20 ◦C in 30%
glycerol.
3.3. Determination of Activity of Transaminases
The activities of the puriﬁed transaminase variants were studied using the conversion
of (R)-1-phenylethylamine resulting in the formation of acetophenone [ 51], which was
quantiﬁed photometrically at 245 nm over time using the Inﬁnite ® 200 PRO (TECAN)
plate reader in UV-transparent microtiter plates (UV-Star, Greiner Bio-One GmbH, Berlin,
Germany). The assay was performed with 2.5 mM (R)-1-phenylethylamine as amine donor
and 2.5 mM pyruvate as amine acceptor in 1.25–2.5% DMSO, 50 mM Davies buffer pH
6.5–9.5 at 30 ◦C. One unit (U) activity was deﬁned as the formation of 1 µmol acetophenone
per minute. All measurements were performed in triplicates.
3.4. Docking Experiments
The geometrical optimizations of substrates were carried out with theChemBio3D Ultra
13.0 suite program using the MM2 basis set. Dockings were performed with the AutoDock
4.2.6 suite [55]. All the water molecules were deleted in the docking simulation, and the
grid box was centered on the carbon atom of the internal aldimine of the cofactor PLP . Other
parameters were kept at the default settings. The resulting ligand and original protein
data ﬁles were used to generate Figure 4 using the PyMOL 2.3.0 program [49] (Table S5).
The water molecule shown in Figure 4 comes from the crystal structure of ATA-Afu (PDB:
4CHI).
3.5. pKa Prediction and Evaluation
The pKa values of the residue H53 of ATA-Afu or its E49Q variant were predicted
by the program PropKa 3.3 (developed by the Jensen group) [52]. PropKa 3.3 predicts the
pKa values of ionizable groups in proteins based on their 3D structure. The 3D structure
of ATA-Afu was downloaded from the PDB database (PDB code: 4CHI) and was used
as a structure template to predict the 3D homology models of its E49Q variant, using the
program YASARA based on its homology model generation algorithm [45]. The pdb ﬁle
served as input for PropKa 3.3 and the predicted pKa values of all the ionizable residues
were calculated automatically.
The pKa value of the internal aldimine group of the cofactor of ATA-Afu-E49Q was
measured using a literature method [ 42]. The absorption spectra of ATA-Afu-E49Q at
pH 6.5–9.5 were determined using the Inﬁnite ® 200 PRO (TECAN) plate reader in UV-
transparent microtiter plates (UV-Star, Greiner Bio-One GmbH). These pH-dependent
spectral changes have been known to reﬂect the ionization state of the imine nitrogen of
Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2022, 23, 15347 9 of 11
the internal aldimine bond formed between K179 and PLP , and the protonated form of the
internal aldimine of ATA-Afu-E49Q is thought to have an absorption band around 410 nm,
which was titratable and resulted in a pKa value of 9.0 (Figure S3, Supplementary Materials).
3.6. Asymmetric Synthesis of (R)-1-Phenylethylamine
Asymmetric synthesis of (R)-PEA using puriﬁed ATA-Afu or its E49Q variant was
done at pH 7.5 or 8.5, respectively. HPLC calibration curves are shown in Figure S4. To a
reaction vial (20 mL) with a screwcap, the following components were added to give a ﬁnal
volume of 10 mL: sodium phosphate buffer (50 mM, pH 7.5 or 8.5) including PLP (0.1 mM);
rac-alanine (100 mM); oxidized nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+, 1 mM); glucose
dehydrogenase (1 U mL−1); D-glucose (50 mM) and lactate dehydrogenase (3 U mL −1);
0.050 mL stock solution of acetophenone (100 mM in DMSO); puriﬁed protein (5 mg). The
reaction vials were incubated at 30 ◦C, 200 rpm for 48 h. To monitor the progression of the
reaction, samples (50 µL) were taken at different time points of the reaction (0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10,
24 and 48 h), and mixed with acetonitrile (100 µL) and hydrochloric acid solution (100 mM,
50 µL) for HPLC analysis of the conversion of (R)-1-phenylethylamine. Concentrations of
(R)-PEA and acetophenone were determined using an HPLC system with a Luna Omega
5 um Polar C18 (150 ×4.6 mm, Phenomenex), ﬂow rate at 1 mL/min, detection at 210
nm, column temperature at 25 ◦C. The gradient elution started with H2O/CH3CN/TFA
90:10:0.1 (by volume) hold 3 min, ramped up to H2O/CH3CN/TFA 50:50:0.1 in 2 min, hold
1 min, then back to H2O/CH3CN/TFA 90:10:0.1 in 1 min, kept constant until the end of
the run. Authentic standards were analyzed before the analysis of the reaction mixtures.
Retention times: 3.87 min for (R)-1-PEA, 6.94 min for acetophenone.
4. Conclusions
In conclusion, we have identiﬁed key residues which affect the pH proﬁles of ( R)-
selective transaminases and demonstrated a shift of pH optima resulting in improved
catalytic activity. The possible mechanism behind the different pH optima found for the
ATA variants was explored and conﬁrmed by activity tests of different variants, together
with computational calculations such as molecular docking and p Ka prediction. This
revealed that the variant ATA-Afu-E49Q exhibited higher reaction rates in the synthesis of
(R)-1-phenylethylamine at pH 7.5.
