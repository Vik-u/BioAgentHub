INTRODUCTION
Biomass, along with CO2, constitutes the only re-
newable source of carbon compounds as an alter-
nativetofossilfuelstoproducechemicalsandfuels
[1,2].Particularlyfrombiomass,hundredsofchem-
ical compounds can be obtained through thermal,
catalytic and fermentative processes. The specific
functional groupsexisting in thesebiomass-derived
chemicals represent an important advantage for in-
troducing heteroatoms such as N, P, S, etc. Par-
ticularly, nitrogen-containing compounds are high-
added-valuechemicalsforthepreparationofdrugs,
agrochemicals, polymers or surfactants in the form
ofamines,amides,nitriles,heterocycliccompounds,
etc. In fact, N-chemicals are present in>80% of
the 200 most important products of the pharma-
ceuticalindustryandtheyareusuallyobtainedfrom
petrochemical platforms. For this reason, in recent
years,therehasbeengreatinterestindevelopingN-
chemicals through efficient and sustainable routes
from renewable raw materials from biomass [3].
Particularly,opticallypureaminesarevaluablecom-
poundsforthepharmaceuticalandagrochemicalin-
dustries [4–13]. However, conventional chemical
methodsusedforthesynthesisofchiralaminessuf-
fer from several limitations such as low selectivity
and high generation of wastes [14]. Thus, during
the last two decades, many efforts have been car-
ried out to develop alternative biocatalytic routes.
Besidesthebiocatalyticapproachesbasedontheki-
neticresolutionofracemicamines(usingforexam-
plelipases)andthedynamickineticresolution(via
in situ racemization of the unreactive enantiomer)
[15–17], diverse types of enzymatic activities have
been explored, such as imine reductases, amine
dehydrogenases, ammonia lyases, monoamine oxi-
dasesandtransaminases[ 18].
An interesting group of ω-transaminases are
the amino transaminases (ATAs) able to transfer
an amino group from a simple amine (donor) to
a prochiral ketone (acceptor) (Scheme1). These
enzymes use the cofactor pyridoxal 5′-phosphate

Thisproperty,combinedwiththeexcellentstere-

thesisofchiralamines[ 23].
Nevertheless, for the large-scale application
of transaminases, several problems typically asso-
ciated with enzymes need to be solved, namely
the limited range of substrates that can be used or
problemsrelatedtoenzymestabilityandreusability.
To overcome these problems, biotechnological
strategies to increase the substrate scope of the
enzyme, such as rational design or gene mining
[24,25], have been developed, while enzyme im-
mobilization over different supports has been the
most-used strategy to increase the stability and the
reusability of these biocatalysts [22]. However,
the moderate operational stability of ATAs upon
immobilization has prompted a number of studies
on the immobilization of ω-transaminases on
different supports directed at improving the overall
performanceofthebiocatalyst.Thus,transaminases
have been immobilized over a variety of carriers,
such as organic supports as cellulose or chitosan
via covalent interaction [26], over macrocellular
silica[27],commercialresinsasSepabeadsEC-HA
[13]viahydrophobic,ionicorcovalentinteraction.
Controlled porosity glass, polymer-hybrid versions
(HybCPG) [28] and polydopamine magnetic
nanoparticles [29] chelated with Co+2 and Ni+2,
respectively,havebeenusedtoimmobilizetransam-
inases via electrostatic interactions of metals and
histidine residues. Also, bisepoxide-activated poly-
mericresins[ 30]andlens-shapedpolyvinylalcohol
particles[31]havebeenrecentlyreported.
An important challenge often associated with
ATA catalysed transamination is the unfavorable
thermodynamic equilibrium of the reaction. To
overcome this drawback, different strategies have
beenused[ 32],suchasremovingtheproduct(orco-
product)fromthereactionbyusingdifferentmeth-
ods. However, a promising alternative is the use of
immobilizedATAsinflowsystems.Here,asthecar-
bonylcompoundisconvertedintotheamine,thelat-
terisremovedfromthereactionenvironment,shift-
ing the equilibrium toward amine formation while
enzyme inhibition is avoided. However, the effec-
tiveenzymeimmobilizationisacrucialfactorforsuc-
cessfulbiotransformationsinaflowsystem.
Recently, we have reported that the pure silica
2D ITQ-2 zeolite is an excellent carrier to support
enzymes such as naringinase [33] and alcohol de-
hydrogenases [34] that have been used efficiently,
in both batch and flow mode, in the production of
citrus flavonoids as well in the production of chiral
alcohols from racemic mixtures through a chemo-
enzymatic cascade process respectively. The ITQ-
2 zeolite that can be prepared by a dual-templating
one-step synthesis or by the delamination of a lay-
ered Mobil twenty two (MWW) zeolite precursor
[35–38]isa2Dsystemof2.5-nm-thickthinsheets.
Thus, the ITQ-2 zeolite exhibits high external sur-
face area(∼600m2 g−1)wherethe enzymecan be
immobilized with high stability in aqueous media
and provides a suitable support for enzyme immo-
bilizationthroughelectrostaticorcovalentlinkages.
Considering that a wide variety of prochiral ke-
tones can be obtained from lignocellulosic biomass
through thermal, catalytic or fermentative pro-
cesses, we present in this work an efficient process
to obtain valuable chiral amines from biomass-
sourced prochiral ketones using an immobilized
ω-transaminase(ATA)onthelaminarzeoliteITQ-
2 through electrostatic interactions. Moreover, we
have designed a chemo-enzymatic cascade process
to produce chiral 4-phenyl-2-butanamide deriva-
tives from biomass, such as 4-(4-methoxyphenyl)-
2-butanamine and 4-phenyl-2-butanamine. The
4-(4-methoxyphenyl)-2-butanamine is a valuable
intermediate in the synthesis of drugs such as
Dobutamine,whichiswidelyusedforthetreatment
of heart failure and cardiogenic shock [39], while
4-phenyl-2-butanaminehasbeenrecentlydescribed
asachiralbuildingblockforthesynthesisofamides
thataremodulatorsoflysophosphatidicacidrecep-
tors beneficial for the prevention or treatment of
liver,skinandlungdiseases[ 40].
The chemo-enzymatic route to produce the chi-
ral 4-(4-methoxyphenyl)-2-butanamine involves as
the first step the synthesis of the prochiral 4-
(4-methoxyphenyl)-2-butanone through a one-pot
process performed in the presence of a bifunc-
tional base–metal catalyst formed by Pd nanopar-
ticles supported on MgO. This catalyst is able
to perform the aldol condensation between 4-
methoxybenzaldehyde (or substituted benzaldehy-
des that can be sourced from lignin) [41] and ace-
tone(thatcanbesourcedfromtheacetone-butanol-
ethanol (ABE) sugar fermentation process) [42]
yielding an α,β-unsaturated ketone that is selec-
tively reducedin situ into 4-(4-methoxyphenyl)-2-
butanone in the presence of hydrogen [43]. The

RESULTSANDDISCUSSION
Characterizationofthesupportand
immobilizationofATAs
Transaminases have been immobilized over dif-
ferent supports using different strategies; how-
ever, a common methodology is through electro-
static interactions between supports bearing amino
groups and the carboxylic acids of the enzyme
[13]. Therefore, the surface of the zeolite ITQ-2
was functionalized with amino groups, using (3-
aminopropyl)triethoxysilane (3-APS) as described
in the experimental section. The resulting material
labeled as NITQ-2 contained a density of amino
groupsof1.26mmolg −1 asdeterminedbyelemen-
talanalysis(seeSupplementaryTableS1).
Both zeolites (ITQ-2 and NITQ-2) were
characterized using Fourier transform infrared
spectroscopy (FTIR) analysis (Supplementary
Fig.S1)Ascanbeobserved,thestretchingvibration
band associated with silanol groups (Si–OH)
appears in the ITQ-2 sample at 3735 cm–1 (Sup-
plementary Fig. S1a). However, when the surface
of the zeolite ITQ-2 is chemically modified with
(3-aminopropyl)triethoxysilane through covalent
bonding with thesilanol groups(NITQ-2sample),
the intensity of the stretching vibration band of
the later decreases dramatically, while the bands
associated with the amino groups appear at 3422
and 1657 cm–1, along with the bands at 2930 and
2865 cm–1 associated with –CH2 stretching vibra-
tion bonds of the propyl group (Supplementary
Fig.S1b).
The Brunauer–Emmett–Teller surface area of
the zeolite ITQ-2 pure silica was calculated to be
592m2 g−1 and,afterchemicalmodificationwith3-
APS, the Brunauer, Emmett and Teller (BET) sur-
faceareadecreasedby ≤375m2 g−1;nevertheless,it
representsahighsurfaceareasupportwheretheen-
zyme is electrostatically anchored (see Supplemen-
taryTableS2).

taryFig.S3aandb).
PropertiesofimmobilizedATA
First, we optimized the enzyme loading by varying
theamountoftheenzymeonthesupportasshown
in Table 1. The immobilization of the enzyme
(ATA(S)) was performed by incubating different
amounts of enzyme with NITQ-2 in a phosphate
buffersolutionatpH7for24h.Theamountofpro-
tein immobilized was determined by analysing the
amountoffreeenzymeinthesupernatantusingthe
bicinchoninicacidproteintest.Ascanbeobserved,
whentheratiooftheenzyme/support(wt/wt)was
increased(Entries1–4),theamountofimmobilized
enzyme increased from 12.1 (Entry 1) to 40 mg
ATA/gNITQ-2 (Entry 4), while the percentage of
immobilized enzyme was maintained at 69%–80%.

However, when the ratio enzyme/support was
further increased (Entry 5), the immobilization
level was considerably lower (49%) while the
amountofimmobilizedenzymepergramofsupport
slightly decreased (38.0mgATA/gNITQ-2).Then,
an optimized enzyme/support ratio was found
under the conditions presented in Entry 4. The
catalytic activity of the samples with different
loadings was tested taking as a model reaction
the amination 4-(4-methoxyphenyl)-2-butanone
into (S)-4-(4-methoxyphenyl)-2-butanamine.
Reactions were performed at 37◦C using a molar
ratio substrate/cofactor of 15/1. In Supplementary
Fig. S4 the results of the activity for the different
samples are presented, measured as the yield of
amineproducedafter60minofreactiontimeversus
enzyme loading. As can be seen, the activity of the
biocatalyst is directly proportional to the amount
of enzyme present on the surface of the solid.
Therefore, we selected the sample corresponding
to Entry 4 (Table1) labeled as ATA(S)@NITQ-2
with81%ofenzymeimmobilizationforperforming
allthesubsequentstudies.Tocomparetheintrinsic
activity of the free and supported enzyme, the
activity recovery was calculated as the activity of
immobilizedenzyme/activityoffreeenzyme ×100,
being62%.
CatalyticactivityasafunctionofpHand
thermalstability
To study the effect of pH on the transamination
of4-(4-methoxyphenyl)-2-butanone,theactivityof
ATA(S)@NITQ-2 was studied at pH 5, 7 and 9 at
37◦C and compared with that of the free enzyme
(seeSupplementaryFig.S5).Ascanbeobserved,the
freeandsupportedformoftheenzymeshowedthe
maximumactivityatpH = 7,whileacidicpH(5)or
basic pH (9) was detrimental for the enzyme activ-
ity,particularlyacidicmedia.
The thermal stability of ATA(S)@NITQ-2
was determined by exposing the supported en-
zyme to different temperatures: 37, 60 and 80◦C
for 1 h at pH 7. After that, the substrate 4-(4-
methoxyphenyl)-2-butanone and the cofactor
(PLP) was added and the residual catalytic activity
was determined under the conditions described
in the Supplementary data. In Supplementary
Fig.S6,theresidualrelativeactivitiesofthefreeand
immobilized enzyme after the thermal treatment
are presented. As can be seen, at 37◦C, the free
enzymeperformsfasterthantheimmobilizedform,
giving ∼100% activity and 60%, respectively. After
treatment at increasing temperatures, both the
immobilizedandfreeenzymeundergoastrongloss
of activity. In fact, the free enzyme lost its activity
completelyat60 ◦C,whiletheimmobilizedenzyme
retained a residual activity. It has been described
that enzyme immobilization can restrict unfolding
of the enzyme and therefore the thermal stability
could be somewhat improved [44]. However, the
results show that the optimum temperature of the
biocatalytic process should not surpass 37◦Ci n
ordertomaintainhighenzymaticactivity.
Scopeofthetransaminationwith
ATA(S)@NITQ-2
As commented on above, there are a variety of
prochiral ketones than can be obtained from
biomass and they can serve as starting reactants to
produce chiral amines useful in the fine chemical
industry. Therefore, we have selected a variety
of prochiral ketones with phenylethanone and
1-(4-methoxyphenyl)propanone structures that
canbeobtainedfromp-coumarilalcoholderivatives
fromlignin[ 41]andwhichchiralaminesderivatives
(1-phenylethylamine, 1-(4-methoxyphenyl)-2-
propanamine) are important chiral inductors and
building blocks for the synthesis of drugs such as
Brivaracetam, Fenoterol and Formoterol, used as
anticonvulsant, anti-asthmatic and bronchodilator
agents, respectively [45,46]. In addition, several
linear (C7–C9) 2-methylketones that can be ob-
tained through biomass fermentation processes
[47]orbycatalyticcrossketonizationofcarboxylic
acids from biomass [48] can be prochiral sub-
strates for the production of aliphatic amines that
are important intermediates of pharmaceuticals
and other biologically active compounds [ 23].
Moreover, the ketoester methyl levulinate was
also selected as a prochiral precursor. The scope
of the reaction was studied using the enzymatic
derivative ATA(S)@NITQ-2 under the optimal
reaction conditions in batch mode and the results
are presented in Table 2. As can be observed,
excellent yields of the corresponding chiral amines
(80%–98%) could be obtained in short reaction
times, while the enantiomer excess (ee) was 99%
in all cases, showing the outstanding performance
of ATA(S)@NITQ-2 biocatalyst on a variety of
biomass-derivedsubstrates.Whentheenantiocom-
plementaryenzyme(ATA(R)@NITQ-2)(Entry1)
wasusedfortheaminationof4-phenyl-2-butanone,
the yield and enantioselectivity to the (R)-4-
phenylbutan-2-aminewerealsoveryhigh,although
a longer reaction time was required. The amination
of methyl levulinate (Entry 8, Table2) afforded
(S)-5-methylpyrrolidin-2-one after spontaneous
cyclization of the intermediate product (S)-methyl
4-aminopentanoate.

Enzymaticaminationoftheprochiral

The amination of the prochiral ketone 4-(4-
methoxyphenyl)-2-butanone was performed
in a flow reactor system. Initially, the biocata-
lyst ATA(S)@NITQ-2 (208.0 mg) was diluted
with silicon carbide CSi (1.8 g) and packed in
a stainless-steel reactor. The reactor was fed
through a peristaltic pump with a solution 4-(4-
methoxyphenyl)-2-butanone and the cofactor (in
a substrate/cofactor molar ratio of 15) using a
mixture of isopropylamine/phosphate buffer pH 7,
100mM(50/50v/v)as a solventand 10% DMSO
as co-solvent. The temperature was fixed at 37◦C
andthecontacttimewasevaluatedkeepingconstant
the amount of 4-(4-methoxyphenyl)-2-butanone
andincreasingtheflow(0.25–3mLh –1).Aswecan
observe(SupplementaryFig.S7andSupplementary
TableS3),whenincreasingthecontacttimefrom1
to 7 h, the conversion increased from 50% to 71%,
respectively(∼100%selectivitytoamine);afurther
increase in the contact time to 13 h led to 94%
conversion maintaining the selectivity to the opti-
cally pure S-4-(4-methoxyphenyl)2-butanamine at
∼100%. Then, we selected a contact time of 13 h
(that corresponds to a weight hour space velocity
(WHSV)of0.076h −1)tochecktheperformanceof
theenzymaticderivative.AscanbeseeninFig. 1,the
conversion of 4-(4-methoxyphenyl)-2-butan-one
(93%) could be maintained during 160 h of opera-
tion.Infact,thereactorwaskeptunderoperationfor
20 days, maintaining its activity. Similar data were
obtained using the ATA(R)@NITQ-2, obtaining
in this case 4-methoxyphenyl-(R)-2-butanamine

the possible catalyst deactivation, the reaction
was performed using a contact time of 1 h, which
afforded a conversion of∼50% and, as can be seen
in Supplementary Fig. S8, under these reaction
conditions, the biocatalyst activity was maintained
during the period studied. Moreover, the presence
of leached enzyme in the reaction crude (using the
bicinchoninic acid protein test) was not detected
during the time-on-stream, confirming the high
stabilityofthebiocatalyst.
The continuous amination process using the
ATA(S)@NITQ-2 biocatalyst was also extended
to 4-phenyl-2-butanone, obtaining excellent yield
and selectivity to the corresponding chiral amine
(seeSupplementaryFigsS9andS10,respectively).
These results reveal the high stability of the biocat-
alyst that in this experiment was able to produce
∼40 g of chiral amine per gram of enzyme. In
Supplementary Table S4 the productivity and
operationalstabilityofdifferentsupportedtransam-
inases are compared for the amination of different
carbonyl compounds previously reported in the
literature.Ascanbeseen,thebiocatalystdeveloped
in this work is among the most active, representing
an interesting alternative to produce chiral amines
frombiomass-derivedprochiralketones.

WehaveshownthatATA@NITQ-2isastablebio-
catalyst able to perform the stereoselective amina-
tion of prochiral ketones into the corresponding
enantiopure amines. Following the objective stated
above,westudiedthepossibilityofcouplingthesyn-
thesisofaprochiralketonewiththeaminationpro-
cessintoachiralamine.Owingtothepharmacolog-
icalinterestofchiral4-methoxyphenylbutanamines,
we performed the synthesis of the prochiral ketone
precursor (4-methoxyphenyl-2-butanone) as a re-
action model through the aldol condensation of 4-
methoxybenzaldehyde and acetone (both available
molecules from biomass), followed by hydrogena-
tionoftheC =Cbondinonepot(seeScheme 2)us-
ingabifunctionalcatalyst(Pd/MgO)bearingbasic

metalsites(abletocatalysethehydrogenationofthe
C=Cbond).Previously,wehadshownthatthispro-
cess is a highly sustainable route to producing the
target ketone as the calculated E factor is 0.01, wa-
terbeingthemainwaste[ 49].
As can be observed in Supplementary Fig. S11,
the catalyst performs the one-pot reaction with
high selectivity, achieving total conversion of the
4-methoxybenzaldehyde in 2 h with 93% selectiv-
ityto4-(4-methoxyphenyl)-2-butanone.Moreover,
the reusability of the Pd/MgO catalyst was studied
byperformingthereactiontroughthreeconsecutive
cycles.Ascanbeobserved,theactivityofthecatalyst
wasmaintainedinconsecutiveruns,demonstrating
thehighstabilityofthiscatalyticsystem(seeSupple-

Additionally, the one-pot reaction was tested
with another aldehyde (benzaldehyde) under the
same reaction conditions giving similar results of
benzaldehydeconversion(99%)and94%selectivity
to4-phenyl-2-butanone.
To explore the efficacy of our proposal for the
synthesis of enantiopure primary amines, both
steps were coupled in a chemo-enzymatic process
carried out in a semi-continuous batch reactor
(SCBR) for the aldol-reduction step (first step)
combined with an fixed-bed continuous reactor for
the transamination reaction step. Thus, after the

Interesting aspects of the chemo-enzymatic

CONCLUSION
We have shown that ATAs electrostatically sup-
ported on a 2D ITQ-2 zeolite resulted in a highly
stable active biocatalyst to obtain a variety of valu-
able chiral amines starting from prochiral ketones
sourcedfrombiomass.Moreover,wehaveexpanded
thebiocatalystapplicationsbydesigninganewfully
sustainable catalytic process by means of chemo-
enzymaticsystemswithaveryhighatomeconomy,
which allows process intensification. More specifi-
cally,wehaveintroducedacatalyticprocessthatin-
volves a bifunctional metal/base solid catalyst and

METHODS
Enzymaticreactionsinbatchreactor
Reactions were performed by incubating the im-
mobilized enzyme ATA(S)@NITQ-2 with the ke-
tone(4-(4-methoxyphenyl)-2-butanone)(15mM),
the cofactor (PLP) 1 (mM) in 2 mL of solvent
(isopropylamine(pH7,2M)/phosphatebufferso-
lution, pH 7, 100 mM) (50/50 v/v) and DMSO
(10%) as co-solvent, at 37◦C while stirring at
1400 r/min. After the reaction, the biocatalyst was
separated from the mixture by centrifugation at
6000 r/min for 5 minutes, washed with phosphate
buffer (pH 7) and stored at 4◦C until use. The
reaction mixture was supplemented with NaOH
8 M and then extracted using methyl tert-butyl
ether and dried with anhydrous MgSO4. The or-
ganicphasewasanalysedonaVarian3900gaschro-
matograph equipped with a capillary column HP-5
(30m × 0.25mm × 0.25μm)andflameionization
detector. Dodecane was used as the external stan-
dardandthemolarbalancewasinallcases >96%.

ketonesinafixed-bedreactor
Forexperimentsintheflowreactor,adrysampleof
ATA(S)@NITQ-2 (208 mg) was diluted with sil-
icon carbide (CSi≥ 0.25 μm, 1.8 g) and packed
in a stainless-steel reactor (diameter 1 mm, height
35 mm). The catalyst dilution with the inert solid
particle, having the same size as the catalytic parti-
cles, reduces the local hot-spots and improves the
temperaturedistributionalongthecatalyticbed.The
dilutionofthecatalystwasperformedfollowingthe
literature [50] where it is recommended that the
volume of the bed (catalyst plus inert) has to fit
in a range depending on the diameter and length
of the reactor used. The temperature was fixed at
37oC for all experiments and the reactor was cou-
pled with a peristaltic pump for feeding. To eval-
uate the contact time, the flow rate was increased
from 0.25 to 3 mL h−1 while the temperature and

one dissolved in the feeding (isopropylamine (pH
7,2M)/phosphatebuffersolution,pH7,100mM)
(50/50 v/v), DMSO (10%) as co-solvent, 1 mM
PLP were keep constant. The contact time (h)
has been calculated as the inverse of space ve-
locity WHSV (h−1), which is defined as: WHSV
(h−1)= limitingreactant(gh −1)/gramofcatalyst.
