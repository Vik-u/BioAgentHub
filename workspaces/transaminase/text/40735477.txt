Background: Combination therapy of anticancer drugs with antibacterial agents
has numerous advantages, but these may develop adverse drug events that were
rarely studied. Speciﬁcally, regorafenib (REGO) mediates ferroptosis and causes
liver injury when used in combination with aminoglycosides (AGs); however, this
interaction remains unexplored.
Methodology: The study was conducted using bothin vivo and in vitro assays
involving Sprague– Dawley (SD) rats and HepG2/Huh7 to investigate ferroptosis-
associated liver injury. The drugs REGO, amikacin (AMK), and gentamicin (GNT)
were administered individually as well as in combination to evaluate their noxious
effects on the liver. Subsequently, biochemical, histological, and transcriptomic
analyses were carried out, and protein expressions were investigated using the
immunoblotting assay to explore the mechanisms underlying ferroptotic-
mediated liver injury.
Results: The ﬁndings of thein vivoassay revealed that the combination therapy of
regorafenib with aminoglycosides augments alanine transaminase (180%– 200%),
aspartate aminotransferase (120%– 140%), malondialdehyde, and Fe
2+ levels. It
decreases the level of antioxidants and alters histomorphology in SD rats
compared to individual therapy. The in vitro assay results validate the
enhanced levels of cellular iron, lipid peroxidation, reactive oxygen species,
and lactate dehydrogenase release, indicating enhanced toxicity. In contrast, it
decreased the cell viability ratio, glutathione level, and integrity of the
mitochondrial membrane. The real-time quantitative polymerase chain
reaction (RT-qPCR) and immunoblotting assay results show downregulation of
GPX4 and SLC7A11 expressions, along with elevation of ALOX-15 (3- to 6-
fold change).
Conclusion: Thus, combination therapy of regorafenib with amikacin and
gentamycin causes signiﬁcant elevation of iron and lipid peroxidation levels
and alteration in protein expressions, which mediates ferroptotic cell death
and leads to liver injury.

Introduction
Drug therapy is remarkably safe and ef ﬁcacious in many
pathophysiological conditions; however, anti-cancer drugs are still
associated with numerous adverse drug events (Tewari et al., 2019).
Anti-cancer drugs are multimodal approaches in oncological
treatment, involving highly complex regimens that result in a
high susceptibility toward their noxious effects ( Chopra et al.,
2016). Chemotherapeutic drugs are frequently linked to
chemotherapy-induced myelosuppression, which leads to severe
hematological complications ( Weiss, 2012 ) like
thrombocytopenia, leukemia, and persistent anemia, speci ﬁcally
long-term neutropenia, and immunosuppression ( Vial and
Descotes, 2003 ). These complications enhance the risk of
infections even during or after chemotherapy ( Ba et al., 2020;
Blayney and Schwartzberg, 2022; Dessalegn et al., 2023).
Regorafenib (REGO), a vascular endothelial growth factor
receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor, involves the activity of several
kinase proteins and is associated with the tumor microenvironment,
oncogenesis, and angiogenesis (Wilhelm et al., 2011). REGO was
approved for treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer, advanced
hepatocellular carcinoma ( Granito et al., 2021 ), breast cancer
(Salahuddin et al., 2021), esophageal cancer (Cytryn et al., 2023),
etc. In 2,341 subjects, REGO-associated hematological toxicities
include 22% thrombocytopenia, 3% anemia, and 10%
neutropenia. In this scenario, the use of REGO dramatically
elevated the risk of hematological toxicities, causing a higher risk
of developing severe infections (Zhao and Zhao, 2017). Moreover,
REGO inﬂuences the tumor microenvironment by modulating the
activity of various immune cells, which can contribute to an overall
immunosuppressive environment (Ou et al., 2021; Liu et al., 2022). It
was proven that the drugs affecting the vascular endothelial growth
factor pathway could alter immune cell function; for instance,
REGO may inhibit the function of natural killer cells and T
lymphocytes, which are critical for reducing sepsis. In clinical
settings, patients receiving REGO have been reported to
experience higher rates of serious infections (Kim et al., 2024).
Numerous studies have reported that an unknown infection is
suspected during or after cytotoxic chemotherapy, so certain
broad-spectrum antibiotics are recommended (Moon et al., 2006;
Taplitz et al., 2018; Jayanth et al., 2021).
Aminoglycosides (AGs) are broad-spectrum bactericidal
antibiotics primarily used to treat various infections caused by
aerobic and anaerobic organisms. They are commonly used in
chemotherapy settings and are highly recommended, particularly
when patients have a low neutrophil count (Taplitz et al., 2018).
Among all AGs, gentamicin (GNT) or amikacin (AMK) is used
concomitantly with various chemotherapeutic drugs (Zumla, 2010;
Avent et al., 2011), like vinblastine (Cuccarese et al., 2013), cisplatin
(Schacht et al., 2012), and methotrexate (Mendu et al., 2007), to
enhance the efﬁcacy and support defense mechanisms from certain
types of infections. The use of antibiotics with cytotoxic
chemotherapeutic drugs may be beneﬁcial in terms of defense
mechanisms; however, despite the potential for adverse drug
events, this combination has been rarely studied. Speci ﬁcally,
AGs used with REGO mediate ferroptosis and cause liver injury;
however, this interaction remains unexplored.
In recent years, the research on ferroptosis has grown
exponentially. This type of regulated cell death is primarily
induced by iron-dependent phospholipid peroxidation, which is
controlled by a number of metabolic processes intracellularly, via
System Xc
−, the mevalonate pathway, Nrf2, p53, and other pathways
(Ou et al., 2022). Ferroptosis is distinct from necrosis, autophagy,
apoptosis, and other types of controlled cell death in terms of the
genetics, biochemistry, and appearance (Dixon et al., 2012). As a
major kind of cell death, ferroptosis has received increased attention
in both clinical and basic research works. Ferroptosis, which
involves a number of substances, both as triggers and inhibitors,
severely impacts the physiological system, including the respiratory
system (Yu and Sun, 2023), renal system (Zhou et al., 2022),
gastrointestinal system, and hepatic system. Furthermore, the
effect of ferroptosis on several kinds of diseases have also been
extensively studied; for instance, cardiovascular illnesses (Guo et al.,
2022; Cai et al., 2023), neurodegenerative problems (Ren et al.,
2020), liver illnesses (Wu et al., 2021), and bone-associated diseases
(Chen et al., 2023) may either be acute or chronic (Chen F et al.,
2024). The proposed research work includesin vivo and in vitro
biological assays. It aims to investigate the mechanism underlying
ferroptosis-associated liver injury mediated by the combination
therapy of anticancer drugs, speci ﬁcally following the use of
regorafenib with amikacin (R + A) and regorafenib with
gentamicin (R + G).

Animal strains and care
Sprague– Dawley (SD) male rats, weighing 200– 225 g and aged
6– 8 weeks, were purchased from Hangzhou Medical College,
Zhejiang, China “Zhejiang Academy of Medical Sciences ”
(SCXK– Zhejiang 2019-0002). The animals were housed in plastic
cages and had free access to nutrition and were exposed to equal
light and dark cycles during the day to facilitate the experimental
procedures. Animal handling ethics protocols were followed as per
approved institutional guidelines established by the Zhejiang
University Institutional Animal Care. The animals were kept
under a controlled temperature of 20– 25
°C±2 °C and 40%– 60%
humidity. After acclimatization and feeding for 7 days, the rats were
randomly distributed into six groups, each with six animals, and
treated with individual and combination therapies of REGO, AMK,
and GNT as follows:
 Co: negative control group (1.5 mL of CMC administered
orally and 0.5 mL 0.9% sodium chloride administered
intraperitoneally).
 REGO: regorafenib alone at 15 mg kg
−1 once daily.
 AMK: amikacin injection alone at 15 mg kg−1 once daily.
 GNT: gentamicin injection alone at 15 mg kg−1 once daily.
 R + A: regorafenib: 15 mg kg−1 and amikacin: 15 mg kg−1
once daily.
 R + G: regorafenib: 15 mg kg−1 and gentamicin: 15 mg kg−1
once daily.
REGO was administered via oral gavage for 21 days. AMK/GNT
treatments began on the 19th day and were administered
intraperitoneally (IP). After the completion of the whole trial,
animals were sedated with ketamine hydrochloride injection
(45 mg kg
−1) and xylene (5 mg kg −1) and then sacri ﬁced by
cervical dislocation. Blood samples were drawn from the inferior
vena cava. The serum/plasma from whole blood was collected
through centrifugation at 5,000 × g at 4
°C for 10 minutes and
kept at −20°C for further biochemical analysis. The liver was
dissected and longitudinally bisected; one-half of the liver tissues
from different groups were preserved in 4% paraformaldehyde for
histomorphological analysis, and the remaining portions of the liver
were frozen at−80
°C for further experimental purposes.
Cell culture
An in vitro assay was performed to analyze the further
mechanism of liver injury mediated by the combination therapy
of REGO with AMK and GNT. For this purpose, HepG2 and
Huh7 were obtained from the Chinese Academy of Sciences,
Shanghai, China. The cells were cultured in Dulbecco ’s
modiﬁed Eagle medium (DMEM), supplemented with fetal
bovine serum (FBS) 10% (v/v), and incubated at 37
°Ci na n
incubator containing 5% CO2. Subsequently, the respective cells
were exposed to individual and combination therapies and
grouped as follows:
 Co: DMSO (0.01%) and considered the negative control.
 REGO: regorafenib 2 µM.
 AMK: amikacin 10 µM.
 AMK: amikacin 20 µM.
 GNT: gentamicin 10 µM.
 GNT: gentamicin 20 µM.
 R + A: regorafenib: 2μM + amikacin: 10μM.
 R + A: regorafenib: 2μM + amikacin: 20μM.
 R + A + F: regorafenib: 2μM + amikacin: 20μM + ferrostatin-
1: 10 μM.
 R + G: regorafenib: 2μM + gentamycin: 10μM.
 R + G: regorafenib: 2μM + gentamycin: 20μM.
 R + G + F: regorafenib: 2 μM + gentamicin: 20 μM+
ferrostatin-1: 10 μM.
Analysis of liver function biomarkers,
oxidative stress determinants, and
iron contents
To determine the levels of ALT, AST, MDA, GSH, SOD, and
CAT, the liver tissue, the blood of SD rats, HepG2 cells, and
Huh7 cells were homogenized. Subsequently, these were
centrifuged at 10,000 – 12,000 x g for 15 min at 4
°C, and a
supernatant solution was collected. Further protocols were
followed as per the manufacturer’s instructions provided with the
commercial assay kits.
Histopathological analysis of the liver injury
After 24 h of ﬁxation in 4% paraformaldehyde, the hepatic
tissues of SD rats were embedded in parafﬁn. Subsequently, the
tissues were sliced into 4-mm pieces and stained with hematoxylin
and eosin (H and E). Finally, each section was examined under the
optical microscope. According to liver H and E staining, Suzuki’s
criteria (Suzuki et al., 1993) were followed to determine the severity
of liver damage.
Immunoblotting analysis
A “One Step PAGE Gel Fast Preparation Kit” (Vazyme, Cat
#E303-C1) was used to prepare polyacrylamide gels and
electrophoretic separation of proteins. Primary antibodies,
including Slc7a11, Gpx4, p53, Stat-1, Alox-15, and Gapdh, were
used after preparing the primary antibody’s dilution buffer provided
by Beyotime Biotechnology, People’s Republic of China. The speciﬁc
dilution ratio of various antibodies is presented inSupplementary
Table S1.1. Finally, images were taken using the Azure Bioanalytical
Imaging System (Azure 300, United States) with system-provided
software. The scanned digital images were quantiﬁed using NIH
ImageJ software.

Cellular viability and lactate dehydrogenase
release analyses
Cell viability was quantiﬁed using cell count kit-8 (CCK-8)
provided by LAB LEAD, Beijing, China (Cat # CK001), and LDH
release toxicity was investigated using an assay kit supplied by
Beyotime, China (Cat #C0016). HepG2 and Huh7 cells were
incubated at a density of 1.0 × 10
6 in 96-well plates.
Subsequently, cells were exposed to the individual as well as
combination treatment of the corresponding drugs for the next
24 h. Further procedures were carried out according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. Finally, the cell viability was
measured at 450 nm and LDH activity at 490 nm using a
Thermo Scientiﬁc NanoDrop 2000 UV– Vis spectrophotometer.
Reactive oxygen species analysis
To identify the cellular ROS level in HepG2 cells, a DCFH-DA
assay kit was used, which was provided by Beyotime, China (Cat
#S0033s). The cells were exposed to corresponding drugs for 24 h.
Subsequent steps were followed according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. The ﬁnal results were analyzed using aﬂuorescence
microscope Nikon Eclipse Ti (Tokyo, Japan).
Real-time quantitative polymerase chain
reaction assay
TRIzol reagent obtained from TIANGEN Biotech Co., Ltd.,
Beijing, China (Cat # DP424) was used to obtain the total RNA
from HepG2 cells, Huh7 cells, and liver tissues. The RNA was then
reverse-transcribed onto cDNA using a commercial kit. Real-time
quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) was performed
using SYBR Green (Rosh, United States) on an Applied Biosystems
system by Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc, United States. Theﬁnal results
were evaluated using the 2 ^(-△△CT) method. GAPDH is
considered a control gene. The reaction system established for
RT-qPCR and speci ﬁc primers for each gene are enlisted in
Supplementary Table S1.2, 1.3A, 1.3B.
Mitochondrial membrane potential determination
The mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) was determined
following instructions for the JC-1 dye assay kit purchased from
Beyotime, China (Cat #C2006). In short, HepG2 cells were
incubated in equal density in a 6-well plate and exposed to drugs
for 24 h. Subsequently, the respective treated cells of every group
were rinsed with PBS and incubated with 1,000μL of the JC-1
working solution for 20 min at 37
°C. Finally, the cells were analyzed
using a Nikon A1R confocal microscope (Tokyo, Japan).
Statistical analysis
The experiment’s numerical data was expressed as ± SD, further
analysis was performed using GraphPad Prism 8.1.2. The values
with (*) are signiﬁcantly different from the Co (negative control)
using ANOVA and Dunnet’s technique (*p< 0.05), (**p< 0.005),
(***p < 0.001), (****p < 0.0001) and ns means non-signiﬁcant.
Results
The combination therapy of REGO with AGs
induces liver injury in SD rats
To identify the hepatotoxic effects of combination therapy of
REGO with AGs, speciﬁcally AMK and GNT, the drugs were
administered to SD rats. Theﬁndings revealed that the body weight
was decreased in SD rats when combination therapy was started,
speciﬁc a l l yi nR+Aa n dR+Gg r o u p so fr a t s(Figure 1B). However,
other groups that were treated with monotherapy having the same
body weight were the negative control group. The microscopic
images of H and E staining revealed that the drug monotherapy has
no impact on the liver. It is noteworthy that severe alterations were
observed at the site of hepatic cells (HCs) in groups treated with
combination therapy (R + A and R + G groups), characterized by
inﬂammation, cytoplasmic vacuolation, and microvascular injury
at the central vein (CV) and portal vein (PV). It disrupted the
cellular architecture and histological architecture, as shown in
Figure 1C. Meanwhile, the level of ALT was enhanced in R + A
signiﬁcantly (p< 0.001) and also in R + G (p< 0.0001), while the
AST level increased in R + A (p< 0.0001) and in R + G (p< 0.001)
compared to the Co group. (Figures 1E,F). In contrast, no changes
were observed in groups treated w ith individual therapies of
REGO, AMK, and GNT. These ﬁndings indicate that
combination therapy of REGO with AMK and GNT induces
l i v e ri n j u r yi nS Dr a t s .
The combination therapy of REGO with AGs
induces oxidative stress and mediates
ferroptosis in SD rats
Increased levels of LP, ionic iron, and oxidative stress are
considered biochemical h allmarks of ferroptosis ( Chen et al.,
2021). To investigate the mechanism underlying liver injury
caused by the combination therapy of REGO with AGs, tissues of
SD rats were used following individual and combination
treatments with the corresponding drugs. The ﬁndings
revealed that the LP level was signiﬁcantly increased in R + A
and R + G groups (p< 0.0001), while the level of ionic iron was
also elevated in the R + A (p< 0.05) and R + G (p< 0.001) groups.
The MDA level was signiﬁcantly increased in the R + A (p <
0.0001) and in R + G (p < 0.05) groups. In contrast, the
concentrations of GSH, CAT, and SOD were signi ﬁcantly
reduced in the R + A and R + G groups. However, no
signi ﬁcant difference was observed in REGO, AMK, and GNT
groups that received individual therapy for the corresponding
drugs (Figures 2A– F). Furthermore, transcriptomic analysis was
performed as follows: raw counts were normalized using
DESeq2 ’s median-of-ratios method to compute sample-
speci ﬁc size factors, and differential gene expression analysis
was performed using Wald’s test, and p-values were adjusted for
multiple testing using the Benjamin – Hochberg FDR method
with a cut-off of FDR <0.05 │log2FC │.T h eﬁndings revealed
that 887 genes were dysregulated, of which 454 were upregulated
and 433 were downregulated. Subsequently, 50 genes were
selected from each group, and those were most differently

expressed genes (DEGs) between the treatment groups (Figures
3A,B). DEGs are involved in ferroptosis in the respective groups,
including Alox-15 (arachidonate 15 lipoxygenase), Ndufa10l1
(NADH dehydrogenase-ubiquin one-1 alpha sub-complex 10-
like-1), Angptl4 (angiopoietin-like 4), Nr4a1 (nuclear receptor

(phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase), Duox1 (dual oxidase-1),
Igfbp1 (insulin-like growth factor-binding protein-1)
(Figure 3C ), Alox-15 (arachidonate 15 lipoxygenase), Sox9
(SRY-Box transcription factor-9), Trpm6 (transient receptor
potential cation channel subfamily-M-6), Klf5 (Kruppel-like
factor-5), Alas2 (5′-aminolevulinate synthase 2), Pla2g2a
(phospholipase A2, group IIA), Arrdc3( arrestin domain-
containing 3), Plin2 (perilipin 2), Trim36 (tripartite motif-
containing-36), and Igfbp1 (insulin-like growth factor-binding
protein-1) ( Figure 3D). The Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and
Genomes (KEGG) pathway-rich factor shows that ferroptosis
pathways are involved in the top 20 pathways (Figure 3E). From
these investigations, it wa s summarized that after the
combination treatment of REGO with AGs, Alox-15 was
found to be commonly expressed in all groups and
signi ﬁcantly upregulated, which is associated with the
ferroptosis pathway. To va lidate the expression pro ﬁling of
Alox-15 and other DEGs, RT-qPCR was performed ( Figures
4A,B). Additionally, the protein expression of Alox-15 was
analyzed through an immunoblot assay ( Figures 4C,D ).
Consistent with the results of RNA-seq, RT-qPCR, and
immunoblotting assay, it was con ﬁrmed that Alox-15 was
signi ﬁcantly overexpressed when REGO was concomitantly
used with AMK and GNT, which may induce ferroptosis.
The combination therapy of REGO with AGs
reduced cell viability, mitochondrial
membrane potential, and increased LDH
release in HepG2 and Huh7 cells
The aforementioned outcomes of thein vivoassay encourage us
to investigate further mechanisms of combination therapy of REGO
with AGs, which may be involved in hepatic injury. For this purpose,
an in vitro assay using HepG2 and Huh7 cells was established.
Through this, it is determined that the combination therapy of
corresponding drugs (R + A and R + G) reduces the cell viability
ratio according to the concentration gradient of drugs. Meanwhile,
individual therapy showed a slight change in the cell viability, but
this was insigni ﬁcant as compared to Co ( Figures 5A,B ).
Accompanied with the decreased ratios of cell viability, an
increased LDH release was observed in R + A and R + G groups
of HepG2 and Huh7 cells with exposure to different drug
concentrations ( Figures 5C,D ). To examine MMP levels in
response to the combination therapy of REGO with AGs, JC-1
staining was used. It is noteworthy that the MMP level remarkably
decreased after combination therapy of corresponding drugs, i.e., in
R + A and R + G groups of cells compared to Co, while cells exposed
to individual therapy, i.e., REGO, AMK, and GNT, have no changes
(Figure 5E). Additionally, in the presence of fer-1 with combination
therapy of REGO with AMK (R + A + F) and REGO with GNT (R +

G + F), cell viability and MMP were improved, and LDH release was
decreased. These key outcomes validate that the combination
therapy of REGO with AGs mediates ferroptosis, which leads to
liver injury.
The combination therapy of REGO with AGs
mediated ferroptosis in
HepG2 and Huh7 cells
Iron accumulation and elevated LP levels are considered
phenotypic features, while downregulation of GPX4 and
SLC7A11 expressions are considered genotypic hallmarks of
ferroptosis (Capelletti et al., 2020). Notably, it was extensively
studied that iron accumulation increases ROS levels, thereby
elevating oxidative stress and potentiating liver ﬁbrosis (Mehta
et al., 2019 ). Consistently, iron levels in REGO-, AMK-, and
GNT-treated HepG2 and Huh7 cells were examined. Meanwhile,
it was observed that the combination therapy of REGO with AMK
and GNT augments iron accumulation intracellularly. Speciﬁcally,
Fe
2+ was signiﬁcantly elevated in HepG2 cells (p< 0.005) in R + A
(2 μM+1 0 μM) and in R + G (2μM+2 0 μM) groups (p< 0.001), as

ROS and MDA levels in R + A and R + G groups. However, GSH
levels markedly reduced in HepG2 and Huh7 cells in R + A and R +
G groups at both extents, as compared to the negative control
group. In contrast, slight changes were observed in cell groups that
were exposed to AMK, REGO, and GNT alone, but these changes
were not signiﬁcant (Figures 6C– G). Notably, in the presence of fer-
1, the levels of Fe
2+, MDA, and ROS were signiﬁcantly decreased in
HepG2 and Huh7 cells, while the GSH level was signi ﬁcantly
improved. Consistently, it was also determined that REGO and
its combination therapy extensively downregulates the proteins
levels of GPX4 and SLC7A11 in HepG2 and in Huh7 cells
(Figures 7A,B). Meanwhile, the results of RT-qPCR show that the
fold change of GPX4 and SLC7A11 was signiﬁcantly decreased in
HepG2 cells, speciﬁcally in R + A and R + G groups at various
extents (Figures 8A,B). Simultaneously, in Huh7 cells, the expression
level of GPX4 was also reduced in R + A and R + G groups, as
displayed in Figure 8C , while SLC7A11 level is signi ﬁcantly
decreased in both R + A and R + G groups as the drug content
was increased (Figure 8D). The overallﬁndings demonstrate that
when REGO is co-administered with AMK and GNT, it induces
ferroptosis, which may lead to liver injury.
The combination therapy of REGO with AGs
activates ALOX-15, which is involved in
hepatic ferroptosis
It has been extensively studied that ferroptosis is established
through extrinsic and intrinsic pathways. Ample evidence suggests
that co-administration of antibiotics with cytotoxic
chemotherapeutic drugs exerts their adverse effects, which may
cause severe liver injury. Thus, it was hypothesized that REGO
and its combination therapy with AMK and GNT might exert the
adverse effects associated with ferroptotic cell death. To verify this
hypothesis, HepG2 and Huh7 cells were exposed to individual
therapies of REGO, AMK, and GNT, as well as in combination
with each other at different concentrations. Subsequently, the
protein expression in these cells was analyzed through an

immunoblotting assay. The results depict that ALOX-15 and
associated genes were signi ﬁcantly upregulated in HepG2 and
Huh7 cells in the R + A and R + G groups of cells compared to
the Co group. In contrast, the cells exposed to individual drug
therapy, i.e., REGO, AMK, and GNT, have no signiﬁcant changes in
the protein expression of ALOX-15 (Figures 9A,B). Meanwhile, the
genetic expressions of these cells were also examined through RT-
qPCR after exposure to respective drugs, and quantiﬁcation of the
fold change of ALOX-15, p53, and STAT-1 genes signiﬁcantly
increased in R + A and R + G groups of cells against negative
control. On the other hand, there was no signiﬁcant mutation in the
AMK, REGO, and GNT groups of cells when exposed to the
individual therapy of drugs (Figures 10A– F).
Discussion
The liver is one of the essential organs in the body and is the
center of hormonal control, immunological response, nutrition
metabolism, and biotransformation of medicinal substances
(Trefts et al., 2017). However, the liver performs key functions
but is prone to injury (Rad et al., 2024; Velez et al., 2024). It can be
damaged due to infection, metabolic disorders, immunity disorders,
or drug-induced toxicity (Hoeve et al., 2018). Liver ﬁbrosis, fatty
liver (alcoholic or non-alcoholic), and trauma are the leading causes
of liver damage. However, acute liver injury is frequently caused by
viral infection, ischemia– reperfusion injury, and chemical or drug
substances. Chemical or drug-induced liver injury is the term used
to describe the damages caused to the hepatocytes or biliary system
by the application of xenobiotic chemicals or other pharmacological
entities (Senior, 2007). Drug-induced acute liver injury is a frequent
and severe clinical illness with high incidence and mortality rates.
Concerning organ damage associated with cell death, recent
evidence suggests that ferroptosis is a novel type of regulated cell
death. It differs from other types of regulated cell death in terms of
the cell structure, metabolism, genetic mutation, and protein
expression. Ferroptosis involves three key metabolic processes:
thiol, lipid, and iron. These metabolic processes ultimately result
in lipid peroxidation, which is dependent on the accumulation of
ionic iron inside the cell and ultimately leads to cell death.
Ferroptosis has a destructive role and is implicated in the
pathologies related to organ damage and degenerative illnesses
(Tang et al., 2021; Chen et al., 2022).
In this study, we describe our efforts at using the AG antibiotics,
speciﬁcally AMK and GNT, which are involved in liver injury when
concomitantly administered with REGO, even on clinical
therapeutic concentrations. Clinically, AGs are considered the
main pharmacological agents used for prophylaxis in various

pathophysiological conditions, including post-surgery and cancer-
associated immunosuppression (Taplitz et al., 2018; Jayanth et al.,
2021). The proposed hypothesis reveals a link between drug toxicity
and ferroptosis. Initially, adverse effects of REGO with AMK and
GNT were investigated on SD rats. In the initial stage, using blood

biochemical determinants were increased. Additionally, inﬁltration
and microvascular injury in hepatic tissues were observed following
the combination therapy of corresponding drugs (Figure 1). The
liver tissues of SD rats were analyzed through RNA-seq; the results
revealed that among various DEGs,Alox-15 was commonly and
signiﬁcantly overexpressed in all groups and associated with the
ferroptotic pathway (Figure 3).
Ferroptosis predominantly relies on iron and is marked by
elevated levels of LP ( Rodriguez et al., 2022 ). Notably,
intracellular Fe
3+ is reduced to Fe 2+ by the prostate 6-
transmembrane epithelial antigen-3, subsequently integrated into
the iron pool, and stored as ferritin (He et al., 2020; Correnti et al.,
2024). The Fe2+, which is unstable and highly reactive, facilitates the
generation of hydroxyl radicals via the Fenton reaction, which can

directly interact with polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) in the cell
membrane, resulting in signiﬁcant elevation in ROS and initiating
ferroptosis ( Gammella et al., 2016 ; Chen et al., 2020 ). ROS
encompasses lipid peroxyl radicals, lipid peroxides, and lipid
alkoxyl radicals, mainly generated via enzymatic LP or non-
enzymatic autoxidation pathways, with the Fenton reaction,
which is iron-dependent. Our study determined that MDA levels
were elevated in liver tissues of SD rats during Fe
2+ overload;
furthermore, GSH, SOD, and CAT levels were reduced after
concomitant use of REGO with AMK and GNT (Figure 2).
However, no single strategy has yet been developed to identify
ferroptotic cell death, although different studies have determined
multiple techniques for detecting the ferroptosis process (Chen Z.,
et al., 2024). To demonstrate the presence of ferroptosis in the disease

discovery process, cell viability testing is crucial. Overall, research on
ferroptosis frequently uses cell status and activity detection through a
CCK-8 assay, which is the most popular approach nowadays (Su et al.,
2022; Qin et al., 2023; Ma et al., 2024). Moreover, increased LDH
release and decreased MMP are also considered to determine
ferroptosis (Kumar et al., 2018; Huang et al., 2022; Xu et al.,
2022). To discover the further mechanism of liver injury associated
with ferroptosis, an in vitro assay model was established on
HepG2 and Huh-7 cells. Through this, it was determined that cell
viability and MMP were decreased in HepG2 and Huh7 cells when
these were exposed to the combination therapy of REGO with AMK
and GNT compared to individual therapy. Additionally, increased
LDH release was observed (Figure 5).
Meanwhile, ROS determination, whether lipid ROS, intracellular
ROS, or mitochondrial ROS, is also useful in identifying ferroptosis.
Intracellular ROS are frequently detected using DCFH-DA; after
staining, green ﬂuorescence is visible with an increase in ROS
(Eruslanov and Kusmartsev, 2010). Increased LP is a hallmark of
ferroptosis (Dai et al., 2023), which is involved in the oxidative
breakdown of PUFA ( Tsikas, 2017; Hirschhorn and Stockwell
et al., 2019 ; Wu et al., 2022 ). While ferroptosis cannot be
identiﬁed only by elevated ROS and LP, detecting iron levels is
also a phenotypic hallmark in the ferroptosis process. Furthermore,
GPX4 is an essential regulatory component in the cellular antioxidant
defense mechanism (Yang et al., 2014). The key factors regulating
ferroptosis are cysteine availability, GSH production, and
GPX4 activity (Yang et al., 2016). In the system SLC7A11/XC
−,
glutamate and extracellular cysteine are exchanged in an equal
ratio; glutamate is transported outside the cell by solute carrier
family 3 member 2, while cysteine is transported intracellularly for
GSH production by SLC7A11 (Mandal et al., 2010; Kobayashi et al.,
2015). Glutamate, cysteine, and glycine are then converted into GSH
by glutamyl cysteine synthetase and glutathione synthetase; as a result,
ferroptosis is less likely to occur (Jiang et al., 2021). GSH can enhance
the GPX4 ’s interaction with intracellular phospholipid
hydroperoxides which will decrease the corresponding

phospholipid alcohol levels. Following these parameters, ourﬁndings
are evident that the combination therapy of AMK and GNT with
REGO induces Fe
2+, MDA, and ROS levels, and GSH production was
decreased (Figure 6). Apart from this, the most commonly used
methods to validate the occurrence of ferroptosis are RT-qPCR and
Western blotting, which conﬁrm the reduced expressions of GPX4 or
SLC7A11 (Zhang et al., 2023). The current study proved that the
combination therapy of REGO with AMK and GNT decreases the
production of GSH, which may downregulate the expressions of
GPX4 and SLC7A11, as depicted inFigures 7, 8.
Multiple pathways might be involved in the ferroptosis process;
it is still under consideration. However, the two major pathways
have been identiﬁed: the transporter-dependent pathway or the
extrinsic pathway and the intrinsic pathway (Tang et al., 2021).
Interestingly, it can be said that both are based on the levels of LP
and iron content, which play a key role in the homeostasis of
ferroptosis ( Rochette et al., 2022 ). The intrinsic pathway of
ferroptosis is regarded as an enzyme-regulated pathway, in which
p53 plays a fundamental role in inducing ferroptosis through
activation of STAT-1 and ALOX-15 ( Jiang et al., 2015 ). It
increases LP production by increasing ROS levels ( Ou et al.,
2016). Additionally, it can efﬁciently oxidize diverse phosphatidyl
ethanol amines into iron-reducing signaling molecules (Li et al.,
2020). PUFAs are highly cationic amines that exhibit strong binding
afﬁnity to nucleic acids and are involved in several bimolecular
processes, such as DNA replication, translation, and transcription,
and these interactions can control the intercellular communication
(Casero and Marton, 2007; Han et al., 2024). The enzymatic pathway
entails the lipoxygenase enzyme using PUFAs as substrates to generate
lipid peroxides, whichmay damage cellular and organelle membranes
(Kuhn et al., 2015; Zheng and Cornad, 2020). The correlation between
p53-mediated STAT-1 and ALOX-15 expression has also been
observed in cancer cells (Ou et al., 2016). Our investigation revealed
that ALOX-15 induces ferroptosis following liver injury, where STAT-
1 plays a pivotal role by modulatingthe LP process and facilitating the
elevated production of ALOX-15 in hepatocytes. This study explored
the fact that the combination therapy of REGO with AGs induces
ferroptosis via activation of ALOX-15 (Figures 9, 10). This indicates
that targeting Alox-15 may represent an innovative therapeutic
approach for alleviating subsequent damage caused by drug-induced
hepatic ferroptosis. Before conducting this study, the clinical
signiﬁcance of the p53/ALOX-15 ferroptotic pathway in sinonasal
inverted papilloma was determined (Li et al., 2024). Another study
revealed that this pathway plays a vital role in ferroptosis following
skeletal muscle contusion (Yang et al., 2024). “Yuan” suggested that
this ferroptotic pathway is involved in Alzheimer’sd i s e a s e(Ren et al.,
FIGURE 11
The schematic view of the current study: REGO-AGs activate ALOX-15 (black arrow), which accelerates the Fenton reaction and formation of

2024); however, in our novel study, it was explored that activation of
ALOX-15 through p53/STAT-1 causes ferroptosis, leading to severe
liver damage.
From the aboveﬁndings, it has been concluded that combination
therapy of REGO with AMK and GNT causes signiﬁcant elevation of
Fe
2+, LP, ROS levels and alteration in protein’s expression, which
mediates ferroptotic cell death and leads to liver dysfunction (Figure
11). Speciﬁcally, it wasﬁrst investigated that concomitant use of these
drugs activates ALOX-15 through STAT-1, followed by p53, leading
to ferroptosis and liver injury.
