The reductive amination of prochiral ketones using biocata lysts has been of great interest
to the pharmaceutical industry in the last decade for integr ating novel strategies in
the production of chiral building blocks with the intent of m inimizing impact on the
environment. Amongst the enzymes able to catalyze the direc t amination of prochiral
ketones, pyridoxal 5 ′-phosphate (PLP) dependent ω -transaminases have shown great
promise as versatile industrial biocatalysts with high sel ectivity, regioselectivity, and broad
substrate scope. Herein the biochemical characterization of a putrescine transaminase
from Pseudomonas putida(Pp-SpuC) was performed, which showed an optimum pH
and temperature of 8.0 and 60 ◦C, respectively. To gain further structural insight of
this enzyme, we crystallized the protein in the apo form and d etermined the structure
to 2.1 Å resolution which revealed a dimer that adopts a class I transaminase fold
comparable to other class III transaminases. Furthermore w e exploited its dual substrate
recognition for biogenic diamines (i.e., cadaverine) and r eadily available monoamines
(i.e., isopropylamine) for the synthesis of benzylamine de rivatives with excellent product
conversions and extremely broad substrate tolerance.

INTRODUCTION
Substituted benzylamines are essential building blocks for the synthesis of a diverse range
of agrochemicals, pharmaceuticals, chiral ligands, and poly mers (
Roughley and Jordan, 2011;
Froidevaux et al., 2016 ). Furthermore, they are key components with potent bioactivi ties in natural
products and synthetic drugs, such as the topical antifungal t reatment butenaﬁne ( Krauss et al.,
2017), glucocorticoid receptor modulators with potent anti-inﬂam matory and immunosuppressive
activity ( Link et al., 2005 ), epoxide hydrolase inhibitors employed in the treatment of t ype II
diabetes ( Shen and Hammock, 2012 ), and most recently anti-tumor drugs ( Mojena et al., 2018 ).
The classical direct amination route, which has often been u sed on an industrial scale, is based
on the reaction of alcohols with ammonia using transition met al supported catalysts ( Figure 1A);
however, this heterogeneous process requires high temperatu res and pressures resulting sometimes
in low yields of desired product ( Hayes, 2001). For reasons of availability, a cost eﬀective alternative
would use a one-pot conversion of a carbonyl compound into an am ine via the formation of an
iminium ion intermediate which is subsequently reduced in situ by a reducing agent. Homogenous

catalysis for the amination of carbonyl groups using rhodium ,
iridium, and ruthenium transition metal catalysts with amm onia
under hydrogen pressure ( Figure 1B) demonstrate this eﬀective
and clean procedure ( Gross et al., 2002; Tan et al., 2018 ). Apart
from transition metal catalysis, a well-known two-step appro ach
involving the reaction of hydroxylamine with carbonyl grou ps
to give oxime ethers and subsequent reduction with borane to
yield amine products has also been applied ( Figure 1C), but this
cumbersome approach requires isolation and puriﬁcation steps
of the stable reaction intermediates (
Feuer and Braunstein, 1969;
Mirjafary et al., 2015 ).
Biocatalysis provides numerous advantages to the tradition al
chemical synthetic methods, allowing for biosustainable
processes that exhibit excellent stereo- and regioselectivi ties,
mild reaction conditions and no requirement for expensive
and toxic heavy metals or protection-deprotection strategie s.
The expanding toolbox of enzymes enables scalable asymmetri c
amine synthesis to access chiral amine derivatives. Severa l
biocatalytic strategies that have been developed include am ine
dehydrogenases (
Ye et al., 2015 ), ammonia lyases ( Parmeggiani
et al., 2018 ), reductive aminases ( Aleku et al., 2017 ) or via
kinetic resolutions using monoamine oxidases ( Ghislieri
et al., 2013; Batista et al., 2018 ), and/or hydrolases ( Reetz
and Schimossek, 1996 ). Of these the reductive amination of
prochiral ketones has been listed in the ACS Green Chemistry
Roundtable discussion of implementing an atom eﬃcient and
environmentally benign method to produce chiral amines
(
Constable et al., 2007 ). The direct amination of prochiral
ketones via the transfer of ammonia from an amine donor using
ω -transaminases ( Figure 1D) has an attractive advantage over
dehydrogenases as the latter require an external nicotinam ide
cofactor regeneration system whilst ω -transaminases utilize
pyridoxal 5 ′-phosphate (PLP) as a tightly bound prosthetic
group (
Slabu et al., 2017 ). However, ω -transaminase suﬀers from
thermodynamic equilibrium limitations ( Tufvesson et al., 2014 )
and substrate inhibition ( Shin and Kim, 1997 ). Studies have
shown this can be circumvented using inexpensive amine donors
in large excess such as isopropylamine (which in the formation
of volatile acetone that drives the equilibrium to the desir ed
product) or using sacriﬁcial amine cosubstrates which displace s
equilibria via ring aromatization or cyclisation (
Gomm et al.,
2016; Martínez-Montero et al., 2016; Galman et al., 2017 ). To
date there are many examples that have demonstrated the use of
ω -transaminases toward the production of industrially relev ant
amines, alkaloids, and other bioactive natural products (
Guo and
Berglund, 2017; Costa et al., 2018; Galman et al., 2018 ).
We earlier identiﬁed a putrescine transaminase spuC gene in
Pseudomonas putida with preference to aliphatic diamines other
than putrescine such as cadaverine and spermidine ( Galman
et al., 2017 ). A basic local alignment search tool (BLAST) analysis
(Altschul et al., 1990 ) revealed a 76% protein sequence identity to
a spuC gene from Pseudomonas aeruginosa , that was previously
characterized to be part of a polyamine uptake and utilization
pathway converting putrescine to 4-aminobutyraldehyde (
Lu
et al., 2002 ). Further investigations supported the physiological
role of SpuC by maintaining alanine homeostasis via the
transamination of pyruvate (
Han et al., 2008 ). However, the
promiscuous role of P. putida Pp-SpuC may also contribute
to a complementary pathway in L-lysine catabolism via the
cadaverine route (
Revelles et al., 2005 ) to produce sought
after polyamide building blocks 5-aminovalerate and glutaric
acid (
Adkins et al., 2013 ). In this study, we report on the
detailed characterization (structural and biochemical) o f the
putrescine transaminase Pp-SpuC, and its application in the
transamination of a comprehensive range of ketones/aldehyde s
for the production of a variety of benzylamine derivatives.
RESULTS
The Effects of Temperature and pH on
Pp-SpuC
Putrescine transaminase Pp-SpuC was cloned into a pET28b
vector containing an N-terminal His 6-tag and recombinantly
expressed in E. coli BL21 (DE3) as previously reported
(
Galman et al., 2017 ). The initial thermoactivity of puriﬁed Pp-
SpuC was investigated by incubating the enzyme with ( S)-α -
methylbenzylamine and sodium pyruvate at 25–90 ◦C in Tris-
HCl buﬀer pH 8.0 ( Figure 2). The activity was measured
according to the UV absorbance change due to the formation of
acetophenone. The activity of the enzyme signiﬁcantly improv ed
as the temperature increased to its suboptimum activity at 50 ◦C,
and reached 100% optimum relative activity at 60 ◦C. At higher
temperature, it showed gradual denaturation but maintainin g
signiﬁcant residual activity (77%) up to 70 ◦C. Interestingly, an
activity above 50% of the maximum was observed over a large
temperature range (45–75 ◦C).
The thermostability of Pp-SpuC was assayed by incubating
the enzyme (5 mg mL −1) at optimum and sub-optimum
temperatures for diﬀerent times, then assaying the residual
activity at 30 ◦C as described above ( Figure 3). Each result was
an average of triplicate measurements from the initial rates
upon the formation of acetophenone and was linearly plotted as
ln(residual activity %) vs. time. The deactivation rate const ants

kd were calculated at 4.65 and 0.156 h −1 for incubated enzyme
temperatures at 60 and 50 ◦C, respectively. The half-life times
(t1/ 2 = ln2/kd) were calculated as 4.4 h at 50 ◦C which is more
stable than the optimal relative activity conditions at 60 ◦C with a
half-life time of 8.9 min.
The pH-stability proﬁle of Pp-SpuC was determined by
incubating at 30 ◦C for 24 h the puriﬁed enzyme in diﬀerent
buﬀer solutions (50 mM), then measuring residual activity as
described above ( Figure 4). The pH proﬁle reveals the eﬀect
on transaminase activity in deﬁned buﬀers shown as relative
activity using 2-ﬂuoroacetophenone as the acceptor substrat e
and isopropylamine (50 equiv.) as the amine donor. Pp-SpuC
was found inactive at acidic pH values pH < 6.0 and active at
pH 7.0–9.0 with optimum activity at pH 8.0, which is typical
of a majority of ( S)-selective transaminases such as those from
Halomonas elongata He-ω TA (
Cerioli et al., 2015 ), Vibrio ﬂuvialis
Vf-ω TA (Shin et al., 2003 ), and Chromobacterium violaceum Cv-
ω TA (Schell et al., 2009 ). Tris-HCl buﬀer was found to stabilize
the protein, with the highest activity at pH 7.0 (compared to
phosphate buﬀer which showed a 40% decrease in activity at
the same pH). The decrease in activity is likely to be due to the
displacement of the cofactor pyridoxamine-5 ′-phosphate (PMP),
the aminated form of PLP , via competing phosphate ions, as
previously reported within Class III transaminases (
Schell et al.,
2009; Mathew et al., 2015 ). Enzyme stability decreases by about
55% when the pH was increased to 9.0 and only negligible activi ty
could be seen at pH > 10.0.
The Effects of the Nature and
Concentration of Co-solvents on Pp-SpuC
Transaminase catalyzed reactions often rely on the use of
organic co-solvents, primarily to increase the solubility o f
hydrophobic substrates. Biotransformation reactions with Pp-
SpuC transaminase were previously conducted using 1% ν /ν
DMSO and gave high product conversions (
Galman et al., 2017 ).
However, a detailed study of the inﬂuence of various organic co-
solvents was not performed ( Figure 5). In order to investigate

the eﬀects, Pp-SpuC reactions were performed on a 5 mM scale
using 3-ﬂuorobenzaldehyde 1a as the substrate acceptor with
50 equivalents of IPA in the presence of 10–30% ν /ν of several
common co-solvents. Pp-SpuC was shown to tolerate up to 10%
ν /ν with all the organic co-solvents tested. Increasing the co-
solvents to 20% ν /ν revealed a 45–55% decrease in activity with
MeCN, MeOH, and THF. Interestingly, the activity of Pp-SpuC
remained unaﬀected with DMSO at 30% ν /ν , therefore higher
concentrations were tested, revealing almost identical ac tivity at
up to 40% ν /ν DMSO. The high DMSO stability of Pp-SpuC
is comparable to a recently published wild type transaminase
(pQR2189, 52% protein sequence identity to Pp-SpuC) isolated
from a household drain metagenome, displaying activity up to
50% ν /ν DMSO (
Leipold et al., in press ).

better insight into the catalytic mechanism, the crystal str ucture

determined by HPLC based on the formation of the correspondi ng amine. The
buffers used were acetate (pH 5.0–6.0), phosphate (pH 6.0–8 .0), Tris-HCl (pH
7.0–9.0), and carbonate (pH 9.5–10.5) at a concentration of 50 mM.

of Pp-SpuC was solved as follows. The His-tagged Pp-
SpuC puriﬁed by nickel aﬃnity chromatography was further
puriﬁed by ion-exchange before crystallization. A commerci ally
available crystallogenesis screening set was employed, obt aining
crystals under a number of diﬀerent conditions after overnig ht
incubation at 20 ◦C. The best diﬀracting crystals were obtained
in 0.2 M MgCl 2, 0.1 M Bis-Tris pH 6.5, 25% PEG3350,
then cryoprotected before freezing. X-ray diﬀraction data wa s
collected from single crystal at IO4 beamline at the Diamond
Light Source Syncrotron (UK). The structure was solved by
the molecular replacement method using as a search model
the aspartate aminotransferase from Pseudomonas sp. (Pse-ω TA)
(PDB id: 5TI8) (
Wilding et al., 2017 ) which shows 77% identity
with Pp-SpuC. The ﬁnal reﬁned structure of Pp-SpuC has been
deposited in the PDB database (PDB id: 6HX9).
Applications of Pp-SpuC as a Biocatalyst
With Broad Substrate Tolerance
Lastly, to demonstrate the applicability of Pp-SpuC as an
eﬃcient biocatalyst, the transamination of a broad range
of aromatic carbonyl compounds (a representative panel
of 30 aldehyde/ketone substrates substituted with halogen s,
electron-donating groups, and electron-withdrawing groups,
was tested. Reactions were carried out with recombinant
Pp-SpuC (2 mg mL −1) in Tris-HCl buﬀer (50 mM) pH 9.0,
containing PLP (1.0 mM), at 30 ◦C for 18 h. For comparison, two
equilibrium-shifting approaches were tested: either a large e xcess
isopropylamine (50 equiv.) as a low-cost amine donor, or bio-
derived cadaverine (5 equiv.) as a cleaner, “green” alternat ive
sacriﬁcial co-substrate, which drives the reaction by spont aneous
cyclisation. Conversions were monitored by LC-MS and the
identity of the products was veriﬁed by MS and/or by comparison
with authentic standards. In most cases, almost quantitati ve
conversions could be observed (see Discussion section), pro ving
the broad substrate tolerance of this enzyme.
In order to demonstrate the feasibility of the reaction with
reduced catalyst loadings, biotransformations of the mode l
substrate 1a were performed with successive ten-fold dilutions,
under the same conditions speciﬁed above. With a catalyst
concentration of 0.2 mg mL −1 full conversion could still be
achieved, while reducing the enzyme loading to 0.02 mg mL −1
only a modest conversion (19%) was observed. From the latter
data, with the substrate only partially consumed, a total turn over
number (TTN) could be estimated to ∼2400.
DISCUSSION
X-ray Crystal Structure of Pp-SpuC
The overall structure of Pp-SpuC (PDB id: 6HX9) is similar
to Pseudomonas sp. Pse- ω TA (PDB id: 5TI8) (
Wilding et al.,
2017) and C. violaceum Cv-ω TA (PDB id: 4A6T) ( Humble et al.,
2012; Sayer et al., 2013 ) and typical to the class I transaminase
fold. There are two monomers in the asymmetric unit and
the enzyme forms a tight dimer with predicted surface area
of about 28710 Å 2, with buried surface area of 3980 Å 2
. Each
monomer can be divided into two major domains ( Figure 6).
The large domain comprises residues 93–313 and folds into a
sandwich of α /β /α comprising a core of seven stranded β -sheets
with only β 10 being antiparallel. The large domain is ﬂanked
by a small domain composed of two subdomains joined by a
parallel β interaction between strand β 3 and β 14. The N-terminal
subdomain is composed of three antiparallel β strands. In the case
of holo Cv- ω TA (PDB id: 4A6U) these anti parallel β strands
capped by two most N-terminal α -helices, which were absent
in our structure, similarly to the apo structures of CV- ω TA
(PDB id: 4A6U) and Pse- ω TA (PDB id: 5TI8). The N-terminal
subdomain forms extensive interactions with monomer 2 of th e
dimer which is important for active site formation, similar t o
what was observed with Cv- ω TA and Pse- ω TA. The C-terminal
subdomain is formed of four antiparallel β -sheets.
In the active site of aminotransferases, the PLP cofactor bi nds

C4′ of PLP forms a Schiﬀ base with an active site lysine during
the catalytic interaction ( Eliot and Kirsch, 2004 ). Unfortunately,
all our attempts to obtain the structure of the complex of Pp-
SpuC with PLP bound were unsuccessful. The superposition of
the Pp-SpuC structure with the holo structure of Cv- ω TA (PDB
id: 4A6T) reveals the position of the active site. In the case o f
SpuC, the catalytic residue Lys289 is located on the loop betw een
β 4 and β 10. The Pp-Spuc structure is very similar to the Pse- ω TA
(PDB id: 5TI8) (
Wilding et al., 2017 ) and the apo form of Cv-
ω TA (PDB id: 4A6U) ( Humble et al., 2012 ) as compared to holo
structure of Cv- ω TA (PDB id: 4A6T). The ﬁrst N-terminal 33
residues are missing from the pp-SpuC structure which forms the
corresponding two α helices in the holo Cv- ω TA (PDB id: 4A6T).
Another disordered region of Pp-SpuC are amino acid residues
154–179 and 313–324. The homologous region 154–179 forms a
“roof” above the cofactor binding site in the holo structure of Cv-
ω TA, indicating its importance in PLP binding ( Figure 7). This
region is also absent in case of apo-Cv- ω TA and Pse- ω TA. The
additional missing loop from 313–324 which should connect t wo
alpha helices and comes close to the phosphate moiety of the PLP
cofactor in holo-Cv- ω TA (PDB id: 4A6T).
Comparison of Pp-SpuC Active Site
Structure and Catalytic Activity With
Related Class III Transaminases
Two structurally homologous genes Vf- ω TA (
Shin and Kim,
2002; Midelfort et al., 2013 ) and Cv-ω TA with a sequence identity
of 36 and 55% respectively have been extensively studied with
crystals isolated in the apo and holo form co-crystallized wi th
PLP or bound to a suicide inhibitor such as gabaculine ( Sayer
et al., 2013 ). Superposition of Pp-SpuC structure with the Cv-
ω TA apo monomer (PDB id: 4A6U) ( Humble et al., 2012 ), in
which the authors also experienced diﬃculties obtaining cry stals
with PLP bound, gave an root mean square deviation (RMSD)
value of 1.5 Å between 376 C α atoms of aligned residues (out of
389) with the same “roof” residues missing in the apo structur e
of Cv-ω TA. The disordered region may indicate why no electron
density is observed for the PLP cofactor at the interface of t he
two enzyme subunits. A structure-based sequence alignment
of closely related ω -TAs was constructed with Pp-SpuC as a
template, revealing several important characteristics for t hese
industrially relevant enzymes for the production of chiral a mines
(Figure S1, Supplementary Information). Similar to other Class
III transaminases of fold type I, the active site of ω -TAs contain
two binding pockets for binding of the substrates ( Figure 8). The
active key amino acid residues which constitute the small bin ding
pocket and allow accommodation of substituents less bulky tha n
an ethyl group are identiﬁed in Pp-SpuC as Phe23, Phe89
′
(from
the other subunit), Tyr154 and His155 (absent in the Pp-SpuC
apo structure). A clear observation of these residues acting as
a steric barrier narrowing the entrance to the active site ca vity
(
Malik et al., 2012 ) is the decrease in amino donor speciﬁcities
from (S)-methylbenzylamine to ( S)-ethylbenzylamine which was
also observed in Vf- ω TA (Nobili et al., 2015 ) and Ochrobactrum
anthropi Oa-ω TA ( Han et al., 2015 ). Several previous studies
have mutated the corresponding Trp61 in homologous ω TA

sequences resulting in improved activities toward aromatic and
aliphatic amines without compromising enantioselectivity ( Cho
et al., 2008; Cassimjee et al., 2012 ). On the other hand, the
highly conserved amino acid residues which surround the lar ge
hydrophobic binding pocket were identiﬁed as Leu60, Trp61,
Ala232, Ile263, and Arg415 which has dual recognition for
hydrophobic substituents and a carboxylate group (
Hirotsu et al.,
2005). This was shown to be in general agreement with previous
studies of ω -TAs with high aﬃnity for acetophenone derivatives
as well as aliphatic methyl ketones and aldehydes ( Kaulmann
et al., 2007; Cerioli et al., 2015 ).
Biocatalytic Synthesis of Benzylamines
Derivatives
A plethora of ω -transaminases have been reported to aminate
acetophenone derivatives and bulkier ketones. There have
been recent reports on the use cinnamaldehyde derivatives as
amine acceptor molecules using ω -transaminases from Cv- ω TA,
Vf-ω TA, and isolated transaminase genes from metagenomic
samples furnishing modest yields of the allylic amines (
Baud
et al., 2017 ). To our surprise, only a few have been described
on the acceptance of benzylic aldehydes ( Cerioli et al., 2015;
Guidi et al., 2018 ). In one of the reports, the benzaldehydes were
generated by biocatalytic oxidation of the corresponding be nzylic
alcohols, followed by transamination to the corresponding
benzylamines (
Fuchs et al., 2012 ). Interestingly, within the panel
of ω -transaminases investigated, signiﬁcant diﬀerences in the

amination of benzaldehyde and analogs could be observed,
transamination biocatalysts with a broad substrate tolera nce
toward this class of compounds are rare. Moreover, an addition al
cofactor recycling system in the presence of a sacriﬁcial
cosubstrate was essential to drive the equilibrium to comple tion.
Since Pp-SpuC was already demonstrated to have high activity
with a variety of prochiral ketones (
Slabu et al., 2018 ), we
envisaged to investigate the amination of a range of benzald ehyde
analogs bearing halogen substituents ( 1a-6a), electron-donating
groups ( 7a-12a), electron-withdrawing groups ( 13a-18a) and
heteroatoms in the ring ( 19a-24a). Considering the importance
of non-natural amino acids, we also investigated aromatic
aldehydes and ketones that lead to pharmaceutically relevan t
examples of this class of compounds ( 25a-30a). All compounds
were screened using either a large excess of isopropylamine as
a donor ( Figure 9A) or only a moderate excess of cadaverine, a
biogenic amine donor that favors reaction equilibria by cyc lising
spontaneously to 1-piperideine after transamination ( Figure 9B).
Mono- and dihalogenated benzaldehydes 1a-6a aﬀorded
excellent conversions to the halogenated benzylamines 1b-6b
using isopropylamine as the amine donor within 18 h (in the
preliminary screening, substrate 1a was converted quantitatively
in <30 min with both amine donors). Interestingly, a decrease
in conversions was observed using para-ﬂuorinated substrates
2a-3a with cadaverine as the amine donor. We previously
observed a similar low conversion with a para-substituted
ﬂuoroacetophenone derivative (
Galman et al., 2017 ) which
is presumably ascribed to the interaction between the
piperideine monomer from the transamination of cadaverine
and the activated para-ﬂuoro substrates. Encouraged by
these results, other benzylic derivatives were tested to as sess
the stereoelectronic eﬀects of electron-donating (methoxy,
methylenedioxy), or electron-withdrawing (nitro, cyano,

(19a-20a), furan ( 21a), thiophene ( 22a), indoline ( 23a), and
quinoline (24a) moieties.
In addition, we attempted to carry out the biocatalytic
synthesis of benzylamines carrying the carboxylic acid
functionality from the transamination of formylbenzoic
acid derivatives ( 25a-26a). The para-substituted compound
was readily accepted to produce the corresponding amine
25b with excellent conversion, while the ortho-derivative
gave considerably lower conversions to 26b (23 and 60%,
respectively), indicating the presence of a carboxylic acid
substituent at the ortho-position can have a detrimental eﬀect on
the reactivity. This facile approach to generate 25b, which is used
as an antiﬁbrinolytic agent, provides a sustainable alterna tive
to other reductive amination protocols requiring toxic meta l
catalysts and harsh reaction conditions (
Yraola et al., 2006 ).
Prochiral acetylbenzoic acids 27a and 28a are considerably more
challenging due to the presence of the methylketone moiety.
Indeed only moderate conversions to 27b (41%) and 28b (59%)
could be achieved. This can be rationalized by looking at the
active site shape in the crystal structure of Pp-SpuC, which
provides an insight into the substrate scope of the enzyme: the

hydrophobic environment of the large pocket can accommodate
large aromatic groups, presumably by stabilization from π -π
stacking interactions, while the smaller pocket imposes a ste ric
constraint on the other substituent of the carbonyl group an d
might hinder access to larger substituents. This explains wh y
almost any aromatic aldehyde derivative is accepted easily, while
the range of methyl (and higher) ketones is very limited, lim iting
the biocatalytic synthesis of chiral amines and is conﬁgure d to
accept aromatic aldehydes readily. Lastly, we screened hete roaryl
oxoacid derivatives 29a and 30a. Unsurprisingly, 29a aﬀorded
lower conversions (20 and 8%, respectively), presumably for
the same reasons discussed above, while 30a was converted
completely, indicating that the presence of a carboxylic acid
substituent does not have a detrimental eﬀect on the reactivi ty of
these heteroaromatic substrates.
CONCLUSION
In summary, we have performed the biochemical
characterization of putrescine transaminase Pp-SpuC which
reveals a high relative activity at 60 ◦C and excellent stability
in 50 mM Tris-HCl at pH 8.0. The enzyme structure was
obtained, showing a high degree of similarity to the apo
form of Cv- ω TA (PDB id: 4A6U) which can accommodate
large aromatic substrates for catalysis. We recognized the
important dual substrate recognition of Pp-SpuC, accepting
cadaverine or isopropylamine as the equilibrium shifting ami ne
donor, and having excellent activity against a broad range o f
aromatic aldehyde derivatives bearing various electron-d onating
and electron-withdrawing substituents, as well as diﬀerent
heteroatoms in the ring, with excellent conversions. This m ethod
also eliminates the need for an expensive cofactor recycling
system making this approach to important amine scaﬀolds
greener and more economically feasible.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
General Methods
All commercially available reagents, analytical standards , and
solvents were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich, Alfa Aesar, or
Fluorochem and used without further puriﬁcation. Escherichia
coli DH5α and BL21 (DE3) cells were purchased from New
England Biolabs (Ipswich, MA, USA). Expression vector pET-28b
was purchased from Novagen (Darmstadt, Germany) and was
used for gene expression. P. putida NBRC 14161 (Asc no. 9494)
was purchased from the NCIMB culture collection (Aberdeen,
UK). The putrescine transaminase spuC from P. putida was
cloned in a pET-28b vector containing an N-terminal His 6-tag
and was recombinantly overexpressed in E. coli BL21 (DE3) cells
according to a previously published procedure (
Galman et al.,
2017) with slight modiﬁcations.
Protein Expression and Puriﬁcation
Plasmid pET28b-SpuC was transformed into E. coli BL21
(DE3). A fresh colony was used to inoculate LB medium
(4 mL) containing kanamycin (50 µ g mL −1). This freshly
prepared overnight culture was grown at 220 rpm at 37 ◦C,
and was used to inoculate 500 mL of LB medium supplemented
with kanamycin (50 µ g mL −1) in a 2 L Erlenmeyer ﬂask
at 220 rpm at 37 ◦C. The recombinant protein expression
was induced by adding isopropyl- β -D-1-thiogalactopyranoside
(IPTG) (0.2 mM, ﬁnal) when OD 600 reached 0.6–0.8. The cell
cultures were then incubated at 18 ◦C for 16 h. The cells were
harvested by centrifugation at 4 ◦C (3,250 g, 20 min) and were
resuspended (1g in 10 mL) in lysis buﬀer (50 mM Tris-HCl,
5 mM imidazole, pH 7.0) and lysed in an iced bath by ultra-
sonication by Soniprep 150 (20 s on, 20 s oﬀ, for 20 cycles, at
30% amplitude). After centrifugation (4 ◦C, 16,000 g, 20 min)
the clariﬁed lysate was used for protein puriﬁcation via a Ni-
NTA agarose column. The bound enzyme was washed with
20 mL wash buﬀer (50 mM Tris-HCl, 30 mM imidazole pH
7.0), and eluted with 50 mM Tris-HCl, 250 mM imidazole
at pH 7.0. The collected fractions were concentrated in
VivaspinTM ﬁlter spin membrane columns (10,000 MWCO). The
puriﬁed enzyme was buﬀer exchanged using PD-10 desalting
columns using 50 mM Tris-HCl containing 1 mM PLP at
pH 9.0. The purity was analyzed by SDS/PAGE and the
protein was more than 95% pure and the protein stock was

as standard.
Biotransformations and LC-MS Analysis
Unless otherwise speciﬁed, all biotransformation were perfor med
in 2 mL Eppendorf tubes, at 30 ◦C in biotransformation buﬀer:
Tris-HCl (50 mM) containing PLP (1 mM), pH 9.0. To the
addition of amine donor, cadaverine (25 mM), or isopropylamine
(250 mM) in biotransformation buﬀer adjusted to pH 9.0 and
carbonyl substrate (5 mM, from a 500 mM stock solution in
DMSO), was added puriﬁed Pp-SpuC (2 mg mL −1, puriﬁed
as described above) in a ﬁnal volume of 0.5 mL. After 18 h,
the reaction mixture was quenched by adding aqueous NaOH
solution (100 µ L, 2 M).
The residual activities of the enzyme after incubating at 50
and 60 ◦C at the allotted time was determined by the generation
of acetophenone from ( S)-methylbenzylamine with pyruvate as
the amine acceptor substrate molecule (
Schätzle et al., 2009 ). The
absorbance was measured at 300 nm using a UV transparent 96-
well plate (Tecan inﬁnite M200 spectrophotometer, Austria). On e
unit of enzyme activity (U) was deﬁned as the amount of enzyme
required to produce 1 µ mole of acetophenone produced per min.
The deactivation rate constant k d was determined from the slope
and the half-lives were calculated as t 1/ 2 = ln2/kd.
The eﬀect of pH on enzyme stability was carried at various
pH buﬀers from pH 4.0–10.5. The enzyme (2 mg mL −1) was
incubated for 24 h at 4 ◦C in diﬀerent buﬀers containing 1 mM
PLP: sodium acetate (pH 4.0–6.0), sodium phosphate (pH 6.0–
8.0), Tris-HCl (pH 7.0–9.0), and sodium carbonate/bicarbon ate
(pH 9.2–10.0). The residual activity was assayed from the
biotransformations as described above.
The eﬀect of solvent stability was performed using a variety of
diﬀerent co-solvents (DMSO, MeOH, MeCN, DMF, and THF)
at diﬀerent solvent concentrations % (v/v) using 5 mM of 1a,
and 2 mg mL −1 of puriﬁed Pp-SpuC, 1 mM PLP , and 250 mM
isopropylamine at pH 9.0.
Conversions were calculated by HPLC analysis on an Agilent
1,100 Series system equipped with a quaternary pump, a
HiChrom ACE 5 C18-AR column (15cm × 4.6 mm), a diode
UV array detector and an Agilent LC/MSD SL LCMS System.
Separation conditions: 1 mL min −1 ﬂowrate, mobile phases:
H2O + 0.1% v/v TFA, MeOH + 0.1% v/v TFA. Gradient: 95:5
for 4 min, to 0:100 over 25 min. Temperature: 30 ◦C. Detection
wavelength: 210 nm. Injection volume: 10 µ L. Compounds
were ionized using API-electrospray technique and detected in
positive mode on the LCMS System. Drying gas temperature
250◦C at 12 L min −1, and nebulizer pressure at 25 psig. All
products, unless otherwise speciﬁed, were identiﬁed by their
[M+H]+ signal and conﬁrmed via chemical standards.
Crystallization and Structure
Determination
C-terminal His-tagged Pp-SpuC puriﬁed by aﬃnity
chromatography as described above was exchanged to 20 mM
HEPES buﬀer pH 7.5 and submitted to an additional step of
ion-exchange puriﬁcation on a ResourceQ column (6 mL, GE
healthcare), to further purify the protein for crystallogene sis.
Pp-SpuC was loaded on the column in 20 mM HEPES pH
7.5 buﬀer and elution was performed with a linear gradient
(25 column volumes) of NaCl in buﬀer. All the fractions were
analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Fractions containing Pp-SpuC were
pooled and concentrated in a Vivaspin TM ﬁlter spin membrane
columns (10,000 MWCO).
Apo and PLP (equimolar) mixed protein was screened against
commercially available crystallogenesis screens using a mo squito
nanodispenser robot (LLP Biotech). Overnight crystals appeare d
in a number of conditions at 20 ◦C. The best diﬀracting crystals
were obtained in 0.2 M MgCl 2, 0.1 M Bis-Tris pH 6.5, 25%
PEG3350. SpuC crystals cryoprotected with 10–20% PEG200 in
mother liquor before freezing. Data was collected from sing le
crystal at IO4 beamline at the Diamond Light Source Syncrotr on
(UK). Data was indexed and integrated with XDS (
Kabsch,
2010) and scaled with AIMLESS ( Evans and Murshudov, 2013 ).
Data processing and reﬁnement statistics are summarized in
Table 1.
The structure of Pp- SpuC was solved using molecular
replacement method by Phaser (
Eliot and Kirsch, 2004 ). Crystal
structure of Pse- ω TA (PDB id: 5TI8, sequence identity 77%)
was used as a phasing model. Iterative cycles of manual
building in COOT (
Emsley et al., 2010 ) and reﬁnement in
Phenix.reﬁne ( Murshudov et al., 1997; Eliot and Kirsch, 2004 )
were carried out to complete the model. Validation of structur e
was done with Molprobity ( Chen et al., 2010 ) and PDB-
redo ( Joosten et al., 2014 ) were integrated into the iterative
building and reﬁnement procedure. The ﬁnal reﬁned structure
of Pp-SpuC has been deposited in the PDB database (PDB id:
6HX9).
