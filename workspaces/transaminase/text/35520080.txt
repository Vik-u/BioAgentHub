*
Biocatalytic transamination is widely used in industrial production of chiral chemicals. Here, we constructed
a novel multi-enzyme system to promote the conversion of the amination reaction. Firstly, we constructed
the ArR-uTA/TdcE/FDH/LDH multi-enzyme system, by combination of ( R)-selective u-transaminase
derived from Arthrobacter sp. (ArR-uTA), formate dehydrogenase (FDH) derived fromCandida boidinii,
formate acetyltransferase (TdcE) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) derived fromE. coli MG1655. This
multi-enzyme system was used to eﬃciently remove the by-product pyruvate by TdcE and LDH to
facilitate the transamination reaction. The TdcE/FDH pathway was found to dominate the by-product
pyruvate removal in the transamination reaction. Secondly, we optimized the reaction conditions,
including
D-alanine, DMSO, and pyridoxal phosphate (PLP) with diﬀerent concentration of 2-pentanone
(as a model substrate). Thirdly, by using the ArR-uTA/TdcE/FDH/LDH system, the conversions of 2-
pentanone, 4-phenyl-2-butanone and cyclohexanone were 84.5%, 98.2% and 79.3%, respectively.
1. Introduction
Chiral amines are a class of compounds containing amino
groups in the chiral center of small molecule compounds. They
are widely used in pharmaceutical and agriculturalelds, such
as neurological, cardiovascular, antihypertensive, anti-infective
drugs, and vaccines, which play an important role in the
national economy.
1–5 At present, the main methods for the
preparation of chiral amines6–9 are chemical synthesis, biolog-
ical resolution and biological asymmetric synthesis. Chiral
amines synthesized by chemical methods have many short-
comings, such as the need to use expensive metal catalysts, high
production costs, low enantioselectivity, and environmental
pollution.
10–14 The maximum theoretical conversion of chiral
amine prepared by biological resolution is only 50%.15 Thus,
chemical methods and biological resolution cannot meet the
needs of industrial production. Biological asymmetric synthesis
method becomes the preferred strategy for the production of
chiral amines because of its theoretical conversion of up to
100%.
16–19 Therefore, the synthesis of chiral amines by biolog-
ical asymmetric synthesis has been of increasing interest.
u-Transaminases (u-TAs) are pyridoxal phosphate (PLP)
dependent enzymes that could be used for the synthesis of
chiral amines.
20–23 Since the transamination reaction catalysed
by u-TA is a reversible reaction, there are two methods to make
the reaction proceed in the direction of chiral amines. One of
them is employing excess amino donors in a single enzyme
catalytic system to drive the transamination reaction and push
the reaction toward the synthesis of chiral amines as much as
possible;
24 the other is eliminating the substrate ( i.e., by-
product) inhibition through a multi-enzyme coupled catalytic
reaction, thereby proceeding the reaction toward chiral amine
synthesis.
25,26 Therefore, eﬀective removal of the by-product,
pyruvate, is a key factor in the development of an eﬃcient
asymmetric amination system. 27–29 Several approaches to
remove pyruvate were reported to improve the conversion of
ketones to amines.
29 Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) along with
u-TA was used to convert pyruvate to lactate in transamination
reactions.30 Glucose dehydrogenase (GDH) was introduced in
the u-TA/LDH system to recycle the cofactor NADH.31 Thus, the
u-TA/LDH/GDH system has been used for conventional asym-
metric reductive amination and synthesized a series of valuable
amines.
31–33 However, the conversion rate of asymmetric amines
obtained with the (R)-selective u-transaminase derived from
Arthrobacter sp. (ArR-uTA)/LDH/GDH system remained low.
Therefore, the conversion rate of amines from the correspond-
ing ketones needs further improvement.
Here, we developed a novel system to enhance the conver-
sion of ketones to amines. Firstly, we overexpressed four
formate acetyltransferases ( i.e., Ybiw, PB, PD and TdcE)
derived from Escherichia coli MG1655 to convert pyruvate to
formate, and we found TdcE had the highest specic activity.
Formate dehydrogenase (FDH) was introduced to decompose
formate and produce NADH. LDH was introduced to recycle
NADH and remove pyruvate. Thus, the ArR-uTA/TdcE/FDH/
LDH system was constructed for transamination reaction

(Fig. 1A). The substrates and products for the transamination
reaction in this study were shown in Fig. 1B and C, respectively.
Secondly, we optimized the reaction conditions, includingD-
alanine, DMSO, and PLP with diﬀerent concentration of 2-
pentanone (as a model substrate) to increase the conversion of
ketones to amines. Thirdly, the conversions of 2-pentanone, 4-
phenyl-2-butanone and cyclohexanone by using the ArR-uTA/
TdcE/FDH/LDH system were 84.5%, 98.2% and 79.3%, respec-
tively. Besides, the pyruvate to formate pathway (i.e. TdcE/FDH)
dominates the by-product pyruvate removal in the trans-
amination reaction. This work demonstrated that the ArR-uTA/
TdcE/FDH/LDH system could e ﬀectively convert ketones to
amines.
2. Materials and methods

FDH is from Candida boidinii (Sigma). (R)-Selective u-trans-
aminase derived from Arthrobacter sp. (NCBI GenBank:
BAK39753.1) was identi ed from NCBI. Its amino acid
sequences were optimized in theE. coli strain BL21 (DE3) in
JCAT, and the restriction sites of NdeI, SpeI, HindIII and XbaI
were avoided in the optimal sequence. Thegdh gene (NCBI Gene
ID: 938377) originated fromBacillus subtiliswas obtained in the
same way as thearR-uTA gene. ThearR-uTA gene andgdh gene
were in vitrosynthesized. Theybiw (NCBI Gene ID: 945444),pB
(NCBI Gene ID: 945514), pD (NCBI Gene ID: 948454), tdcE
(NCBI Gene ID: 947623) andldh (NCBI GenBank: APQ21713.1)
were amplied from the genomic DNA of theE. coli MG1655
through PCR with primers. The gene of green uorescent
protein (GFP) was from our research lab. Tables S1 and S2† list

research, respectively.
ArR-uTA, Ybiw, PB, PD, TdcE, LDH and GFP were con-
structed in the p2A4 vector containing pBR322 origin. GDH and
GFP were constructed in the p3C5 vector containing p15A
origin. All genes were inserted into vectors by biobrick. All the
plasmids utilized in this research are shown in Table 1.E. coli
BL21 (DE3) was utilized for gene expression. Fig. 2A shows
schematic of plasmids used in this research.
2.2 Gene expression in E. coli
The transformed strains were cultured in LB liquid medium
containing appropriate antibiotics (100 mg ampicillin per L or
34 mg chloramphenicol per L), and cultivation for overnight at
37

fresh Terric Broth medium containing 1% (w/v) glucose and
appropriate antibiotics, and they were incubated at 37/C14 C. When
the optical density at 600 nm (OD600) reached approximately
0.6, the temperature was decreased to 25/C14 C with shaking at
200 rpm. Then, anal concentration of 1 mM isopropyl-b-D-
thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG), 10 mM aTc or 1 mML-arabinose
was added, and cells were cultured at 25/C14 C for 16 h.
2.3 Representative example for amination
Cells containing ArR-uTA, TdcE, LDH or GDH were collected by
centrifugation at 6000 rpm for 10 min at 4/C14 C, respectively.
Then, cells were suspended in PBS buﬀer (100 mM, pH 7.5) for
the standardization of samples (OD600 ¼120) and lysed through
sonication over ice for 30 min with 5 s pulses at 10 s intervals.
Cells lysates were regarded as crude products. All reactions were

3. Results and discussion
3.1 Overexpression and analysis of formate
acetyltransferases
Pyruvate can be catalysed to produce lactate and formate inE.
coli. Formate acetyltransferase, also known as pyruvate formate
lyase, is an enzyme to transform pyruvate into formate. There
are four formate acetyltransferases derived fromE. coliMG1655
(i.e., Ybiw, PB, PD and TdcE) catalysing the reaction from
pyruvate to formate. In this study, we constructed plasmids for
these four genes (Fig. 2A) and conrmed their soluble expres-
sion (Fig. 2B). The catalytic activity of four formate acetyl-
transferases were compared through the formation of formate.
Considering the reversible reaction between pyruvate and
formate, FDH was introduced to decompose formate and
produce NADH (Fig. 2D). Thus, we tested these four enzymes
activities by determining the concentration of NADH at OD
340.
We demonstrated that the overexpression of TdcE enabled the
highest specic activity (299.3 U mg
/C0 1 puried protein) in
comparison to the other three formate acetyltransferases
(Fig. 2E). Therefore, TdcE was selected as the enzyme to catalyse
the reaction from pyruvate to formate for subsequent experi-
ments. Furthermore, TdcE/FDH was regarded as the formate
pathway to remove pyruvate. Considering the recycle of co-
factor NADH, LDH was introduced to recover NAD
+.I n

addition, LDH was regarded as the lactate pathway to remove
pyruvate. Thus, a novel multi-enzyme system, i.e., the u-TA/
TdcE/FDH/LDH system, was established for transamination
reaction (Fig. 1A).
In order to determine the expression level of promoters, we
constructed four inducible promoters (i.e.,P
T7,P lac,P tet,P bad)t o
drive the expression of gfp gene, respectively (Fig. S4†). The
expression levels of TdcE, LDH and GDH should be similar,
thus avoiding the eﬀect of enzyme dosages on the experimental
results. The results showed that the GFP/OD
600 values of Plac,
Ptet and Pbad were all about 20 000, when the inducer concen-
trations were 1 mM IPTG, 10 mM aTc and 1 mML-arabinose,
respectively. Therefore, 1 mM IPTG, 10 mM aTc and 1 mML-
arabinose were selected for further studies. The soluble frac-
tions of cells containing ArR-uTA, LDH or GDH were analysed
by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 2C).
3.2 Optimization of the condition of transamination
reaction
Reaction condition is a key factor in the transamination reac-
tion. We investigated the eﬀects of
D-alanine, DMSO, substrate
concentration and PLP on the conversion of ketones to amines.
2-Pentanone was used as a model substrate in the optimization
of reaction conditions.
The conversion was improved with the concentration ofD-
alanine increasing from 50 mM to 250 mM; however, there was
a slight increase in conversion when the concentration of
D-
alanine was more than 250 mM (Fig. 3A). The conversion could
increase up to 60.2% at 250 mM
D-alanine. Thus, 250 mMD-
alanine was selected for further experiments. When the DMSO
concentration increased from 0 to 30% (v/v), the conversion was
also enhanced. While the conversion decreases when the DMSO
concentration was over 30% (v/v). Optimization of the DMSO
concentration led to 70.6% conversion at 30% (v/v) DMSO
(Fig. 3B). It is noted that the conversion was decreased with the
concentration of substrate increases at 30% (v/v) DMSO and
250 mM
D-alanine concentration (Fig. 3C). The conversion
reached 79.3% at 25 mM substrate concentration. The conver-
sion of ketone to amine was increased when more PLP was
added, while the concentration of PLP has minor positive
impact on the conversion at the PLP concentration above
1.5 mM (Fig. 3D). Upon optimization of reaction conditions, the
conversion of 2-pentanone to pentan-2-amine reached 84.5%.
Thus, subsequent experiments were performed at 250 mM
D-
alanine, 30% (v/v) DMSO, 25 mM substrate and 1.5 mM PLP.
3.3 Analysis the asymmetric amination of the ArR-uTA/
TdcE/FDH/LDH system
Three substrates (i.e., 2-pentanone, 4-phenyl-2-butanone and
cyclohexanone) were examined to compare the conversion of
ketones to amines obtained with both the ArR-uTA/TdcE/FDH/
LDH system and the ArR-uTA/LDH/GDH system. By using the
ArR-uTA/TdcE/FDH/LDH system, the conversion of 2-penta-
none to pentan-2-amine was increased from 75.1% (by the ArR-
uTA/LDH/GDH system) to 84.5%, the conversion of 4-phenyl-2-
butanone to 4-phenylbutan-2-amine was increased from 74.9%
to 98.2%, and the conversion of cyclohexanone to cyclohexyl-
amine was increased from 55.8% to 79.3%, respectively
(Fig. 4A). Besides, the conversion of 2-pentanone to pentan-2-
amine and the conversion of 4-phenyl-2-butanone to 4-
phenylbutan-2-amine with the ArR-uTA/LDH/GDH system re-
ported in the literature were only 67% and 82%, respectively.

The enantiomeric excess of reaction products was shown in
Table 2. It is remarkable that the ArR- uTA/TdcE/FDH/LDH
system could eﬃciently synthesize chiral amines. Moreover,
the ArR- uTA/TdcE/FDH/LDH system does not need to be
provided with co-substrate (i.e., glucose).
2-Pentanone was used as a model substrate to compare the
conversion of these two systems at diﬀerent reaction times. The
conversion with the ArR-uTA/TdcE/FDH/LDH system reached
the maximum value within 4 to 8 h, while the conversion with
the ArR-uTA/LDH/GDH system reached the maximum value
within 8 to 12 h (Fig. 4B). Compared with the ArR-uTA/LDH/
GDH system, the ArR- uTA/TdcE/FDH/LDH system led to
a shorter reaction time and a higher conversion. The ArR-uTA/
TdcE/FDH/LDH system has two enzymes, TdcE and LDH, to
remove the by-product pyruvate, thereby shiing the equilib-
rium toward amine synthesis. Furthermore, FDH and LDH in
the ArR-uTA/TdcE/FDH/LDH system could not only recycle the
redox cofactor (i.e., NAD
+ and NADH), but also promote the
removal of pyruvate by decomposing formate.
De-acetylation of pyruvate to formate catalysed by TdcE was

the feasibility of ArR-uTA/TdcE/FDH/LDH cascade. Acetyl-CoA
reacted with oxaloacetate to give CoA and citrate in the tricar-
boxylic acid cycle. The crude enzyme preparations contained
GltA (citrate synthase) that catalysed this reaction, thereby
regenerating CoA from acetyl-CoA. We also performed experi-
ments on varied concentrations of CoA in the ArR-uTA/TdcE/
FDH/LDH system, in which 2-pentanone was used as a model
substrate, as shown in Fig. 3E. The results showed that the
conversion of 2-pentanone to pentan-2-amine barely increased
when the concentration of CoA was more than 0.1 mM. It
proved that 0.1 mM CoA was suﬃcient, and the regeneration of
CoA from acetyl CoA was feasible in the ArR-uTA/TdcE/FDH/
LDH system.
In order to investigate which of the two pyruvate removal
pathways dominates, three substrates were tested to compare
the conversion of ketones to amines obtained with the ArR-uTA/
LDH system and the ArR-uTA/TdcE/FDH system. 1 mM NADH
was added to the ArR-uTA/LDH system, and 1 mM NAD
+ was
added to the ArR-uTA/TdcE/FDH system. Under the ArR-uTA/
TdcE/FDH system, the conversions of 2-pentanone, 4-phenyl-
2-butanone and cyclohexanone were 76.3%, 89.6% and 62.7%,
respectively. However, the conversions of 2-pentanone, 4-
phenyl-2-butanone and cyclohexanonevia using the ArR-uTA/
LDH system were 49.9%, 71.5% and 47.4%, respectively
(Fig. 4C). The experimental results showed that the ArR-uTA/
TdcE/FDH system led to a higher conversion of ketones to
amines than that of the ArR-uTA/LDH system. Furthermore, it
illustrated that the formate pathway (i.e. TdcE/FDH) dominates
the by-product pyruvate removal in the transamination
reaction.
4. Conclusions
We compared speci c activities of four formate acetyl-
transferases and constructed a novel system by combination of
ArR-uTA, TdcE, FDH and LDH. Optimization of reaction
conditions of
D-alanine, DMSO, substrate concentration and
PLP further increased the conversion of ketones to amines. By
using the ArR-uTA/TdcE/FDH/LDH system, the conversions of
2-pentanone, 4-phenyl-2-butanone and cyclohexanone were
84.5%, 98.2% and 79.3%, respectively. Moreover, we found that
the by-product pyruvate removal in the transamination reaction
was dominated by the pyruvate to formate pathway (i.e. TdcE/
FDH). The ArR-uTA/TdcE/FDH/LDH system was suitable for
multiple types of substrates, such as aromatic substrates (e.g.,4 -
phenyl-2-butanone), aliphatic substrates (e.g., 2-pentanone) and
alicyclic substrates (e.g., cyclohexanone). In conclusion, the ArR-
uTA/TdcE/FDH/LDH system was conrmed to be an eﬃcient
system for the removal of pyruvate, thus facilitating the
conversion of transamination reaction.
There is too an increase in the complexity so there are more
enzymes involved than that for reported system (i.e., ArR-uTA/
LDH/GDH three enzymes' system). However, the four enzymes
in our system ( i.e., ArR-uTA/TdcE/FDH/LDH four enzymes'
system) could be co-expressed in one engineered strain ofE.
coli, which makes the enzymes synthesis and separation rela-
tively cheap. Therefore, there is a negligible increase in the
enzymes production cost in our system compared with the re-
ported system. In addition, the conversion with our system
reached maximum within 4 to 8 h, while the conversion with the
reported system reached maximum within 8 to 12 h. Compared
with the reported system, our system led to a shorter reaction
time and /C24 20% increase in the conversion. Thus, our system
has advantages in the production cost.
