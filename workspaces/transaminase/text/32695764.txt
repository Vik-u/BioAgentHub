For the multimeric enzymes R- ω-transaminase (RTA), alanine dehydrogenase (AlaDH),
and formate dehydrogenase (FDH), peptide bond formation between the hetrosubunits
has been achieved by the intein-mediatedin vivosubunit splicing. The subunit ligation is
triggered by the heterodimerization of an arginine rich leucine zipper motif with a glutamic
acid rich leucine zipper motif. The one-by-one ligation of hetrosubunits constructs
the pairing enzymes RTA&AlaDH and AlaDH&FDH. The ligation modes were analyzed
based on blue native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (BN-PAGE). The spectra of
circular dichroism (CD), ﬂuorescence, and two-dimensional FTIR provide information
on the secondary structures and stability of the pairing enzymes. The enzyme-
substrate interaction was analyzed based on microscale thermophoresis analysis. In
contrast to the mixed three enzymes RTA +AlaDH +FDH, the ligated enzymes
RTA&AlaDH +AlaDH&FDH exhibited a much larger substrate afﬁnity, higher stability,
and signiﬁcantly enhanced activity.

INTRODUCTION
Chiral amines are used for the synthesis of pharmaceuticals (Hannes et al., 2014; Simon et al.,
2014). The optically pure amines have been used for the synthesis of biologically active compounds
(Koszelewski et al., 2009). ω-Transaminases ( ω-TAs) are multimeric enzymes and have been
investigated for preparation of chiral amines (Han et al., 2019; Rocha et al., 2019; Isupov et al., 2019;
Liao et al., 2019). ω-Transaminases are eﬃcient biocatalysts for reductive amination of ketones to
corresponding amines (Kelly et al., 2018; Padrosa et al., 2019). Alanine is commonly used as amine
donor and the coproduct is pyruvate (Pressnitz et al., 2013). However, equilibrium is unfavored

Li et al. Peptide Bond Formation Between the Hetrosubunits
for the reductive amination. For circumventing this issue, ω-
TAs have been combined with various enzymes to establish
multienzyme networks for removing the coproduct, combining
with lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) to convert pyruvate into lactic
acid, incorporating pyruvate decarboxylase (PDC) to convert
pyruvate to acetaldehyde and CO 2 (Shin and Kim, 1999; Hohne
et al., 2008). 2-Propanamine was also used as a cheap and
achiral amine donor (Cassimjee et al., 2010). Yeast alcohol
dehydrogenase was used for removing the coproduct acetone to
displace the equilibrium.
Herein, we pay attention to another approach using an alanine
dehydrogenase (AlaDH) to cooperate with R-ω-transaminase
(RTA). In this approach, alanine is used as amine donor. The
coproduct pyruvate is recycled back to alanine by consuming
ammonia and formate (Koszelewski et al., 2008) ( Figure 1 ).
Formate dehydrogenase is integrated into the network to recycle
NADH, which is needed for the reductive amination of pyruvate
to alanine. However, we found that for some ketones, like
acetophenone and 2-octanone, the conversions are very low
under the catalysis of the mixed enzymes RTA+AlaDH +FDH.
When these three enzymes are simply mixed together, the
orientation and distance between the enzymes cannot be
controlled. It is speculated that for eﬃcient conversion of
those ketones, the amine donor alanine and coproduct pyruvate
as well as NADH and NAD + must be eﬃciently transferred
between RTA and AlaDH and between AlaDH and FDH,
respectively. The distances between RTA and AlaDH and between
AlaDH and FDH aﬀect the transfer eﬃciency. Ideally, the
enzymes are in close proximity with a molecular distance.
Through gene fusion, two enzymes can be linked together
(Lindbladh et al., 1994). However, for these multimeric enzymes,
gene fusion does not work (exhibiting no activity). It is
possibly because the fusion enzyme cannot fold correctly in the
Escherichia colicell.
Except the above mentioned low catalysis eﬃciency by the
mixed enzymes, there is a signiﬁcant concern for enzyme
stability (Börner et al., 2017; Santos et al., 2018). The enzymes
RTA, AlaDH, and FDH are multimeric enzymes. Experimental
conditions may weaken the subunit-subunit interactions for
multimeric enzymes (Fernandez, 2009). A suﬃcient operational
stability of the enzymes is necessary for high productivity in chiral
amine synthesis.
Previously, we have speciﬁcally ligated two multimeric
enzymes with native peptides through intein-mediated in vivo
subunit splicing (Du et al., 2017; Li et al., 2018). Herein, we
develop the methodology, by using the coiled-coil association
of an arginine-rich leucine zipper motif (Z R) (Moll et al., 2001)
and a glutamic acid-rich leucine zipper motif (Z E) (Moll et al.,
2001) to trigger the intein-mediated in vivo subunit splicing.
RTA is speciﬁcally ligated to AlaDH and AlaDH is speciﬁcally
linked to FDH with peptide bonds. The speciﬁc ligations were
achieved through in vivo subunit splicing. Thus, the cycle of
alanine →pyruvate →alanine between RTA and AlaDH and
the cycle of NADH →NAD+→NADH between AlaDH and
FDH are formed. Evaluation of the three-enzyme system has
been performed in terms of enzyme secondary structure, enzyme
stability, and catalysis eﬃciency.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Materials
DNA ligase, DNA polymerase, and restriction enzymes were
purchased from Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc. Oligonucleotide
primers were synthesized by BioMed Tech. Escherichia colistrain
DH5α used as a host for DNA manipulation and strain BL21
(DE3) as a host for expressing enzymes were both purchased
from Zoman Bio. And all other reagents were purchased from
Sigma-Aldrich (Shanghai, China).
Construction of Plasmids
The alanine dehydrogenase (AlaDH) gene was synthesized based
on the genome sequence of Archaeoglobus fulgidus (EC:1.4.1.1)
(Agren et al., 2008) and cloned in pUC57 plasmid by Genewiz
(Suzhou, China). The AlaDH gene was puriﬁed using a DNA
extraction kit (Omega Bio-tek). The puriﬁed AlaDH gene was
digested with both BamHI and EcoRI restriction endonucleases,
which then was ligated into the plasmid pETDuet-1 cleaved
with BamHI and EcoRI restriction endonucleases already. The
AlaDH gene was ampliﬁed by PCR using the paired primers
AlaDH-fp and AlaDH-rp ( Supplementary Table S1 ), at the
ampliﬁcation conditions ( Supplementary Table S1 ). The Z E-
IntC-link gene was ampliﬁed by PCR using the Z E-IntC-
fp and Z E-IntC-rp primers ( Supplementary Table S1 ). The

Li et al. Peptide Bond Formation Between the Hetrosubunits
puriﬁed Z E-IntC-link gene was digested with NcoI and BamHI
restriction endonucleases, then was ligated into the vector
AlaDH-pETDuet that had been cleaved with NcoI and BamHI
restriction endonucleases. The constructed expression plasmid
was designated as ZE-IntC-link-AlaDH-pETDuet.
The R-ω-transaminase (RTA) gene used here was the
same as that in our previous work (Sun et al., 2018). The
RTA gene was ampliﬁed by PCR using primers RTA-fp
and RTA-rp ( Supplementary Table S1 ). The puriﬁed RTA
gene was digested with both NdeI and KpnI restriction
endonucleases, and then was ligated into the plasmid Z E-
IntC-link-AlaDH-pETDuet, which had been cleaved with
NdeI and KpnI restriction endonucleases. Therefore, the
plasmid Int C-link-AlaDH/RTA-pETDuet in Escherichia coli
was constructed. The gene of link-Int N-ZR was ampliﬁed
by PCR using the Int N-ZR-fp and Int N-ZR-rp primers
(Supplementary Table S1 ). The puriﬁed link-Int N-ZR gene
was digested with both KpnI and XhoI restriction endonucleases,
and then was ligated into the plasmid Z E-IntC-link-AlaDH-
pETDuet, which had been cleaved with KpnI and XhoI
restriction endonucleases. Then plasmid for coexpressing the
precursors RTA-link-Int N-ZR and Z E-IntC-link-AlaDH was
ﬁnally constructed. It is Z E-IntC-link-AlaDH/RTA-link-IntN-
ZR-pETDuet, as illustrated in Supplementary Figure S1a .
The FDH gene (Fogal et al., 2015) was ampliﬁed. The plasmid
for coexpressing the precursors Z E-IntC-link-AlaDH and
FDH-link-IntN-ZR was constructed similarly, designated as
ZE-IntC-link-AlaDH/FDH-link-IntN-ZR-pETDuet as illustrated
in Supplementary Figure S1b.
For the hetrosubunit splicing without using the coiled-
coil association of Z E and Z R to promote the splicing, the
plasmids were constructed using the same procedures as
described above. The plasmid for coexpressing the precursors
RTA-link-IntN and Int C-link-AlaDH was constructed,
designated as Z E-IntC-link-AlaDH/RTA-link-IntN- Z R-
pETDuet, as illustrated in Supplementary Figure S1c .
The plasmid for coexpressing the precursors Int C-link-
AlaDH and FDH-link-Int N was constructed, designated as
IntC-link-AlaDH/FDH-link-IntN-pETDuet as illustrated in
Supplementary Figure S1d.
Enzyme Expression and in vivo
Subunit Splicing
The genes were transferred into Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3)
cells. The cells were cultured in Luria-Bertani medium (50 µg/ml
ampicillin) under shaking (220 rpm) at 37◦C for 3 h. At this time,
the OD600 reached about 0.4, and the cells grew at exponential
phase. Then the cells were induced with 0.5 mM isopropyl β-
D-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG), and the culture temperature
was changed to 25◦C. At this temperature the cells grew for 8, 12,
and 16 h, respectively. During the co-expression of the precursors
ZE-IntC-link-RTA and AlaDH-link-IntN-ZR, the in vivosubunit
splicing occurred simultaneously. Both SDS-PAGE and blue
native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (BN-PAGE) were used
to monitor and analyze the crude proteins released from the cells.
It was found that 8 h is enough for the cell growth to accomplish
the in vivosubunit splicing, determined by observing the bands
for the splicing products.
The E. coli cells were collected after 30 min centrifugation
at 7000 g at 4 ◦C. The cells were then disrupted under
ultrasonication on ice. The cell debris was removed by
centrifugation at 7,000 g at 4◦C for 30 min. The supernatant was
collected into a fresh tube. The enzymes were ﬁrst puriﬁed by
passing through a chromatography column (GE Life Sciences)
ﬁlled with Ni Sepharose beads (GE Life Sciences). Five hundred
mM imidazole was used as the elution liquid, which was
separated from the puriﬁed enzymes by dialysis into a buﬀer
(500 mM NaCl, 50 mM Tris-Cl pH 7.5, 1 mM EDTA). The
puriﬁed enzymes were further fractionated by ultraﬁltration
(GE Healthcare, 50000 Da cut oﬀ). The splicing products were
ﬁnally puriﬁed using a gel ﬁltration chromatography (AKTA Pure
chromatography system, GE Healthcare, Superose 6 column).
Microscale Thermophoresis (MST)
The experiments were performed on an instrument of microscale
thermophoresis (MST) (Nano Temper technologies). The
splicing product RTA&AlaDH was not labeled by ﬂuorescence.
The dialysis liquid consisted of 50 mM Tris-Cl (PH 8.0), 150 mM
NaCl, and 10 mM MgCl2. After dialysis, RTA&AlaDH (200 nM)
was mixed with the ligand 2-octanone (100 mM), and then
incubated at 30 ◦C for an hour. A 16 step dilution series from
10 mM to 0.25 µM were prepared by DMSO. 10 µL of each
step was ﬁlled into 16 fresh small micro reaction tubes and was
well mixed by pipetting up and down. The measurements were
performed at 20% IR-laser power and 40% MST power. Using
the software MO. Aﬃnity Analysis, the binding coeﬃcient Kd
values were obtained by ﬁtting the fraction of bound protein
to the quadratic solution of the binding reaction equilibrium.
MST beneﬁts from very low sample consumption and short
measurement times.
Attenuated Total Reﬂectance Fourier
Transform Infrared (ATR-FTIR)
FTIR- attenuated total reﬂection (ATR) spectra were recorded
on a spectrometer (Bruker Tensor 27) at a nominal resolution
of 2 cm −1. Each spectrum is the result of the accumulation
and averaging of 512 interferograms. Ultrapure nitrogen was
continuously introduced into the sample compartment to
minimize the spectral contribution of atmospheric water. The
enzyme was dissolved in 10 mM deuterated potassium phosphate
buﬀer (pH 7.4) with a concentration of 15 mg/mL. The enzyme
solution was rapidly prepared at 10 ◦C, thus condensation of
atmospheric water into the solution can be avoided. D 2O
was added into the sample of the enzyme solution, and the
measurement of FTIR spectra was started. The hydrogen-
deuterium exchange experiment was carried out for 90 min.
The pure spectrum of enzyme was obtained by subtracting the
spectra of D2O.
Enzymatic Activity
For transformation of the amines, the enzymatic catalysis was
performed at 30 ◦C under shaking at 200 rpm. The enzyme

concentrations were: 0.5 mg/mL RTA&AlaDH +0.5 mg/mL
AlaDH&FDH; 0.5 mg/mL RTA#AlaDH + 0.5 mg/mL
AlaDH#FDH. The concentration of substrate 2-octanone
was 50 mM. The substrate solution was prepared by dissolving
in phosphate buﬀered solution (mix 100 mM Na 2HPO4 and
100 mM NaH 2PO4 in proportion to pH 8.0), then alanine
(5 mM), pyridoxal-5 ′-phosphate (1 mM), 1 mM NAD +, and
100 mM ammonium formate were added. The reaction volume
was 2 mL. The chromatographic pure methanol and ultra
pure water were respectively ﬁltered by the ﬁlter membrane,
and then the ultrasonic treatment was carried out to exhaust
bubbles for half an hour. The concentration of the substrate
2-octanone was monitored by HPLC (Shimadzu LC-10A) with
ultraviolet detector at 280 nm using a C18 column (Diamonsil
C18 250 ×4.6 mm, 5 µm). Setup column thermostat at 30 ◦C,
and the mobile phase was methanol/water (60:40 by vol) at
0.8 mL/min, and the injected sample was 20 µL.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
In vivoHetrosubunit Splicing
Herein, the split intein was utilized to speciﬁcally ligate
multimeric enzymes for potential industrial application. These
multimeric enzymes have large molecular weights. The ligations
were accomplished through intein-mediated in vivo subunit
splicing, triggered by the coiled-coil association of an arginine-
rich leucine zipper motif (Z R) and a glutamic acid-rich leucine
zipper motif (ZE) (Moll et al., 2001). The developed methodology
was used to ligate the enzymes for constructing three-enzyme
network, as illustrated in Figure 2.
R-ω-Transaminase (RTA) and alanine dehydrogenase
(AlaDH) are dimeric enzymes, each consisting of two subunits.
ZE was fused to the C-terminal domain of the split NpuDnaE
intein (IntC), the ZE-Int C segment was fused to the N-terminus
of the RTA subunit (RTAS), constructing ZE-IntC-RTAS. ZR was
fused to the N-terminal domain of the split NpuDnaE intein
(IntN), the ZR-IntN segment was fused to the C-terminus of the
AlaDH subunit (AlaDH S), constructing ZR-IntN-AlaDHS (Shah
et al., 2011). In between ZR-Int N and AlaDH S and in between
ZE-IntC and RTAS, rigid linkers (EPPPPLPPPPLPPPPEPPPP)
are required, in order to reduce the steric hindrance for the
subunit splicing. Dimerization of ZE and ZR can naturally occur
due to the coiled-coil association between ZE and ZR (Shah
et al., 2011). Herein, the dimerization of ZE and ZR was utilized
to promote the self-excision of Int C and IntN and concomitant
ligation of the subunits of RTA S and AlaDH S. The splicing
product is designated as RTA&AlaDH ( Figure 2A ). Another
splicing product FDH&AlaDH is obtained similarly, as shown
in Figure 2B. Thus, the cycle of alanine →pyruvate →alanine
between RTA and AlaDH and the cycle of NADH →NAD+→
NADH between AlaDH and FDH are formed (Figure 1).
The splicing products RTA&AlaDH and AlaDH&FDH were
puriﬁed sequentially by Ni-Sepharose beads, ultraﬁltration
fractionation, and gel ﬁltration chromatography. They were
analyzed through SDS-PAGE ( Figure 3 ). The band indicated
by the black arrow in Figure 3A is ascribed to the ligation of
the RTA subunit (RTA S) with the AlaDH subunit (AlaDH S),
the ligated subunit of RTA S-AlaDHS. The molecular weight
of RTA S-AlaDHS is 75.9 kDa. The band of RTA S-AlaDHS is
below the position 97.2 kDa of a mark protein. The band
indicated by the black arrow in Figure 3B is attributed to the
ligation of AlaDH S with the FDH subunit (FDH S). The band
of the ligated subunit AlaDH S-FDHS has a molecular weight
of 83.1 kD. Appearance of the bands of RTA S-AlaDHS and
AlaDHS-FDHS conﬁrmed the ligations of RTA S with AlaDH S
and AlaDH S with FDH S, through the in vivo posttranslational
hetrosubunit splicing triggered by the dimerization of ZE
and ZR.
Ligation Mode Based on BN-PAGE
Analysis
We have tried to use matrix-assisted laser desorption and
ionization time-of-ﬂight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS)
to identify the fractions of the splicing products RTA&AlaDH
and AlaDH&FDH. However, the measured data are not useful,
due to the lack of reliability of the data. This is ascribed to
the large molecular weights of the fractions of RTA&AlaDH
and AlaDH&FDH. In an alternative approach, blue native
polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (BN-PAGE) was used to
analyze RTA&AlaDH and AlaDH&FDH. BN-PAGE has been
proved to be eﬀective for identifying proteins from multiprotein
complexes (Wiedemann et al., 2003; Wittig et al., 2016). The
BN-PAGE of RTA&AlaDH is shown in Figure 4A . Eight
bands appeared. It is meant that RTA&AlaDH comprises
eight fractions. Marker proteins are shown on Lane M. Based
on the bands on lane M, the electrophoretic mobility of
the marker proteins is plotted against the molecular weight
(Supplementary Figure S2 ), and an equation was obtained.
The apparent molecular weights (AMWs) corresponding to
the eight bands were estimated, based on the comparison
between the electrophoretic mobility of marker proteins and
that of the eight bands. The AMWs of the bands I, II, III,
IV , V , VI, VII, and VIII were determined to be 254.8, 311.9,
388.0, 422.4, 480.7, 564.9, 674.2, and 741.3 kDa, respectively
(Supplementary Table S2 ). Based on the band intensity, the
relative abundances of the eight bands were determined to be
26.5, 2.3, 5.8, 20.4, 11.8, 6.8, 7.6, 19.1% for bands I, II, III, IV , V ,
VI, VII, and VIII, respectively. For each fraction of RTA&AlaDH,
the mode of hetrosubunit ligation was searched. The criterion
is that the theoretical molecular weight (TMW) predicated
on the basis of the ligation mode is in accordance with the
AMW. Based on the molecular weights of intein, ZR-IntN-RTAS,
and ZE-Int C-AlaDHS, the TMW of the possible ligation mode
were predicated. Supplementary Table S2 lists those ligation
modes with TMWs being in accordance with the AMWs of
the eight bands. The ligation modes were ﬁnally determined to
be, RTA∼AlaDH∼RTA (band I), RTA ∼AlaDH∼RTA∼AlaDH
(band II), AlaDH ∼RTA∼ AlaDH∼RTA∼AlaDH (band III),
RTA∼AlaDH∼RTA∼AlaDH∼RTA∼AlaDH (band IV), RTA ∼

with AlaDH through the in vivo subunit splicing. The splicing
product is designated as RTA#AlaDH. The BN-PAGE analysis
is shown in Supplementary Figure S3b . Four bands appeared,
with apparent molecular weights being 271.2, 346.7, 435.1, and
761.7 kDa, corresponding to bands I, II, III, and IV , respectively,
and the relative abundances of the four bands are 25.4, 43.9,

The amount of paired subunit RTAS-AlaDHS in RTA&AlaDH is

of the seven bands are 27.4, 20.4, 14.8, 24.3, 3.4, 3.8, and 5.9%,
respectively. The ligation modes were, FDH ∼AlaDH (band I),

subunit AlaDH S-FDHS is indicated by in Figure 5B . Based on
the relative abundances and seven ligation modes, the amount of
paired subunit AlaDH S-FDHS is determined to be 2.9 mol per
mole of AlaDH&FDH. The splicing product AlaDH#FDH was
obtained without using the promotion by the heterodimerization
of ZR and ZE. The SDS-PAGE ( Supplementary Figure S5a )
conﬁrmed the ligation of AlaDH with FDH through the in vivo
subunit splicing. The BN-PAGE for AlaDH#FDH is shown
in Supplementary Figure S5b . Five bands appeared, with
apparent molecular weights being 205.8, 280.9, 331.6, 403.8,
and 679.3 kDa, corresponding to bands I, II, III, IV , and V ,
respectively, and the relative abundances of the ﬁve bands are
24.4, 22.7, 20.7, 27.4, and 4.8%, respectively. The ligation modes
are shown in Supplementary Figure S5c. The amount of paired
subunit AlaDH S-FDHS is 2.8 mol per mole of AlaDH#FDH.
The amount of paired subunit RTAS-AlaDHS in AlaDH&FDH is
comparable to that in AlaDH#FDH.
Alpha-Helical Content Analysis by
Circular Dichroism (CD) Spectra
Here we presented two splicing products. RTA&AlaDH was
obtained through the in vivo hetrosubunit splicing triggered
by the coiled-coil association of Z E and Z R. For comparison,
RTA#AlaDH was obtained through the in vivo hetrosubunit
splicing without using the coiled-coil association of Z E and
ZR. CD spectra were measured for the splicing products
RTA&AlaDH and RTA#AlaDH (Figure 6), with the CD spectrum
of the mixed enzymes RTA + AlaDH as control. The CD
absorption at 222 nm is sensitive to the change of alpha-helical
content of proteins (Fasshauer et al., 1997). In comparison to
RTA +AlaDH, both RTA&AlaDH and RTA#AlaDH exhibited a

more negative ellipticity at 222 nm ( Figure 6). The CD spectra
demonstrated that the splicing products RTA&AlaDH and
RTA#AlaDH contain more alpha-helical structure than the mixed
enzymes RTA+AlaDH. This is possibly ascribed to the formation
of paired subunit RTA S-AlaDHS in the splicing products. The
CD spectra also show that RTA&AlaDH contains more alpha-
helical structure than RTA#AlaDH. Supplementary Figure S6
shows the CD spectra for the splicing products AlaDH&FDH
and AlaDH#FDH and the mixed enzymes AlaDH +FDH. The
diﬀerence between the spectra is not signiﬁcant.
Analysis of Enzyme Structures by
Two-Dimensional FTIR Spectra
The CD spectra ( Figure 6 ) showed that the splicing products
RTA&AlaDH and RTA#AlaDH comprise more alpha-helical
structure then the mixed enzymes RTA +AlaDH. Herein, to
further get insight into the structures of the splicing products,
RTA&AlaDH and RTA#AlaDH as well as RTA + AlaDH
were subjected to the measurement of two-dimensional FTIR
spectra, as described in the experimental section. Through two-
dimensional correlation spectroscopy, individual bands with a
high resolution can be identiﬁed. Upon external perturbation,
the sequential order of spectral intensity changes of the enzyme
structures (unordered, α-helix, and β-sheet) can be obtained.
By combining the sign of the peaks in the synchronous and
asynchronous maps, the sequence of the spectral variations can
be determined (Noda, 1989).
Infrared spectra as a function of the deuteration time were
measured as shown in Supplementary Figure S7 . Based on
Supplementary Figure S7, two-dimensional spectra are obtained
for RTA&AlaDH ( Figure 7A ), RTA#AlaDH ( Figure 7B ), and
RTA +AlaDH ( Figure 7C ). During the measurements, D 2O
was added, hence hydrogen-deuterium (H-D) exchange was
the external perturbation. The main correlation peaks observed

in the synchronous and asynchronous maps of Figure 7 are
summarized in Supplementary Table S3 . Published literature
on infrared spectroscopy of proteins provides the basis for the
band assignment (Richard et al., 2005; Mecozzi et al., 2011).
The sequential order of H-D exchange is determined based on
Noda’s rules (Noda, 1989). For RTA&AlaDH ( Figure 7A ), the
cross-peaks (1650, 1450) and (1610, 1450) can be identiﬁed
from the synchronous and asynchronous maps. The Noda’s rules
conﬁrm that the unordered structure (1450 cm −1) exhibited a
faster H-D exchange than the α-helix (1650 cm −1) and β-sheet
(1610 cm−1) structures. For RTA#AlaDH, the cross-peaks (1639,
1430) and (1665, 1437) can be identiﬁed from the synchronous
and asynchronous maps are shown Figure 7B . The unordered
structure (1430 cm−1) exhibited a faster H-D exchange than the
α-helix (1639 cm−1), and the unordered structure represented by
1437 cm−1 exchanged before the β-sheet structure (1665 cm−1).
For RTA +AlaDH ( Figure 7C ), the cross-peaks (1645, 1425)
and (1680, 1427) can be identiﬁed. The unordered structure
(1425 cm −1) exhibited a faster H-D exchange than the α-helix
(1645 cm −1), and the unordered structure represented by
1427 cm−1 exchanged before the β-sheet structure (1680 cm−1).
The analysis of the two-dimensional FTIR spectra ( Figure 7)
demonstrated that the three two-enzyme systems, RTA&AlaDH,
RTA#AlaDH, and RTA +AlaDH, exhibited the same sequence
of the spectral variations upon the external perturbation of D 2O.
That is the unordered structures exhibited a faster H-D exchange
than the structures of α- helices and β-sheets. Ascribing to the
presence of strong hydrogen bonds in α-helices and β-sheets,
the protons of α-helix and β-sheet are more diﬃcult to exchange
than those of unordered structures (Richard et al., 2005; Mecozzi
et al., 2011). There is no regular hydrogen bonds in the unordered
structures, the amide protons can be exchanged more easily than
those of α-helices and β-sheets. The sequential order of H-D
exchange demonstrated that thein vivohetrosubunit splicing had
little eﬀect on the hydrogen bonding interactions presented, that
maintain the secondary structures ofα-helices and β-sheets of the
enzymes. These secondary structures play an important role in
the function of the enzymes.
Anti-denaturation Through Hetrosubunit
Splicing
Multienzymes comprise of subunits that are associated through
non-covalent interactions, which play an important role in
maintaining the quaternary structures. However, the non-
covalent interactions can be weakened or partially destroyed
under certain experimental conditions. The dissociation
of the subunits leads to the inactivation of multimeric
enzymes. Multimeric enzymes face the concern of stability,
especially when applied at industrial scale (Fernandez, 2009).
For the two-enzyme systems, RTA&AlaDH, RTA#AlaDH,
and RTA +AlaDH, ﬂuorescence spectra were measured to
investigate enzyme stability. Urea (2 M) was used as the
denaturing agent. Acrylamide was used to quench the intrinsic
ﬂuorescence of the enzymes. The spectra of ﬂuorescence
intensity changing with the acrylamide concentration are shown
in Supplementary Figure S8. Stern–Volmer equation F0/F = 1+
FIGURE 8 | Stern–Volmer plots for the quenching of protein ﬂuorescence by
acrylamide. F0 and F are the ﬂuorescence intensities in the absence and
presence of acrylamide, respectively.
KSV[A] was used to evaluate the concentration-dependence
quenching (Georlette et al., 2004). In the equation, F and F 0
are the ﬂuorescence intensities in the presence and absence of
acrylamide, respectively. [A] is the acrylamide concentration.
The quenching constant KSV reﬂects the conformational
change of enzymes (Georlette et al., 2004). The ratio of F 0/F is
plotted against acrylamide concentration as shown in Figure 8.
A larger KSV corresponds to a larger conformational change
of the protein. The KSV value of RTA&AlaDH is 2.57, which
is smaller than 3.48 for RTA#AlaDH and much smaller than
6.63 for RTA +AlaDH. In comparison to RTA&AlaDH and
RTA#AlaDH, RTA +AlaDH is more inclined to expose the
tryptophan residues upon interfering by urea. The splicing
products are stable than the mixed two enzymes RTA +AlaDH.
The splicing products resulted from the covalent ligation of
the RTA subunit with the AlaDH subunit, making the splicing
products become more rigid than mixed enzymes. It is indicated
that RTA&AlaDH is stable than RTA#AlaDH. Based on the
BN-PAGE analysis ( Figure 4 and Supplementary Figure S3b ),
the amount of the paired subunit RTAS-AlaDHS in RTA&AlaDH
is 28.5% higher than that in RTA#AlaDH. This results in a
lower subunit mobility in RTA&AlaDH, leading to a more rigid
structure. The stabilities of AlaDH&FDH, AlaDH#FDH, and
AlaDH+FDH have also been analyzed based on the ﬂuorescence
intensity (in the legend of Supplementary Figure S9).
Enzyme-Substrate Interaction Based on
Microscale Thermophoresis Analysis
The analysis of enzyme binding to substrate can provide the
information of enzyme aﬃnity toward the substrate. Microscale
thermophoresis (MST) is a relatively recent technique based
on the unique physical principle of thermophoresis. It can
be used to quantify the interactions of proteins and small

molecules (Seidel et al., 2013). The two-enzyme systems,
RTA&AlaDH, RTA#AlaDH, and RTA +AlaDH, were subjected
to MST measurements to quantify binding coeﬃcients ( Kd).
Figure 9 shows the fraction bound versus ligand concentration.
The substrate 2-octanone was the ligand. RTA&AlaDH exhibited
a Kd value of 0.68 ±0.15 mM, which is smaller than the Kd value
of 2.33 ±3.22 mM by RTA#AlaDH, and much smaller than the
Kd value of 14.91 ±10.13 mM by RTA +AlaDH. It is indicated
that RTA&AlaDH exhibited the aﬃnity to 2-octanone 3.4 times
stronger than that by RTA#AlaDH, and 6.5 times stronger than
that by RTA+AlaDH.
Enzymatic Activity
In the conversion of the ketones to amines under the catalysis
of RTA, alanine was used as amine donor, and pyruvate being
the co-product. Maintaining alanine with a low concentration
facilitates subsequent puriﬁcation of the product. In addition,
recycling of pyruvate back to alanine can reduce the inhibitory
eﬀect of by-product. Alanine with a small concentration (5 mM)
was used, which is tenth of that of 2-octanone (50 mM).
The conversion was catalyzed under the three-enzyme systems
RTA&AlaDH +AlaDH&FDH, RTA#AlaDH +AlaDH#FDH,
and RTA +AlaDH +FDH. Figure 10 shows the 2-octanone
conversion versus reaction time. RTA+AlaDH +FDH (control)
achieved a conversion of 32% after 2 h reaction, and 79.2% of
2-octanone was converted by RTA#AlaDH +AlaDH#FDH. In
contrast, RTA&AlaDH +AlaDH&FDH achieved a 2-octanone
conversion of 98.8% after 2 h reaction. For the conversion of
acetophenone ( Supplementary Figure S10 ), after 6 h reaction,
65, 45, and 18% were achieved by RTA&AlaDH+AlaDH&FDH,
RTA#AlaDH +AlaDH#FDH, and RTA +AlaDH +FDH,
respectively. RTA&AlaDH +AlaDH&FDH exhibited a higher

catalysis eﬃciency than RTA#AlaDH +AlaDH#FDH, and much
higher eﬃciency than RTA +AlaDH +FDH.
Supplementary Table S4 lists the published results using
ω-transaminases combining AlaDH and FDH for the conversion
of 2-octanone (50 mM). In the catalysis, alanine was used as
amine donor. The amounts of alanine used are 250 mM by Mutti
et al. (2011, 2012) and 280 mM by Koszelewski et al. (2010).
In contrast, this work used alanine with a small concentration
(5 mM), which is tenth of that of 2-octanone (50 mM). The
conversion of 2-octanone achieved by this work is higher than
the conversions by the three-enzyme systems of the published
articles ( Supplementary Table S4 ). Through the hetrosubunit
splicing, the hetrosubunits are paired. This paves a short pathway
for alanine recycling. The amount of alanine used is much less
than that published, demonstrating that the transferring and
recycling of alanine are more eﬃcient than the three-enzyme
systems (Supplementary Table S4). In addition, the reaction time
of this work is 2 h in comparison to 24 h required by the catalysis
in the published articles.
For the mixed enzymes RTA + AlaDH + FDH, the
interactions between the enzymes are not speciﬁc interactions.
Under shaking condition during the reaction, occasionally
pairing of RTA with AlaDH and AlaDH with FDH occurred.
However, the instantaneous pairing of the enzymes cannot be
controlled and maintained for the whole reaction time, attributed
to the non-speciﬁc interaction between the enzymes. This results
in that, the transfers of alanine and pyruvate between RTA and
AlaDH and NADH and NAD+between AlaDH and FDH cannot
be directional. In contrast, RTA&AlaDH +AlaDH&FDH and
RTA#AlaDH +AlaDH#FDH achieved the paired hetrosubunits,
RTAS-AlaDHS and AlaDH S-FDHS, as illustrated in Figure 2 .
Based on the software (Discovery Studio), the linker length
is 3.3 nm. Hence the largest distance between the pairing

fbioe-08-00686 June 26, 2020 Time: 20:38 # 12
Li et al. Peptide Bond Formation Between the Hetrosubunits
hetrosubunits is 6.6 nm. Thus, the hetrosubunit pairing paves
short transferring-recycling pathways for transferring pyruvate
and NAD + and recycling alanine and NADH. Thus the
transferring and recycling are directional and oriented. The
hetrosubunit pairing through peptide bonds makes the splicing
products become stable in comparison to the mixed enzymes.
In addition, the splicing products have exhibited much higher
aﬃnity toward the model substrate 2-octanone. All these
contribute to the splicing products exhibiting much higher
catalysis eﬃciency than the mixed enzymes.
Based on the BN-PAGE analysis for RTA&AlaDH,
RTA#AlaDH, AlaDH&FDH, and AlaDH#FDH, the linking
mode corresponding to each band has been determined,
and the fraction of each band has also been obtained.
Based on the information, the number of the pairing
hetersubunits RTAS-AlaDHS in RTA&AlaDH is 28.5% higher
than that in RTA#AlaDH, and the number of AlaDH S-FDHS
in AlaDH&FDH is comparable to that in AlaDH#FDH.
Possibly, this is the reason that RTA&AlaDH contains
more alpha-helical structure than RTA#AlaDH. It is implied
that, RTA&AlaDH has more alanine →pyruvate→alanine
cycles than RTA#AlaDH. Due to having more pairing
hetrosubunits, RTA&AlaDH + AlaDH&FDH is more
stable than RTA#AlaDH + AlaDH#FDH. In addition,
RTA&AlaDH +AlaDH&FDH exhibited much higher aﬃnity
toward the substrate 2-octanone than RTA#AlaDH + Ala
DH#FDH. As a result, RTA&AlaDH+AlaDH&FDH exhibited a
higher catalysis eﬃciency than RTA#AlaDH +AlaDH#FDH.
CONCLUSION
The heterodimerization of leucine zipper motifs promoted
the in vivo hetrosubunit splicing, and the pairing enzymes
RTA&AlaDH and AlaDH&FDH have been constructed. The
hetrosubunit splicing has little eﬀect on the intro-hydrogen
bonding interactions, and can confer RTA&AlaDH having
more alpha-helical structure and a higher stability. Ascribing
to the hetrosubunit pairing through peptide bonds, the
transferring pyruvate and NAD + and recycling alanine and
NADH are directional and oriented. In contrast to the
mixed three enzymes RTA +AlaDH+FDH, the ligated enzymes
RTA&AlaDH+AlaDH&FDH exhibited a much larger substrate
aﬃnity, higher stability, and signiﬁcantly enhanced activity.
