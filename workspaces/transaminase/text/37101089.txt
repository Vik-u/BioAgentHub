Abstract
Objectives Patients with obstruction jaundice are at a high risk of hypotension and need high volume of fluids and a high dose 
of catecholamine to maintain organ perfusion during operation procedure. All these likely contribute to high perioperative 
morbidity and mortality. The aim of the study is to evaluate the effects of methylene blue on the hemodynamics in patients 
undergoing surgeries associated with obstructive jaundice.
Design A prospective, randomized, and controlled clinical study.
Setting The enrolled patients randomly received 2 mg/kg of methylene blue in saline or saline (50 ml) before anesthesia 
induction. The primary outcome was the frequency and dose of noradrenaline administration to maintain mean arterial blood 
pressure over 65 mmHg or > 80% of baseline, and systemic vascular resistance (SVR) over 800 dyne/s/cm5 during operation. 
The secondary outcomes were liver and kidney functions, and ICU stay.
Patients Seventy patients were enrolled in the study and randomly assigned to receive either methylene blue or control 
(n = 35/group).
Results Fewer patients received noradrenaline in the methylene blue group when compared with the control group (13/35 vs 
23/35, P = 0.017), and the noradrenaline dose administrated during operation was reduced in the methylene blue group when 
compared with the control group (0.32 ± 0.57 mg vs 1.787 ± 3.51 mg, P = 0.018). The blood level of creatinine, glutamic 
oxalacetic transaminase, and glutamic–pyruvic transaminase after the operation was reduced in the methylene blue group 
when compared with the control group.
Conclusions Prophylactic administration of methylene blue before operation associated with obstructive jaundice improves 
hemodynamic stability and short-term prognosis.
Question Methylene blue use prevented refractory hypotension during cardiac surgery, sepsis, or anaphylactic shock. It is 
still unknown that methylene blue on the vascular hypo-tone associated with obstructive jaundice.
Findings Prophylactic administration with methylene blue improved peri-operative hemodynamic stability, and hepatic and 
kidney function on the patients with obstructive jaundice.
Meanings Methylene blue is a promising and recommended drug for the patients undergoing the surgeries of relief 
obstructive jaundice during peri-operation management.

Background
Obstructive jaundice is induced by the common bile duct being 
blocked completely or partially, and then the bile overflows from 
the digestive system into the circulation, which will lead to all 
vital organ damage.1–5 Surgical interventions to relieve obstruc-
tive jaundice are essential but are often associated with a high 
postoperative morbidity and mortality. It has been reported that

improved preoperative preparation and peri-operation manage-
ment may greatly contribute to a favorable outcome, but those 
are not optimized yet. Patients with obstructive jaundice often 
presented to be hypotensive after anesthesia induction and are at 
a high risk of severe hypotension. Thus, the patients often need 
a large volume of fluid loading and a large dose of vasopressors 
to maintain adequate blood pressure.6,7 Methylene blue (MB), 
as a potent inhibitor of nitric oxide (NO) synthase, has been suc-
cessfully used to combat refractory hypotension associated with 
cardiopulmonary bypass, septic shock, liver transplantation, 
and anaphylactic shock.8–10 Methylene blue is the second-line 
drug to treat this refractory hypotension; however, it was found 
that methylene blue improved the hemodynamics in the critical 
ill patients with refractory hypotension, and the patients may 
benefit more from early than later administration.11 To date, it 
remains unknown whether the patients with obstructive jaundice 
are also benefited from prophylactic administration of methylene 
blue. The patients, who were scheduled to undergo surgeries 
for relieving obstructive jaundice, were enrolled to evaluate the 
effects of prophylactic administration of methylene blue on the 
hemodynamic status and organs’ function in this trial.
Methods

Board of Southwest Hospital, Third Military Medical 
University (No. 2016(94)), and registered on the clinical trial 
registration website (www. chictr. org. cn; Number: ChiCTR-
IOR- 16,010,206) on 21 December 2016. Procedures were 
followed by the ethical standards of the committee on human 
experimentation and with the Helsinki Declaration of 1975. 
Written informed consent was obtained from all of the 
enrolled patients. All authors had access to the study data 
and had reviewed and approved the final manuscript.
Patients’ Recruitment
Patients with obstructive jaundice as indicated as 
TBIL > 5.0 mg/ml and the yellowing of skin or sclera, 
aged between 18 and 70 years old, who need surgical 
intervention, were enrolled in this study (Fig.  1) from 
January 15, 2017, to June 17, 2018, at Southwest hospital, 
the Third Military Medical University, Chongqing, China. 
Patients were excluded if they met any of the following 
criteria: anesthesiologists (ASA) physical status scores IV 
and V, the patients received selective serotonin reuptake 
inhibitor (SSRI) therapy, abdominal surgery history, 
coronary heart disease, hypertension, and any other 
cardiovascular diseases to be treated with medication, 
respiratory dysfunction including  PaO2 ≤ 60  (FiO2 > 21%) 
or/and  PaCO2 ≥ 50 mmHg, undergoing other clinical 
studies within recent 3 months or refusal to participate

Randomization
Randomization in a 1:1 ratio was done by an independent 
staff and all recruited patients were randomly allocated to 
receive either 2 mg/kg of Methylene blue I.V. in 50 ml of 
saline solution or 50 ml of saline solution. The researchers 
who collected data were blinded to the trial protocol, and 
the anesthesiologists who performed the anesthesia were 
blinded for grouping.
Procedures
The dose of 2 mg/kg of the bodyweight of methylene blue 
(20 mg/2 ml) (Jichuan Medicine Co., Ltd, Taixing, China) 
was diluted with saline solution to be 50 ml; the placebo was 
50 ml of saline solution. Both were prepared by a medical 
staff who did not participate in the rest study. Before general 
anesthesia induction, all patients received placement of a 
central venous catheter (B. Braun, Melsongen, Germany) 
and Swan-Ganz catheter via the right jugular vein, and an 
arterial catheter (18G) at the site of the left radial artery 
under local anesthesia. Invasive arterial blood pressure 
(ABP) and central venous pressure (CVP) were monitored 
continuously during operation. The surgical procedures were 
well matched between the two groups.
The methylene blue solution or normal saline was adminis-
trated by a continuous intravenous infusion at a rate of 2.5 ml/
min before anesthesia induction, and then all the patients were 
induced with the administration of midazolam (0.02–0.05 mg/
kg), sufentanil (0.5–1 μg/kg), etomidate (0.2–0.3 mg/kg), and 
cisatracurium (0.2–0.3 mg/kg). The patients received trachea 
intubation and ventilated with 8–10 ml/kg of tidal volume, 
12–16 rpm, 1:2 of I:E to maintain  EtCO2 between 35 and 40 
 cmH2O. Sevoflurane (1–2%) and continuous intravenous infu-
sion of remifentanil at dose of 2–4 ng/ml of plasma concentra-
tion were administrated to maintain enough depth of anesthe-
sia (40–60 of Bispectral Index (BIS)) throughout the surgical 
procedure. Cisatracurium (a bolus dose of 0.1–0.2 mg/kg) was 
injected when necessary to keep a single or zero twitch on 
the train-of-four stimulation of the ulnar nerve (TOF-Watch 
SX; Organon Ltd., Dublin, Ireland) during operation. The 
anesthesia protocol was identified for all patients. Arterial 
blood gas analysis was determined before and after anesthe-
sia induction, after removal of the tumor, during the phase of 
entero-anastomosis or choledochojejunostomy, before closure 
of enterocele, and 24 h after the surgery completion.Hemo-
dynamic status and blood transfusion was managed accord-
ing to the Infusion Regimen (Supplemental Tables 3 and 4). 
Decisions regarding all other aspects of medical care during 
the intraoperative and postoperative periods, including pain 
management after operation, and administration of fluids and 
antibiotics, were made by attending surgeons according the 
routine clinical practices.
Outcomes
The primary outcome was the frequency of norepinephrine 
administration during the operation phase. Secondary out-
comes included the dose of norepinephrine, other vasoactive 
agent usage, the loading volume of fluid, liver and renal 
function, ICU stay, and hospital stay.
Power Calculation and Statistical Analysis
Normally distributed data are reported as mean ± standard 
deviation, and abnormally distributed data are reported as 
medians and interquartile ranges. The D’ Agostino-Pearson 
test was applied to assess data normality. Normally distrib-
uted variables were compared using the Student t  test or 
paired Student t-test, as appropriate, and abnormally distrib-
uted data were compared by using the Mann–Whitney test. 
Categorical variables were compared using Fisher’s exact. 
(SPSS 20.0 software, Chicago, IL, USA). A P-value less 
than 0.05 was considered to be of statistical significance.
The frequency of noradrenaline administration to main-
tain mean blood pressure above 65 mmHg or > 80% of base-
line during operation was about 70% in this comparable 
patient population in the previous study. If the frequency of 
noradrenaline administration during operation was reduced 
by half with the administration of methylene blue, then with 
a significance set at 0.05 and power set at 80%, the sample 
size required to detect differences was 66 patients in total 
for two arms. Taking into account a lost-to-follow-up rate 
of about 10%, 70 patients were enrolled.
Results
Between January 15, 2017, and June 17, 2018, 229 patients were 
screened for study participation. Of those, 70 patients who met 
recruitment criteria were recruited and randomly assigned to 
receive either methylene blue or control (n = 35/group) (Fig. 1). 
During the study period, there were no lapses in the blinding. All 
patients were included for data analysis. The final visit of the last 
randomized patient was done on September 20, 2019. Overall, 
the patients in the control and methylene blue group were well 
matched for the baseline characteristics (Table 1).
Vasopressor Administration During Operation
Noradrenaline was administration to maintain MBP over 
65 mmHg or > 80% of baseline, and SVR over 800 dyne/s/cm5. 
Less patients received noradrenaline in the methylene blue 
group than in the control group (13/35 vs 23/35, P  = 0.017) 
(Table 2). The time-averaged dose of noradrenaline adminis-
tration during operation was decreased in the methylene blue 
group than in the control group [(0.00 (0.00–0.06) μg/min/kg vs 
1840 Journal of Gastrointestinal Surgery (2023) 27:1837–1845

0.06 (0.00–0.15) μg/min/kg, P = 0.020] (Fig. 2A). Less patients 
were received large dose of noradrenaline (total dose > 2 mg/
throughout the procedure) infusion in the methylene blue group 
than in the control group (1/35 vs 9/35, P = 0.006) (Table 2). The 
duration of noradrenaline administration was decreased in the 
methylene blue compared with the control group [0(0–110) min 
vs 110(0–270), P = 0.019] (Fig. 2B). The frequency and dose 
of dobutamine administration during operation did not differ 
between the two groups (Table 2).
Hemodynamic Parameters During Operation
The baseline of SBP, MAP, SVR, and CO did not differ between 
the two groups. After anesthesia induction, SBP, MAP, and SVR 
were reduced in both groups. SBP (Fig. 3A) and MAP (Fig. 3B) 
were higher in the methylene blue group compared with the 
control group throughout the surgical procedure (P  < 0.05). 
SVR was also higher in the methylene blue group compared 
with the control group until 180 min after anesthesia induction 
(P < 0.05) (Fig. 3C). CO was higher in the control group than 
the methylene blue group at 15 min after anesthesia induction 
(P < 0.05) and it was also higher in the control group than in 
the methylene blue group at other time points, but there was no 
significant difference (P > 0.05) (Fig. 3D).
The Other Anesthesia Managements During 
the Operation
Less patients received plasma transfusion in the methylene 
blue group compared with the control group (10/35 vs 19/35, 
P = 0.029). The frequency of plasma infusion was reduced in

the methylene blue group when compared with the control 
group (29% vs 43%, P = 0.029). There is no statistical differ-
ence of blood loss, washed red blood cells, colloid, crystalloid 
solution, and other blood products during operation. The dura-
tion of anesthesia (7.56 ± 2.13 h vs 8.79 ± 2.47 h, P = 0.033) 
and surgical procedure duration (6.44 ± 2.01 h vs 7.63 ± 2.31 h, 
P = 0.029) was reduced in the methylene blue group when com-
pared with the control group, respectively (Table 2).
Arterial Blood Gas Analysis
There was no significant difference of pH, Hb,  PO2,  PCO2, 
 K+,  Ca2+, BE, and lactic acid between the two groups at all 
the observed time points (Supplemental Table 5).
Kidney and Liver Function
Fewer patients suffered from acute kidney injury after opera-
tion (KDIGO criteria) in the methylene blue group than in 
the control group (6% vs 23%, P = 0.040). Fewer patients in 
the methylene blue group presented an increase of creatinine 
over the normal range compared with the control group on 
the postoperative day 2 (3% vs 17%, P = 0.046) and day 3 (0 
vs 14%, P = 0.020) (Table 3). 
Most of patients in the control and methylene blue group 
presented abnormally liver function, which was demonstrated 
the frequency of glutamic oxalacetic transaminase (GOT) over 
than (89% vs 97%, P = 0.164) and glutamic pyruvic transaminase 
(GPT) (94% vs 97%, P  = 0.555) over normal range, respec-
tively. GOT was increased at day 1st after the operation, then 
gradually declined over time, GOT was decreased in the meth-
ylene blue group compared with the control group on day 1st 
(255.2 ± 250.3 IU/L vs 559.0 ± 837.6 IU/L, P = 0.043), 2nd 
(132.2 ± 138.9 IU/L vs 297.7 ± 398.4 IU/L, P = 0.029), and 3rd 
(71.0 ± 62.7 IU/L vs 124.9 ± 136.9 IU/L, P = 0.049) after the sur-
gery, respectively. GPT was increased on the 1st day after the sur-
gery and then gradually declined over time. GPT a was decreased 
in methylene blue group compared with the control group at 
day 1st (241.2 ± 198.4 IU/L vs 464.8 ± 583.3 IU/L, P = 0.043), 
2nd (164.9 ± 156.1 IU/L vs 344.5 ± 473.5 IU/L, P = 0.044), 3rd 
(117.2 ± 111.2 IU/L vs 215.5 ± 289.6 IU/L, P = 0.081) after the 
surgery, respectively. (Table 3)Creatine kinase (CK) was enhanced 
after surgery and declined gradually over time. CK activity was 
reduced in the methylene blue group compared with the control 
group on day 1st (441.1 ± 282.3 IU/L vs 782.6 ± 480.4 IU/L, 
P = 0.037), 2nd (345.4 ± 276.5 IU/L vs 569.5 ± 257.6 IU/L, 
P = 0.018), 3rd (177.2 ± 135.7 IU/L vs 389.3 ± 198.6 IU/L, 
P = 0.011) after operation, respectively (Table 3).
Other laboratory measurements did not differ between 
the two groups (Supplemental Table 6).

jaundice and thus improves renal and hepatic function, 
attenuating cardiac ischemic injury the after the operation, 
and shortened the ICU stay.
Patients with obstructive jaundice are at high risk for 
impairment of cardiovascular and low vascular response 
under anesthesia conditions and often need high dose of 
vasopressors to maintain stabilization of hemodynamic. It 
has been reported that a high requirement for vasoactive 
drugs is associated with increased mortality and organ’s 
function, which is due to that excessive vasoconstriction 
might be deleterious to micro-circulation and lead to mis-
match between macro-circulation and micro-circulation 
during shock conditions.12–14 In a previous study, we found 
that reduced SVR associated obstructive jaundice resulted 
in this pronouncing hypotension, which at least partly 
attributed to this high morbidity and mortality after the 
operations. 15–17 Increased bilirubin and bile acid and asso -
ciated toxins were reported to contribute to this reduced

vascular response. 18–20 Nitric oxide (NO) was found to 
be increased in the patients with obstructive jaundice 
and played important roles in the vascular hypo-response 
and organs’ dysfunction in the patients with obstructive 
jaundice. 21
In clinic practice, noradrenaline is a first-line drug to cor-
rect hypotension associated with reduced  SVR15,22; how-
ever, this hypotension associated with obstructive jaundice 
does not often respond well to norepinephrine, and hence, a 
large dose of norepinephrine is often administrated to com-
bat hypotension. It was found that microcirculatory is still 
abnormal despite normalization of blood pressure by vaso-
pressors under this condition, which is considered the pri-
mary cause of kidney and hepatic dysfunction, and cardiac 
injury after the operations. 23
Methylene blue has been suggested as an adjuvant treat-
ment in the setting of refractory hypotension.24,25 Methylene 
blue reduces nitric oxide–mediated vasodilation via direct 
inhibitory of iNOS and soluble guanylate cyclase, 26 which 
attenuates remarkably low response to vasoconstrictor. 
Methylene blue is recommended as an effective treatment 
of refractory hypotension which is not sensitive to catecho-
lamine in the international guidelines.27 Recently, it has been 
reported that methylene blue improved both macro-circu-
lation and micro-circulation, and thus attenuates mismatch 
between macro-circulation and micro-circulation induced 
by administration with high dose of catecholamine,23 which 
was regarded to contribute to improve hepatic and kidney 
function, and attenuated myocardium ischemic damage. It 
has been reported that methylene blue is routinely adminis-
trated as rescue therapy for catecholamine-refractory hypo-
tension in the setting of cardiac surgery, sepsis shock, and 
liver transplantation. Moreover, it has been found that early 
administration is more effective than later administration 
in these reports. 11,22 To our best knowledge, this clinical 
study firstly reported the protective effect of prophylactic 
administration of methylene blue in patients with obstruc-
tion jaundice. Prophylactic administration of methylene 
blue prevented occurrence of refractory hypotension during 
the operation and thus protected the patients from hepatic,

kidney, and cardiac injury. These data suggest that the 
patients with obstructive jaundice benefit from prophylactic 
administration of methylene blue.
Some limitations of this study are the following. Firstly, this 
is single-center study with small sample size. Second, methylene 
blue was administrated before anesthesia induction; the risk and 
benefit of the patients with low risk of refractory hypotension 
remain unknown. Thirdly, the effects of methylene blue on long-
term outcomes are also unknown and warrant further study. 
Fourthly, methylene blue may interfere some measurements, 
including pulse oximetry reading and alter the color of body 
fluid, such as urine; all these need to be closely monitored using 
its use and more cautions are needed to take. Lastly, some of the 
patients underwent pre-operation ERCP in both groups, because 
the number of patients who received pre-operation ERCP was 
not big enough to stratified analyze the effects of methylene blue 
and pre-operation ERCP.
Although owing to mentioned limitations, methylene blue 
may be recommended to be used to improve hemodynamic 
stabilization during operation and organ’ function in 
the patients undergoing operations relieving obstructive 
jaundice, but further clinical study is still needed to verify 
its long-term benefits.
Conclusion
This study shows that prophylactic administration of methylene 
blue improves hemodynamic stabilization, and organs’ function 
via maintaining tissue perfusion in the patients undergoing the 
procedures of relieving obstructive jaundice. Patients with high 
risk of refractory hypotension may benefit from prophylactic 
administration of methylene blue but warrant further study.
