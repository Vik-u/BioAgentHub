ABSTRACT
Background and Aims: The role of the patatin-  like phospholipase domain-  containing protein 3 (PNPLA3)-  I148M variant in 
drug- induced liver injury (DILI) remains unclear. This systematic review with meta-  analysis investigated whether carriage of 
PNPLA3 I148M may contribute to the development of hepatocellular DILI.
Methods: Scientific databases were searched up to January 31st, 2025 for studies investigating serum transaminase elevations 
in response to drug treatment. Studies were included if serum transaminases were elevated in at least one genetic subgroup (II/
IM/MM), and the possible presence of relevant hepatocellular DILI was estimated based on Hy's law. The meta- analysis reported 
on any increase in transaminases compared to baseline levels.
Results: Eight articles covering thirteen studies with a total of 8235 patients were included in the systematic review, of which 
5 studies comprising 3480 individuals were eligible for the meta-  analysis. Patients were treated with small molecules ( n = 602), 
biologicals (n = 3221), or chemotherapeutic treatments (n = 4412). None of the studies reported conclusively more occurrence of 
relevant hepatocellular DILI based on PNPLA3 I148M carriage. The meta-  analysis suggested amplified drug-  induced transami-
nase elevations in response to adomeglivant and basal insulin peglispro in metabolically impaired individuals with PNPLA3- IM/
MM compared to PNPLA3-  II (odds ratio = 1.53, 95% CI = 1.22–1.92). None of the studies were primarily designed to detect the 
outcome of interest.

Conclusions: Low to no evidence suggests that carriage of PNPLA3 I148M confers susceptibility to develop clinically relevant 
hepatocellular DILI; although it may potentiate drug-  induced transaminase elevations in response to adomeglivant and basal 
insulin peglispro in metabolically impaired individuals.
1   |   Introduction
Drug- induced liver injury (DILI) can result in acute liver fail -
ure, making it a relevant cause of liver- related death. The global 
incidence of DILI is unclear but prospective studies from France 
and Iceland reported annual incidences in the general popula -
tion of 13.9 and 19.1 per 100 000 inhabitants [ 1, 2 ]. DILI is a 
challenging clinical condition responsible for roughly half of 
the cases of acute liver failure reported in the USA and Western 
Europe [3, 4], and accounts for 8% of liver transplantations in 
Europe [5].
Further, DILI is amongst the leading reasons for late-  stage dis -
continuation of agents during clinical trials or post-  marketing 
regulatory actions. Specifically, hepatotoxicity accounted for 
one in every four terminations during clinical development 
and one third of market withdrawals between 1975 and 2007 
in the USA [ 6]. The lack of specific, validated biomarkers to 
predict DILI complicates its management during clinical trials, 
where monitoring of alanine and aspartate aminotransferases 
(ALT and AST) in serum remains the most accessible and rec -
ommended approach to evaluate potential hepatic injury in 
study participants. According to the guidelines of the European 
Association for the Study of the Liver (EASL), DILI should be 
suspected in a clinical trial when ALT and/or AST levels were 
normal at baseline and exceed 3-  fold the upper limit of normal 
(ULN) during treatment [ 7]. Apart from transaminase eleva -
tions > 3- fold the ULN, Hy's law, which serves as an indicator 
that a drug is likely to cause severe hepatocellular DILI, addi -
tionally considers elevations of total serum bilirubin > 2- fold, 
and the elevations in AST/ALT should have occurred in the 
absence of elevated serum alkaline phosphatase or other alter -
native explanations [ 8].
The underlying mechanisms culminating in DILI are often of 
multifactorial nature and involve an interplay between both char-
acteristics of the DILI-  causing agent and patient-  related factors 
including age, sex, environment and genetics [9]. In this context, 
a single nucleotide polymorphism in patatin-  like phospholipase 
domain- containing 3 (PNPLA3), PNPLA3 I148M, has been ro -
bustly associated with metabolic dysfunction- associated steatotic 
liver disease (MASLD) susceptibility and progression [ 10, 11], 
and also with advanced liver disease due to other aetiologies [12]. 
PNPLA3 I148M has also been linked to increased serum ALT and 
AST levels, and in vitro studies suggest that it may also impact the 
drug metabolising capacity of hepatocytes, possibly altering their 
sensitivity to hepatotoxicity [10, 13, 14]. While a recent systematic 
review showed that carriage of PNPLA3 I148M may influence the 
response to treatment for hepatic steatosis, its potential impact on 
the susceptibility to develop DILI remains elusive [15].
This systematic review with meta-  analysis investigated whether 
hetero-  or homozygous carriage of the PNPLA3 I148M variant 
may potentiate drug- induced hepatocellular liver injury.
2   |   Methods
The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and 
Meta- Analyses (PRISMA) checklist is available as a supplement.
2.1   |   Eligibility Criteria
Study eligibility criteria are given in Table  S1. Clinical stud -
ies were included from full-  text research papers or conference 
proceedings, written in English. Studies were eligible if serum 
aminotransferase test disturbances were detected during drug 
treatment for any non-  hepatic disease in at least one subgroup 
of PNPLA3 I148M (II/IM/MM). Studies were excluded when 
no genotyping for PNPLA3 I148M was done, no serum ami -
notransferase tests were performed after treatment, or when 
the agent could be classified as a dietary supplement accord -
ing to European (Directive 2002/46/EC) or USA law (Dietary 
Supplement Health and Education Act of 1994).
2.2   |   Information Sources
MEDLINE, Cochrane Library and Web of Science were searched 
for publications up to January 31st, 2025.
2.3   |   Search Strategy
MEDLINE: (((PNPLA3) OR (patatin- like phospholipase domain–
containing 3) OR (adiponutrin)) AND (rs738409)) AND ((DILI) OR 
(drug induced liver injury) OR (liver toxicity) OR (hepatotoxicity)).
Cochrane Library: ‘PNPLA3’ AND ‘rs738409’ AND (‘Drug in -
duced liver injury’ OR ‘DILI’ OR ‘liver toxicity’ OR ‘aminotrans-
ferases’) + filter Trials.
Web of Science: AB = (PNPLA3 OR patatin-  like phospholipase 
domain- containing protein 3 OR adiponutrin) AND AB = (DILI 
OR drug- induced liver injury OR liver toxicity OR hepatotoxic -
ity) + filter Review article (exclude).
Additionally, citation searching was performed to identify any 
other reports that could meet the predefined eligibility criteria.
2.4   |   Selection Process
Duplicates were manually removed from the search results, 
and pre-  screening of titles, abstracts and keywords was done 
to identify potentially relevant records based on study type 
and the mentioning of the terms ‘PNPLA3’ and ‘DILI’, or syn -
onyms thereof. Remaining full-  text reports were subsequently 
assessed for all eligibility criteria listed in Table  S1. The search 
3 of 17
was conducted independently by two researchers; inconsisten -
cies were discussed to reach a consensus. A third researcher was 
available for discussion in case consensus could not be reached 
by the two primary researchers.
2.5   |   Data Collection Process
A premade extraction sheet in Microsoft Excel was used for 
data collection by two independent researchers. The collected 
data were compared, and inconsistencies were discussed to 
reach a consensus. A third researcher was available for discus -
sion in case consensus could not be reached by the two primary 
researchers.
2.6   |   Data Items
2.6.1   |   Outcomes
The primary outcome was the effect of PNPLA3 I148M IM/
MM vs II genotypes on treatment-  related increase of ALT and/
or AST levels. Secondary outcomes were the occurrence of he -
patocellular DILI based on thresholds defined by Hy's law [ 8]: 
ALT and/or AST ≥ 3- fold ULN (or 3-  fold the pre-  existing level) 
and total bilirubin > 2- fold ULN without alkaline phosphatase 
(ALP) elevation or any alternative explanation; and the risks of 
serum transaminase elevation and hepatocellular DILI based on 
treatment type by PNPLA3 genotype (IM/MM vs II).
Data were collected on the outcome of serum aminotransferases 
(enzyme(s) tested, numerical outcome/change from baseline, p - 
value, odds ratio). If available, bilirubin and alkaline phospha -
tase levels were also noted. If applicable, specific criteria used 
for classification of the observed hepatotoxicity were also noted.
2.6.2   |   Other Variables
Report details (first author, year of publication), study details 
(design, duration, participating countries, registration number), 
patient characteristics (disease, age, sex, body mass index (BMI), 
PNPLA3 I148M genotype) and intervention details (interven -
tion, treatment arms, dosage, frequency, duration, number of 
patients per group) were collected.
2.7   |   Study Risk of Bias Assessment
Risk of bias was assessed independently by two researchers 
using the revised Cochrane Risk-  of- Bias tool for randomised tri-
als (RoB 2) [16], the Risk of Bias in Non- randomised Studies—of 
Interventions (ROBINS-  I) assessment tool (version for cohort- 
type studies) [17] and the Newcastle-  Ottawa quality assessment 
scale (NOS) for case-  control studies [ 18]. Inconsistencies were 
discussed to reach a consensus, and a third researcher was avail-
able for discussion in case consensus could not be reached by the 
two primary researchers.
2.8   |   Effect Measures
A meta-  analysis was performed for the composite outcome of 
increased serum ALT and/or AST level after treatment with a 
small molecule, biological or chemotherapy protocol in PNPLA3 
IM/MM carriers compared to PNPLA3 II carriers. The effect 
measure used in the meta-  analysis was the corresponding odds 
ratio (OR) and its 95% confidence interval (CI).
2.9   |   Synthesis Methods
All studies that met the eligibility criteria were included in the 
narrative synthesis of results. When studies reported on ALT 
and/or AST elevations ≥ 3- fold ULN, but without additional in -
formation to apply Hy's law, the impact of PNPLA3 I148M was 
graded as ‘possibly contributing to relevant hepatocellular DILI’. 
When no cutoff data for ALT and/or AST was available and only 
minor increases in their levels were observed without any other 
notice of severe hepatocellular liver injury, the effect of PNPLA3 
I148M was considered as ‘unlikely contributing to relevant he -
patocellular DILI’.
For the meta-  analysis, only studies that either reported an OR 
and its 95% CI from a dominant (IM/MM vs. II) logistic regres -
sion model regarding ALT and/or AST, or reported sufficient 
data allowing calculation of the standardised mean difference 
(SMD) as Cohen's d between PNPLA3 IM/MM and II groups, 
were eligible for inclusion [ 19]. Studies were excluded from the 
meta- analysis if baseline ALT and/or AST levels were not ac -
counted for.
Where ORs could not be directly extracted from the publications 
or Appendix  S1, the SMD (Cohen's d ) was calculated using the 
least squares mean values reported for the change from base -
line (CFB) after treatment in PNPLA3 IM/MM and PNPLA3 
II individuals. From the SMD, the lnOR and its 95% CI were 
subsequently calculated and transformed to OR and its 95% CI 
[19]. The input data used for the meta-  analysis is summarised 
in Table S2.
Meta- analysis was performed in R (version 4.4.2) using the 
meta package (version 8.0–1) [ 20]. A random effects model 
Summary
• Carriage of PNPLA3 I148M is unlikely to increase the 
risk of clinically relevant hepatocellular drug-  induced 
liver injury.
• In metabolically impaired patients, carriage of the 
PNPLA3 I148M variant may confer susceptibility to 
develop more pronounced drug- induced transaminase 
elevations in response to adomeglivant and basal insu-
lin peglispro, which both influence lipid metabolism.
• (Exacerbation of) underlying MASLD could have 
mediated the increased propensity to develop higher 
levels of transaminases in PNPLA3 I148M carriers in 
response to certain drugs.
• Studies investigating the effect of PNPLA3 I148M on 
drug- induced hepatotoxicity are scarce.

was fitted, and heterogeneity between the studies was explored 
by subgroup analysis based on treatment type and by using 
Cochran's Q, Higgins & Thompson's I2 index and tau-  squared 
(τ2) metrics. Univariate meta-  regression was performed for the 
mean difference between the PNPLA3 IM/MM and PNPLA3 II 
groups in baseline age, proportion of males, BMI, %Hb1Ac, du -
ration of T2DM, serum triglycerides and transaminase levels. 
In the subset of studies for which liver fat content (LFC) mea -
surements and CFB in LFC, triglycerides and %Hb1Ac were 
available in both PNPLA3 IM/MM and II genetic subgroups, 
meta- regression was also performed using the mean difference 
of these factors as covariates. The Benjamini-  Hochberg method 
for multiple comparisons was applied to control the false dis -
covery rate (FDR) and adjusted p was considered significant 
when < 0.05. Publication bias was assessed through a trim-  and- 
fill contour-  enhanced funnel plot. The results from the meta- 
analysis were presented in a forest plot.
2.10   |   Reporting Bias Assessment
Pre- registration of the study protocol in a publicly accessible 
registry and pre-  specification of genetic subgroup analysis for 
PNPLA3 I148M was evaluated for all included studies as a mea -
sure for reporting bias.
2.11   |   Certainty Assessment
All included studies were discussed in the context of their risk 
of bias assessments, meaning that outcomes from studies with 
intermediate or high risk of bias were nuanced using that per -
spective during the narrative synthesis of results. For the meta- 
analysis, every study was weighted according to its 95% CI; 
based thereon, a proportional symbol size was given in the sum-
marising forest plot.
3   |   Results
3.1   |   Study Selection
Thirty- five unique records were retrieved based on the pre- 
defined search criteria, and 27 records were excluded after pre- 
screening for keywords. The full texts of the remaining eight 
reports were assessed for the in-  and exclusion criteria (Table S1), 
after which two records were excluded. Five additional records 
were identified through citation searching and retrieved for 
full- text screening, of which two were retained. Overall, eight 
full- text reports covering thirteen unique studies were included 
in the systematic review (Figure  S1), of which five accounted 
for baseline transaminase levels, which were included in the 
meta- analysis.
3.2   |   Study Characteristics
Study characteristics are summarised in Table  1. From the thir-
teen unique studies, Liu et  al. [ 27] combined the randomised 
TOTXV and TOTXVI studies into one discovery cohort; there -
fore, these studies are discussed as one cohort. Liu et  al. also 
reported on a replication cohort that is the randomised con -
trolled trial (RCT) AALL0232. The report by Guzman et  al. 
[22] covered a randomised crossover study (GLDI) and a RCT 
(GLDJ), and the report by Pillai et al. [ 25] included three RCTs, 
namely IMAGINE-  2, IMAGINE-  4 and IMAGINE-  5. Further, 
Yang et al. [28] included two studies, the RCTs AALL0232 and 
AALL0434, and the remaining reports yielded one study each. 
Two of these studies, by Feagins et al. [ 24] and Sundbaum et al. 
[21], were case–control studies and another two studies, by 
Capone et al. [ 23] and Gutierrez-  Camino et al. [ 26], were retro -
spective cohort studies. The duration of treatment covered by 
the studies varied from 4 weeks to 12 months, with some treat -
ments running for several years.
The included studies covered a total of 8235 patients, of which 
602 received treatment with a small molecule, 3221 with a bi -
ological agent, and 4412 were treated with a chemotherapy 
protocol consisting of multiple drugs. Patients were treated 
for inflammatory diseases (rheumatoid arthritis, Crohn's dis -
ease, psoriatic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis), multiple scle -
rosis, type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), or acute lymphoblastic 
leukaemia (ALL). Details of all treatments are provided in 
Table S3. Overall, the allelic frequencies were 0.712 and 0.288 
for PNPLA3 148I and 148M, respectively, and II/IM/MM gen -
otype frequencies were 0.527/0.370/0.103. Both the allelic and 
genotype frequencies were similar to those reported for the gen -
eral population in the 1000 Genomes Project Phase 3 [ 29]. Five 
studies were conducted in paediatric patients. Study participant 
characteristics are summarised in Table S4 .
Studies used various outcome measures (Table  1) such as ALT/
AST numerically expressed as fold of the ULN or as CFB, or 
ALT/AST categorically expressed as a grade of hepatotoxicity 
according to various criteria (e.g., common terminology criteria 
for adverse events (CTCAE) versions 3.0 and 4.0). None of the 
included studies were primarily powered to detect a difference 
in this outcome based on PNPLA3 I148M genotype.
3.3   |   Risk of Bias in Studies
Results of the bias analyses are summarised in Tables  S5–S7. 
None of the studies prespecified our outcome of interest in their 
study protocol, resulting in some concerns of bias in the domain 
‘selection of the reported result’ for all studies.
Some studies were assessed for risk of bias as a cohort study 
despite being originally randomised trials, due to their specific 
post hoc analyses resembling a cohort study design. This was 
the case for TOTXV + TOTXVI and AALL0232 (Liu et al. [ 27]), 
and AALL0232 and AALL0434 (Yang et al. [ 28]). The study by 
Guttierez- Camino et al. [ 26] was determined to have a serious 
risk of confounding (Domain 1), as the report did not mention 
any evaluation or correction for potential confounding domains; 
nor did it mention the measurement or gradation of ALT levels 
before treatment initiation. Similarly, baseline ALT levels were 
unavailable for the AALL0232 study reported by Liu et al. [ 27] 
and only gradations using the CTCAE 4.0 criteria were avail -
able; thus, the analysis was performed using cases (grade > 2) 
and controls (grade ≤ 2). Therefore, this study was considered 
to have a moderate risk of bias due to missing data (Domain 5).

As outcome assessors could have been aware of the treatment 
received by the patients in all evaluated studies, the risk of 
bias in Domain 6 was considered moderate. Baseline transam -
inase levels were also not available for both the AALL0232 and 
AALL0434 studies as reported by Yang et al. [ 28], resulting in 
a moderate risk of bias due to missing data (Domain 5). The re -
maining non- randomised study, TOTXV + TOTXVI as reported 
by Liu et al. [27], had a low overall risk of bias.
All randomised trials had a low overall risk of bias, except for 
the IMAGINE-  5 trial by Pillai et al. [ 25], which was determined 
to have a high risk of bias in Domain 2 due to its open- label study 
design. Further, outcome assessors were also aware of the treat -
ment received by the patients, raising some concerns of bias in 
Domain 4 as well.
Both case–control studies were determined to have some con -
cerns of bias. In the study by Feagins et al. [ 24], this was mainly 
due to the fact that all but one of the participants were male. 
In the study of Sundbaum et al. [ 21], concerns arose from the 
likelihood that the study was underpowered to detect an effect 
of PNPLA3 I148M.

Sundbaum et al. [ 21] investigated the effect of PNPLA3 I148M 
on ALT elevation after 6 months of methotrexate treatment 
for rheumatoid arthritis, and did not find a significant asso -
ciation between either an increase of ALT > 1.5- fold the ULN 
(OR = 0.3147 [0.0845–1.132], p = 0.0768) or peak ALT (beta es -
timate = −0.08791 [ −0.2650–0.08913], p = 0.3317) (Table  2), 
although a trend towards a detrimental effect for the II group 
was seen. It should be noted that in this study, 50% of patients 
included as cases had a history of ALT elevations compared to 
12.5% of the controls ( p = 0.001) which might have biased the 
results. Furthermore, the study was powered at 80% to detect 
an OR of ±7.5 at a genome- wide level for a marker with a minor 
allele frequency of 0.4. Considering the reported minor allele 
frequencies of 0.083 in cases and 0.206 in controls, this study 
was underpowered to detect more subtle effects of this specific 
variant [ 29]. Therefore, no general conclusion can be drawn 
regarding a possible effect of the PNPLA3 I148M variant on 
methotrexate- induced ALT/AST elevations.
The report by Guzman et al. [ 22] covered two separate studies 
concerning treatment with the glucagon receptor antagonist 
adomeglivant (LY2409021) in patients with T2DM. The first 
study was a 6-  week randomised cross-  over study in which 246 
patients received either placebo or adomeglivant, alongside 
diet and exercise alone or in combination with a stable dose of 
metformin. While no difference in ALT CFB was found based 
on PNPLA3 I148M genotype during the placebo treatment, 
the CFB in the treatment arm was significantly higher in pa -
tients carrying the PNPLA3 I148M variant ( p = 0.005). PNPLA3 
I148M explained 4.22% of variance in ALT CFB in the adomeg -
livant arm compared to 0.2% in the placebo arm. While no nu -
merical values were reported, the mean CFB interpreted from 
Figure  1A in the article was around 7.4, 14.7 and 14 IU/L for 
II, IM and MM genotypes, respectively [ 22]. The second study 
was a randomised placebo and active comparator-  controlled 
trial in which 158 T2DM patients on a stable dose of metformin 
and a sulfonylurea received either placebo, active comparator 
(sitagliptin) or adomeglivant. Similar to the first study, no dif -
ference in CFB based on PNPLA3 I148M was found for the pla -
cebo and sitagliptin group, whereas in the adomeglivant group, 
ALT CFB was increased in carriers of the PNPLA3 I148M vari -
ant (p = 0.059, p < 0.1 was considered significant). In this study, 
PNPLA3 I148M explained 7.29% of variance in the adomeg -
livant group compared to 5.79% and 0.44% in the sitagliptin and 
placebo groups, respectively. The mean CFB interpreted from 
Figure 1B was around 4.3, 13.2 and 31.8 IU/L for II, IM and MM 
genotypes, respectively [22] (Table 2). Taken together, these two 
studies support the hypothesis that the PNPLA3 I148M variant 
potentiates ALT elevations upon treatment with adomeglivant.
3.4.2   |   Biological Agents
The five studies employing biological agents covered varying 
diseases and therapeutic classes. Feagins et al. [ 24] conducted 
a case–control study in patients with inflammatory diseases re -
ceiving treatment with tumour necrosis factor alpha inhibitors 
(Table S3). They reported that the PNPLA3 I148M minor allele 
was more frequent in patients who developed transaminase ele -
vations exceeding the ULN compared to matched controls (75% 
of cases compared to 38% of inflammatory controls, p = 0.31). 
However, the study included only eight cases, all male and the 
magnitudes of transaminase elevations were not ascertained, 
questioning the relevance of these results.
Capone et al. [ 23] investigated the effect of PNPLA3 I148M on 
transaminase elevations exceeding the ULN upon treatment 
with interferon beta 1 alpha (IFNβ-  1α) for multiple sclerosis. In 
their retrospective cohort study covering 113 patients, they found 
that carriage of the PNPLA3 I148M variant (IM/MM) increased 
the risk of such elevations (OR = 2.82 [1.08–7.83], p < 0.05).
In the report by Pillai et al. [25], the association between PNPLA3 
I148M and CFB in ALT and/or AST after treatment with basal 
insulin peglispro (LY2605541) was investigated in three ran -
domised active comparator-  controlled studies, IMAGINE-  2, 
IMAGINE-  4 and IMAGINE-  5, and a pooled analysis was also 
conducted. In IMAGINE-  2, 1364 insulin naïve T2DM patients 
who were on at least two stable-  dose oral antihyperglycaemic 
medications received treatment with either peglispro or active 
comparator insulin glargine. While no statistically significant 
effect of PNPLA3 I148M was found at the interim analysis after 
26 weeks, both ALT and AST mean CFB were significantly 
higher in carriers of the variant after 52 weeks of treatment with 
peglispro (II/IM/MM, ALT: 2.46, 6.31, 4.74 IU/L, p < 0.001; AST: 
2.50, 4.33, 3.14 IU/L, p = 0.023). A similar effect was found in the 
active comparator group although in that case, specifically ho -
mozygous carriage of PNPLA3 I148M predisposed patients to 
increased ALT and AST CFB (II/IM/MM, ALT: − 2.76, −2.89, 
2.76 IU/L, p = 0.021; AST: −0.70, −0.95, 3.55 IU/L, p = 0.008). 
In the IMAGINE-  4 trial, 1284 T2DM patients on insulin lispro 
were treated with either peglispro or active comparator insulin 
glargine for 26 weeks. Significantly increased ALT and AST 
mean CFB values were found in carriers of the PNPLA3 I148M

not in the active comparator group. This effect seemed most pro-
nounced in homozygous carriers of the variant allele. In both 
aforementioned studies, PNPLA3 I148M carriage was also as -
sociated with increased ALT and AST at baseline (IMAGINE-  2, 
p = 0.007 for both and IMAGINE-  4, p < 0.001 and p = 3.75 × 10−3 
respectively). In the IMAGINE-  5 trial, 428 T2DM patients who 
were already on insulin, or with up to three stable-  dose oral an-
tihyperglycaemic medications, were switched to either peglispro 
or glargine for 52 weeks. At the interim analysis after 26 weeks, 
mean ALT and AST CFB were significantly increased in the peg-
lispro group (II/IM/MM, ALT: 7.55, 13.90, 15.36 IU/L, p = 0.001; 
AST: 3.49, 8.46, 10.18 IU/L, p < 0.001) but not the glargine group. 
After 52 weeks, these effects persisted (II/IM/MM ALT: 6.78, 
12.33, 8.67 IU/L, p = 0.009; AST: 3.32, 7.15, 5.45 IU/L, p = 0.019). 
The pooled analysis of all three aforementioned studies further 
emphasised the association between PNPLA3 I148M and in -
creases in CFB of both ALT and AST after 26 weeks of treatment 
(II/IM/MM, ALT: 5.27, 6.05, 8.60 IU/L, p = 0.019, AST: 2.89, 
3.72, 6.36 IU/L, p < 0.001) (Table 2). Taken together, these stud -
ies provide some evidence for a link between PNPLA3 I148M 
and moderate serum transaminase elevations after treatment 
with basal insulin peglispro in T2DM patients.
3.4.3   |   Combinatory Chemotherapy Protocols
Five studies investigating chemotherapeutic treatment protocols 
for children with ALL (Table  S3) were included. A retrospective 
study by Gutierrez-  Camino et  al. [ 26] reported an association 
between carriage of PNPLA3 I148M and the occurrence of 
ALT and/or AST elevations > 5.1- fold the ULN during the in -
duction phase of treatment for B-  cell lineage ALL with LAL/
SHOP94/99/2005 protocols in a Spanish cohort of 138 children 
(OR = 2.69 [1.09–6.64], p = 0.029). However, this study appeared 
to be bias- prone (Table S5).
The report by Liu et al. [27] included 715 patients in a discovery 
cohort and 2285 patients in a replication cohort. The authors in-
vestigated the impact of PNPLA3 I148M on ALT levels during 
the induction phase of treatment (Table  S3). Median increases 
in ALT per PNPLA3 I148M minor allele of 10 and 15 IU/L were 
reported for TOTXV and TOTXVI, respectively ( p < 0.001 for 
both), resulting in a pooled median increase of 12 IU/L per al -
lele ( p = 0.032). Linear regression analysis further showed an 
association between PNPLA3 I148M and ALT increases during 
the induction phase (exponent beta = 1.29 [1.18–1.40], p < 0.001). 
In this study, PNPLA3 I148M explained 3.8% of variance in 
postinduction ALT elevations, and PNPLA3 I148M remained 
a significant risk factor for postinduction ALT elevations when 
baseline ALT was included as a covariate ( p < 0.001). Analysis 
in the replication cohort confirmed these findings, showing an 
association between PNPLA3 I148M and the occurrence of ALT 
elevations > 5- fold the ULN ( p = 0.024), yet no baseline ALT 
levels were reported, and therefore this result might be biased 
(Table 2).
The report by Yang et al. [28] included similar studies, but in this 
case, the entire duration of treatment was considered. The first 
study, AALL0232, involved 2283 children receiving treatment 
for B-  cell lineage ALL, while the second study, AALL0434, 
included 1274 children being treated for T-  cell lineage ALL 
(Table  S3). An association between PNPLA3 I148M and ALT 
and/or AST elevations > 5- fold the ULN was observed in both 
the AALL0232 study (OR = 1.26 [1.12–1.41], p < 0.001) and 
AALL0434 study (OR = 1.29 [1.07–1.55], p = 0.007), and in a 
pooled analysis (OR = 1.27 [1.15–1.40], p < 0.002). No interac -
tion with treatment phase was found for this effect ( p = 0.78) 
(Table 2). However, it should be noted that baseline ALT and 
AST levels were not available in these studies.
Altogether, these studies provide moderate evidence that the 
PNPLA3 I148M variant may enhance transaminase elevations 
in paediatric patients upon treatment with chemotherapeutics 
in the context of ALL.
3.5   |   Results of Syntheses
3.5.1   |   Narrative Synthesis
Results of the narrative synthesis are visually summarised in 
Figure  1. Moderate evidence suggests that the PNPLA3 I148M 
variant potentiates elevations in serum aminotransferases fol -
lowing treatment with biological agents for inflammatory and 
metabolic diseases, chemotherapeutic protocols in the con -
text of ALL, and treatment with the small molecule adomeg -
livant for T2DM. There is low to no evidence that individuals 
who are homozygous for the PNPLA3 major allele (II) may 
be at increased risk of ALT elevations after treatment with 
methotrexate.
Some paediatric studies reported on a higher hepatocellular 
DILI risk in children with PNPLA3 I148M following ALL treat -
ment (ALT and/or AST ≥ 3- fold ULN), but none of the included 
studies could show a definite effect of PNPLA3 I148M on clin -
ically relevant hepatocellular DILI because of lacking baseline 
transaminase levels and individual- level total bilirubin and ALP 
levels.
3.5.2   |   Meta- Analysis
All studies included in the meta-  analysis encompassed patients 
with metabolic impairment, as the study population in all stud -
ies consisted of patients with T2DM. Further, all patients were 
on treatment with diet and exercise or at least one anti-  diabetic 
medication at a stable dose (i.e., metformin, sulfonylurea and/
or insulin) prior to study initiation (Table S3). For three of these 
studies, LFC measurements by magnetic resonance imaging 
within each PNPLA3 I148M genetic subgroup were available; 
these data suggest that overall these patient populations exhib -
ited hepatic steatosis at baseline (LFC around 10%) without sig -
nificant differences between the IM/MM and II groups (13.7% 
vs. 12.3%, Table S4).
A random effects model suggested that individuals carrying 
PNPLA3 IM/MM genotypes may develop higher serum ami -
notransferase levels after treatment with the small molecule 
adomeglivant and the biological basal insulin peglispro, both 
agents that are known to influence lipid metabolism, compared

studies (τ 2 = 0.0295 [0.0000–0.8722]; I2 = 46.5% [0.0–80.4]; and 
Q = 7.48, p = 0.1127). Asymmetry of the contour-  enhanced fun -
nel plot (Figure  S2) suggested that publication bias might be 
present, which was supported by the addition of two studies by 
the trim- and- fill method to achieve symmetry. However, the im-
pact hereof was limited as the adjusted trim-  and- fill random ef-
fects estimate did not deviate from the original result (OR = 1.39 
[1.12–1.72], p = 0.0024). Meta-  regression did not reveal signifi -
cant contributions from differences between PNPLA3 IM/MM 
and II subgroups in baseline factors such as age, sex, duration of 
T2DM, BMI, serum triglycerides, %Hb1Ac and transaminase lev-
els. Moreover, in the subgroup for which LFC measurements and 
CFB in LFC, triglycerides and %Hb1Ac were available in both 
PNPLA3 genetic subgroups, inclusion of these covariates did not 
significantly change the outcome of the meta- analysis (Table S8).
3.6   |   Reporting Biases
Four studies did not mention registration of the study protocol. 
Only one registered study protocol included the investigation 
of pharmacogenetic predictors for treatment-  related outcomes; 
however, it did not specify the investigation of PNPLA3 I148M 
(Table S9). Altogether, these factors may have contributed to se -
lective reporting and publication bias.
4   |   Discussion
DILI is a major cause of acute liver injury [ 3, 4], but the contrib-
uting host factors are poorly defined. In this systematic review 
with meta-  analysis, we found no definite effect of PNPLA3 
I148M on the occurrence of clinically relevant DILI, although 
the meta-  analysis suggested that carriage of the variant could 
confer susceptibility to develop increased serum transami -
nases in response to drugs that influence lipid metabolism 
(i.e., adomeglivant and basal insulin peglispro in the context 
of T2DM). Similar results were seen in a study from the USA 
DILI Network, where no association between PNPLA3 I148M 
and the risk of development, severity, or outcome of DILI caused 
by 177 agents in a cohort of 832 cases and 10 397 controls was 
seen, although the authors noted that the variant could still be 
involved in DILI related to specific drugs [ 30]. In this context, 
a phenome-  wide association study suggested that carriage of 
PNPLA3 I148M may be associated with aspirin-  and ibuprofen- , 
but not naproxen- related DILI [31]. Because these findings were 
only supported by data from one out of four included cohorts, 
which relied on questionnaire-  based self- reports as a source for 
the phenotypes, further investigation and independent replica -
tion are needed.
The underlying mechanisms that could explain the findings 
of the present study are unclear but likely lie in the context of 
lipid metabolism. The PNPLA3 I148M variant has been linked 
to elevated transaminase levels in both adults and children 
[10, 32], and treatments causing or contributing to hepatic lipid 
accumulation may hence amplify this effect. In this context, 
insulin is known to promote hepatic de novo lipogenesis and 
hyperinsulinemia, which occurs in insulin-  resistant individu -
als, can result in hepatic steatosis [ 33]. In patients with insulin 
resistance, the PNPLA3 I148M variant has also been linked 
to reduced circulating very low-  density lipoprotein (VLDL) 
particles that are smaller in size compared to those found in 
non- carriers of the variant [ 34]. A recent study suggested that 
FIGURE 1     |    Narrative synthesis of results. Some evidence suggests that carriage of a PNPLA3 I148M minor allele confers susceptibility to 
develop more pronounced aminotransferase elevations in response to drugs, although not all studies accounted for baseline transaminase levels. 
Based on the criteria of Hy's law, there is no evidence that PNPLA3 I148M increases the propensity to develop clinically relevant hepatocellular drug- 
induced liver injury, although it might occur more frequently in paediatric patients carrying PNPLA3 I148M following treatment with chemotherapy 
protocols. I and M represent a major or minor allele, respectively. PNPLA3, Patatin- like phospholipase domain-  containing protein 3.

impaired lipidation of VLDL and reduced triglyceride secre -
tion could be key contributors to PNPLA3 I148M-  mediated 
hepatic steatosis. Under lipogenic stimulation, wild-  type 
PNPLA3 plays a crucial role in mobilising polyunsaturated 
fatty acids from the triglyceride pool to synthesise phospholip -
ids, which are in turn used for the synthesis and secretion of 
large, triglyceride-  rich VLDLs, while this process is impaired 
for PNPLA3 I148M [ 35].
Data from multiple phase 2 and 3 trials comparing basal insu -
lin peglispro and insulin glargine for treatment of both type 1 
and type 2 diabetes suggested that basal insulin peglispro, de -
spite being superior in lowering HbA1c, caused ALT elevations 
in both study populations which were more often found to be 
> 3- fold the ULN when compared to glargine. Moreover, in type 
1 diabetes mellitus and T2DM patients previously treated with 
basal insulin, basal insulin peglispro caused a significant in -
crease in LFC which was not observed in the glargine treatment 
group. The absence of this effect in the insulin naïve popula -
tion suggests that withdrawal of basal insulin, and thus loss of 
suppression of peripheral lipolysis, may have contributed to this 
effect. A positive correlation was found between increased LFC 
and increases in ALT and triglycerides, irrespective of the study 
population [36]. Given that the prevalence of MASLD in patients 
with T2DM is around 65% [ 37], a further study investigated 
whether carriage of genetic polymorphisms linked to MASLD 
could further explain these findings. Pillai et al. [25] found that a 
switch from basal insulins, which suppress lipolysis, to hepato- 
preferential basal insulin peglispro, resulted in higher serum 
transaminase elevations in carriers of the PNPLA3 I148M 
variant. When peripheral lipolysis receives less suppression 
from insulin, the flux of free fatty acids to the liver increases, 
resulting in triglyceride re-  esterification, VLDL secretion, and 
thus increased hepatic lipid turnover. Furthermore, systemic 
palmitate flux was found to be 35% higher in patients with type 1 
diabetes treated with peglispro than those treated with glargine 
[38]. Considering that PNPLA3 I148M impairs VLDL lipidation, 
and that patients with MASLD who carry the PNPLA3 I148M 
variant benefit especially from interventions that reduce hepatic 
fatty acid flux such as lifestyle interventions, loss of peripheral 
suppression of lipolysis by conventional insulins may have an 
enhanced impact on hepatic steatosis in these patients [15].
Elevation of serum transaminases was a common side-  effect 
observed in clinical trials investigating glucagon receptor antag -
onists, and liver injury was one of the key safety concerns re -
sulting in cessation of their clinical development [39]. While the 
exact mechanisms behind this adverse effect remain to be elu -
cidated, a recent study showed that a physiological increase in 
circulating glucagon stimulates hepatic mitochondrial oxidation 
in both healthy controls and individuals with liver steatosis, and 
several (dual) glucagon receptor agonists are currently under 
investigation in clinical trials for obesity, T2DM and MASLD 
[40–42]. In both a 6- week and 6- month trial, the glucagon recep-
tor antagonist adomeglivant caused marked elevations of serum 
aminotransferases in patients with T2DM and PNPLA3 IM/MM 
genotypes compared to II carriers. This was not observed in the 
placebo or active comparator groups and thus suggests that an 
interaction between adomeglivant and carriage of PNPLA3 
I148M may contribute to the observed transaminase elevations. 
Since the PNPLA3 I148M variant has been linked to hepatic mi -
tochondrial dysfunction and increased mitochondrial stress in 
humans, further impairment of hepatic mitochondrial function 
due to blocking glucagon receptor signalling could have been 
one of the mechanisms that contributed to this effect [ 43].
In the context of cancer treatments, a recent study demon -
strated that an interaction between oestrogen receptor alpha

and PNPLA3 I148M may contribute to steatotic liver disease 
susceptibility in women. In  vitro data showed that exposure 
to the selective oestrogen receptor modulator tamoxifen, used 
for treatment of oestrogen-  sensitive cancers, resulted in upreg -
ulation of PNPLA3 mRNA and protein levels, as well as accu -
mulation of PNPLA3 I148M on intracellular lipid droplets in 
HepG2 cells [ 44]. As tamoxifen intake has been linked to the 
development of hepatic steatosis in patients [ 45], it is plausible 
that carriage of the PNPLA3 I148M variant may worsen the de -
velopment of DILI in such cases. Unfortunately, no studies re -
garding tamoxifen- related DILI were found in the context of this 
systematic review; clinical data is needed to further investigate 
this possible interaction.
Some evidence was found that carriers of PNPLA3 I148M may 
develop excess hepatotoxicity in response to combinatory chemo-
therapy protocols in the paediatric population. Although these 
data are complex to interpret, it remains valuable to explore a 
possible effect of PNPLA3 I148M on increased serum transami -
nase levels in this context, given that individuals receiving these 
treatments often develop hepatotoxicity. Identifying one specific 
agent that was responsible for the observed transaminase ele -
vations is unfeasible, and also other factors beyond chemother -
apeutics may contribute to it, including hepatic infiltration of 
ALL and drugs used in supportive care, such as antibiotics [ 28]. 
The included studies by Lui et  al. [ 27] and Gutierrez-  Camino 
et al. [26] reported PNPLA3 I148M as a possible driver to develop 
elevated serum transaminases after induction therapy with 
the TOTXV, TOTXVI and LAL/SHOP/94/99/2005 protocols. 
A cross-  sectional study of 300 paediatric ALL patients receiv -
ing induction therapy with UKALL 2003 protocols, including 
PEGylated asparaginase, vincristine and dexamethasone, con -
firmed these findings at the organ level by showing a significant 
association between PNPLA3 I148M and postinduction hepa -
to(spleno)megaly (dominant logistic regression model, OR = 3.79 
[2.29–6.28], p adjusted < 0.05) [46]. This association was inde -
pendent of age, sex, ALL lineage, or the addition of daunorubicin 
to the protocol. The induction regimens of the aforementioned 
studies all included asparaginase, vincristine and a corticoste -
roid, with some also including methotrexate, daunorubicin, or 
cytarabine. Liu et al. found in their discovery cohort that postin-
duction ALT elevations were associated with the TOTXVI treat -
ment protocol, which uses PEGylated asparaginase ( p = 0.025), 
and additional doses of asparaginase ( p < 0.001). Notably, grade 
2–3 ALT elevations were more frequently observed in patients 
treated with the TOTXVI protocol than in those receiving the 
TOTXV protocol (p = 5.8 × 10−3). Moreover, the TOTXV protocol 
included high-  dose methotrexate, while the TOTXVI protocol 
did not. These findings somewhat suggest that asparaginase, 
and particularly the more potent PEGylated form used in the 
TOTXVI protocol, is the predominant driver of postinduction 
ALT elevations in this cohort. In mice, rather than having di -
rect hepatotoxic effects, PEGylated asparaginase was found to 
induce lipolysis in adipose tissue, hereby increasing fatty acid 
flux to the liver, resulting in steatosis. This activation of lipolysis 
was confirmed in an in  vitro model using differentiated 3T3- 
L1 adipocytes, leading to increased non-  esterified fatty acids in 
the cell culture supernatant [47]. It is plausible that the PNPLA3 
I148M variant amplifies this indirect mechanism of hepatotox -
icity in a similar manner as discussed for basal insulin peglispro, 
by increasing hepatic retention and reducing VLDL-  mediated 
secretion of triglycerides. However, the study by Yang et al. [ 28] 
reported that the effect of PNPLA3 I148M on serum transam -
inase elevations was unrelated to treatment phase, suggesting 
that patients with this variant may have an overall increased 
susceptibility to hepatotoxicity, rather than an interaction with 
a specific treatment agent.
In line with this, apart from some specific lipid metabolism- 
related effects mediated by PNPLA3 I148M, a higher burden of 
pre- existing MASLD in the PNPLA3 I148M groups could have 
made these individuals more prone to develop hepatotoxicity 
[48, 49]. A large study including 4837 individuals with suspected 
MASLD and controls investigated the risk of suspected DILI 
caused by the top 10 medications that most frequently cause 
DILI. Suspected DILI was defined as ALT > 200 IU/L, alka -
line phosphatase > 250 IU/L and/or total bilirubin > 2.5 mg/dL 
within 3 months of drug prescription at two or more consecutive 
laboratory tests. Suspected DILI occurred in 0.8% of the group 
with suspected MASLD, which was significantly higher com -
pared to the controls without MASLD (0.2%), suggesting that 
MASLD can be a relevant condition predisposing to hepatotox -
icity [50]. The relation between DILI and PNPLA3 I148M could 
therefore be bidirectional, with some drugs enhancing liver 
steatosis and pre-  existing liver disease predisposing to develop 
DILI [51]. Indeed, pre-  existing liver disease can also alter drug 
pharmacokinetics and MASLD has been specifically linked 
to clinically important reductions in expression of CYP2C19, 
which is responsible for the metabolism of many drugs [ 52, 53]. 
Thus, although PNPLA3 is not a pharmacogene, it is plausible 
that the resulting liver- related effects caused by the I148M vari -
ant can indirectly influence pharmacokinetics and DILI poten -
tial of drugs [53, 54].
Moreover, several studies have reported a synergistic interaction 
between PNPLA3 I148M and BMI when it comes to elevated 
serum ALT and hepatic steatosis [ 55, 56]. Notably, in both chil -
dren and adults with steatotic liver disease, BMI above 30 kg/m2 
was found to confer an exponential increase in the relationship 
between PNPLA3 I148M and risk for advanced fibrosis [ 57]. 
Whether this interaction also affects the risk for hepatocellular 
DILI remains unclear. In the meta-  regression, the mean differ -
ence between PNPLA3 IM/MM and II in baseline BMI did not 
significantly affect the odds of enlarged serum aminotransferase 
elevations (estimate = −0.4026, adjusted p = 0.196), nor did base-
line BMI in the PNPLA3 IM/MM group (estimate = −0.0979, 
adjusted p = 0.211). In a study regarding treatment with basal 
insulin peglispro in insulin-  naïve patients with T2DM, CFB in 
LFC was found to correlate negatively with baseline BMI. The 
same study did report a positive correlation between CFB in LFC 
and CFB in BMI, irrespective of previous insulin treatment, sug-
gesting that it is not the patients with a high baseline BMI that 
are at risk but rather the patients who exhibit an increase in this 
parameter during treatment [ 36]. Unfortunately, CFB BMI data 
per PNPLA3 I148M genetic subgroup were not available for any 
of the studies in the meta-  regression. Interestingly, in the GLDJ 
study, patients with PNPLA3 MM genotype had a lower baseline 
BMI (II/IM/MM, mean BMI: 32.6, 31.4, 26.9 kg/m, p - value not 
declared), yet they exhibited larger elevations in ALT compared 
to patients with PNPLA3 II and IM genotypes after treatment 
with adomeglivant (Δ mean CFB MM vs. II ≈ 28 IU/L, vs. IM 
≈20 IU/L) [22]. Similarly, carriers of the PNPLA3 I148M variant 
15 of 17
in the pooled IMAGINE trials exhibited a slightly lower BMI at 
baseline (II/IM/MM, mean BMI: 32.92, 32.34, 32.38, p = 0.03) 
yet exhibited a significantly higher CFB in ALT, AST and LFC 
after treatment with basal insulin peglispro [ 25]. It should be 
noted that for all studies in the meta-  analysis, the mean BMI 
was above 30 kg/m2 in both the PNPLA3 II and PNPLA3 IM/
MM groups. Further, Liu et al. reported a positive correlation be-
tween postinduction ALT elevations and BMI percentile, which 
remained significant after adjustment for PNPLA3 I148M car -
riage ( p = 0.0027). Nevertheless, data regarding the interaction 
between PNPLA3 I148M and either baseline or CFB BMI on 
drug- induced serum aminotransferase elevations are scarce, 
and further investigation is needed.
Our study should be interpreted in the context of its limitations. 
While elevations in ALT and AST are sensitive signals of hepa -
tocellular injury, especially AST is an unspecific parameter and 
can be increased because of, for example, cardiac toxicity and 
muscle damage. In line with this, there was insufficient data to 
cover all parameters of Hy's law as a more specific measure of 
potential severe hepatocellular DILI [ 7, 8], although most stud -
ies did not report on severe DILI cases. Second, the included 
studies were not primarily powered to detect differences be -
tween PNPLA3 I148M subgroups and were retrospective in na -
ture, which are sources of bias that could not be controlled for. 
Third, the relatively small number of studies, along with the het-
erogeneity of their summary measures, are additional possibly 
biasing factors, while severe DILI is rare and most compounds 
had a relatively safe toxicity profile [ 1, 2]. Last, not all studies 
ascertained the presence of MASLD or MASH that could have 
been more prevalent in the people carrying PNPLA3 I148M, 
which could have conferred an increased risk to develop hepa -
totoxicity [53, 54].
5   |   Conclusion
There is low to no evidence that carriage of PNPLA3 contrib -
utes to clinically relevant hepatocellular DILI; although it may 
amplify drug-  induced transaminase elevations attributed to 
adomeglivant and basal insulin peglispro, which are both known 
to influence liver lipid metabolism in individuals with meta -
bolic impairment. A higher prevalence or severity of MASLD 
may have mediated the observed effect of PNPLA3 I148M on 
the more pronounced increase of transaminases in response to 
these drugs.
