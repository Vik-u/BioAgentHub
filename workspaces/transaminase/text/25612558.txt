Role of L-alanine for redox self-sufficient amination
of alcohols
Stephanie Klatte and Volker F Wendisch*
Abstract
Background: In white biotechnology biocatalysis represents a key technology for chemical functionalization of
non-natural compounds. The plasmid-born overproduction of an alcohol dehydrogenase, an L-alanine-dependent
transaminase and an alanine dehydrogenase allows for redox self-sufficient amination of alcohols in whole cell
biotransformation. Here, conditions to optimize the whole cell biocatalyst presented in (Bioorg Med Chem 22:5578– 5585,
2014), and the role of L-alanine for efficient amine functionalization of 1,10-decanediol to 1,10-diaminodecane were
analyzed.
Results: The enzymes of the cascade for amine functionalization of alcohols were characterizedin vitroto find optimal
conditions for an efficient process. Transaminase fromChromobacterium violaceum,T aCv,s h o w e dt h r e e - f o l dh i g h e r
catalytic efficiency than transaminase fromVibrio fluvialis,T aVf, and improved production at 37°C. At 42°C, TaCv was
more active, which matched thermostable alcohol dehydrogenase and alanine dehydrogenase and improved the
1,10-diaminodecane production rate four-fold. To study the role of L-alanine in the whole cell biotransformation, the
L-alanine concentration was varied and 1,10.diaminodecane formation tested with constant 10 mM 1,10- decanediol
and 100 mM NH4Cl. Only 5.6% diamine product were observed without added L-alanine. L-alanine concentrations
equimolar to that of the alcohol enabled for 94% product formation but higher L-alanine concentrations allowed for
100% product formation. L-alanine was consumed by theE. colibiocatalyst, presumably due to pyruvate catabolism
since up to 16 mM acetate accumulated. Biotransformation employingE. colistrain YYC202/pTrc99a-ald-adh-taCv,w h i c h
is unable to catabolize pyruvate, resulted in conversion with a selectivity of 42 mol-%. Biotransformation with
E. colistrains only lacking pyruvate oxidase PoxB showed similar reduced amination of 1,10-decanediol indicating that
oxidative decarboxylation of pyruvate to acetate by PoxB is primarily responsible for pyruvate catabolism during redox
self-sufficient amination of alcohols using this whole cell biocatalyst.
Conclusion: The replacement of the transaminase TaVf by TaCv, which showed higher activity at 42°C, in the artificial
operon ald-adh-ta improved amination of alcohols in whole cell biotransformation. The addition of L-alanine, which was
consumed byE. colivia pyruvate catabolism, was required for 100% product formation possibly by providing maintenance
energy. Metabolic engineering revealed that pyruvate catabolism occurred primarily via oxidative decarboxylation to
acetate by PoxB under the chosen biotranformation conditions.

Background
White biotechnology is the key technology for alternative
and sustainable production of e.g. fine chemicals. Its ap-
plication in biocatalysis is considered a branch of Green
Chemistry which can replace or complement routes of
chemical modification and functionalization. Enzymes
catalyze reactions under mild conditions contrarily to
chemical catalysts which often demands high pressure and
temperature as well as toxic solvents. Among others,
amine functionalization of chemical compounds is an im-
portant approach in biocatalysis to produce (poly)amines
which are components of for example synthetics and coat-
ings. This can be performed by amino acid dehydroge-
nases catalyzing NADH-dependent reductive amination of
oxo-acids with ammonium or by transaminases transfer-
ring an amino group from a donor amine to a carbonyl
compound. The cofactor pyridoxal-phosphate is covalently
bound to the catalytic center ofω-transaminases to trans-
fer the amino group to the acceptor molecule [1,2].
Generally, in biocatalysis the use of a transaminase
instead of an amino-acid dehydrogenase offers the access
to a wider range of substrates since amino-acid dehy-
drogenases accept a restricted spectrum ofα-keto acids.
Coupling of both types of enzymes enables amine functio-
nalization of a wider range of carbonyl compounds from
ammonium in a redox dependent manner. Therefore,
redox cofactor recycling is important to reduce the
process costs. Cofactor recycling by cascading with, for ex-
ample, glucose dehydrogenase or formate dehydrogenase
or for whole cell biocatalysts with cellular glucose catabol-
ism have been developed [3,4]. A three enzyme cascade
for recycling redox cofactor and amino group donor has
been demonstrated in cell free biocatalysis using an ala-
nine dehydrogenase coupled with a L-alanine-dependent
transaminase and an alcohol dehydrogenase [5]. The ini-
tial alcohol oxidation by an alcohol dehydrogenase yields
NADH and the aldehyde which is converted to the amine
by L-alanine-dependent transamination (Figure 1A). Ala-
nine dehydrogenase recycles L-alanine using ammonium
and NADH releasing NAD+ as redox cofactor for the alco-
hol dehydrogenase. Recently, this concept of redox self-
sufficient amination of alcohols (Figure 1A) was realized
in a whole cell process withEscherichia coli by plasmid-
born overproduction of the alcohol dehydrogenase of
Bacillus stearothermophilus, the transaminase of Vibrio
fluvialis and the alanine dehydrogenase ofBacillus subtilis
[6]. Advantageously, the whole cell process only required
alcohol, L-alanine and ammonium but neither NAD nor
PLP. In principle, L-alanine addition is not required in
the three-enzyme-cascade and amination of alcohols to
amines should be possible with an ammonium salt. How-
ever, whole cells require energy to maintain viability as well
as for transport processes e.g. substrate uptake and prod-
uct export as well as protein synthesis under starvation or
other stress conditions. Since non-growing cells are typ-
ically used for whole cell biotransformation, the non-
growth-associated maintenance coefficient reflects the
cell’s requirement to catabolize an energy substrate such
as glucose to keep the cell’s viability and functionality.
Therefore, the role of L-alanine in the whole cell biotrans-
formation of alcohols to amines was analysed and condi-
tions for optimizing the whole cell biocatalyst towards
improved amino functionalization of alcohols were tested.
Results
Construction of the whole cell biocatalyst W3110/
pTrc99A-ald-adh-taCv and its comparison to W3110/
pTrc99A-ald-adh-taVf in vitro and in vivo
The whole cell biocatalyst W3110/pTrc99A-ald-adh-taVf
was previously shown to enable redox self-sufficient
amination of a variety of alcohols [6] and involved
thermo-sensitive transaminase fromVibrio fluvialis.D u et o
the thermostable alcohol dehydrogenase ofB. stearother-
mophilus an increased reaction temperature for redox
self-sufficient amination was considered to improve the
production rate. Therefore, the gene for the transaminase
of V. fluvialiswas replaced by the gene for the transaminase
of C. violaceum in the IPTG-inducible vector pTrc99A-
ald-adh-taVf.T h ev e c t o rw a su s e dt ot r a n s f o r mE. coli
W3110 to yield the whole cell biocatalyst W3110/pTrc99A-
ald-adh-taCv. Enzyme activity assays of the newly constructed
whole cell biocatalyst revealed that all three genes were func-
tionally expressed. The crude extracts displayed enzyme activ-
ities of 9.8 ± 1.1 and 0.55 ± 0.03 U/mg for the alanine
dehydrogenase and the alcohol dehydrogenase, respectively,
which was similar to the activities in W3110/pTrc99a-ald-
adh-taVf [6]. However, with (S)-(−)α-methylbenzylamine as
substrate, the specific activities of transaminase TaCv of 0.62 ±
0.01 in W3110/pTrc99a-ald-adh-taCv were two-fold higher
than that of TaVf in W3110/pTrc99a-ald-adh-taVf.
The catalytic efficiencies of both transaminases were es-
timated with L-alanine as donor substrate and hexanal as
acceptor substrate. Therefore, crude extracts of W3110/
pTrc99a-taVf and W3110/pTrc99a-taCv were assayed in a
50 mM potassium-phosphate buffer pH 7.4 with constant
hexanal and varying L-alanine concentrations at 37°C. The
L-alanine-dependent transamination of hexanal to hexyla-
mine could be detected for both transaminases and Km-
and Vmax-values for TaVf were 20 mM L-alanine and 0.3
U/mg, respectively, and 35 mM L-alanine and 2 U/mg, re-
spectively, for TaCv (Table 1). The catalytic efficiency
reflected by the Vmax/Km-value was 3-fold higher for TaCv
than for TaVf (0.06 compared to 0.02 U mg−1 mM−1).

NH4Cl resulted in 100% product formation employing
the newly derived catalyst W3110/pTrc99a-ald-adh-taCv
(Table 2) as well as employing the previously designed
W3110/pTrc99a-ald-adh-taVf [6]. When the L-alanine
concentration was reduced to 50 mM or 20 mM, pro-
duction of 1,10-diaminodecane using W3110/pTrc99a-ald-
adh-taCv and W3110/pTrc99a-ald-adh-taVf was reduced
to 84% and 86%, respectively, and 73% and 50%, respect-
ively (Table 2). HPLC analysis revealed that both strains
consumed between 16 and 30 mM L-alanine (Table 2).
Taken together, the newly constructed biocatalyst W3110/
pTrc99a-ald-adh-taCv showed higher activity and catalytic
efficiency with respect to the transaminase and higher se-
lectivity at 37°C and with low L-alanine concentrations.

The three-enzyme-cascade contains thermostable alcohol
dehydrogenase from the thermophilicB. stearothermophilus,
but little is known about the activity of the alanine de-
hydrogenase fromB. subtilisand the two transaminases of
V. fluvialis and C. violaceum at higher temperatures. The
activities of all enzymes were analyzed at varying tempera-
tures in crude extracts of W3110/pTrc99a-adh,W 3 1 1 0 /
pTrc99A-ald, W3110/pTrc99a-taVf as well as W3110/
pTrc99a-taCv. For the alanine dehydrogenase ofB. subtilis
and the alcohol dehydrogenase ofB. stearothermophilus,
enzyme activities increased with temperature ranging from
30°C to 60°C and 20 U/mg and 1.8 U/mg, respectively,
with maxima at about 60°C (Figure 2). The activity of the

transaminase ofV. fluvialis (TaVf) in the crude extract of
W3110/pTrc99a-taVf dropped from 0.5 U/mg to 0.03 U/mg
when the reaction temperature increased from 37°C to
42°C. The activity of transaminase ofC. violaceum (TaCv)
was also lower at 42°C (0.13 U/mg) than at 37°C (0.66
U/mg), but its activity at 42°C was four-fold higher than
that of TaVf at 42°C (Figure 2).
To assay the influence of the reaction temperature on
the amination cascade, whole cell biotransformations with
W3110/pTrc99a-ald-adh-taVf and W3110/pTrc99a-ald-
adh-taCv were performed at 37°C, 40°C and 42°C being
suitable temperatures for the hostE. coli. 1,10-decanediol
was chosen as a substrate since it was among the best
substrates of this cascade [5,7] and, moreover, the use
of this dialcohol allows for monitoring 1-amino-10-
decanol, an intermediate of diamine formation. The di-
amine production of both strains was compared in a
resting buffer system using 1,10-decanediol as substrate,
100 mM L-alanine and 100 mM NH4Cl. In vivoamination
of 1,10-decanediol performed by the two whole cell bio-
catalysts reached 100 mol-% selectivity after 24 hours at
37°C and production rates of about 0.06 g/g*h (0.35
mmole/g*h) were calculated (Figure 3). Furthermore, the
increase of the reaction temperature from 37°C to 40°C
and 42°C improved the production rates to 0.15 g/g*h (0.87
mmole/g*h) and 0.2 g/g*h (1.16 mmole/g*h), respectively,
when the newly constructed W3110/pTrc99a-ald-adh-taCv
was employed. Contrarily, with W3110/pTrc99a-ald-adh-
taVf substrate conversion to 1,10-diaminodecane (74% and
56%, respectively) and production rates (0.04 g/g*h and
0.03 g/g*h, respectively) were lower at 40°C and 42°C,
respectively, as compared to 37°C (Figure 3). Thus, under
the chosen conditions W3110/pTrc99a-ald-adh-taCv was
superior to W3110/pTrc99a-ald-adh-taVf at an elevated
temperature.
The role of L-alanine for the redox self-sufficient amination
of alcohols in a whole cell process
L-alanine was a component of the hitherto described redox
self-sufficient amination of alcohols with cascaded en-
zymes or as whole cell biotransformation [5,6] as well as in
the experiments described above to serve as amino group
donor in L-alanine-dependent transamination. However,
conceptually redox self-sufficient amination of alcohols
does not require the addition of L-alanine, but may pro-
ceed from ammonium only (Figure 1A). Thus, in order
to find out if external addition of L-alanine is necessary
to drive amination of 1,10-decanediol via this cascade,

varying L-alanine concentrations were assayed using
biocatalyst W3110/pTrc99a- ald-adh-taCv at 42°C with
a constant concentration of 100 mM NH 4Cl. At re-
duced L-alanine concentrations of 50 mM and 20 mM
complete conversion of 1,10-decanediol to 1,10-diami-
nodecane was observed after 6 hours. With 10 mM and
5 mM L-alanine selectivity was almost complete (94%
and 93%, respectively), whereas only 5.6% conversion
of 1,10-decanediol to 1,10-diaminodecane was observed
without adding L-alanine (Table 3). Thus, L-alanine has
to be present for efficient amination of alcohols using
biocatalyst W3110/pTrc99a-ald-adh-taCv.
L-alanine added was utilized completely (at 5 and
10 mM) or partially (at 20 and 50 mM) during the whole
cell biotransformation approach. Under certain condi-
tions, acetate accumulated as by-product. When L-alanine
was present at the same or lower concentrations as the
substrate 1,10-decanediol, acetate accumulation was not
observed, however, at higher L-alanine excess increasing

acetate concentrations could be observed (Table 3). L-
alanine (20 mM) was catabolized entirely in the absence of
the substrate 1,10-decanediol. Pyruvate only partially re-
placed L-alanine since only 70% product formation were
detected with 20 mM pyruvate. Taken together, these re-
sults indicate L-alanine consumption and acetate forma-
tion by the host’s central carbon metabolism.
To test if L-alanine consumption is important for the
redox self-sufficient amination of alcohols with this whole
cell biocatalyst or a dispensable side reaction, the host’s
pyruvate catabolism was blocked at various positions.E.
coli YYC202 cannot catabolize pyruvate (Figure 1) since it
lacks the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (deletion of
aceEF), phosphoenyl pyruvate synthetase (mutation ofpps),
pyruvate formate lyase (pflB)a n dp y r u v a t eo x i d a s e(poxB)
[7]. Heterologous overexpression ofald, adh and taCv in
E. coli YYC202 led to 42% conversion of 1,10-decanediol
to 1,10-diaminodecane as compared to 100 mol-% selectiv-
ity obtained with the reference strain MG1655/pTrc99a-
ald-adh-taCv (Figure 4). Since there are multiple metabolic
blocks inE. coli YYC202, additional strains were analysed
to identify which of the reactions blocked in E. coli
YYC202 is most important for pyruvate catabolism. It is
generally believed that pyruvate dehydrogenase complex
(PDHC) is important under aerobic conditions and pyru-
vate formate lyase (PFL) under anoxic conditions while
PoxB might be important during the transition between
exponential and stationary phase since under microaerobic
conditions both PDHC and PFL function poorly [8]. PoxB
also contributes to aerobic growth especially at low grow
rates [9]. It is known that the pyruvate oxidase genepoxB
is induced in the stationary growth phase and this induc-
tion is dependent on the alternative sigma factor RpoS
[10]. Thus, PoxB might be relevant under the conditions
of whole cell biotransformation that are characterized by
slow growth and limited oxygen. Therefore, poxB was
deleted in E. coli W3110 (s. Materials and method) and
the resulting mutant was transformed with pTrc99a-
ald-adh-taCv. The whole cell biocatalyst lacking only
poxB, W3110ΔpoxB/pTrc99a-ald-adh-taCv, showed about
two-fold reduced amination of 1-10-decanediol to 1,10-
diaminodecane (Figure 4) indicating that PoxB is the most
important enzyme for pyruvate catabolism under the
chosen biotransformation conditions. Moreover, sinceE.
coli strain differences have been observed to affect bio-
transformation [11], which may be relevant even between
the closely related strains W3110 and MG1655 used here
[12], the effect of the lack of PoxB was also analysed in a
different strain background, namely BW25113. Indeed,
E. coli BW25113/pTrc99a-ald-adh-taCv converted about
three times more (56%) 1,10-decanediol to 1,10-diamino-
decane than its poxB mutant (16%; Figure 4). Taken to-
gether, the addition of L-alanine and its catabolism via
pyruvate and pyruvate oxidase PoxB is important for effi-
cient amino functionalization of alcohols by the described
whole cell biocatalysts.
Discussion
Redox self-sufficient amination of alcohols by whole cell
biotransformation benefitted from replacing the trans-
aminase from V. fluvialis used previously [6] by trans-
aminase TaCv from C. violaceum [13] since it showed
higher activity at 42°C. Moreover, it showed higher cata-
lytic efficiency with L-alanine as substrate (Table 1). The
low activities of transaminases at 42°C appeared to be
limiting the efficiency of the whole cell biocatalyst since
alcohol dehydrogenase of B. stearothermophilus and L-
alanine dehydrogenase are rather thermostable (Figure 2)
[14,15]. Indeed, TaCv, which showed higher activity at
42°C than TaVf, allowed for efficient conversion of 1,10-
decanediol to 1,10-diaminodecane at 42°C. Shifting the
biotransformation temperature from 37°C to 42°C led to
about three-fold faster conversion employing W3110/
pTrc99a-ald-adh-taCv (Figure 3). Since at 37°C both
W3110/pTrc99a-ald-adh-taCv and W3110/pTrc99a-ald-
adh-taVf showed comparable production rates, the lower
catalytic efficiency of TaVf did not limit product forma-
tion under these conditions.
Addition of L-alanine was required for full and fast con-
version of 1,10-decanediol to 1,10-diaminodecane using
the whole cell biocatalyst for alcohol amination. The

to its isogenic parent MG1655, strain W3110ΔpoxB lacks poxB compared
to its isogenic parent W3110 and BW25113ΔpoxB lacks poxB compared to
its isogenic parent BW25113. All strains carried pTrc99a-ald-adh-taCv.

consumption of L-alanine over time suggested insufficient
L-alanine recycling and loss of pyruvate via the cellular ca-
tabolism (Figure 1B; Table 3). This was less pronounced at
higher 42°C possibly because under these conditions activ-
ities of both L-alanine dehydrogenase and alcohol de-
hydrogenase were increased allowing for more efficient
redox cofactor recycling.
L-alanine served two functions in the biotransform-
ation: As substrate in the transaminase reaction and to
provide energy and reduction equivalents to the whole cell
biocatalyst by catabolism of pyruvate, the co-product of
L-alanine-dependent transamination (Figure 1). Under the
non-growth conditions of whole cell biotransformation up
to 20 mM of alanine were consumed (Table 3) with a rate
of about 0.04 g/g*h, which is in the same order of magni-
tude as non-growth maintenance energy (0.055 to 0.07 g
of glucose/g*h). Pyruvate addition only partially replaced
L-alanine addition since product formation in the pres-
ence of 20 mM pyruvate was incomplete (70%; Table 3).
In part, L-alanine was catabolized to acetate. If pyruvate is
oxidatively decarboxylated to acetate by pyruvate oxidase
PoxB, a reduction equivalent (ubiquinol) is formed which
may be used (indirectly) for reductive amination by L-
alanine dehydrogenase in the cascade.E. coli is known to
produce acetate as overflow metabolite even under fully
aerobic conditions, e.g. with excess glucose [16] when 10% -
30% of carbon flux is directed to acetate formation [17].
Acetate may be formed under aerobic growth conditions
by the combined activities of pyruvate dehydrogenase
complex PDHC, phosphotransacetylase Pta and acetate
kinase AckA (Figure 1B). Besides the reduction equivalent
NADH, this pathway yields ATP. A third pathway may be
active as a mutant devoid ofpoxB, pta and ackA still pro-
duced acetate [18]. Fast catabolism of glucose to acetate
followed by its reuse via acetyl-CoA synthetase (Figure 1B)
may be advantageous in comparison to other microorgan-
isms present in its natural habitat that slowly convert the
limiting carbon source glucose [9]. In the absence of pyru-
vate oxidase PoxB conversion of 1,10-decanediol to 1,10-
diaminodecane was reduced in about the same way as
when PoxB and all other known enzymes for pyruvate
degradation were missing, thus, indicating that PoxB is
the major enzyme for pyruvate degradation under the
chosen biotransformation conditions. In the biotrans-
formation described here, the whole cell biocatalysts
were harvested in the stationary phase when PoxB
dominates.
Conclusions
The newly derived whole cell biocatalyst W3110/pTrc99a-
ald-adh-taCv allowed for the improvement of redox self-
sufficient amination of alcohols displayed by an increase
in production rate. This was achieved by replacing the
transaminase of V. fluvialis by the transaminase of C.
violaceum, which showed higher activity at 42°C. The
whole cell biocatalyst for redox self-sufficient amination of
alcohols required L-alanine in concentrations equimolar
to the dialcohol substrate for complete conversion to the
diamine. L-alanine catabolism occurred primarily via pyru-
vate oxidase PoxB under the biotranformation conditions.
Materials and method
Bacterial strains, plasmids and oligonucleotides
The E. coli strains, plasmids and oligonucleotides used
in this study are listed in Table 4.
Competent cells and vector cloning was performed
according to standard DNA work procedure [21]. In
this study two different cloning strategies forE. coli ex-
pression vectors based on IPTG-inducible pTrc99a
were used. Firstly, cut sites were used for inserting a
gene into a vector. Therefore, PCR-derived gene prod-
uct ta of Chromobacterium violaceum [GI: 34105712;
codon-optimized] (ta Cv_KpnIRBS_for; ta Cv_BamHI_rev)
amplified by KOD Hot Start Polymerase Kit (Novagen)
was cut withKpnIa n dBamHI and used for ligation with
also KpnIa n d BamHI treated pTrc99A to generate
pTrc99a-taCv. To construct pTrc99a- ald-adh-taCv the
BamHI cut site was inserted upstream oftaVf within the
artificial operon ald-adh-taVf of pTrc99a- ald-adh-taVf
by site directed mutagenesis using the oligonucleotides
pTrc99a-ald-adh-taVf_mut_for [22]. The newly derived
vector pTrc99a-ald-adh-taVf_mut was then cut by BamHI
and ligated with BamHI cut ta of Chromobacterium
violaceum that was amplified by KOD Hot Start Polymer-
ase Kit (Novagen, pTrc99a-ald-adh-taCv _for, pTrc99a-ald-
adh-taCv_rev). Secondly, to construct pTrc99A-taVf the
gene ta of Vibrio fluvialiswas amplified with the oligonu-
cleotides taVf_RBS_for and taVf_rev and assembled with
EcoICRI restricted pTrc99a using Gibson assembly
method [23]. Then, E. coli DH5α was transformed with
the ligation products. CaCl2-competent E. coliDH5α were
heat-shocked for the uptake of ligation products. Newly
derived vectors were proven by sequencing and E. coli
W3110 was transformed with correct plasmids pTrc99a-
taVf,p T r c 9 9 a -taCv and pTrc99A-ald-adh-taCv and E. coli
MG1655 as well as E. coli YCC202 with pTrc99A-ald-
adh-taCv.
Cultivation conditions and media
Standard cultivation of E. coli was performed in Luria-
Bertani medium (LB-medium: 10 g/L NaCl, 10 g/L tryp-
tone, 5 g/L yeast extract) at 37°C and 200 rpm in baffled
flasks or plated on LB-Agar as it is not declared otherwise.
When strains harboring plasmid pTrc99A and its deriva-
tives, 100 μg/mL ampicillin was supplemented to the
medium. Strain YYC202 and its derivatives were supple-
mented with 25μg/ml streptomycin and 10μg/ml tetra-
cycline, additionally.

Preparation of cell free extract and enzyme assay
The E. coli derivatives were grown in LB + 100μg/mL
ampicillin until an optical density at 600 nm of 0.6– 0.8,
induced with 1 mM isopropyl-β-D-thiogalactopyranosid
(IPTG) and harvested in the exponential phase at OD600 =
3.5. 10 mL of the cell culture was harvested and always kept
on ice. The cells were once washed with buffer for the en-
zyme assay, resuspended in 1 mL of the same buffer and
then lysed by sonication (Ultrasonic processor UP200S,
Hielscher Ultrasound Technology, Teltow, Germany) for
2 minutes (cycle 0.5; amplitude 55%). Cell cebris was cen-
trifuged at 10.000 x g at 4°C for 1 hour and clear cell extract
was used for the measurement of the enzyme activity.
Measurement of alanine dehydrogenase activity
50 mM Na2CO3 pH 10 was used for cell washing. For
measuring the activity of alanine dehydrogenase pyru-
vate was converted to L-alanine by NADH consumption
spectrophotometrically at 340 nm. Therefore, 50 mM
Na2CO3 pH 8.5, 50 mM NH4Cl, 10 mM pyruvate and
0.25 mM NADH where mixed in a cuvette, filled up to
1 mL ddH2O and upon the addition of crude extract the
reductive amination was initiated and measured for 3 mi-
nutes. The assay was performed in triplicates and one
enzyme unit was calculated to be the amount of enzyme
that catalyzes the conversion of 1 μmol substrate in
1 min.
Measurement of alcohol dehydrogenase activity
25 mM Sodium phosphate buffer pH 8 was used for cell
washing. For measuring the alcohol dehydrogenase activ-
ity 1,4-butanediol was oxidized to hydroxybutyraldehyde
and NADH formation followed spectrophotometrically at
340 nm. Therefore, 25 mM Na-P-buffer pH 8, 18 mM 1,4
butanediol and 10 mM NAD+ were mixed in a cuvette,
filled up to 1 mL ddH2O and reaction was initiated upon
the addition of crude extract (triplicates). The NADH for-
mation was followed over 3 minutes and one enzyme unit
was calculated to be the amount of enzyme that catalyzes
the conversion of 1μmol substrate in 1 min. To analyze
substrate specificity to 1-hexanol, 1-octanol, 1,6-hexane-
diol, 1,8-hexanediol, cyclohexanol, benzylalcohol and 2-
hexanol same conditions were used but different substrate
concentration were added to estimate Km and Vmax-values
via Lineweaver-Burk Plot.
Measurement of transaminase activity
100 mM Potassium-phosphate buffer pH 7.4 was used
for cell washing. Reaction conditions were: 100 mM K-
P-buffer pH 7.4, 50 mM (S)-α-MBA and 10 mM pyru-
vate. The transamination was initiated upon the addition
of crude extract and samples were taken continuously.
The reaction was stopped with 75μl 16% perchloracetic
acid. The samples where neutralized by the addition of
40 μl buffer containing 20 mM Tris/HCl pH 8 and
23 mM K2CO3. L-alanine formation was measured via
HPLC and one enzyme unit was calculated to be the
amount of enzyme to catalyze the formation of 1μmol
product in 1 min.
The experimental procedure for the estimation of cata-
lytic efficiency was equal but hexanal was used as sub-
strate instead of (S)- α-MBA. The Reaction conditions
were: 100 mM K-P-buffer pH 7.4, 10 mM hexanal and
varying concentrations of L-alanine. Hexylamine forma-
tion was measured via HPLC and one enzyme unit was
calculated to be the amount of enzyme to catalyze the
formation of 1μmol product in 1 min.
Whole cell biotransformation with resting cells
E. coli W3110/pTrc99A and its derivatives W3110/
pTrc99A-ald-adh-ta and W3110/pTrc99A- ta-ald-adh
were inoculated to an initial OD600 = 0.1 in LB-medium
plus 20 mM Mops and 100μg/mL ampicillin and incu-
bated at 37°C and 200 rpm. At an OD600 = 0.6-0.8 1 mM
IPTG was added to the expression culture to induce the
cells and cultivation was continued as described above.
15 hours cells were harvested for a final OD600 =1 0 i n
20 mL final volume, once washed with 50 mM Hepes buf-
fer pH 7 and prepared for whole cell biotransformation in
a resting buffer system with the mentioned buffer. NH4Cl
and L-alanine were added to the system when necessary
and concentrations are given in the text. The test reaction
containers (100 mL Schottbottle) where incubated at 37°C
or 42°C and 200 rpm and samples for HPLC-analytics
were taken in intervals throughout the production.
HPLC-analysis
Extracellular amines and 1-amino-10-decanol were ana-
lyzed by high-pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC,
1200 series, Agilent Technologies Deutschland GmbH,
Böblingen, Germany). Sampleswere centrifuged at 10.000 ×
g for 5 minutes and the clear supernatant was taken for
HPLC-measurement. For the detection samples were
derivatized with ortho-phthaldialdehyde (OPA) auto-
matically before entering the precolumn (LiChrospher
100 RP8 EC-5μ, 40 × 4.6 mm, CS-Chromatographie Ser-
vice GmbH, Langerwehe, Germany) and the main column
(LiChrospher 100 RP8 EC-5μ, 125 × 4.6 mm, Langerwehe,
Germany) for separation. The used mobile phase was made
of A: 0.25% (v/v) Na-acetate buffer pH 6 and B: Methanol;
0 min 30% B, 1 min 30% B, 8 min 70% B, 13 min 90% B,
16 min 70% B, 18 min 30% B. 1,7-diaminoheptane was
used as internal standard.
The detection of amino acids were performed with a
quicker HPLC-method but derivatization with OPA was
used equally to amine detection. Here, through a precol-
umn (LiChrospher 100 RP 18– 5E C ;4 0×4m m )a n dt h e
main column (LiChrospher 100 RP18 EC-5 μ;1 2 5×

4.6 mm; CS-Chromatographie Service GmbH, Langerwehe,
Germany) amino acids were separated and detected by a
FLD-detector. As an internal standard L-asparagine was
used and the gradient for improved separation was made
of A: 100 mM Sodiumacetate pH 7.2 and B: Methanol;
0 min 25% B, 0.5 min 45% B, 4 min 65% B, 7 min 70% B,
7.2 min 80% B, 7.4 min 85% B, 8 min 20% B, 10.6 min
