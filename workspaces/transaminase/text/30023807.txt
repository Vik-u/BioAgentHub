ABSTRACT: Directed Evolution is a key technology driving the
utility of biocatalysis in pharmaceutical synthesis. Conventional
approaches to Directed Evolution are conducted using bacterial cells
expressing enzymes in microplates, with catalyzed reactions measured
by HPLC, high-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrom-
etry (HPLC-MS), or optical detectors, which require either long
cycle times or tailor-made substrates. To betterﬁt modern, fast-paced
process chemistry development where solutions are rapidly needed
for new substrates, droplet microﬂuidics interfaced with electrospray
ionization (ESI)-MS provides a label-free high-throughput screening
platform. To apply this method to industrial enzyme screening and to
explore potential approaches that may further improve the overall
throughput, we optimized the existing droplet −MS methods.
Carryover between droplets, traditionally a signi ﬁcant issue, was
reduced to undetectable level by replacing the stainless steel ESI needle with a Teﬂon needle within a capillary electrophoresis
(CE)−MS source. Throughput was improved to 3 Hz with a wide range of droplet sizes (10−50 nL) by tuning the sheathﬂow
within the CE−MS source. The optimized method was demonstrated by screening reactions using two diﬀerent transaminase
libraries. Good correlations (r
2 ∼ 0.95) were found between the droplet−MS and LC−MS methods, with 100% match on hit
variants. We further explored the capability of the system by performing in vitro transcription−translation inside the droplets and
directly analyzing the intact reaction mixture droplets by MS. The synthesized protein attained comparable activity to the protein
standard, and the complex samples appeared well tolerated by the MS. The success of the above applications indicates that the
MS analysis of the microﬂuidic droplets is an available option for considerably accelerating the screening of enzyme evolution
libraries.
■ INTRODUCTION
Biocatalysis has become a valuable tool in the synthetic
chemist’s toolbox,1−7 often providing unmatched speciﬁcities
for producing the desired products. However, industrial
substrates and reaction environments are typically very diﬀerent
from those for which native enzymes have originally evolved,
and these diﬀerences often lead to the suboptimal performance
for industrial biocatalysts. Directed Evolution provides a
methodology for the retuning of an enzyme to a new substrate
and new reaction conditions by re-engineering the amino acid
sequence.
2,8−13 Directed Evolution is becoming widely used on
many enzymes for the chemical synthesis of commercial
products.
3 As an example, Merck Sharp & Dohme (MSD)
engineered an optimized transaminase for the production of
sitagliptin that underwent 11 rounds of Directed Evolution
carried out over the course of one year, ultimately changing 27
amino acids in the enzyme sequence.
8 The large number of
biocatalytic opportunities, combined with the relatively long
cycle time for each round of evolution, creates a compelling
need for speeding and simplifying the Directed Evolution
process.14
Screening of enzyme libraries is a hallmark of Directed
Evolution and is often the rate-limiting step in a Directed
Evolution project. Consequently, improved technologies for
carrying out the rapid analysis of enzyme performance are an
area of active research interest. One exciting technology
developed recently has been the advancement of a high-
throughput screening (HTS) in microﬂuidic droplets.
15−17 This
technology dramatically decreases the assay volume while
increasing the rate of analysis, enabling the rapid identiﬁcation
of rare, sought-after events in the library. A recent review18

Evolution studies. Most experiments have been designed to
liberate aﬂuorophore upon reaction, and similar strategies have
taken advantage of chemiluminescence, electrochemistry, light
scattering, and absorbance di ﬀerences between tailor-made
substrates and their corresponding products. However, as“you
get what you screen for”, the design of substrate/product pairs
to match the analytical readout is poorly received by industrial
scientists, whose ﬂexibility to modify the desired substrate is
highly limited.
19 Industrial biocatalysis applications require an
analytical method that is more general, less compound speciﬁc,
and faster to develop.
Mass spectrometry (MS) is among the most preferred
detectors for the pharmaceutical industry. It is ubiquitous,
rapidly tunable to target analytes, and highly sensitive. Two
ionization technologies electrospray ionization (ESI) and
matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization (MALDI) are
most widely employed. ESI-MS is more readily available due
to the lower price and theﬂexibility to be interfaced with liquid-
introducing sources, such as high-performance liquid chroma-
tography (HPLC), ﬂow injection, and droplet microﬂuidics.
The throughput of universally used, conventional HPLC-ESI-
MS is limited by a typical 3 min/sample, corresponding to 2
weeks of screening for a typical round of selection of 5000
protein variants. Alternative approaches, such as multiple
injections in a single experimental run (MISER) and RapidFire
can potentially increase the throughput to 10 s/sample,
20−22
reducing the analysis time to ∼14 h for the same size of a
library. Given the power of modern mass spectrometers to
identify a product mass in a complex sample matrix, a
chromatographic step is often not necessary to monitor
enzyme activity. Interfacing droplet microﬂuidics with ESI-MS
would bypass the separation and therefore improve the speed.
The high-throughput droplet−MS method developed by the
Kennedy laboratory demonstrated a label-free screening with
the throughput as high as 1.7 samples/s (0.6 s/sample),
23,24
further reducing the analysis time to less than 1 h for 5000
samples, representing a 15-fold improvement over the MISER-
based approaches
21 and a 300-fold over typical LC −MS
methods. It is getting close to some optical methods,18 but
can be achieved without the need for a surrogate substrate
development. Recent studies have also demonstrated the
success of using MALDI-time-of-ﬂight for HTS with automatic
sample preparation (∼30 min for 1536 samples), high analysis
rate ( ∼1s / s a m p l e ) ,
25−27 and decent agreement with
orthogonal assays (e.g., correlation coeﬃcient r2 ∼ 0.9 with
RapidFire screening 25). Nevertheless, the expense of the
instrument, the consumables, and the spotting robot (e.g.,
mosquito) understandably prevents the technology from being
quickly adopted by most laboratories, especially resource-
limited ones.
In this work, we further tailored the droplet−MS method-
ology
23 for use in Directed Evolution in pharmaceutical process
development (Figure 1). First, we implemented the technology
on an Agilent single quadrupole that is the most basic ESI-MS
system at MSD. More importantly, we generalized the method
with commercially available components to allow a rapid
implementation by industrial scientists. Second, carryover
between the droplet samples was more sustainably overcome
by using a Teﬂon ESI needle within a capillary electrophoresis−
mass spectrometry (CE−MS) ESI source that had the added
beneﬁt of being able to apply a sheath ﬂow to stabilize
electrospray for certain applications. Third, the analysis rate was
increased to 3 samples/s (3 Hz), which enabled screening of
one 96-well plate in 30 s. Two diﬀerent transaminase libraries
were screened using this optimized method. The screening
results were compared with the optimized LC−MS methods,
and good correlations (r
2 ∼ 0.95) were found between the two
methods with 100% match on hits. Finally, we demonstrated
that the new MS con ﬁguration was capable of handling
complex cell free protein synthesis reaction samples generated
through in vitro transcription/translation (ivTT), which oﬀers a
further speed advantage by skipping the cell growth and protein
harvest steps.
■ RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Droplet Generation. To make droplets from multiwell
plates, we purchase the XYZ positioner, attach a power supply
as described by the manufacturer, and train the positioner to
Figure 1.Droplet−ESI-MS methodology for high-throughput biocatalysts screening in Directed Evolution. Following the arrows: DNA templates of
selected enzymes are created on plasmids; the cells are transformed with DNA-carrying plasmids; the cells are cultured and the target enzymes are
produced; the cells are lysed to release the enzymes; enzymatic assays are carried out in multiwell plates; sample droplets are generated into a Teﬂon
tube from the assay plates; sample droplets are infused into ESI-MS for high-throughput screening.

multiwell plates using a G-Code as described previously (Figure
S1A).23 To verify this instrument worked satisfactorily, the
droplet carrier Teﬂon tubing is clamped onto the Z positioning
head and connected on the other end to a syringe loaded into a
syringe pump. A well plate isﬁlled with blue dye and overlaid
with perﬂuorinated oil. With the syringe pump operating in
ﬁlling mode, the positioner moves the tubing to each well
alternating between the sample and the oil. As shown inFigure
2A, the samples are aspirated through a Teﬂon sipper directly
inserted into the droplet carrier tubing. The blue dye droplets
are ∼50 nL and the clear oil gap is a slightly larger than the
droplets.
The droplet generation rate is∼0.3 Hz (droplets/s) from a
single plate. The XYZ positioner used in this study is capable of
parallel sample reformatting from 4 plates into 4 tubes (Figure
S1A), corresponding to 1.2 Hz (∼25 min for 1536 droplets).
Detaching the droplet carrier tubing from the positioner and
reattaching it to ESI-MS takes <30 s. If multiple tubes of
droplets are to be screened, each manual detaching and
reattaching needs <30 s.
23 Although tubing change is not a
speed-limiting step in the entire screening process, one can
envision that a fully automated platform, potentially with a
valving control, will reduce the required time to negligible.
Carryover Elimination with Teﬂon ESI Needle. Carry-
over is a frequent issue when droplets are transferred from
ﬂuorophilic Teﬂon tubing into nonﬂuoriphilic tubing due to
diﬀerences in surface chemistry. Unlike Teﬂon, which is wetted
by the ﬂuorinated oil that encapsulates and prevents the
aqueous samples from inter acting with each other, the
hydrophilic stainless steel (SS) needle used in most ESI
sources is wetted by the aqueous samples, leading to cross
contamination. Carryover is observed in theﬁrst 5 droplets (50
nL each) of each sample when using the default SS needle (∼9
cm) on an Agilent single-quadrupole MS ( Figure 3A). In
previous studies, the carryover is mitigated by replacing the SS
needle with an internallyﬂuorosilane-functionalized fused silica
(FS) capillary, which is externally sputter coated with gold−
platinum alloy for electrical conductivity.
23 Although the
ﬂuorinated FS capillary signiﬁcantly reduced the carryover at
low analysis rate, ∼20% carryover is observed when the
throughput is increased to >3 Hz. Additionally, the process of
treating the inside of the FS capillary to be hydrophobic and
sputter coating the outside for conductivity is time consuming
and labor intensive. Therefore, a commercial solution enabling
the direct electrospray from a Teﬂon needle is desired.
Unlike most MS that applies high voltage onto the ESI
source, the Agilent single-quadrupole MS applies high voltage
to the transferring capillary inside the MS, whereas the ESI
source remains grounded. Such settings broaden the choice of
ESI needles to those that are nonconductive, such as Teﬂon.
However, standard ESI sources have a thin needle (<200μm
o.d.) and a Teﬂon tubing is not readily available at such small
diameters. As an alternative, the CE−MS ESI source (Figure
Figure 2.All-Teﬂon ﬂuid path for droplet generation and droplet−MS
analysis. (A) Droplet generation is accomplished using a 120/250
Teﬂon sipper connected to a 250/1600 carrier tubing via a wax seal
(B) during MS analysis droplet carrier tubing is connected to a 150/
360 Te ﬂon needle by a zero dead volume PEEK union. (C)
Alternatively, a 120/250 Teﬂon needle can be inserted into the droplet
carrier tubing directly and sealed with wax.

and a 150/360 Te ﬂon needle (B). A series of pyridinyl amine
standards from 0.05 to 1.5 mM reformatted into sets of eight 50 nL
droplets were used to evaluate the carryover. Carryover generated by
SS needle is 5 droplets. In contrast, the Teﬂon needle generated no
carryover.

S1C,D) from Agilent’s capillary electrophoresis hardware is
compatible with the 360μm o.d. tubings that are commonly
used in capillary electrophoresis and is a commonly available
size of Te ﬂon tubing. To demonstrate the electrospray
compatibility with a Teﬂon tubing, we ﬁrst test a 150/360
Teﬂon needle, connected to the droplet carrier tubing through
a zero-dead-volume union (Figure 2B), andﬁnd that it provides
a stable electrospray and a minimal carryover (Figure 3B) for
most analytical samples. However, the droplets with complex
components are more likely to break at tubing connections. To
mitigate this issue, we replace the 150/360 needle and the
union with a 120/250 Te ﬂon needle that can be directly
inserted into the 250/1600 droplet carrier tubing with a simple
wax seal (Figure 2C). We ﬁnd this conﬁguration also provides
minimal carryover and is more suitable for fragile droplets.
The MS signal quality using a Teﬂon ESI needle is evaluated
with a pyridinyl amine (Scheme 1) standard containing trace
amount of pyridinyl ketone. The amine is sampled into∼200
droplets and continuously sprayed into the MS. Both high
amine signal and low ketone signals are detected with fair
stability over the 200 droplets (Figure S2A,B). The relative
standard deviation (% RSD) was 12 and 15% for the amine and
ketone, respectively; however % RSD can be reduced to <5%
by dividing the signal for a given analyte by the total signal for
both analytes (same as % conversion calculation). To
determine if the Teﬂon ESI needle has an eﬀect on linear
range, a series of standards are measured ( Figure S2C,D).
Response remained linear from 1 to 100μM( r
2 ∼ 0.99) and a
positive correlation is ob served from 0.5 to 1000 μM,
demonstrating a good sensitivity and a wide semiquantitative
window.
Throughput Improvement with Agilent Single Quad.
The previous study demonstrates a 1.7 Hz droplet analysis rate,
which is the highest throughput robustly achievable for at least
4200+ droplets.
23 The sampling rate of the Agilent single-
quadrupole MS is set by the“peak width” parameter in the MS
setup software; the fastest data acquisition rate required setting
the peak width to the lowest value (0.005 min), which
corresponds to ∼35 data points/s in the MS. Assuming that 5
data points are collected for each droplet and the same for the
oil gap, the MS should support a 3.5 Hz analysis. Infusion rate
is another key factor aﬀecting the throughput and needs to be
tuned with the droplet size to attain a stable signal, a suﬃcient
number of scans over each peak, and a low pressure on droplets
to avoid breakage and merging. Typical experiments used 50 nL
droplets with a 2.5:1 length-to-width ratio and with an oil gap
slightly larger than the droplets. This type of segmentedﬂow is
found to be most stable within the 250μm i.d. tubing. After
testing the infusion rates from 1 to 200μL/min, 20 μL/min
was found to provide the best performance in terms of the
droplet stability, spray eﬃciency, and throughput for 50 nL
droplets. Under these conditions,Figure 3B demonstrates the
analysis rate 44 droplets assayed in 0.2 min, which
corresponds to 3.7 Hz. Similar result is shown in Figure
S2A200 droplets detected in 0.925 min, which corresponds
to 3.6 Hz.
Broader Droplet Size Compatibility with Sheath Flow.
During ﬂow rate optimization, the electrospray becomes
unstable at ﬂow rates below 5 μL/min. Although such low
ﬂow rates are unnecessary with 50 nL droplet samples, they are
required for analysis of smaller droplets (e.g., <15 nL) to avoid
undersampling by MS. Because of the low electro-osmoticﬂow
rate in CE, the CE−MS source has an additional inlet for the
introduction of a coaxialﬂow (termed“sheath ﬂow” in CE−MS
technology) to facilitate eﬃcient electrospray. In the same way,
an additional sheath ﬂow can enhance the spray eﬃciency of
the droplets. When infusing droplets as small as 10 nL
(compatible with micro ﬂuidic devices
16,28)a t5 μL/min,
signiﬁcant improvement is seen in both MS signal intensity
and distinguishability with the addition of a 20μL/min sheath
ﬂow (Figure 4). For poorly ionized compounds (ketone traces,
Figure 4), the improvement is even more pronounced. The best
performance is seen when the sheath liquid has the same
solvent composition of the droplet (i.e., 20% acetonitrile
(ACN) and 0.1% formic acid). Typically, a nano-ESI source
16 is
required to analyze low-volume samples (e.g., 10 nL droplets),
but the addition of a sheath ﬂow in the CE −MS source
expanded the range of sample volumes compatible with the
traditional electrospray.
The 120/250 Te ﬂon needle is evaluated with the same
pyridinyl amine droplets at diﬀerent concentrations with or
without the sheath ﬂow using regular size droplets (50 nL).
Droplets without the sheathﬂow are infused to the MS at 20
μL/min, whereas those with the sheathﬂow are infused at 15
μL/min plus a sheath ﬂow at 30 μL/min. As illustrated in
Figure 4B, the sheathﬂow greatly increases the signal quality. In
the process of optimizing the sheathﬂow rate, we observe that
when the sheathﬂow exceeds 30μL/min, the gaps between the
droplet peaks contract, indicating that the total infusion rate is
too high for the MS data acquisition to distinguish one droplet
from another. After testing severalﬂow rate combinations, the
optimal conditions are 15 μL/min droplet infusion and a 30
μL/min sheath ﬂow.
Transaminase ATA-036 Screening. Once the stability
and feasibility of utilizing this CE−MS source and the Teﬂon
needle are conﬁrmed, the new droplet−MS system is used for
variant library screening. The parent transaminase is able to
convert methyl 4-methyl-3-oxopentanoate (ketoester) to its
corresponding amine, which then spontaneously undergoes
hydrolysis under the reaction conditions to formβ-leucine as
the ﬁnal product (Scheme 2). Eighty-four variants are mapped
to individual well in rows A−D, and F−H. Row E contains
positive controls in E1−E8 and negative controls in E9−E12.
The variants are grown, induced to express enzyme, and treated
to produce a clariﬁed lysate for screening. After the trans-
amination reaction and sample preparation (including acetoni-
trile precipitation of protein and plateﬁltration), these samples
are ﬁrst analyzed on a commercial HPLC-MS (Figure 5B).
Then, the plate is further diluted 5-fold to aﬁnal 18 v/v % ACN
a n dr e f o r m a t t e di n t op e rﬂuorodecalin (PFD) segmented
droplets quadruplicatedly for each sample. Although the
reaction mixture contains high amount of dimethyl sulfoxide
(DMSO), pyridoxal-5-phosphate (PLP) cofactor, salts, and cell
lysate proteins and surfactants that destabilize the droplets, the
plate ﬁltration and further dilution resolve this issue, enabling
the sample droplets to be directly analyzed by MS. The raw
droplet trace of the plate is captured inFigure 5A. For a total of
∼400 droplets, the entire assay time is 130 s, corresponding to
Scheme 2. Formation ofβ-Leucine from Ketoester

the analysis rate of 3 Hz, whereas the HPLC-MS assay has a
throughput of 4 min/sample. Because the substrate ketone has
a very low ionization eﬃciency on the MS, only the productβ-
leucine is used to evaluate the activities of various genes. After
the data analysis, the fold improvement of each gene is
calculated by normalizing theβ-leucine intensity to the positive
control. Figure 5B clearly shows that HPLC-MS and droplet−
MS produce very similar results in terms of fold improvement
for each variant and the hits identiﬁcation. The high correlation
(r
2 = 0.95) between the two data sets validates the reliability of
the droplet−MS approach, and importantly, is 700× faster than
the LC−MS method.
Transaminase ATA-117 Screening. To further establish
the robustness of the optimized droplet −MS method for
analyzing the pharmaceutical protein engineering samples, we
screen a transaminase hit plate from an earlier evolution
project, as shown inScheme 3. Previously, transaminase ATA-
117 undergoes two rounds of evolution to convert this 1-(3-

7(8H)-yl)butane-1,3-dione (THTP-BDO) methyl ketone to
amine, and this provides a collection of variants of improved
activity (Moore et al. submitted). Thirty variants are mapped in
triplicate on a 96-well plate, including the best variant from the
initial round (wells H4−H6), the wild-type ATA-117 (wells
H7−H9), and the negative control (well H10−H12). Reactions
are run using THTP-BDO as previously described, and the
screening results are obtained from both LC−MS and droplet−
MS methods. Because both the substrate and the product have
a high ionization eﬃciency, the conversion is calculated based
on the signal of both.Figure 6A demonstrates the conversion
data obtained from LC−MS and droplet−MS methods are
equivalent regarding the relative activities among the variants.
Figure 6B also conﬁrms the good correlation ( r
2 ∼ 0.96)
between the two sets of results. The primary diﬀerence is that
screening this one plate takes 6 h using LC−MS, but it takes
only 120 s to assay the same plate in quadruplicates with the
droplet−MS methodagain a 700× throughput upgrade.
One-Step ivTT and Enzymatic Assay in Droplets.The
two examples above indicate that the droplet−MS method can
be used to save signiﬁcant assay time when applied to industrial
enzyme screening. In this event, the throughput-limiting step in
the enzyme evolution process then shifts to protein expression
and running the reaction. The traditional cell-based protein
expression approach requires cell transformation, cell culturing,
protein harvesting, and sample preparation requiring multiple
days of eﬀort. Alternatively, cell free protein synthesis (or
ivTT) dramatically accelerates protein expression, as it only
requires mixing of the template DNA with key reagents and
incubation for 2 h.
29−31 One major reason that ivTT has not
been widely used is that the reagents are expensive relative to
the traditional approach. We and others envision ivTT would
ﬁnd application in the droplet format, as the reagent
consumption is only a few nanoliters per sample.
32,33 We test
in-droplet ivTT by performing the cell free synthesis of
transaminase ATA-117 and the ketone/amine conversion using
the synthesized ATA-117 in one step. All of the ivTT
components, including the ivTT mixes, RNAse inhibitor,
PLP, and DNA template, along with the reaction substrates

pyridinyl amine and pyruvate (Scheme 1) are mixed together in
a well plate, and then immediately (within 1.5 min) reformatted
into the PFD-segmented droplets and stored in the Teﬂon
tubing for incubation. Initially, signi ﬁcant droplet breakage
inside the tubing is observed after only 30 min of incubation.
These droplets break down further upon infusion into the MS.
We hypothesize that the interfacial tension of the droplet and
oil is weakened by the relatively high concentration of the
complex components as compared to the previous diluted
samples from transaminase screening plates. Typically, this is
managed by adding surfactant to the carrier oil, and an MS
friendly oil −surfactant system has been reported.
34 After
switching to a similar oil−surfactant system (HFE 7500 with
2% ﬂuorosurfactant, a perﬂuoropolyether−poly(ethylene gly-
col) triblock co-polymer), the droplets are stable even after
overnight incubation and remained stable when moving inside
the tubing. The new oil−surfactant ﬂuid provides abundant
signal and very nice stability on the MS ( Figure S3 ).
Additionally, the ESI needle is changed to a 12 cm long 120/
250 Teﬂon needle, which is directly inserted into the carrier
tubing with wax seal, as shown inFigure 2C. Stable spray and
good droplet traces are obtained with the help of the 30μL/
min sheath ﬂow (Figure S3). The optimal sheath liquid is
discovered to be 100% H
2O, which matches the solvent
composition for ivTT. Based on our data, the best practice is to
select the same solvent for the sheath liquid as the sample.
With the new oil−surfactant system in place, the one-step
ivTT and enzyme assay is revisited. An ivTT reaction designed
to make ATA-117 is set up as described in Table S1.I na
positive control reaction, we spiked in a small amount of the
ATA-117 enzyme, and in the negative control, we omitted the
DNA coding for the enzyme. Pyridinyl amine and pyruvate are
used as substrates because the equilibrium lies heavily in favor
of the pyridinyl ketone and alanine (Scheme 1) and therefore
no additional enzymes for pulling the reaction forward are
required. Figure 7presents the measured product (ketone) and
substrate (amine) signals from the three reactions incubated in
droplets. The transaminase produced by ivTT is active, similar
to that of the ATA-117 standard positive control, whereas
omitting the DNA results in no reaction under identical
conditions. This successful one-step study shows that the cell
free transaminase synthesis and transaminase reaction can be
performed in one step for an overnight incubation (∼14 h).
The one-step study is unaﬀected by the new oil−surfactant
system, this system is e ﬀective at maintaining individual
droplets without carryover, and the MS is capable of analyzing
complex ivTT reactions without an additional sample
preparation. This allows for taking advantage of the tiny
volume of droplets to save considerable reagent cost.
Additionally, the identiﬁcation of the appropriate oil−surfactant
system broadens the scope of droplet−MS screening setup, as
samples no longer need to be conﬁned to relatively clean,
prepared sample plates,
24 or buﬀer-switched reactions16 but can
be employed as routine reaction vessels in a protein engineering
process.
■ CONCLUSIONS
With the upgraded analysis rate, robustness, ﬂexibility, and
applicability, we demonstrated the droplet−MS methodology
as an eﬃcient, label-free, high-throughput screening technology
for pharmaceutical biocatalysis. Utilizing an all-Te ﬂon ﬂuid
path, the carryover was eliminated without losing signal stability
and sensitivity. Escherichia coli expressed enzymes were
screened using the droplet −MS platform following the
standard sample preparation. Screening results of two types
of transaminases by droplet−MS were in good agreement with
the LC −MS method, but with signi ﬁcantly faster rate,
validating the methodology as a viable high-throughput
analytical technique for industrial biocatalyst screening. The
adoption of the selected surfactant−oil carrier ﬂuid alleviated
the droplet instability caused by complex reaction components,
at the same time sustaining a high-quality MS signal. The
success of cell free synthesis of transaminase in nanoliter
droplets suggested a great potential for accelerating the activity
testing of DNA libraries in a round of protein engineering from
3−4 weeks to within 24 h at signiﬁcant cost savings compared
to traditional ivTT experiments.

amine/ketone conversion (Scheme 1): ivTT reactions, positive and
negative control reactions were performed with details described in
Table S1. Each reaction was sampled 10 times. Teﬂon needle: 120/
250. Droplet size: 50 nL. Droplet infusing rate: 15μL/min. Sheath
ﬂow rate: 30μL/min (100% H2O).

reaction samples were diluted with acetonitrile (ACN) and
H2O, both containing 0.1% formic acid to make theﬁnal ACN
concentration ∼20%. The diluted sample solutions wereﬁltered
through a ﬁlter plate (0.45μm ﬁlter, EMD Millipore, Billerica,
MA) to remove the precipitates. The diluted samples were then
loaded onto the treated multiwell plate (using Teﬂon aerosol).
Next, this plate was placed in a custom three-dimensional-
printed plate holder (Figure S1B) with raised edges around the
plate to hold an extra layer of perﬂuorodecalin (PFD) oil. After
the oil was placed on top of each sample and the whole plate,
the sample droplets were sipped into a 250μm i.d., 1600μm
o.d. (250/1600) carrier Te ﬂon tubing (IDEX Health and
Science, Oak Harbor, WA), which was connected to a 500μL
syringe (Hamilton Robotics, Reno, NV). The syringe was
mounted on a PHD 2000 syringe pump (Harvard Apparatus,
Holliston, MA) and set to withdraw at 2μL/min. On the open
inlet of the 250/1600 carrier Teﬂon tubing, a 2 cm long, 120
μm i.d., 250 μm o.d. (120/250) thin Teﬂon tubing (Zeus
Industrial Products, Inc., Orangeburg, SC) was inserted in and
sealed with capillary wax (Hampton Research, Aliso Viejo, CA)
to function as a “sipper” (Figure 2A). Before the droplets
generation, the syringe and the tubing were preﬁlled with PFD.
To sample the whole plate into droplets in an array, a computer
numerical control device (purchased from Zen Toolworks,
Concord, CA, and custom assembled according to the provided
instructions) was used as the XYZ positioner. The carrier
Teﬂon tubing was mounted on the Z head and the XYZ
positioner was programmed to reformat the desired number of
droplets from screening plates with the desired size.
ESI-MS Detection of Sample Droplets.Before screening
the enzymatic reaction samples, the droplet−MS conditions
were optimized using pyridinyl amine and pyridinyl ketone
standards (Scheme 1). Consequently, the amount of ketone
and amine in each sample were measured to evaluate the
activity of the transaminase. An Agilent MS-6120A (Santa
Clara, CA) single-quadrupole mass spectrometer was used for
droplet analysis. The regular ESI source with the stainless steel
(SS) ESI needle was replaced with a CE −MS ESI source
(Figure S1C,D ), which has similar con ﬁguration as the
traditional ESI source, but allows direct insertion of a 12 cm
long, 150 μm i.d., 360 μm o.d. (150/360), or 120/250 thin
Teﬂon tubing as the ESI needle and with the capability of
introducing sheath ﬂow to the spray. The entireﬂuid path is
shown in Figure 2 B,C. Once generation of droplets was
ﬁnished, the small Teﬂ
on sipper was removed and the open
end of the droplet carrier tubing was connected to the 150/360
Teﬂon ESI needle through a PEEK zero dead volume union
(Valco Instruments Co. Inc., Houston, TX) or by the direct
insertion of a 120/250 Teﬂon needle. For analysis, the same
syringe pump was used to infuse the droplets into the ESI
source at 15−20 μL/min. Positive ESI mode was used with
voltage set at 3 kV. The nebulizing gasﬂow pressure was 35
psig, and the temperature of transferring capillary was 250°C.
Selected ion monitoring mode was used to measure the MS
signals for the substrate and product from each reaction.
Droplet Data Analysis.Droplet traces were analyzed using
ChemStation (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA). Absolute abundance
(peak height) of the substrate and the product was correlated
to the concentration. The peak height information of each
droplet was exported to Excel (Microsoft Corporation,
Redmond, WA). The list of peaks was automatically assigned
back to each well on the 96-well plates using Excel based on the
diﬀerent oil spacing (reﬂected as diﬀerent numbers of MS data
points) within the replicates of each sample, between samples,
and between rows. The averaged peak height of replicated
droplets for each sample was used for calculation. The %
conversion was calculated as the percentage of the peak height
of the product over the sum of the peak heights of the product
and the substrate. The fold improvement was calculated as the
peak height of the product of each variant over that of the
positive control sample. All of the calculations were performed
with Excel.
Enzyme Variant Construction, Expression, Lysis, and
Reaction. The ATA-036 transaminase variants were con-
structed by a single site-directed mutagenesis of a C-terminus
6xHis tag variant of the ATA-036 enzyme, a hit selected as a
part of sitagliptin evolution work.
8 To perturb the activity of the
enzyme, 84 variants containing single mutations within 10 Å of
the ATA binding pocket were selected. These variants were
cloned into an expression vector containing a p15A-based
replication origin, chloramphenicol antibiotic resistance marker,
and an IPTG-inducible promoter.
8 The ﬁnal plasmids were
transformed into an E. coli W3110 mutant.8 The enzyme
variants, eight replicates of the positive control (ATA-036), and
three replicates of a negative control (that expresses β-
lactamase instead of ATA-036) were grown overnight at 30
°C and 200 rpm in a NUNC 96-well microplateﬁlled with 160
μL LB media supplemented with 35 ng/μL chloramphenicol
and 1% glucose. 10 μL cells from each well was then
subcultured into 390 μL terri ﬁcb r o t h( T B )m e d i a
supplemented with 35 ng/μL chloramphenicol and 100 μM
pyridoxine, and grown at 30°C and 250 rpm. After 3 h, 1 mM
IPTG was added and the cells were grown for another 18 h.
The cells were harvested by centrifugations at 4000 rpm and
the cell pellets were stored at−80 °C until ready for lysis. The
cell lysis step was initiated by preparing a fresh lysis buﬀer
containing 0.25 mg/mL lysozyme, 100 mM TEoA, pH 7.5, 0.2
mg/mL polymyxin B sulfate, and 100 μMp y r i d o x a l - 5 -
phosphate (PLP). 200 μL of the lysis buﬀer was added to
cell pellets and the lysis reaction mixture was incubated for 2 h
at room temperature and 1000 rpm. The lysis mixture was then
centrifuged at 4000 rpm and 60 μL of the supernatant was
added to 140μL of a reaction master mix such that theﬁnal
reaction contains 20 g/L methyl 4-methyl-3-oxopentanoate
(ketoester, Scheme 2), 18 vol % DMSO, 50 vol % of a buﬀer
composed of 0.2 M borate and 1.5 M iPrNH
2, 1 g/L PLP, and
30 vol % ATA-036 lysate. The reaction was run overnight at 60
°C and 800 rpm then quenched by the addition of 200μLo f
acetonitrile (ACN), followed by a 5-fold dilution with 10%
ACN/H
2O for the subsequent droplet−MS analysis.
To vary the activity of ATA-117, a library of 32 variants were
selected from our previous study (Moore et al. submitted)
cloned into a pD451 expression vector (ATUM, formerly
DNA2.0) and the ﬁnal plasmids were transformed into anE.
coli BL21 (DE3) strain. Glycerol stocks of these variants were
prepared by the addition of glycerol to overnight cultures of
these variants in LB media supplemented with 50 ng/ μL
Kanamycin. To express this library, each variant was grown
overnight in the LB-Kanamycin media at 37°C. 10 μL from
each sample was subcultured into 400μL of Super broth (SB)
media supplemented with 50 ng/μL Kanamycin. The mixture
was incubated at 37°C and 250 rpm for 3 h. Then, the protein
expression was induced by the addition of 40μL IPTG (10
mM). The induced cells were incubated at 37°C, 250 rpm for
4 h. Finally, the cells were collected by centrifuging the culture
at 4000 rpm for 10 min and discarding the supernatant. The

cells were stored at −80 °C before the lysis step. The lysis
buﬀer composed of 50 mM Tris−HCl (pH 8.0), 300 mM
NaCl, 1 mg/mL lysozyme, and 25 U/μL endonuclease. 50μL
of the lysis solution was added to each sample, and the lysis
mixture was incubated at 4 °C and 750 rpm. Finally, after
centrifugation at 4000 rpm for 10 min, the supernatant
containing the expressed enzyme was collected. A reaction
stock solution containing 0.5 g/L PLP, 0.1 g/L lactate
dehydrogenase (LDH), 0.5 g/L glucose dehydrogenase
(GDH), 0.25 g/L NAD, 1 M
D-alanine, 0.5 M glucose, 0.1 M
Na2HPO4 (pH 7.0), and 10 mg/mL truncated sitagliptin
ketone (Scheme 3) was prepared. Each reaction was set up by
the addition of 10μL cell lysate to 90μL of the reaction stock.
The ﬁnal reaction mixture was incubated overnight at 30°C
and 450 rpm and then quenched by the addition of 100μL
ACN.
In Vitro Transcription−Translation (ivTT) Reaction in
Droplets. For reactions of ivTT-synthesized transaminase with
pyridinyl amine ( Scheme 1 ), a reaction stock solution
composed of 250 mM pyridinyl amine and 250 mM pyruvate
was prepared before assembling the ivTT reaction. Cell free
transaminase synthesis was performed using PURExpress in
vitro protein synthesis kit. Two solutions, A and B,
reconstituted from the puriﬁed components necessary for E.
coli translation, were provided from the kit. Following the
protocol for a 200μL reaction, 80μL of solution A, and 60μL
of solution B were added sequentially in a nuclease free
microfuge tube placed on ice. Next, 4μL RNAse inhibitor (40
000 units/mL) and 8 μL PLP (2.5 mM) were added to the
mixture. Then, 36 μL of the nuclease free water and 12μL
plasmid DNA (TA-pD451, 300 ng/μL) were added into the
mixture. After all of the ivTT components were added, 180μL
ivTT reaction solution was taken and added with 20 μL
substrate stock solution. The positive control reaction
contained the same components except that expressed ATA-
117 standard replaced the plasmid DNA. The negative control
contained neither ATA-117 standard nor its DNA, thus no
conversion was expected (Table S1). The ﬁnal mixtures of
ivTT reaction, positive control, and the negative control were
immediately sampled (∼1.5 min after mixing) into droplets and
then stored in a 250/1600 Teﬂon tubing. Once sampling was
ﬁnished, both ends of the tubing were sealed with capillary wax
and placed in the 37°C incubator overnight (∼14 h).
HPLC-MS Analysis. For the plate-based transaminase
screening, the reactions on the 96-well plates were also
analyzed with the Agilent HPLC-MS system as a comparison to
the droplet−MS results. ForScheme 2with ATA-036, after the
sample preparation, the samples were injected onto a HPLC
column (Zwix (−) 100 mm× 3 mm, 3μm particle size) with a
separation time of 4 min. Selected ion monitoring (SIM)
signals of β-leucine (m/z 132) were measured. For
Scheme 3
with ATA-117, the samples were injected onto the same
column with a separation time of 3.5 min. Selected ion
monitoring (SIM) signals of truncated sitagliptin ketone and
amine (m/z 277 and m/z 278, respectively) were measured.
