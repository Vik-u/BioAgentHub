Abstract 
Background
Phenytoin is an anticonvulsant medication that is effective in treating 
various seizure disorders. It is mostly metabolized by the liver, which 
increases the risk of PHT-induced hepatotoxicity.
Aims
This study aimed to assess the effectiveness of N-acetylcysteine (NAC) 
in protecting the liver from phenytoin-induced hepatotoxicity in rats.
Materials and Methods
Four sets of five rats male Wistar albino rats (Rattus norvegicus) used 
for this study was based on their availability, well-established 
physiology, and long history of use in pharmacological and 
toxicological studies each were used for analysis. Each of the four 
groups received different treatments: the control group received 
normal saline, one group received 200 mg/kg/day of NAC, another 
group received 5 mg/kg/day of phenytoin, and the fourth group 
received 200 mg/kg/day of both phenytoin and NAC. The treatments 
were administered orally by gavage for 45 days. Biochemical 
indicators (aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine 
aminotransferase (ALT), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), and total serum 
bilirubin (TSB)) were measured in serum after the animals were 
anaesthetized and the experiment ended. Histological analysis was

performed on liver specimens.
Results
Our investigation showed that phenytoin significantly elevated liver 
enzymes and total serum bilirubin compared to the control and NAC 
groups. The concurrent administration of NAC and phenytoin led to a 
notable reduction in these biomarkers, excluding ALP levels. 
Moreover, the group that received NAC alone did not exhibit a 
significant increase in the levels of these biomarkers compared with 
the control group. The histopathological results were in agreement 
with the biochemical tests.
Conclusion
This study concluded that Concomitant administration of NAC and 
phenytoin lowered the risk of phenytoin-induced hepatotoxicity. 
Moreover, this study confirmed that NAC is relatively safe when 
administered for a relatively prolonged period.

Introduction
Phenytoin (PHT) is a medication used to treat neurological and psychiatric conditions, as well as epilepsy (antiepileptic).1
PHT metabolites are associated with liver damage, including cholestatic hepatitis, cytotoxic hepatitis, or mixed
reaction.
2,3 The exact mechanism of PHT-induced hepatotoxicity remains unclear.4 One of the proposed mechanisms
is that PHT may cause significant liberation of reactive oxygen species in hepatic mitochondria, resulting in mitochon-
drial malfunction.3,5 Another proposed mechanism is thought to be related to the activation of inflammatory pathways
with the overproduction of pro-inflammatory cytokines.6,7 N-acetyl cysteine (NAC) has been used in therapeutic contexts
for numerous years. It has been employed in the management of several conditions, including paracetamol overdose,
adriamycin-induced cardiotoxicity, ischemia-reperfusion injury, heavy metal poisoning, and idiopathic pulmonary
fibrosis.
8,9 The presence of a principal function as an antioxidant, its free thiol group, enables it to interact with reactive
oxygen and nitrogen species.10,11 NAC possesses anti-inflammatory properties by inhibiting the nuclear factor kappa-
light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-κB), a key player in the inflammatory cascade and immune response to
oxidative stress. NAC inhibits the translocation of the NF-κB transcription factor and nuclear activation, which are
essential for controlling the expression of genes that promote inflammation.12,13 Research has demonstrated that NAC
inhibits the secretion of inflammatory cytokines, such as TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6, in macrophages that have been
activated by lipopolysaccharide.14 That being said, a number of studies were carried out to investigate the potential
hepatoprotective effects of NAC against various hepatotoxic substances, including carbamazepine,15 Adriamycin,16
anti-tuberculosis drugs,17 and others. This study aimed to evaluate the possible protective effects of NAC against
PTH-induced hepatotoxicity.
Ethical approval
This study was conducted with the approval of the ethical committee of the College of Pharmacy, University of Kerbala
on February 6, 2024 (Ref: 2024An.8).
Methods
Twenty male Wistar albino rats, weighing 120–170 g, were used in this study. The animals were kept in the animal house
at the College of Pharmacy, University of Kerbala, where they had unlimited access to food and drink, 12-hour light/dark
cycle. The animals were acclimated for seven days prior to the experiment, were in good health, and were free of specific
pathogens. All animal procedures in this study were conducted in accordance with institutional and international
guidelines for the ethical treatment of animals. They were divided randomly into four groups, each of which contained
five animals, as follows:
1. The control group administered normal saline only
2. NAC group: NAC (200 mg/kg/day) administered daily for 45 days
3. Phenytoin-treated group: received phenytoin at a dose of 5 mg/kg/day orally for 45 days
4. Phenytoin + NAC group: received phenytoin as in the third group plus NAC (at a dose of 200 mg/kg/day) 1 h
before phenytoin daily for 45 days
The animals were maintained for 24 h following their last dose and then anesthetized with xylazine and ketamine
(75 mg/kg). After the rats were anesthetized, a 5 cc syringe was used to draw blood from their left ventricle. After
centrifuging the serum with an Eppendorf apparatus, it was chilled to -20°C for storage.
18 For histological investigation,
liver tissues were removed, washed with cold phosphate buffer (pH 7.4), weighed, and stored in 10% formalin for later
analysis.19 Biochemical markers, including enzymes that measure total serum bilirubin TSB, ALT, AST, and alkaline
phosphatase activity, were assessed via the colorimetric method, utilizing cell biolabs assay kits in compliance with the
manufacturer’s protocols.
Throughout the study, no unanticipated or anticipated negative events were noted. All efforts were made to minimize
animal suffering, including the use of appropriate anesthesia and analgesia, continuous health monitoring by trained
personnel, and the implementation of humane endpoints when necessary. These measures were undertaken to ensure the
ethical treatment of animals and the reliability of scientific outcome according to ARRIVE reporting guidelines.

Histopathological analysis
The liver was removed and preserved in 10% formalin solution for histopathological examination. Afterwards, the livers
were dehydrated using alcohol at escalating concentrations (80-100%, v/v) and then placed in paraffin blocks.
21 These
blocks were then cut into sections of 4-6μm using a Rotary Microtome. The organ slices were stained with hematoxylin

and eosin (H&E) to assess the tissue morphology using light microscopy. The evaluation of tissue morphology was
performed blindly by an expert histopathologist.
Statistical analysis
SPSS version20 to report the results as mean/C6SD, and one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA)https://www.ibm.com/
products/spss-statistics was used to examine the statistical significance of differences between the experimental groups.

when compared with the other groups. In addition, there was a significant decrease in the serum levels of ALT, AST, and
TSB (except for ALP) in the phenytoin+ NAC group when compared with the phenytoin-treated group. Moreover, in the
NAC only treated group, the levels of liver enzymes were low compared to the control group, but this reduction was
significant only for ALP level, as shown inTable 1, Figure 1: (A-D).
Results of histopathology
In this experimental setting, the liver sections obtained from the control group displayed normal histological character-
istics that were distinguished by a central vein encircled by hepatocytes arranged in a radial fashion. In contrast, liver
samples from the phenytoin-treated group showed prominent features, such as substantial congestion, hepatocyte
degeneration, biliary stasis, vacuolated cytoplasm, localized necrosis, and inflammatory cell infiltration (neutrophils,
lymphocytes, and eosinophils). The phenytoin and N-acetylcysteine groups showed considerable reductions in inflam-
matory cells, necrosis, and degeneration in the liver. Moreover, normal hepatocyte plates and lobular architecture
remained intact. Liver slices from the N-acetyl cysteine group showed no significant abnormal features (Figure 2: a-d).
Discussion
Phenytoin is one of the most widely used antiepileptic drugs in the management of various types of epilepsy. It is
frequently utilized in outpatient settings and almost all emergency services worldwide. It is increasingly being utilized in
therapeutic treatment of neuropathic pain,
22 hiccups, migraines, and wound healing;23 however, its dosage should be
adjusted to reduce the risk of unwanted effects, which could lead to its withdrawal even if it is beneficial.24 Phenytoin is
commonly included in the list of ten major causes of drug-induced acute liver failure. More than 10% of cases of acute
phenytoin hepatitis accompanied by jaundice lead to fatality. If signs of jaundice or liver illness occur early during
treatment, it is advisable to halt the use of phenytoin.
23–25 Liver maintenance was evaluated by measuring ALT, AST, and
ALP levels, which are enzymes that are mainly expressed at higher levels in the cytoplasm. During liver injury, these
enzymes are released into the bloodstream in accordance with the severity of the liver damage.26 Serum bilirubin level is

an additional conventional marker of liver damage. The findings of our investigation indicate that phenytoin therapy
resulted in varying degrees of biochemical changes in the liver enzymes of rats relative to other groups. Additionally,
Phenytoin caused hepatic necrosis with focal degeneration and biliary stasis in rat livers, as shown by histopathological
analysis. The obtained results were consistent with the findings of the investigated biochemical parameters. This study
confirmed the hepatotoxic effects of phenytoin treatment. N-acetylcysteine (NAC) is a synthetic form of cysteine. It is
widely recognized as an anti-inflammatory and antioxidant agent that provides hepatoprotection against liver injury
caused by paracetamol.
9 Different mechanisms have been suggested to be involved in the pathogenesis of phenytoin-
induced hepatotoxicity, including oxidative stress and depletion of antioxidants.3 This provided a rationale for inves-
tigating the potential preventive benefits of NAC against PHT-induced hepatic damage caused by phenytoin. NAC
mainly enhances the formation of glutathione and removes reactive oxygen species (ROS) generated during oxidative
stress.9,12,16 Moreover, various studies have examined the probable mechanisms that may explain the positive benefits of
NAC in cases of nonparacetamol overdose. Previous studies have demonstrated that NAC stimulates guanylate cyclase
activation, probably due to its anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, inotropic, and vasodilatory properties that enhance hepatic
blood circulation and oxygen supply to essential organs.27 NAC can mitigate endoplasmic reticulum tension and enhance
mitochondrial function, both of which aid in liver protection against damage.28,29 The same results were observed in cell
cultures treated with tuberculosis medicines,30 which further enhanced the potential positive effects of this agent in
protecting the liver. The current investigation found that concomitant administration of NAC and phenytoin for 45 days
led to a considerable decrease in phenytoin-induced hepatotoxicity, as indicated by the reduction in TSB, ALT, and AST
levels. Moreover, NAC restored normal liver histopathology. These results are in agreement with those of previous
studies that have demonstrated the hepatoprotective effects of NAC against several hepatotoxic conditions. Eftikhari
et al.,
31 found that NAC effectively reduced the increased levels of ALT and AST in an animal model of liver injury
associated with risperidone. Additionally, NAC has demonstrated a defense mechanism against liver damage caused by
other hepatotoxic medicines and chemicals, including adriamycin,16 azathioprine,32 and dimethyl nitrosamine.33 In
summary, NAC at a daily dose of (200) revealed a valuable effect against phenytoin-induced toxicity, probably because
NAC acts as a scavenger of free radicals and mediates the oxidative stress pathway.
Conclusion
This study concluded that concomitant administration of NAC and phenytoin lowers the risk of phenytoin-induced
hepatotoxicity. Moreover, this study confirmed that NAC is relatively safe when administered for a relatively prolonged
period.

The protective effect of N-acetyl cysteine (NAC) against phenytoin (PHT)-induced hepatotoxicity in 
rats was examined in this study. A common antiepileptic medication, phenytoin, is linked to liver 
damage via oxidative stress and inflammatory pathways. Four groups of twenty rats were created: 
phenytoin + NAC, NAC only, control, and phenytoin only. After 45 days, histopathological analysis 
and biochemical markers (ALT, AST, ALP, and total bilirubin) were conducted. Significant increases 
in liver enzymes and noticeable histological damage, such as necrosis, biliary stasis, and 
inflammatory infiltration, were observed in the phenytoin group. Rats given phenytoin + NAC, on 
the other hand, showed decreased inflammation, preserved liver architecture, and decreased 
levels of bilirubin, ALT, and AST. NAC by itself had no negative effects. The results validate that 
NAC is a safe and efficient hepatoprotective agent by significantly reducing phenytoin-induced 
liver injury through its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. 
 
1. Condense sentences about the anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties of NAC into a 
single, succinct statement. 
 2. Table 1 is instructive, but the legend needs to provide a more thorough explanation of the 
labeling (a, b, c, and d for significance). 
 3. Although there is some repetition of background information, the discussion effectively 
connects findings to literature. 
4. What led to the selection of 200 mg/kg/day of NAC? Did you take dose-response into account?

Title: Hepatoprotective Potential of N-Acetyl Cysteine in Rats with Phenytoin-Induced Liver Injury 
Abstract 
The abstract was written well but I think that the aim is best modified as (This study aimed to 
evaluate the protective effect of N-acetylcysteine (NAC) against PHT-induced hepatotoxicity in 
rats). 
Introduction 
The introduction was good but required short paragraphs about the number of studies that were 
carried out that investigated the potential hepatoprotective effects of NAC against various 
hepatotoxic substances. 
I suggest a paragraph included more detail about N-acetyl cysteine in introduction section 
Methods 
1.why you give first group normal saline? 
2. In the paragraph (The animals were acclimated for seven days prior to the experiment, were in

good health, and were free of specific pathogens), how did you prove that the animals were free 
of pathogens? I suggest to remove this sentence. 
3. Please put a reference for the paragraph (The animals were maintained for 24 h following their 
last dose and then anesthetized with xylazine and ketamine (75 mg/kg). Also, the anesthetic dose 
of xylazine not mentioned. 
4. How were the animals sacrificed? 
5. This paragraph also needs reference (Biochemical markers, including enzymes that measure 
total serum bilirubin TSB, ALT, AST, and alkaline phosphatase activity, were assessed via the 
colorimetric method, utilizing cell biolabs assay kits in compliance with the manufacturer’s 
protocols). 
6. Histopathological analysis section also without reference. 
7. In Statistical analysis section, the SPSS version was not mentioned. 
4. Results 
1. In the introduction section, you discussed the proposed mechanisms behind NAC's hepatic 
protective effects, such as its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties; therefore, it would be 
beneficial to measure an inflammatory marker, such as the cellular expression of NFKB, along with 
antioxidant biomarkers in your study groups to confirm your findings. 
2. In the section on results of histopathology and the related figure 2, it is best to indicate the 
histopathological scoring features, like prominent features such as substantial congestion, 
hepatocyte degeneration, biliary stasis, vacuolated cytoplasm, localized necrosis, and 
inflammatory cell infiltration (neutrophils, lymphocytes, and eosinophils), with arrows to be clearly 
understood. 
5. Discussion 
The discussion section was good. It provided valuable insights and highlighted the key findings of 
the study. Overall, it effectively connected the research to the broader context of the field. 
6. Conclusion 
Conclusion It's best to mention a recommended note that further studies in humans are required. 
This will help to validate the findings and ensure their applicability to diverse populations. 
Additionally, exploring the underlying mechanisms could provide deeper insights into the 
observed effects. 
References 
The references were written well. They provided clear insights and supported the arguments 
effectively. Overall, the attention to detail in the citations enhanced the credibility of the work.
 
Is the work clearly and accurately presented and does it cite the current literature?

The author should explain the dose of NAC used in the model.1. 
In Table 1, the level of ALP did not decrease in Phenytoin/NAC group compared to Phenytoin 
group. More discussion relating to Table 1 is needed.
2. 
Mechanism of NAC in protecting phenytoin induced liver injury should be investigated. For 
example, NAC is an antioxidant, the oxidative stress levels in liver tissue should be 
measured. The activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD) can be measured to assess the 
tissue’s antioxidant defense capacity.
