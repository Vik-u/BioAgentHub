Abstract: ω-Transaminases are biocatalysts capable of asymmetrically synthesizing high-
value chiral amines through the reductive amination of carbonyl compounds, and they are
ubiquitously distributed across diverse microorganisms. Despite their broad natural occur-
rence, the industrial utility of naturally occurring ω-transaminases remains constrained by
their limited catalytic efficiency toward sterically bulky substrates. Over recent decades,
the use of structure-guided molecular modifications, leveraging three-dimensional struc-
tures, catalytic mechanisms, and machine learning-driven predictions, has emerged as
a transformative strategy to address this limitation. Notably, these advancements have
unlocked unprecedented progress in the asymmetric synthesis of bulky chiral amines,
which is exemplified by the industrial-scale production of sitagliptin using engineered
ω-transaminases. This review systematically explores the structural and mechanistic foun-
dations of ω-transaminase engineering. We first delineate the substrate binding regions
of these enzymes, focusing on their defining features such as substrate tunnels and dual
pockets. These structural elements serve as critical targets for rational design to enhance
substrate promiscuity. Next, we dissect the catalytic and substrate recognition mechanisms
of (S)- and (R)-ω-transaminases. Drawing on these insights, we consolidate recent advances
in engineering ω-transaminases to highlight their performance in synthesizing bulky chiral
amines and aim to guide future research and the industrial implementation of tailored
ω-transaminases.

1. Introduction
In recent years, nearly 50% of the top 200 best-selling small-molecule drugs in the
world contain one or more chiral amine components in their structure [ 1]. Synthetic
methods of accessing this important type of chiral block have attracted much attention
from scholars worldwide, and asymmetric reductive amination is regarded as an important
synthetic approach [2–4]. Compared with chemical asymmetric synthesis, the asymmetric
reductive amination catalyzed by ω-transaminases has the advantages of mild reaction
conditions, high enantioselectivity and environmental friendliness. The theoretical yield
and atomic utilization rate can both reach 100%, which is consistent with the development

direction of green chemistry. Therefore,ω-transaminase-catalyzed asymmetric reductive
amination has been identified as an efficient green method for preparing chiral amines [5,6].
For example, compared with the chemical synthetic route for sitagliptin, using engineered
ω-transaminase from Arthrobacter sp. to catalyze the key chiral intermediate increased the
total yield and productivity by 13% and 53% and decreased the total waste emissions by
19%. This achievement won the U.S. Presidential Green Chemistry Challenge Award in
2010 [7,8].
ω-Transaminases can catalyze the asymmetric reductive amination of carbonyl com-
pounds to produce chiral amines. Distinct from other transaminases, ω-transaminases
exhibit broader substrate versatility, acting not only onα-amino acids or α-keto acids but
also efficiently converting ketones and aldehydes (Figure 1A). This unique capability sig-
nificantly enhances their potential for industrial applications in chiral amine synthesis [9].
Investigations into the substrate specificity of ω-transaminases from microbial sources,
including Aspergillus fumigatus, Vibrio fluvialis, and Chromobacterium violaceum, indicate
that naturally occurring ω-transaminases exhibit substrate preference toward methyl ke-
tones and relevant amines [10–12]. However, a critical limitation arises in pharmaceutical
contexts: many bioactive chiral amines, such as the antiviral drug oseltamivir and the
antidiabetic drug sitagliptin (Figure 1B), contain two sterically demanding substituents.
Naturally occurring ω-transaminases struggle to accommodate such bulky substrates due
to structural constraints in their substrate binding regions, severely hindering industrial uti-
lization. Structural analyses highlight that the substrate binding region of ω-transaminases
comprises a substrate tunnel and dual pockets. Spatial restrictions, particularly within the
smaller pocket, which accommodates only compact substituents, render wild-type enzymes
catalytically inactive or ineffective toward substrates with dual bulky groups. Overcoming
this limitation by engineering ω-transaminases to expand their substrate scope remains a
pivotal challenge for enabling their practical use in synthesizing pharmaceutically relevant
chiral amines.

future research and the industrial implementation of tailored ω-transaminases.
2. Structural Characteristics, Catalytic Mechanism, and Substrate
Recognition Mechanism
2.1. Structural Classification and Substrate Binding Features
ω-Transaminases represent a ubiquitous class of pyridoxal-5 ′ -phosphate (PLP)-
dependent transferases found across diverse microbial species. These enzymes are classified
into two functional subgroups, (S)-ω-transaminases and (R)-ω-transaminases, based on
their enantioselectivity profiles. Within the PLP-dependent enzyme superfamily, (S)- and
(R)-ω-transaminases exhibit distinct structural architectures, belonging to Fold Types I and
IV , respectively. Representative examples include the (S)-ω-transaminase from Vibrio fluvi-
alis JS17 (Vf TA; PDB ID: 4E3Q) and the (R)-ω-transaminase from Aspergillus terreus (AtTA;
PDB ID: 4CE5), which exemplify the evolutionary divergence in fold organization and
catalytic mechanisms between these subgroups [14,15]. These enzymes exhibit divergent
polypeptide lengths and tertiary structural organizations, leading to both conserved cat-
alytic motifs and pronounced architectural differences. ω-Transaminases typically function
as homodimers with their active sites positioned at the subunit interface (Figure 2(A1,B1)).
Substrates access the dual-pocket active site through a substrate tunnel (Figure 2(A2,B2)),
where the binding cavity is partitioned into a large pocket (accommodating bulky/charged
groups like aromatics or carboxylates) and a small pocket (restricted to small substituents,
e.g., methyl groups, due to steric, electrostatic, and hydrophobic constraints).
In Vf TA, the large pocket comprises eight residues spanning both subunits: Phe19(A),
Tyr150(A), Tyr165(A), Phe85(B), Phe86(B), Gly320(B), Phe321(B), and Thr322(B). The small
pocket is formed by five residues from the A subunit: Trp57(A), Ala228(A), Val258(A),
Ile259(A), and Arg415(A). In contrast, AtTA features a large pocket with seven interfacial
residues: Tyr60(A), Phe115(A), Glu117(A), Leu182(A), Trp184(A), His55(B), and Arg128(B),
while its small pocket involves four A-subunit residues: Val62(A), Thr274(A), Thr275(A),
and Ala276(A) (Figure 2(A 3,B3)). The substrate access tunnels in naturally occurring
ω-transaminases impose steric restrictions on bulky substrates, while the dual-pocket
architecture further constrains binding efficiency. These structural features, particularly the
asymmetric residue composition of the pockets, reflect evolutionary adaptations to distinct
substrate profiles with fold type-dependent variations in β-sheet topology and domain
packing dictating stereochemical preferences.

2.2. Catalytic Mechanisms 
As PLP-dependent transferases, ω-transaminases catalyze transamination through a 
two-step reversible reaction, following the ping-pong bi-bi reaction mechanism [16,17]. 
As shown in Figure 3, in the ﬁrst step, a condensation reaction between the amino group 
of the catalytic residue Lys and the aldehyde group of PLP generates an internal aldehyde 
imide (I); then, a novel aldehyde imide (II) is formed by replacing the amino group of Lys 
with an external amino donor. On this basis, Lys-catalyzed proton transfer is observed to

the quinone-type intermediate (III) and the ketoimine intermediate (IV) successively. Finally,

As shown in Figure 4, the spatial positions of the key catalytic residue Lys relative to 
PLP or the bound substrate in ( S)-ω-transaminases and ( R)-ω-transaminases are mirror 
images of each other. The stereo con ﬁguration of chiral amines, produced by the asym-
metric catalysis of ω-transaminases, depends on the bind ing orientation of the substrate 
in the active center of the enzyme. In ( S)-ω-transaminase VfTA, Lys285 is located on the 
si-face of PLP (relative to C4′) and mainly attacks from the re-face of the substrate (relative 
to the prochiral carbon) to produce the ( S)-product. In contrast, in ( R)-ω-transaminase 
AtTA, Lys180 in (R)-ω-transaminase AtTA is located on the re-face of PLP (relative to C4′) 
and attacks mainly from the si-face of the substrate (relative to the prochiral carbon) to 
produce the (R)-product. In most cases, ω-transaminases show excellent stereoselectivity. 
Nonetheless, when substrates wi th special structures exhibit di ﬀerent binding orienta-
tions in the substrate binding pocket, chiral products with diﬀerent stereo conﬁgurations 
are generated, thus reducing the chiral purity of the products.

2.3. Substrate Recognition Mechanisms
In the process of amino transfer catalyzed by ω-transaminases, substrates (amino
donors and ketones) with significant differences need to be bound to the enzyme succes-
sively [18]. Taking D-alanine and acetophenone as examples, the former is hydrophilic,
and the latter is hydrophobic. How do ω-transaminases achieve an efficient recognition
and binding of these two different substrates? Skalden and coworkers proposed the dual
substrate recognition of (R)-ω-transaminase from Aspergillus fumigatus, and the substrate
tunnel played a gating role in the recognition and binding of hydrophilic and hydrophobic
substrates. As shown in Figure 5, the loop (green) in the substrate tunnel could be flipped,
resulting in the movement of the guanidine of Arg126 into the active site to facilitate
coordination to the carboxylated substrate (D-alanine). In another case, the guanidine
of Arg126 could move out of the active site by flipping the loop (orange) to provide a
hydrophobic environment and facilitate the binding of hydrophobic substrates (acetophe-
none) [19]. Dual substrate recognition has also been reported for the (R)-ω-transaminase
from Arthrobacter sp., in which Arg138 plays the same important role in the substrate
recognition process [20].

2.3. Substrate Recognition Mechanisms 
In the process of amino transfer catalyzed by ω-transaminases, substrates (amino do-
nors and ketones) with signi ﬁcant diﬀerences need to be bound to the enzyme succes-
sively [18]. Taking D-alanine and acetophenone as examples, the former is hydrophilic, 
and the la tter is hydrophobic. How do ω-transaminases achieve an e ﬃcient recognition 
and binding of these two diﬀerent substrates? Skalden and coworkers proposed the dual 
substrate recognition of (R)-ω-transaminase from Aspergillus fumigatus, and the substrate 
tunnel played a gating role in the recognition and binding of hydrophilic and hydropho-
bic substrates. As shown in Figure 5, the l oop (green) in the substrate tunnel could be 
ﬂipped, resulting in the movement of the guanidine of Arg126 into the active site to facil-
itate coordination to the carboxylated substrate (D-alanine). In another case, the guanidine 
of Arg126 could move out of the active site by ﬂipping the loop (orange) to provide a 
hydrophobic environment and facilitate the binding of hydrophobic substrates (acetophe-
none) [19]. Dual substrate recognition has also been reported for the ( R)-ω-transaminase 
from Arthrobacter sp., in which Arg138 plays the same important role in the substrate 
recognition process [20].

3. Molecular Modiﬁcation of ω-Transaminases to Expand the  
Substrate Scope 
3.1. Substrate Speciﬁcity of ω-Transaminases 
Early eﬀorts in ω-transaminase discovery primarily relied on traditional microbial 
culture screening methodologies. Representa tive examples include the isolation of 
Klebsiella pneumoniae JS2F, Bacillus thuringiensis JS64, and Vibrio ﬂuvialis JS17 through cul-
ture screening using ( S)-α-methylbenzylamine as the sole nitrogen source [21]. These 
strains demonstrated remarkable (S)-enantioselectivity and broad amino donor speciﬁcity 
toward aromatic and aliphatic chiral amines containing a methyl group adjacent to the 
chiral center. With the rapid development of genetic engineering, the gene sequences of 
multiple (S)-ω-transaminases have been reported. The (S)-ω-transaminase from Vibrio ﬂu-
vialis JS17 (VfTA) has been intensively studied [22]. On this basis, homologous sequence 
searching technology was applied to mine ( S)-ω-transaminases of di ﬀerent origins, in-
cluding another well-studied (S)-ω-transaminase from Chromobacterium violaceum (CvTA), 
which showed 38% identity to VfTA and also exhibited a substrate preference for methyl 
ketones [23]. The ( S)-ω-transaminases mentioned above can generally catalyze the

Substrate Scope
3.1. Substrate Specificity of ω-Transaminases
Early efforts in ω-transaminase discovery primarily relied on traditional microbial
culture screening methodologies. Representative examples include the isolation ofKlebsiella
pneumoniae JS2F,Bacillus thuringiensis JS64, and Vibrio fluvialisJS17 through culture screening
using (S)-α-methylbenzylamine as the sole nitrogen source [21]. These strains demonstrated
remarkable (S)-enantioselectivity and broad amino donor specificity toward aromatic and
aliphatic chiral amines containing a methyl group adjacent to the chiral center. With
the rapid development of genetic engineering, the gene sequences of multiple (S)- ω-
transaminases have been reported. The (S)-ω-transaminase from Vibrio fluvialis JS17 (Vf TA)
has been intensively studied [22]. On this basis, homologous sequence searching technology
was applied to mine ( S)-ω-transaminases of different origins, including another well-
studied (S)-ω-transaminase from Chromobacterium violaceum (CvTA), which showed 38%

Microorganisms 2025, 13, 820 7 of 20
(S)-ω-transaminases mentioned above can generally catalyze the asymmetric reduction of
methyl ketones to generate (S)-amines using L-alanine as the amino donor.
Research on (R)-ω-transaminases has progressed through distinct phases. (1) Pioneer-
ing discovery: In 2001, Yamada et al. reported an (R)-ω-transaminase from Arthrobacter sp.
(ArTA) capable of synthesizing D-alanine from pyruvate using (R)-α-methylbenzylamine
as the amino donor. This 993 bp gene-encoded enzyme represented the first fully se-
quenced (R)-ω-transaminase [24]. (2) Database mining: In 2001, Höhne et al. systemat-
ically identified 17 phylogenetically diverse ( R)-ω-transaminases through catalytic mo-
tif analysis, revealing their preferential activity toward chiral methyl-group-containing
substrates like (R)-α-methylbenzylamine in pyruvate-driven asymmetric amination [25].
(3) Computational exploration: In 2015, Jiang et al. employed in silico motif-BLAST strate-
gies to discover five novel ( R)-ω-transaminases with pronounced catalytic bias for ( R)-
α-methylbenzylamine/pyruvate systems [ 26]. (4) Substrate scope expansion: In 2019,
Telzerow et al. characterized a (R)-ω-transaminase from Exophiala xenobiotica (ExTA) ex-
hibiting native competence in converting sterically demanding substrates, including biaryl
ketones, which was a notable advancement in substrate diversity [27]. To date, over thirty
(R)-ω-transaminases have been cataloged [28,29].
Comparative analyses reveal conserved substrate preferences across both ( S)- and
(R)-ω-transaminases: (1) high catalytic efficiency toward methyl ketones and (2) markedly
reduced or undetectable activity against substrates bearing dual bulky substituents. The
restricted substrate specificity of ω-transaminases underscores the need for molecular
modification to broaden substrate tolerance while preserving desired enantioselectivity.
3.2. Methyl Ketones and Relevant Amines Bearing One Bulky Substituent
As collated in Table 1, the molecular modification targeting methyl ketones and
relevant amines bearing one bulky substituent was summarized comprehensively in this
section. The catalytic activity of Vf TA toward aliphatic amines is usually lower than that
toward aromatic amines. A mutant library of Vf TA was constructed using error-prone PCR
by Yun and coworkers, and then the enrichment culture was carried out with 2-amino-
heptane as the sole nitrogen source and 2-butanone as the inhibitor against Vf TA. The
resulting mutant ω-Tamla P233L/V297A exhibited a 1.7- to 2-fold improvement in catalytic
activity toward different aliphatic amines and a 4.5- to 6-fold improvement in the product
inhibition constant toward 2-butanone and 2-heptanone [30]. On the basis of homology
modeling and structure–activity relationship analysis, Cho and coworkers determined that
Trp57 and Trp147 in the large binding pocket of Vf TA affect the binding between Vf TA
and aliphatic amines. When Gly was introduced at these two sites, the two mutants both
presented better catalytic activity toward different aliphatic amines and aromatic amines
than wild-type Vf TA with 40.6- and 14.3-fold greater activity toward 4-phenylbutylamine
and 14.6- and 1.4-fold greater activity toward 6-methylheptan-2-amine [31].
The steric hindrance effect is a key factor affecting the catalytic activity of ω-
transaminases toward aromatic methyl ketones with high steric hindrance. Mutating
the amino acid residues in the substrate binding region of ω-transaminases into residues
with smaller side chains can effectively expand the space of the substrate binding region,
thus increasing its catalytic efficiency. On the basis of in silico andin vitro studies, Dourado
and coworkers designed an iterative rational strategy for reshaping the substrate bind-
ing region of Vf TA with a minimal number of mutations. The substrate binding region
was slightly expanded by W57G/R415A mutations, which resulted in detectable activity
toward 2-acetylbiphenyl, and the best mutant bearing 7 mutations presented a 1716-fold
improvement in the reaction rate of the asymmetric synthesis of (1S)-1-(1,1 ′ -biphenyl-2-
yl)ethanamine [32]. The wild-type (S)- ω-transaminase from Halomonas elongata (HeTA)
Microorganisms 2025, 13, 820 8 of 20
showed detectable catalytic activity toward different aromatic methyl ketones, and the
stereoelectronic effect was identified by Contente and coworkers as a crucial factor in the
reaction. When the W56G mutation was introduced in the substrate binding region, a signif-
icant reduction in the stereoelectronic and steric hindrance effects was observed, resulting
in a greater than 2-fold improvement in the activity toward ortho-nitroacetophenone [33].
Progress has also been made in the protein engineering of (R)-ω-transaminases of different
origins for the catalysis of bulky biaryl ketones and naphthyl ketones. Aline and coworkers
reported that naturally occurringExTA was able to convert biaryl ketones to the correspond-
ing chiral amines and that the mutation T273S in the small binding pocket could increase
the catalytic activity and broaden the substrate scope, enabling the conversion of various
biaryl ketones with up to >99% conversion and excellent enantioselectivity (>99% ee) [27].
Cheng and coworkers reshaped the substrate binding pocket of (R)-ω-transaminase from
Mycobacterium vanbaalenii (MvTA) through a fluorescence-based high-throughput screening
method to increase its catalytic activity toward bulky naphthyl ketones. Two beneficial
substitutions (G68Y and F129A) and three improved mutants were identified from ap-
proximately 8000 clones, among which the best mutant, MvTA-M5, exhibited more than a
100-fold improvement in activity toward acetonaphthone with ee > 99% (R) [34].
Although ω-transaminases exhibit a relatively broad substrate spectrum, they gener-
ally have much lower catalytic activity toward ketones and aldehydes than toward their
natural substrate pyruvate, which limits their application in the asymmetric synthesis of
chiral amines. To improve the substrate preference of (S)-ω-transaminase from Ochrobac-
trum anthropic (OaTA), eight amino acid residues in the active center (<3 Å) were selected
for alanine scanning, resulting in a positive mutation, W58A, that improved the catalytic
activity. The final variant W58L was further identified via saturation mutagenesis and ex-
hibited a 41- to 760-fold improvement in activity toward different methyl ketones and a 59%
decrease in catalytic activity toward pyruvate [35]. On the basis of homologous sequence
alignment and protein structure analysis, four amino acid residues (Leu56, Trp57, Arg415,
and Leu417) in the large binding pocket of Vf TA were shown to play important roles in
the binding of Vf TA to α-keto acids or aldehydes. The substrate preference of Vf TA was
converted from pyruvate to pentanal when certain mutations were introduced at these four
sites. When (S)-1-phenylethylamine, (S)-1-phenylpropylamine, or (S)-1-phenylbutylamine
was used as the amino donor, the best mutant, M3 (W57F/R415L/L417V), exhibited 2.8-,
3.0-, and 5.1-fold increases in activity toward pentanal, respectively [36]. In our previous
research, (R)-ω-transaminase AtTA was found to exhibit much lower catalytic activity
toward 4-hydroxy-2-butanone than toward pyruvate. The substrate tunnel and binding
pocket were reshaped by a combinatorial active-site saturation test, resulting in the best
mutant AtTA-M5 (H55A/G126F/S215P) with significantly improved catalytic efficiency
and thermal stability for the asymmetric synthesis of ( R)-3-amino-1-butanol. Moreover,
the ability of the key mutation S215P to improve the catalytic efficiency of seven other
homologous (R)-ω-transaminases was validated [37]. Ketones and aldehydes have always
been important raw materials for the asymmetric synthesis of chiral amines, and improving
the catalytic ability of ω-transaminases toward these compounds could effectively promote
their industrial application.

3.3. Ketones and Relevant Amines Bearing Two Bulky Substituents
In most pharmaceutical chiral amines, there are two bulky substituents on both sides
of the chiral carbon atom. Naturally occurring ω-transaminases show negligible or un-
detectable ability to synthesize these compounds, which has become the main bottleneck
restricting the application of ω-transaminases in the asymmetric synthesis of chiral amines.
As collated in Table 2, the molecular modification ofω-transaminases targeting the substrate
tunnel and binding pocket was able to address this challenge effectively, thus expanded
the application scope of ω-transaminases in chiral amine synthesis.
Among ω-transaminases of different origins, the molecular modification ofVfTA to
facilitate the asymmetric catalysis of bulky substrates has been reported extensively. Owing
to the initial lack of clear information about the three-dimensional structure and catalytic
mechanism of VfTA, the directed evolution strategy was employed. Error-prone PCR
was used by Hwang and coworkers for random mutation of the target gene, and high-
throughput screening was subsequently carried out by using 3-amino-3-phenylpropionic
acid as the sole nitrogen source for primary screening culture and observing the appearance
of color generated by the reaction ofα-amino acids and copper ions. The resulting mutants
exhibited up to a 3.1-fold improvement in the conversion of 3-amino-3-phenylpropionic
acid [38]. With extensive studies on the structure and mechanism, structure-dependent ra-
tional design and mechanism-guided computational design methods have been successfully
employed to engineer VfTA to improve its catalytic ability toward bulky substrates. In the
protein engineering ofVf TA for the synthesis of (3S,5R)-3-amino-5-methyl-octanoate ethyl
ester from (R)-5-methyl-3-oxo-octanoate ethyl ester, homologous sequence alignment and
ProteinGPSTM statistical analysis were combined to construct approximately450 mutants,
and the best mutant, r414, bearing eight mutations, showed more than 60-fold improved cat-
alytic activity. To further improve protein engineering efficiency, a computational protocol
for predicting the catalytic activity ofVf TA mutants was developed by Sirin and coworkers
via the combination of molecular dynamics, docking, and MM-GBSA scoring. Eighty-nine
mutants were constructed by using this protocol, including the best mutant, r414, which
was mentioned above. Two optimal mutants were then identified with 20- and 60-fold im-
provements in catalytic activity [39]. Naturally occurring Vf TA showed negligible catalytic
activity towardα-hydroxy ketones and aryl-alkyl ketones bearing an alkyl substituent larger
than a methyl group. Systematic mutagenesis of the active site residues was carried out
by Nobili and coworkers to expand the substrate scope. Two mutants, F85L/V153A and
Y150M/V153A, were subsequently identified, with a 26-fold increase in activity toward
(S)-phenylbutylamine and a 53-fold increase in activity toward (R)-phenylglycinol, respec-
tively [40]. In addition, Vf TA has been applied to synthesize other chiral amines bearing two
bulky substituents. Genz and coworkers selected seven residues ofVf TA through bioinfor-
matic tools to expand the substrate binding pocket, which was followed by mutant library
construction and high-throughput screening. Three mutants allowing the asymmetric syn-
thesis of tert-butylphenyl amine were identified, among which the best mutant, bearing
four mutations (L56V , W57C, F85V , V153A), presented high catalytic activity and stereos-
electivity in the asymmetric synthesis of ( R)-2,2-dimethyl-1-phenylpropan-1-amine [41].
(2R,4S)-5-([1,1′ -biphenyl]-4-yl)-4-amino-2-methylpentanoic acid, a chiral precursor of the
heart failure drug sacubitril, is very difficult to synthesize asymmetrically by using naturally
occurring ω-transaminases. Using the Codex Amine Transaminase Screening Kit, Scott
and coworkers identified a variant ofVfTA ATA-217 bearing seventeen mutations, which
exhibited trace activity and preferences for the undesired diastereoisomer. Through eleven
rounds of enzyme evolution, the new variant CDX-043 was obtained. CDX-043 showed
high productivity, excellent stereoselectivity, and high process robustness and allowed the
efficient and cost-effective production of sacubitril at a large scale [42].
Microorganisms 2025, 13, 820 11 of 20
Another well-studied (S)-ω-transaminase, CvTA, was characterized by Kaulmann and
coworkers in 2007. CvTA has high potential as a useful biocatalyst because of its broad
amino acceptor range but lacks the ability to accommodate substrates with bulky groups
on both sides of the chiral or prochiral carbon. The residues in the small binding pocket
and substrate tunnel have been successively targeted to expand the substrate scope of
CvTA toward sterically demanding substrates. Two double mutants (F88L/C418(G/L))
developed by Moritz Voss and coworkers showed more than 200-fold improved activity
in the conversion of (S)-1-phenylbutylamine [43]. Another double mutant (L59A/F88A)
was successfully applied in the kinetic resolution of 1,2-diphenylethylamine, generating
enantiomerically pure (R)-1,2-diphenylethylamine with ee > 99% [44]. Owing to the en-
larged small binding pocket and good tolerance to high concentrations of isopropylamine,
the single mutant (L59A) of CvTA was also employed for the asymmetric synthesis of (S)-1-
phenylbutylamine, producing bulky amines in enantiomerically pure form (>99% ee) [45].
For the key chiral intermediate of rimegepant with two rigid and sterically hindered sub-
stituents, naturally occurring ω-transaminases with detectable activity toward the desired
ketone have not yet been identified. Ma and coworkers proposed a two-pronged strategy
to access this asymmetric synthesis. First, a variant derived from CvTA was identified by
screening the transaminase library using a truncated substrate analog and selected as the
starting scaffold. A combination of a rational approach and several evolution strategies
was subsequently carried out to enlarge the substrate binding pocket. Through ten rounds
of enzyme evolution, the resultant variant showed more than 50,000-fold improved activity
and high stereoselectivity (>99.5% de), which indicated promise for industrial applica-
tion [46]. For substrates with greater steric hindrance and complex structures, screening
of the starting scaffold and the further rational design of naturally occurring enzymes
via a truncated substrate analog constitute a recommended strategy, which was reported
earlier in the biocatalytic asymmetric synthesis of the sitagliptin intermediate by Codexis
and Merck. Owing to the greater steric hindrance of the prositagliptin ketone, none of the
naturally occurring ω-transaminases with detectable activity were screened. A substrate
walking approach was first applied to create a single mutant S223P of (R)-ω-transaminase
ArTA, which exhibited catalytic activity toward the truncated methyl ketone analog. An-
other mutant, S223P/Y26H/V65A/V69G/F122I/A284G, was subsequently developed via
directed evolution and rational design; this mutant exhibited catalytic activity toward
bulky prositagliptin ketones for the first time. Through eleven rounds of enzyme evolu-
tion, the final mutant Rd11TA, featuring twenty-seven mutations, exhibited more than
28000-fold improved catalytic activity and was successfully applied in the manufacture of
sitagliptin [7,47].
In addition to Vf TA and CvTA, studies on the molecular modification of ω-
transaminases of other origins have also been extensively reported. (S)-ω-transaminases
from Caulobacter crescentus (CcTA) and Burkholderia vietnamiensis (BvTA) were engineered
to accept bulky β-amino acids and esters, respectively. When Val227 and Asn285 in the
substrate binding pocket of CcTA were changed to Gly and Ala, which have smaller side
chains, the catalytic activity toward 3-amino-3-phenylpropionic acid increased 1.4-fold and
1.9-fold, respectively, whereas the catalytic activity toward 3-aminobutyric acid decreased
to 56% and 28%, respectively, of that of wild-typeCcTA [48]. BvTA showed poor catalytic
activity toward β-keto esters with little steric hindrance and was further engineered to
accept bulky β-keto esters by Wang and coworkers. The best mutant, HBV_MIII, was
applied in the asymmetric synthesis of aliphatic β-amino acids at the semipreparative scale
with high yield and enantioselectivity [49].
α-Keto acids are favorable substrates for ω-transaminases in the production of enan-
tiopure amino acids, but the naturally occurring enzymes show little or no reactivity toward
Microorganisms 2025, 13, 820 12 of 20
α-keto acids bearing larger substituents. Park and coworkers reported the first example in
which a naturally occurring (S)-ω-transaminase from Paracoccus denitrificans (PdTA) was
able to accommodate the bulky n-butyl substituent in the small binding pocket. Alanine
scanning mutagenesis was then applied to six different residues of the small binding pocket,
which revealed that the V153A mutant exhibited significant catalytic activity towardα-keto
acids bearing bulky n-hexyl substituents [ 50]. ( R)-ω-transaminase from Gibberella zeae
(GzTA) was also selected as a starting scaffold because of its high activity and stereoselec-
tivity. By reshaping the substrate tunnel and binding pocket, the conversion activity of the
triple mutant F113L/V60A/S214A toward 2-oxo-2-phenylacetic acid increased by 3.8-fold
relative to that of the wild-type enzyme [51].
Owing to the special structure of the substrate tunnel and binding pocket, chiral aryl
alkyl amines with a small substituent larger than the methyl group have always been
difficult to synthesize using naturally occurring ω-transaminases. Han and coworkers
reported that the orientation of the bound prochiral ketone in the (S)-ω-transaminase from
Ochrobactrum anthropic (OaTA) was not conducive to nucleophilic attack during the reaction.
An efficient computational strategy was then developed to create high-turnover mutants
tailored for a target ketone, resulting in a double mutant, L57A/W58A, with 105-fold
activity improvement toward butyrophenone and no loss of stereoselectivity [52]. Konia
and coworkers engineered (R)-ω-transaminase from Luminiphilus syltensis (LsTA) to expand
the small binding pocket, and the V37A mutant exhibited increased activity toward 1-
phenylpropylamine and 1-butylamine [53]. Instead of modifying the small binding pocket,
Xie and coworkers rationally engineered the large binding pocket of an (S)-ω-transaminase
from Paraburkholderia phymatum (PpTA) to relieve the inherent restriction caused by the
small binding pocket. The resulting quadruple mutant M78F/W82A/I284F/T440Q exhib-
ited 104- to 230-fold improved activity toward various bulky aryl alkyl ketones with a small
substituent bulkier than the methyl group [54].
Chiral cyclic and bicyclic amines have also been asymmetrically synthesized using
engineered ω-transaminases, whereas naturally occurring enzymes result in poor produc-
tivity for these targets. Martin and coworkers reported the directed evolution of ( S)-ω-
transaminase from Athrobacter citreus (AcTA) using error-prone PCR. When substituted
(S)-aminotetralin and pyruvate were selected as the substrates, the resulting substituted
tetralone was colored upon exposure to air. The selection of the mutants with improved
properties was based on the appearance of color. Through five rounds of enzyme evolution,
a final mutant, bearing seventeen mutations, was obtained and exhibited 268-fold improved
activity with reduced biocatalyst loading and an overall improvement in product yield [55].
(S)-ω-transaminase from Pseudomonas jessenii (PjTA) showed no detectable activity for
the synthesis of six bicyclic or bulky amines, and a protein engineering strategy using
computational design was explored by Meng and coworkers to expand the substrate scope.
The single mutant W58G and triple mutant W58M/F86L/R417L demonstrated superior
catalytic performance in the asymmetric synthesis of chiral bicyclic or bulky amines, with
the former showing optimal efficiency for indane- and tetralin-containing substrates, while
the latter exhibited enhanced activity toward 1-phenylbutylamine [56]. (R)-ω-transaminase
from Rhodobacter sp. (RhTA) was redesigned by Li and coworkers for the asymmetric syn-
thesis of chiral N-heterocyclic amines. Through combined mutation, the quadruple mutant
RbTAM2 was developed and exhibited significantly improved activity (4- to 1064-fold)
toward a series of cyclic and bulky heterocyclic ketones [57].
Owing to the structural differences among ω-transaminases of different origins, the
protein engineering of individual enzymes has always been difficult. In view of this,
a systematic study should be carried out on the structure–activity relationship of ω-
transaminases for the catalysis of bulky substrates, which will help to promote the molec-

ular modification of ω-transaminases for the asymmetric synthesis of bulky amines. An
intensive study of (S)-ω-transaminase from Ruegeria sp. TM1040 (3FCR) in the asymmetric
catalysis of bulky substrates was reported by Bornscheuer and coworkers. The 3FCR
mutants were developed by extensive protein engineering followed by optimization of
the identified motif, producing mutants with 8900-fold improvements in activity and high
stereoselectivity in the asymmetric synthesis of several chiral amines bearing two bulky
substituents. The identified motif (Y59W/Y87F/Y152F/T231A) has been demonstrated to
be generally applicable in six other new (S)-ω-transaminases [58]. The quadruple mutant
3FCR_QM obtained in the above research was then selected as the starting scaffold for
the asymmetric synthesis of a bicyclic and bridged amine. Five positive mutants were
developed through protein engineering combining rational design and directed evolution,
the conversion of which was improved 2.2–4.2-fold over that of 3FCR_QM in the asymmet-
ric synthesis of exo-3-amino-8-aza-bicyclo[3.2.1]oct-8-yl-phenyl-methanone [59]. Another
mutant, 3FCR_WLAMA (Y59W, Y87L, T231A, L382M, and G429A), was developed through
the same strategy and can perform the asymmetric synthesis of bulky ( R)-2,2-dimethyl-
1-phenylpropan-1-amine with high conversion [60]. Recently, machine learning has been
employed to provide a promising approach for the protein engineering of 3FCR by the
above research team. A number of 3FCR mutants were developed via directed evolution
and rational design, and their activity was then determined to generate a high-quality

intensive study of (S)-ω-transaminase from Ruegeria sp. TM1040 (3FCR) in the asymmetric 
catalysis of bulky substrates was reported by Bornscheuer and coworkers. The 3FCR mu-
tants were developed by extensive protein engineering followed by optimization of the 
identified motif, producing mutants with 8900-fold improvements in activity and high 
stereoselectivity in the asymmetric synthesis of several chiral amines bearing two bulky 
substituents. The identi fied motif (Y59W/Y87F/Y152F/T231A) has been demonstrated to 
be generally applicable in six other new (S)-ω-transaminases [58]. The quadruple mutant 
3FCR_QM obtained in the above research was then selected as the starting scaffold for the 
asymmetric synthesis of a bicyclic and bridged amine. Five positive mutants were devel-
oped through protein engineering combining rational design and directed evolution, the 
conversion of which was improved 2.2–4.2-fold over that of 3FCR_QM in the asymmetric 
synthesis of exo -3-amino-8-aza-bicyclo[3.2.1]oct-8-yl-phenyl-methanone [59]. Another 
mutant, 3FCR_WLAMA (Y59W, Y87L, T231A, L382M, and G429A), was developed 
through the same strategy and can perform the asymmetric synthesis of bulky ( R)-2,2-
dimethyl-1-phenylpropan-1-amine with high conversion [60]. Recently, machine learning 
has been employed to provide a promising approach for the protein engineering of 3FCR 
by the above research team. A number of 3FCR mutants were developed via directed evo-
lution and rational design, and their activity was then determined to generate a high -
quality dataset for bu ilding a machine learning model. This model was applied for the 
data-driven design of optimized 3FCR mutants with improved activity toward different

4. Conclusions 
The molecular modification of ω-transaminases has achieved remarkable advance-
ments through precise elucidation of their three -dimensional structures and catalytic 
mechanisms, particularly in enabling the asymmetric reductive amination of sterically de-
manding substrates. This field has witnessed a paradigm shift from traditional random 
mutagenesis approaches to structure-guided rational engineering strategies facilitated by 
emerging computational biology tools and structure–function relationship analyses. Such 
progress has significantly enhanced the precision and efficiency of ω-transaminases opti-
mization. Concurrently, the substrate focus has evolved from simple methyl ketones to 
structurally complex, high-value pharmaceutical prochiral ketones, substantially expand-
ing their potential in sustainable biomanufacturing. However, two critical challenges per-
sist in practical implementation: (1) the pronounced substrate specificity of ω-transami-
nases creates substantial limitations in processing structurally diverse compounds, and

4. Conclusions 
The molecular modification of ω-transaminases has achieved remarkable advance-
ments through precise elucidation of their three -dimensional structures and catalytic 
mechanisms, particularly in enabling the asymmetric reductive amination of sterically de-
manding substrates. This field has witnessed a paradigm shift from traditional random 
mutagenesis approaches to structure-guided rational engineering strategies facilitated by 
emerging computational biology tools and structure–function relationship analyses. Such 
progress has significantly enhanced the precision and efficiency of ω-transaminases opti-
mization. Concurrently, the substrate focus has evolved from simple methyl ketones to 
structurally complex, high-value pharmaceutical prochiral ketones, substantially expand-
ing their potential in sustainable biomanufacturing. However, two critical challenges per-
sist in practical implementation: (1) the pronounced substrate specificity of ω-transami-
nases creates substantial limitations in processing structurally diverse compounds, and

4. Conclusions
The molecular modification of ω-transaminases has achieved remarkable advance-
ments through precise elucidation of their three-dimensional structures and catalytic mecha-
nisms, particularly in enabling the asymmetric reductive amination of sterically demanding
substrates. This field has witnessed a paradigm shift from traditional random mutagenesis
approaches to structure-guided rational engineering strategies facilitated by emerging com-
putational biology tools and structure–function relationship analyses. Such progress has
significantly enhanced the precision and efficiency of ω-transaminases optimization. Con-
currently, the substrate focus has evolved from simple methyl ketones to structurally com-
plex, high-value pharmaceutical prochiral ketones, substantially expanding their potential
in sustainable biomanufacturing. However, two critical challenges persist in practical imple-
mentation: (1) the pronounced substrate specificity of ω-transaminases creates substantial
limitations in processing structurally diverse compounds, and (2) the delayed exploration
and limited availability of (R)-ω-transaminases compared to their (S)-counterparts have
severely constrained the synthesis of chiral amines and particularly crucial (R)-configured
Microorganisms 2025, 13, 820 17 of 20
pharmaceutical amines. Furthermore, current laboratory-scale achievements often fail to
meet industrial requirements due to insufficient catalytic efficiency, substrate tolerance,
and operational stability under process conditions.
To address these challenges, future research priorities should focus on the following:
(1) developing innovative enzyme engineering strategies combining computational design
and directed evolution to broaden the substrate scope, (2) establishing high-throughput
screening platforms for discovering novel ω-transaminases, and (3) enhancing biocat-
alyst robustness through immobilization techniques and reaction engineering. These
advancements will be essential to bridge the gap between academic research and industrial
implementation, ultimately advancing ω-transaminases as versatile biocatalysts in green
chemistry applications.
