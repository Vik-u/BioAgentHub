Abstract
Background Effective postoperative pain management is crucial after minimally invasive hepatectomy (MIH) 
to promote recovery, and multimodal analgesia strategies are used to reduce opioid requirements and improve 
outcomes. Acetaminophen is commonly included as part of multimodal therapies for postoperative pain 
management. However, the safety and efficacy of acetaminophen for postoperative analgesia in MIH remains 
unestablished due to its hepatic metabolism. This study aimed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of routine 
intravenous acetaminophen administration following MIH.
Methods The data of consecutive 50 patients who had undergone MIH were retrospectively analyzed. Regarding 
postoperative analgesia, patients were allocated to either the opioid-alone cohort (Cohort O) or opioid with routine 
intravenous acetaminophen cohort (Cohort A). Analgesic efficacy was evaluated using the numerical rating scale 
(NRS) over the first 2 postoperative days. The sum of opioid rescue doses and frequency of postoperative nausea and 
vomiting (PONV) were assessed. Analgesic safety was determined by monitoring prolonged elevated transaminase 
levels.
Results Postoperatively, no significant differences in the hepatic and renal functions and systemic inflammatory 
markers were observed between the two cohorts. On both postoperative day 1 and day 2, Cohort A showed 
significantly lower NRS scores than Cohort O. Notably, almost all patients in Cohort A did not require any rescue 
opioid doses, resulting in a significantly reduced median rescue dose (6 versus 0 doses, p = 0.0017). Even when opioid 
doses were reduced due to PONV, Cohort A continued to exhibit significantly lower NRS scores.
Conclusions Multimodal analgesia comprising routine intravenous acetaminophen administration could be safe and 
effective after minimally invasive hepatectomy, without adverse effects regarding hepatic function.

Background
Liver resection is technically challenging due to the liv -
er’s complex anatomy and rich blood supply [1]. Effective 
perioperative management, such as Enhanced Recovery 
After Surgery (ERAS) protocols is essential for improv -
ing surgical outcomes and reducing postoperative com -
plications [2, 3]. Multimodal analgesia, including epidural 
anesthesia, intravenous opioids (such as fentanyl), 
peripheral nerve blocks (PNBs), non-steroidal anti-
inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), and acetaminophen, is 
widely recognized for its effectiveness in managing post -
operative pain following gastrointestinal surgery [4, 5].
Epidural anesthesia is effective; however, it carries the 
risk of complications, such as hemorrhage and epidural 
hematoma, particularly in patients who develop post-
hepatectomy coagulopathies [ 6–8]. Opioids are effec -
tive for pain relief; nonetheless, they are associated with 
an increased risk of adverse effects, including constipa -
tion, sedation, and postoperative nausea and vomiting 
(PONV) [ 9]. PONV negatively affects the postoperative 
quality of life and may delay mobilization, resulting in a 
prolonged hospital stay [10].
Despite concerns regarding hepatotoxicity, acetamino -
phen administration as postoperative analgesia follow -
ing an open hepatectomy has been shown to be safe [ 11, 
12]. Minimally invasive liver resection (MIH) has evolved 
significantly in recent years, with improved surgical tech-
niques and outcomes [ 13]. MIH is increasingly adopted 
as a standard approach due to its advantages in reduc -
ing surgical trauma and accelerating recovery. However, 
in MIH, the effects of decreased hepatic blood flow due 
to pneumoperitoneum pressure and patient positioning 
on drug metabolism have not been fully elucidated, and 
the safety and efficacy of acetaminophen administration 
post-MIH remains incompletely established. Moreover, 
few studies have objectively assessed an improvement 
in postoperative pain management with acetaminophen 
administration [ 14, 15]. We have hypothesized that the 
routine intravenous administration of acetaminophen 
provides effective postoperative analgesia, reduces the 
need for opioids, and minimizes the incidence of PONV 
in patients undergoing MIHs. Thus, in this study, we 
aimed to assess the safety and effectiveness of multi -
modal analgesia comprising the routine intravenous 
administration of acetaminophen in the postoperative 
pain management of MIH.
Materials and methods
Ethical considerations
This study has been approved by the Ethics Commit -
tee (EC) of Yamaguchi University Hospital, with the 
EC approval number: 2024-020. Moreover, this study 
has been conducted in accordance with the princi -
ples of the World Medical Association Declaration of 
Helsinki involving human patients (as revised in Brazil 
2013). Written informed consent was obtained from the 
patients for the collection of their samples and publica -
tion of their de-identified data and images.
Patients and methods
In this retrospective single-center cohort study, 50 con -
secutive patients who had undergone MIHs between 
October 2021 and October 2022 were enrolled into the 
study; and their data were collected and analyzed. Anes -
thesia was managed with continuous intravenous remi -
fentanil, fentanyl boluses, and sevoflurane inhalation. 
Nitrogen gas and epidural anesthesia were not admin -
istered. Some patients received PNBs during anesthetic 
management. The indication for PNBs was determined 
by the anesthesiologist based on clinical judgment, and 
transversus abdominis plane and rectus sheath blocks 
were performed under ultrasound guidance either before 
or immediately after surgery. A total of 40 mL of 0.25% 
levobupivacaine was administered as standard practice. 
All patients were managed with continuous intravenous 
fentanyl via intravenous patient-controlled analgesia 
(iv-PCA). Dosages and rates had been calibrated by the 
anesthesiologist, according to the age and weight of each 
patient, with an initial rate of 0.3–0.5 µg/kg/h, bolus dose 
of 10–20 µg/dose, and total dose of 1000–2000 µg. Res -
cue opioid doses were administered by patients them -
selves using iv-PCA when they experienced pain.
The patients were divided into two cohorts: Cohort 
O (opioids-alone, without the routine acetaminophen) 
and Cohort A (with the regular administration of acet -
aminophen). In Cohort A, acetaminophen was adminis -
tered every 6  h until 48  h postoperatively, according to 
the manufacturer’s protocol (body weight [BW] ≥ 50  kg: 
1000  mg/dose; BW < 50  kg: 15  mg/kg/dose). These 
cohorts represent consecutive patients treated during 
distinct historical periods: Cohort O includes patients 
treated between October 2021 and March 2022, while 
Cohort A includes those treated between April 2022 
and October 2022 (Fig.  1). In Cohort O, four patients 
received intravenous acetaminophen, but it was admin -
istered once or twice within 48 h postoperatively, not as 
routine dosing. Oral administration of acetaminophen or 
NSAIDs was initiated after 48 h postoperatively and was 
therefore excluded from the analysis.
Postoperative pain was evaluated for 2 days postop -
eratively, using a Numerical Rating Scale (NRS) at rest 
and during movement. NRS scores were recorded in the 
medical chart by the nurses and occupational therapists, 
who were blinded to the study protocol. The results were 
compared with the worst values of the day, evaluated at 
each visit. Furthermore, the total postoperative fentanyl 
dose and number of rescue doses were assessed. The fre -
quency of PONV and sum of the antiemetic agent doses 
Page 3 of 9
Furuya et al. BMC Surgery          (2025) 25:434 
were evaluated for safety and adverse effects. Hepatic 
function was monitored using serum laboratory exami -
nations on the first, third, fifth, and seventh postopera -
tive days. We measured aspartate transaminase (AST), 
alanine transaminase (ALT), total bilirubin (T.Bil), and 
prothrombin time (PT) as indicators of liver function. 
Acetaminophen-induced hepatotoxicity was consid -
ered absent if no abnormal elevations were observed in 
Cohort A compared to Cohort O.
Data were extracted independently by several research-
ers, and any discrepancies were resolved through dis -
cussion to ensure accuracy. A comprehensive electronic 
medical record system was used, and all data were thor -
oughly verified. There were no missing values among the 
variables included in the analysis; thus, no imputation or 
special handling was necessary.
Statistical analyses
The clinicopathological factors of Cohorts O and A were 
compared. Continuous and categorical variables in the 
clinicopathological factors were expressed as median 
values (with range) and frequencies, respectively. Dif -
ferences in clinicopathological findings between the two 
groups were analyzed using the Mann–Whitney U test 
for continuous variables and chi-squared test for cat -
egorical variables; while perioperative liver function, 
renal function, and systemic inflammatory markers tests 
were compared applying the Benjamini and Hochberg 
method as multiple comparisons. Furthermore, univari -
ate and multivariate analyses were performed using the 
logistic regression model. The cut-off value for the intra -
operative fentanyl dose was determined using a receiver 
operating characteristic curve analysis. Patients who had 
undergone PNBs were further divided into sub-cohorts. 
Regarding these sub-cohort analyses, the NRS, total post-
operative fentanyl doses, and number of rescue doses 
were compared between Cohorts O and A. Statistical 
analyses were performed using JMP 15 software (SAS 
Institute, Cary, NC, USA). Statistical significance was set 
at P < 0.05.
Results
Clinical and surgical factors
This study included 50 patients who were divided into 
two cohorts: Cohort A ( n = 25) and Cohort O ( n = 25) 
(Table  1). Statistically significant differences were not 
observed between the two cohorts regarding the clini -
cal features, including diseases and preoperative hepatic 
and renal functions. Ten and seven patients in Cohorts 
O and A, respectively, underwent hand-assisted laparo -
scopic surgeries, with no significant differences noted in 
the types of laparotomies or liver resections.
None of the patients in either cohort underwent con -
version to open surgery. Short-term surgical outcomes, 
including operative time, blood loss, and severe morbidi -
ties (Clavien–Dindo grade ≥ IIIa) were statistically similar 
between cohorts. Cohort A had a statistically significantly 
shorter postoperative hospital stay than did Cohort O 
(median values: 9 and 11 days, respectively; P = 0.0228).
Fig. 1 Study design is depicted. Data of the study patients from the period of October 2021 to October 2022 have been included. The patients have been 
either assigned to the opioid-alone cohort (Cohort O, n = 25) or opioid with routine intravenous acetaminophen administration cohort (Cohort A, n = 25) 
for postoperative analgesia. Both cohorts have received continuous intravenous fentanyl. Cohort A has received intravenous acetaminophen every 6 h, 
until 48 h postoperatively, according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Abbreviation: BW, body weight

Perioperative serum laboratory examination results and 
routine acetaminophen administration
To evaluate the safety of acetaminophen as postopera -
tive analgesia for MIHs, perioperative serum laboratory 
examination results, reflective of and including hepatic 
and renal functions and systemic inflammation, were 
compared between the two cohorts. Perioperative liver 
function tests (AST, ALT, T. Bil, and PT) revealed an 
initial increase on the first postoperative day, followed 
by a gradual improvement over time (Fig.  2). No signifi -
cant differences in the liver function tests were observed 
between the two cohorts on the first, third, fifth, and 
seventh postoperative days (Fig.  2a–d). Postoperative 
liver failure was not observed in any of the patients from 
either cohort. Additionally, renal function and systemic 
inflammatory markers were comparable between the two 
cohorts (Fig. 2e, f). No rehospitalizations due to liver fail -
ure were observed during the follow-up period.
Postoperative analgesia assessment
The efficacy of postoperative analgesia, comprising rou -
tine intravenous acetaminophen administration, was 
evaluated using the fentanyl doses, NRS scores, and 
incidence rates of PONV (Table  2). No significant differ -
ences in the total fentanyl doses were observed between 
the two cohorts. However, the median number of res -
cue doses was statistically significantly higher in Cohort 
O (median value = 6 doses) than in Cohort A (median 
value = 0 doses) (P = 0.0017). The rescue doses were gen -
erally administered before the reduction or discontinua -
tion of opioids.
The NRS scores at rest on the first postoperative 
day were statistically significantly lower in Cohort A 
(median score = 2) than in Cohort O (median score = 4) 
(P = 0.0005). Similarly, the NRS scores during movement 
on the second postoperative day were statistically sig -
nificantly lower in Cohort A (median score = 3) than in 
Cohort O (median score = 5) ( P = 0.0195). In Cohorts O 
and A respectively, 17 (68%) and 20 patients (80%) under-
went PNBs, with no significant differences observed.
In a sub-cohort analysis of patients who underwent 
PNBs that might have affected postoperative pain, the 
median number of rescue doses was statistically signifi -
cantly higher in Cohort O (median value: three doses) 
than in Cohort A (median value: one dose) ( P = 0.0329).
　Moreover, the NRS scores at rest on the first postoper-
ative day were statistically significantly higher in Cohort 
O (median score = 4) than in Cohort A (median score = 2) 
(P = 0.0004).
Nine and eight patients in Cohorts O and A required 
fentanyl reduction or discontinuation due to PONV, 
respectively. No significant differences in the PONV fre -
quency, anti-emetic use, or fentanyl dose reduction were 
observed between the two cohorts.
Assessment of analgesia after reduction or 
discontinuation of fentanyl
The analgesic efficacy after the reduction or discon -
tinuation of fentanyl was evaluated (Table  3). Of all the 
patients, some in Cohort O required frequent rescue

Reduction of total fentanyl dose and risk factors for PONV
Table 4 presents the results of the univariate and mul -

analysis identified higher intraoperative fentanyl doses 
as a significant risk factor for PONV (odds ratio [OR], 
1.0042; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.0003–1.0081, 
P = 0.0257). However, the multivariate analysis did 
not identify any independent risk factors. Intraopera -
tive factors (OR, 2.600; 95% CI, 1.095–6.687, P = 0.030), 
including increased blood loss (OR, 1.0045; 95% CI, 
1.0007–1.00082, P = 0.0066), hand-assisted laparoscopic 
surgery (OR, 4.3922; 95% CI, 1.0600–18.1999, P = 0.0413), 
and larger tumor diameter (OR, 1.0440; 95% CI, 1.0023–
1.9835, P = 0.217), were correlated with a higher number 
of intraoperative fentanyl doses (Table 5).
Discussion
Alignment with PROSPECT guidelines
Our findings align with several recommendations from 
the PROSPECT guidelines for liver resection, including 
the use of multimodal analgesia and the incorporation 
of non-opioid agents such as acetaminophen [ 16]. While 
the guidelines recommend thoracic epidural analgesia, 
challenges involving perioperative pain management in 
liver resection, particularly regarding the administra -
tion of epidural anesthesia and opioids, still exist due to 
possible complications, such as hemorrhage and opioid-
related adverse effects. The potential hepatotoxicity of 
acetaminophen has been a major concern in liver surgery 
[15, 16]. Nonetheless, our findings support the safety and 
efficacy of acetaminophen as part of a multimodal anal -
gesia protocol in MIH.
Safety of acetaminophen in MIH
First, the safety of acetaminophen was evaluated using 
perioperative serum laboratory examination results to 
confirm the presence or absence of liver failure (Fig.  2). 
Although acetaminophen is widely used for postopera -
tive analgesia [ 5]it is metabolized in the liver and may 
cause hepatotoxicity, making liver surgeons cautious 
about its administration [ 17]. Nevertheless, intravenous 
acetaminophen is increasingly considered a valuable 
component of multimodal analgesia in hepatectomy, 
particularly within ERAS protocols [ 15]. However, few 
studies exist regarding this administration as part of post-
liver resection multimodal analgesia. Recently, the safety 
of acetaminophen for post-open hepatectomy analgesia 
has been revealed [ 15, 16]. Hidaka et al. have assessed 
hepatic function using comprehensive measures, such as 
serum laboratory examinations and grading of fibrosis, 
confirming that acetaminophen does not exacerbate liver

injury post hepatectomy [ 14]. Based on these findings, 
we hypothesized that acetaminophen could be adminis -
tered more safely in MIH, which is more likely to involve 
less extensive liver resections compared to open hepatec-
tomy. Our results support this hypothesis and align with 
the findings of Hidaka et al., suggesting that intravenous 
acetaminophen can be safely used in MIH, even among 
patients with potentially compromised hepatic function.
Pain management and opioid-sparing effects
Second, our study expanded on the work of Hidaka et al. 
by providing objective measures of postoperative pain 
management using the NRS. Pain is inherently subjective 
and influenced by various unquantifiable factors, which 
makes consistent evaluation challenging. To address 
this, we employed the NRS to provide a standardized 
and reproducible measure of pain intensity. In particular, 
we revealed the reduced requirements for opioid rescue 
doses in patients receiving routine acetaminophen. This 
finding has been shown in other studies regarding gas -
trointestinal surgery [18–21]but has not been thoroughly 
explored concerning MIHs. Thus, this study finding pro -
vides an important contribution to the understanding of 
the role of acetaminophen in postoperative pain manage-
ment after MIHs.
Impact on opioid rescue doses and hospital stay
Third, we demonstrated that acetaminophen statisti -
cally significantly reduced the number of fentanyl res -
cue doses required during the early postoperative phase, 
particularly during movement, which is commonly the 
most challenging period for pain management. Thus, 
these findings revealed that regular acetaminophen intra-
venous administration may facilitate early mobilization 
and reduce postoperative hospital stays, aligning with the 
results of previous studies regarding other gastrointesti -
nal surgeries [ 21, 22]. These results indicate that routine 
intravenous administration of acetaminophen may be 
effective for post-MIH analgesia. Furthermore, in recent 
years, as the usefulness of MIHs has been established and 
their development and adoption are expected to increase 
[13]the reduction in postoperative hospital stays may 
contribute to a more efficient use of medical resources 
and potential decrease in healthcare costs [ 23, 24]. How-
ever, the total opioid dose did not differ. This may be 
because the total dose was predetermined at the time of 
iv-PCA setting and because dose reductions for reasons 
other than PONV—such as low NRS scores—were not 
observed. Further investigation is warranted. Addition -
ally, since elderly patients were included in this study,

there was a tendency toward longer hospital stays, which 
also warrants further investigation.
Effects on opioid-related adverse events
Acetaminophen effectively reduced the need for opi -
oid rescue doses; however, its impact regarding lesser 
opioid-related adverse effects, such as PONV, was not as 
pronounced as in studies involving other gastrointesti -
nal surgeries [ 25]. A possible explanation for this is that 
the total fentanyl dose, rather than the number of rescue 
doses, plays a more clinically significant role in the devel -
opment of PONV. Analgesia and nausea are controlled 
by distinct physiological mechanisms and high plasma 
concentrations of fentanyl-stimulated µ-opioid receptors 
in the medulla and chemoreceptor trigger zone (CTZ), 
triggering nausea [ 25, 26]. In our study, acetaminophen 
appeared to reduce the requirement for rescue fentanyl 
doses; however, the total intraoperative and postopera -
tive opioid doses were comparable between the cohorts, 
which may explain why we did not observe a statistically 
significant reduction in PONV. Further analysis revealed 
that the total intraoperative opioid dose was a statistically 
significant contributor to the development of PONV. 
Intraoperative opioid administration typically involves 
rapid bolus dosing, which can result in sharp increases in 
plasma opioid concentrations, overstimulation of medul -
lary CTZ, and the induction of nausea and vomiting [ 27]. 
Based on these findings, we are planning a prospective 
clinical trial to determine whether greater reductions in 
the total opioid dose, achieved through alternative anal -
gesic strategies or higher doses of acetaminophen, could 
result in more pronounced reductions in PONV, thus 
maintaining pain management for MIH.
Enhanced pain control with PNBs
Our sub-cohort analysis revealed that, particularly 
among patients receiving PNBs, those administered 
routine acetaminophen had lower pain scores, show -
ing that acetaminophen may enhance pain management 
beyond the effects of PNBs alone, which are known for 
their strong analgesic effect during the early postopera -
tive period of abdominal surgery [ 28]. Studies have indi -
cated that acetaminophen acts peripherally by inhibiting 
cyclooxygenase enzymes and centrally by engaging the 
serotonergic pathways [ 29]. Therefore, combined with 
the local action of PNBs, acetaminophen may provide 
more comprehensive pain management. ERAS proto -
cols, including multimodal analgesia, have demonstrated 
improved postoperative outcomes in liver resection [ 30]. 
Incorporating acetaminophen into these protocols may 
further optimize postoperative pain control and enhance 
recovery.
Study limitations and future directions
Study limitations include the single-center and small-
sample design, as well as potential biases inherent in the 
retrospective nature of the study and the lack of ran -
domization. Factors such as the predominance of elderly 
patients, institution-specific perioperative manage -
ment practices (including anesthetic protocols and tim -
ing of oral intake), the unclear effects on patients with 
severe hepatic impairment, and the interaction with 
other multimodal analgesic strategies remain uncer -
tain. Consequently, the ability to control for selection 
bias and unmeasured confounding factors is limited. 
Future research should comprise multicenter, prospec -
tive studies with larger cohorts to validate and general -
ize these findings and further explore the optimal dosing 
and timing of acetaminophen administration regarding 
multimodal analgesia for MIHs. Finally, the study pre -
dominantly consisted of patients who had undergone 
partial hepatectomies. Therefore, the safety of acetamin -
ophen in the setting of major liver resections performed 
via MIH requires further investigation.
Conclusions
 In conclusion, multimodal analgesia comprising the rou-
tine intravenous administration of acetaminophen could 
be effective and safe post-MIHs, without adverse effects 
regarding hepatic function.
