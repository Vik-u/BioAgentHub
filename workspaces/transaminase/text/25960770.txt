Abstract
Background: Asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA) is an endogenous competitive inhibitor of nitric oxide (NO)
synthetase. Elevated ADMA reduces NO formation and is associated with endothelial dysfunction. The aims of this
study were to evaluate endothelial function and the cardiovascular risk (CVR) profile in patients with non-alcoholic
fatty liver disease (NAFLD), and to determine whether or not an association with metabolic syndrome (MS) increases
these parameters.
Methods: A total of 100 consecutive patients with NAFLD, who were seen in Liver Disease Outpatient clinic and 45
age- and sex-matched controls were included. Endothelial function was evaluated based on the serum ADMA
level measured using a validated ELISA kit (DLD Diag nostika GMBH, Hamburg, Germany) and flow-mediated
vasodilatation (FMV) measured via high-resolution ex ternal ultrasonography. The CVR profile was calculated
according to the Framingham equation.
Results: At baseline there weren’t any significant differences in brachial artery diameter between the NAFLD and
control groups (3.7 ± 0.6 mm vs. 3.6 ± 0.6 mm, respectively). FMV and flow-independent vasodilatation in response to
sublingual nitroglycerin did not differ between the NAFLD and control groups (mean: 16% ± 9.4% vs. 17.9% ± 12.4%,
and 21.4% ± 14% vs. 17.8% ± 11.3%, respectively, p > 0.05). No significant difference in the serum ADMA concentration
between the NAFLD and control groups was observed (mean: 0.8 ± 0.07μmol L−1 vs. 0.74 ± 0.2μmol L−1, respectively).
The CVR profile was significantly higher in the NAFLD group than in the control group (mean: 9% ± 6.9% vs. 4.6% ±
3.8%, P = 0.000). MS associated with NAFLD significantly increased the CVR profile (mean: 11.2% ± 7.4%, P = 0.000).
An abnormal serum alanine aminotransferase level (>37 IU L−1) and the presence of fibrosis did not increase the CVR
profile (p > 0.05).
Conclusions: The risk of cardiovascular events is increased in patients with NAFLD. The association with MS is further
increased such risk.

Background
Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (i.e. NAFLD) is a com-
mon clinical condition of hepatic steatosis in the ab-
sence of a history of signifi cant alcohol use or other
known liver disease [1-5]. NAFLD is the most common
cause of chronic liver diseases in Western countries
and also in Turkey [2,3]. NAFLD encompasses a histo-
logical spectrum, ranging from simple steatosis to
steatohepatitis, fibrosis, ci rrhosis and hepatocellular
carcinoma [3]. NAFLD is frequently associated with
obesity, type 2 diabetes mellitus (i.e. DM), dyslipid-
emia, hypertension, metabolic syndrome (i.e. MS) and
cardiovascular disease (i.e. CVD) [6,7]. NAFLD is the
hepatic expression of MS [2-5].
Asymmetric dimethylarginine (i.e. ADMA) is an en-
dogenous analogue of L-arginine that may interfere with
nitric oxide (i.e. NO) metabolism [5]. ADMA competi-
tively inhibits the activity of NO synthase [7]. Vascular
dilatation response is primarily mediated by NO released
from arterial endothelial epithelium. The degree of the
response correlates with coronary endothelial function.
The elevated plasma ADMA concentration was associ-
ated with decreased brachial flow-mediated vasodilata-
tion (i.e. FMV) response in healthy adults. Several
factors including advanced age, smoking, hyperlipidemia,
hypertension, IR, are associated with endothelial dys-
function and CVD [8]. Data regarding the relationship
of serum ADMA level, endothelial dysfunction and the
potential cardiovascular risk (i.e. CVR) in patients with
NAFLD are limited. The aim of the present prospective
study were to evaluate the association of the serum
ADMA level, endothelial function and the CVR profile
in individuals with NAFLD, and to determine whether
or not an association with MS affects these parameters.
Methods
Patients
This was a prospective longitudinal cohort study. A total
of 100 consecutive patients (54 male and 46 female;
mean age: 47.8 ± 8.7 years) diagnosed with NAFLD, who
were seen in the Liver Diseases Outpatient Clinic were
included into the study. Data were obtained from patient
visit charts. Criteria for inclusion were: 1) age > 16 years; 2)
convincing evidence of absent or minimal alcohol con-
sumption: <20 g alcohol/day for women and <30 g
alcohol/day for men; 3) absence of confounding disease
including acute and/or chronic viral hepatitis (hepatitis
A, B or C); and 4) exclusion of other forms of liver dis-
ease including autoimmune, drug-induced and meta-
bolic liver diseases. Diagnosis of NAFLD was based on
biochemical, radiological and histological criteria,
when available and on exclusion of other forms of
acute and chronic liver diseases. None of the NAFLD
patients had evidence of cirrhosis. Forty-five healthy
controls (23 male and 22 female; mean age: 45.2 ±
7.4 years) were included into study. Hepatitis were ex-
cluded by examining all necessary indicators such as
serum serum HBsAg, HCV and Anti Hbs levels and
also further diagnostic tests if needed. The controls
were selected from among individuals with normal
clinical included body mass index (i.e. BMI), waist cir-
cumference (i.e. WC), and blood pressure, biochemical
tests included fasting glucose, lipid profile, aminotransfer-
ases levels, and radiological parameters included sono-
graphic examination. Smoking, current pharmacological
treatment for comorbid disorders and family history of
CVD and DM were evaluated.
Liver biopsy specimens were evaluated by a pathologist
that was blinded to the patients’ characteristics. Histo-
logical features of the specimens were evaluated accord-
ing to Brunt et al. [9]. The NAFLD activity score (i.e.
NAS) was calculated based on the criteria of Kleiner
et al. [6].
MS was diagnosed based on the presence of≥3 of the
following Third Adult Treatment Panel of the National
Cholesterol Education Program (i.e. NCEP-ATP III) cri-
teria [10]. (1) fasting glucose≥100 mg dL
−1 or history of
treatment for diabetes; (2) central obesity (WC >102 cm
(males) and >88 cm (females); (3) arterial pressure≥130/
85 mmHg or history of pharmacologically treated hyper-
tension; (4) triglyceride level ≥150 mg dL
−1 or current
use of fibrates; (5) high-density lipoprotein (i.e. HDL)
cholesterol ≤40 mg dL−1 (males) and ≤50 mg dL−1 (fe-
males). This study was approved by local ethical com-
mittee of Ankara University School of Medicine.
Methods
Blood pressure measurements were obtained by trained
medical assistants, according to the guidelines of the
International Society of Hypertension [11]. In all, 3
blood pressure readings were obtained at 1-min inter-
vals; the 2nd and 3rd systolic and diastolic pressure
readings were averaged. Body weight was measured to
the nearest 0.5 kg with the participants wearing light
clothing. Height was measured to the nearest 0.5 cm.
The BMI was calculated as weight in kilograms divided
by height in meters squared. WC was measured to the
nearest 0.5 cm at the shortest point between the lower
rib margin and the iliac crest.
Fasting glucose, cholesterol, triglycerides, serum alanine
aminotransferase (i.e. ALT), aspartate aminotransferase
(i.e. AST), gamma glutamyl transpeptidase (i.e. GGT), al-
kaline phosphatase (i.e. ALP), bilirubin, and complete
blood cell count were measured in our central laboratory
using a chemical analyzer and standard reagents. Insulin
was measured via radioimmunoassay (i.e. RIA). Insulin re-
sistance (i.e. IR) was calculated on the basis of fasting
plasma glucose and insulin values using the homeostasis

model assessment-insulin resistance method (HOMA-IR:
plasma glucose (mg/dl) × insulin (μu/ml)/405) [12]. For
the exclusion of other forms of liver disease serum iron,
ferritin, copper, and ceruloplasmin levels were measured,
and serological studies for anti-nuclear antibody, anti-
smooth muscle antibody, and anti-mitochondrial anti-
bodies were performed. Blood samples for ADMA
measurement were centrifuged and the plasma was
stored at −80°C until analysis. ADMA was determined
using a validated ELISA kit (DLD Diagnostika GMBH,
Hamburg, Germany).
Brachial flow mediated vasodilatation
Brachial FMV was measured by an experienced cardiolo-
gist using a high-resolution external ultrasound machine
(Vivid 7, Dimension GE, Healthcare, GE Hortan, Norvay)
in a quiet room following an overnight fast, according to
Celermajer et al. [13]. After identification of the brachial
artery, its diameter was measured under 3 conditions:
at baseline, in response to shear stress (to induce
endothelium-dependent flow mediated dilatation) dur-
ing hyperemia, and in response to a 400-μg sublingual dose
of nitroglycerin. To obtain a high quality baseline measure-
ment ≥10 min of rest in the supine position was needed.
Reactive hyperemia was induced via inflation of a sphygmo-
manometer cuff to 250 mmHg, followed by deflation. After
10– 15 min of rest, nitroglycerin was given and 3.5-4 min
later a final scan of the atrium was obtained.
The time required to scan is 15 s before and 60 s after
cuff deflation. Physiologically, increased blood flow stimu-
lates the release of vasodilators such as NO from the
endothelium, which in turn causes arterial dilatation (i.e.
FMV); impaired FMV is observed in the presence of endo-
thelial dysfunction. In contrast, nitroglycerin acts directly
on arterial smooth muscle and induces endothelium-
independent dilatation (i.e. EID). Data were recorded as
absolute diameter (mm) and as the percentage of change
in diameter after hyperemia and nitrate, respectively.
Statistical analysis
Data were analyzed using SPSS v.15.0 for Windows. Pa-
tients were grouped according to the presence of MS.
Values are expressed as mean± SD for continuous variables
and median (range) for non-normal values. For parametric-
ally distributed data comparisons between the groups were
made using thet-test and ANOVA. For non-parametrically
distributed data the Kruskal Wallis test or Mann– Whitney
U test was used. The level of statistical significance was set
at P < 0.05. Pearson correlation analysis was done to evalu-
ate the relationshipbetween variables.
Results
The characteristics of the NAFLD patients and controls
are shown in Table 1. Two groups were matched for age,
gender and cigarette smoking (p > 0.05). Family history
of DM and CVD were more prevalent in patients with
NAFLD. At the time of the baseline characteristics, the
median age of the NAFLD patients was 46.9 years (range
25-63years), BMI was 28.6 (range 19.6-39.7 kg/m
2); 28%
(n = 28) of the patients were obese, 67% (n = 67) of the
patients had dyslipidemia, 11% (n = 11) hypertension, 7%
(n = 7) DM and 55% (n = 55) IR (HOMA score≥2.7).
Median serum AST, ALT and GGT levels were 38.7 U/L
(range: 15– 187 U/L), 57.5 U/L (range: 12– 248 U/L), and
56.8 U/L (range: 14 – 312 U/L), respectively. Median
initial HOMA score was 3.6 (range: 0.7-24.8), and 50%
(n = 50) of the NAFLD patients had MS.
Endothelial function
At baseline, no significant difference in term of the diam-
eter of the brachial artery between NAFLD patients and
controls was observed (3.7 ± 0.6 mm vs. 3.6 ± 0.6 mm, re-
spectively). There was no significant difference in the

serum ADMA concentration between two groups ob-
served (mean: 0.8 ± 0.07μmol L−1 vs. 0.74 ± 0.2μmol L−1,
respectively). FMV and flow-independent vasodilatation in
response to sublingual nitroglycerin did not differ between
the NAFLD patients and controls (mean: 16 ± 9.4% vs.
17.9 ± 12.4%, and 21.4 ± 14% vs. 17.8 ± 11.3%, p > 0.05, re-
spectively) (Figure 1).
In patients with NAFLD, 62% of the patients had an
abnormal serum ALT level (mean: 76 ± 43 U/L, <31 IU
mL−1). There was no significant association between ele-
vated serum ALT levels, and FMV or flow-independent
vasodilatation (mean: 16.2% ± 10.6%, 15% ± 6.9%, and
22.2% ±16.3%, 20.1% ± 9.8%, respectively). Additionally,
there wasn’t a significant difference detected with MS or
fibrosis or both of them.
CVR profile
The 10-year probability of cardiovascular events was
evaluated according to the Framingham equation and
the CVR scores were categorized as low (<10%), inter-
mediate (10%-20%), and high (>20%) [14] (Table 2).
CVR was significantly increased in patients with NAFLD
as compared to controls (mean: 9.0% ± 6.9% vs. 4.6 ±
3.8%, respectively, p < 0.001). In patients with NAFLD,
the association with MS was significantly higher the CVR
(mean: 11.2% ± 7.4%, p < 0.001). However, abnormal serum
ALT level and the presence of hepatic fibrosis were not as-
sociated with an elevated CVR profile (p > 0.05).
We analysed correlation between variables and only
found significant positive correlation only between fibro-
sis and fasting insulin, HOMA score and waist circum-
ference (p = 0.001, r = 0.63, p = 0.001, r = 0.64, and p = 0.04,
r = 0.42, respectively).
Discussion
In the present study, we investigated that the association
of the serum ADMA level, endothelial function and the
CVR profile in NAFLD patients, and compared those of
age- and sex-matched healthy controls. Endothelial dys-
function is associated with coronary atherosclerosis
in the very early stages of disease and is indicative of
disease grade [15]. A common approach for assessing
endothelial function is brachial artery Doppler ultrason-
ography. In addition to this non-invasive technique,
measurement of plasma levels of markers of endothelial
reactivation, such as ADMA can be used. Villanova et al.
investigated endothelial function in 52 NAFLD cases
and 28 controls, and reported that there was endothelial
dysfunction in the NAFLD patients, particularly in pa-
tients with non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), as
compared to those of patients with simple steatosis [16].
Senturk et al. confirmed these findings [17]. Kasumov
et al. reported that the ADMA level was significantly
higher in patients with NAFLD [18]. In the present
study, in contrast to previous studies, no significant dif-
ference between NAFLD patients and control groups in
terms of the diameter of the brachial artery and the
serum ADMA concentration was observed (p > 0.05).
This difference may be explained that NAFLD patients
in the present study had lower serum triglyceride and
fasting plasma glucose levels, and a lower HOMA-IR
score, and had small number hypertensive and diabetic
patients compared to those of previous studies [16,18].
Colak et al. found higher CIMT levels, and lower
FMD measurements in NAFLD group than in the con-
trols. The results were found independent from MS and
it was also more evident in patients with simple steatosis
and NASH compared to control group [19]. Kim et al.
investigated the association between NAFLD and CIMT,
according to the presence of MS, and observed a signifi-
cant difference in CIMT measurements in patients with
MS [20].
The Framingham score is extensively used to calculate
CVR and was previously shown to correlate with bio-
chemical markers of endothelial function [21]. An in-
creased CVR are associated with advanced age, male
gender, high blood pressure, cigarette smoking, dyslipid-
emia, diabetes, and a family history of CVD [22,23]. Sev-
eral studies have suggested that NAFLD is the hepatic
manifestation of MS, a condition strictly associated with
atherosclerosis [2,3,5]. Schwimmer et al. reported that

based on clinical observation, patients with NAFLD,
who diagnosed in childhood had early-onset atheroscler-
osis [24]. Moreover, Villanova et al. reported an in-
creased the 10-year probability of cardiovascular events
in patients with NAFLD [16]. This finding is consistent
with the present study demonstrating CVR was signifi-
cantly higher in the NAFLD patients than controls, espe-
cially among the patients with MS.
The present study has limitations. Firstly, the number of
controls are limited. Secondly, it will be better to study
other methylated arginines including monomethyl-arginine,
(i.e.MMA), and symmetric dimethylarginine (i.e. SDMA) in
addition to the ADMA.
In conclusion, based on the results of this study, car-
diovascular risk is increased in patients with NAFLD.
Association with MS seems to further increase such risk
in patients with NAFLD. However, endothelial dysfunc-
tion is not found in patients with NAFLD according to
the FMD measurements and ADMA levels. Further
studies with larger number of patients including de-
termination of other circulating molecules related to
the endothelial function is needed to clarify whether
endothelial dysfunction contributes to the increased
cardiovascular risk or not.
