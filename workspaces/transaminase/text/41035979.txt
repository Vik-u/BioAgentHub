ABSTRACT
Background: Cisplatin (CSP), a chemotherapy drug widely used for treating solid tumors, can cause cellular toxicity 
in various percentages. Natural antioxidants, such as phenols, help reduce free radicals and inflammation. 
Aim: This study aimed to investigate the synergistic protective effects of Simmondsia chinensis extract, vitamin E, or 
their combination, particularly in cases of CSP-induced renal and hepatotoxicity.
Methods: Fifty adult male rats were randomly grouped into five groups (n = 10): control group (C): each rat received 
(2 ml/day/orally) distilled water; CSP group: each rat was injected intraperitoneally (IP) with a single dose of (2 mg/
kg) CSP for eight consecutive weeks; and CSP+SCH group: all rats in this group were first injected with cisplatin via IP 
injection, similar to the CSP group, at the same time administered S. chinensis hydro-ethanolic extract at a dose of (0.6 
g/kg/day/orally). In the CSP + Vitamin E group, each rat was treated the same as in the CSP group and then received 
vitamin E at a dose of 100 mg/kg/day/orally. In the (CSP+SCH+Vit. E) group, rats were IP-injected with cisplatin and 
then administered both S. chinensis hydro-ethanolic extract and vitamin E, using the same doses as in the third and 
fourth groups; all treatment administrations were administered over eight consecutive weeks. 
Results: The hepatic enzyme levels of alanine transaminase and aspartate transaminase, as well as malondialdehyde, 
creatinine, uric acid, cystatin C, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) were significantly increased in the CSP 
group compared with all experimental groups. These parameters significantly declined (p < 0.05) in the CSP + SCH  
+ Vit. E group compared with other experimental groups. The injection of cisplatin caused a decrease in the serum 
concentrations of superoxide dismutase, catalase, and interleukin-10 compared to all treatment groups. All these 
parameters were significantly elevated (p < 0.05) in the CSP + SCH + Vit. E group and CSP + SCH groups compared 
with the CSP group. The histological alterations of the renal and hepatic tissues were improved and enhanced in 
patients with CSP + SCH + Vit. E group compared with all experimental groups. 
Conclusion: Simmondsia chinensis alone or in combination with vitamin E can mitigate cisplatin-induced hepatic and 
renal toxicity in rats through its synergistic antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. 
Keywords: Cisplatin, Simmondsia chinensis extract, Vitamin E, Nephrotoxicity, Hepatotoxicity.
Introduction
The increasing prevalence of cancer in Iraq 
necessitates the development of therapeutic programs 
aimed at reducing the toxins produced by these 
medicines and alleviating the stress they place on the 
body’s vital systems. In 1965, researchers discovered 
that platinum complexes exhibited a distinctive and 
intriguing effect, which later served as the cornerstone 
for one of the most commonly used classes of 
anticancer medications (Rosenberg et al., 1965). 
Cisplatin is a platinum-based chemotherapeutic agent 
that was approved by the FDA in 1978. It remains one 
of the most widely used anticancer drugs, showing 
strong efficacy against cancers of the kidney, liver, 
testis, ovary, head, neck, and lung (Prestayko et 
al., 1979). Cisplatin, scientifically known as cis-
dichlorodiammineplatinum (Cis-DDM) (II), is a 
coordination complex consisting of a central platinum 
atom bound to two chloride ions and two ammonia 
molecules in a cis configuration (Tchounwou et al., 
2021). It has been shown to be effective in treating 
various solid tumors (Romani, 2022). Cisplatin is 
a cytotoxic drug that can cause cellular toxicity in 
various percentages, including nephrotoxicity (72%), 
ototoxicity (75%–100%), hepatotoxicity (36%), 
cardiotoxicity (6%), and toxicity to other organs (Abd

Rashid et al., 2021). Cisplatin exerts its anticancer 
effects through several mechanisms. It destroys 
cancer cells by damaging DNA, inhibiting DNA 
synthesis and mitosis, and inducing apoptosis (Dasari 
and Tchounwou, 2014; Brown et al., 2019). The 
adverse side effects of cisplatin depend on the dosage 
and duration of cisplatin administration, resulting in 
increased toxicity, oxidative stress, and free radicals 
(Hamaya et al., 2023), subsequent mitochondrial 
damage, and activation of cell death pathways (Fawzy 
et al., 2022). Cisplatin nephrotoxicity is one of the 
most significant side effects associated with cisplatin 
treatment. Cisplatin accumulation in renal tubular 
cells causes damage to these cells (Hakiminia et al., 
2019).
Simmondsia chinensis, commonly known as Jojoba, 
is a desert shrub native to Mexico and the United 
States. It is now cultivated in arid regions worldwide 
for its economically valuable seed waxy ester 
(Gentry, 1958). Simmondsia chinensis extracts have 
anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial, antioxidant, and 
wound-healing properties; therefore, they are used 
as a supportive topical agent in impaired wound 
healing conditions to accelerate wound healing 
delayed by dexamethasone in a preclinical rat model. 
Its beneficial effects have been attributed to its anti-
inflammatory and pro-healing properties (Siddique et 
al., 2023; Begum et al., 2024). Furthermore, jojoba 
topical application significantly increased collagen 
III mRNA and protein levels and hyaluronic acid 
synthesis and formed a protective skin barrier that 
aids in healing and infection prevention (Tietel et 
al., 2024). The beneficial effects of S. chinensis are 
largely attributed to its polyphenols, phytosterols, 
and tocopherols (Feki et al., 2022), which act as 
antioxidants to protect cells against reactive oxygen 
species (ROS) and free radical-induced tissue 
damage. Such oxidative stress is linked to diseases 
such as cancer, diabetes, and rheumatoid arthritis, 
induces inflammation, and suppresses immunity. As 
confirmed by recent phytochemical studies, Jojoba 
(S. chinensis) extract is rich in bioactive compounds, 
including polysaccharides, lignans, triterpenoids, 
flavonoids, phenolic acids, and phytosterols (Zhu et 
al., 2021; El Gendy et al., 2023). Phytochemicals 
are gaining attention as natural antioxidants used in 
food, health, and cosmetics, offering safer and more 
eco-friendly alternatives to synthetic compounds. 
Flavonoids are characterized by a remarkable 
diversity in biochemical and antioxidant properties, 
making them powerful agents in fighting various 
ailments, including cardiovascular disease, cancer, 
and neurodegenerative disorders (Baptista et al., 
2024).
Vitamin E (alpha-tocopherol) is important in its 
physiological functions, which include battling 
oxidation, regulating immunity, acting as an anti-
inflammatory agent, managing chronic diseases 
such as diabetes and arthritis, and protecting nerves 
(Ribeiro et al., 2021). Besides its role in the food, 
cosmetics, pharmaceutical, and dermatology sectors, 
its application as a therapeutic supplement could also 
provide potential benefits in the fields of dermatology, 
oncology, and infertility (Fatima et al., 2025), which 
is a class of fat-soluble chemicals with antioxidant 
properties that exist naturally in eight chemical forms 
(alpha-, beta-, gamma-, and delta-tocopherol and alpha-, 
beta-, gamma-, and delta-tocotrienol) (Alghamdi et al., 
2020). Vitamin E is a lipophilic antioxidant that protects 
cell membranes from oxidative damage and has been 
used in dermatology for over 50 years  (Cascella et al., 
2017). Vitamin E, a fat-soluble antioxidant, is vital for 
defending polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) within 
cell membranes against oxidative stress damage. In 
particular, alpha-tocopherol, a specific type of vitamin 
E, maintains cell membrane stability by inhibiting 
reactions involving lipid peroxides. This protective 
mechanism also extends to cell components such as 
mitochondria, proteins, and DNA. Moreover, vitamin 
E can help lower the expression of pro-inflammatory 
cytokines (Traber, 2021; Zhang et al., 2024). Vitamin 
E also plays a major role in reducing the apoptosis that 
occurs due to oxidative stress in some organs, such as 
the kidney, nerve, and liver cells (Jain et al., 2022).
Given the rising prevalence of cancer in Iraq and the 
associated toxicity of chemotherapeutic agents such 
as cisplatin, the current study aims to explore the 
protective effects of S. chinensis (jojoba) extract and 
vitamin E, alone or in combination, against cisplatin-
induced nephrotoxicity and hepatotoxicity in rats, with 
further emphasis on their potential antioxidant and 
anti-inflammatory properties.
Materials and Methods
Steps of preparation of the Jojoba S. chinensis extract
The Jojoba (S. chinensis L.) plant was classified in 
the University of Karbala/College of Education for 
Pure Sciences/Department of Life Sciences, and its 
classification was issued 4/6/1252 on 26/2/2025. 
The S. chinensis seeds were purchased from the 
medical herbarium. S. chinensis seeds were prepared 
as previously described (Abdel-Wahhab et al., 2016; 
Abdulraheem et al., 2019; Tietel et al., 2024). Weigh 
100 g of S. chinensis seeds and grind them with an 
electric blender. Add 1,000 ml of 70% ethanol to the 
crushed seeds and cover the beaker completely with 
aluminum foil to avoid light exposure. The beaker with 
the mixture was placed on a hot plate at 220 rpm and 
temperature (30 °C–50 °C) for 12 hours. The mixture 
was then filtered with gauze to get rid of the residue 
and further filtered using Whatman paper (0.5 mm). 
The filtrate was dried in an incubator at 40 °C. After 
drying extraction, the net extract was 25.6 g per 100 g 
of jojoba powder. The final extract was kept frozen at 
(−20 °C) until use.

Experimental animals
The experiment was conducted in the College of 
Veterinary Medicine/Al-Qasim Green University and 
the animal house of the College of Science\University 
of Babil. The experiment was extended from September 
25, 2024, to January 1, 2025. A total of 50 mature male 
Wistar rats (aged 75 days old and weighing 254-260 
g) were used in the current experiment. In wire-plastic 
cages that measure 40 × 60 cm and were well ventilated, 
the animals were kept at 23°C–25°C, 73%–76% 
relative humidity, and a 12:12 hours dark/light cycle. 
The animals had free access to water and laboratory 
food at all times. After 10 days of acclimatization, the 
animals were weighed before treatment (0 day) and 
after each period of the experiment.
Experimental design
Fifty adult male rats were randomly grouped into 
five groups (n = 10): First group: Each rat received 
(2 ml/day/orally) distilled water for eight weeks and 
served as a control group (C); second group (CSP): 
each rat was injected with (2 mg/kg) cisplatin (CSP) 
(Accord®, United Kingdom) as a single dose/week 
intraperitoneally (IP) for eight weeks; third group 
(CSP + SCH): each rat was treated as the second 
group and received (0.6 g/kg/day/orally) S. chinensis 
hydro-ethanolic extract (SCH) seeds purchased from 
the medical herbarium for eight consecutive weeks; 
fourth group (CSP + Vitamin E): each rat treated as 
the second group then received vitamin E (100 mg/
kg/day/orally) (NOW®, USA) for eight consecutive 
weeks; and fifth group (CSP + SCH + Vitamin E): each 
rat treated as the second group then received both S. 
chinensis hydro-ethanolic extract and vitamin E at the  
same as the doses in third and fourth groups for eighth 
consecutive weeks. In addition to cisplatin, jojoba 
extract and vitamin E were used according to previous 
studies (Amate et al., 1996; Feki et al., 2022 ; Peña-
Corona et al., 2023).
At the end of the experimental period, each rat was 
anesthetized with ketamine (40 mg/kg) / Xylazine (10 
mg/kg) body weight (Gaertner et al., 2008). Blood 
samples were collected, and the liver and kidneys were 
dissected and weighed. Kidney samples were harvested 
and preserved in 10% formalin for histopathological 
examination.
Blood sample collection
Following anesthesia, 3 ml of blood was taken directly 
from the heart of each rat. Blood samples were placed 
in non-heparinized tubes and left at room temperature 
until clotting before being centrifuged at 5,000 rpm for 
15 minutes to separate serum. The sera were collected 
in Eppendorf containers and stored at (−20°C) 
(Parasuraman et al., 2010) until use for assessment 
of the biomarkers ALT and AST, marker oxidants 
malondialdehyde (MDA), antioxidant markers 
superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), uric 
acid, creatinine, cystatin C, tumor necrosis factor alpha 
(TNF-α), and interleukin 10 (IL-10).
Determination of liver enzyme activities
Serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) activity 
was measured using the Elabscience ® kit and the 
ARCHITECT c4000 device. A colorimetric method 
is used to accurately determine ALT activity through 
the following reactions according to the methodology 
described by Young (1990).
Serum aspartate aminotransferase activity (AST) 
was measured using an Elabscience ® kit from China 
and the ARCHITECT C4000 device. The principle 
involves a colorimetric assessment to determine AST 
activity through specific reactions according to the 
methodology described by Young (1990).
Determination of oxidant and antioxidant markers
The activities of antioxidant markers, such as 
superoxide dismutase (SOD), CAT, and MDA, were 
determined according to the method described by 
Mohandas et al. (1984), Aebi (1984), and Kei (1978).
Determination of creatinine, uric acid, and cystatin C 
markers
The serum creatinine level was measured using a 
Biolabo Creatinine Kit (ACHITECT C4000, France). 
The creatinine level was determined as described 
previously (Toora and Rajagopal, 2002).
Uric acid concentration in serum was determined using 
a Biolabo-Urea Kit (ACHITECT C4000, France). 
The measurement principle is presented as described 
by (Pachla et al., 1987). Cystatin C was measured 
according to the method described by Onopiuk et al. 
(2015).
Determination of cytokine levels
The levels of interleukin (IL-10) and TNF-α were 
assessed using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 
kits (Elabscience®, USA) following the manufacturer’s 
instructions (Fortis et al., 1996; Barbara et al., 1996).
Histological study
The kidney and liver were fixed in 10% buffered 
formaldehyde for 48 h and then preserved in 70% 
ethanol until processed histologically according to 
the method adopted by Kiernan (2015), as follows: 
dehydration, clearing, embedding in paraffin, and 
staining with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) after 
sectioning into 5-µm slices, as follows: dehydration, 
clearing, infiltration paraffin, embedding, cutting, 
staining, and examination at (100x) magnification, then 
all histological sections were photographed.
Statistical analysis
Statistical analysis of the outcomes of the current 
experiment was conducted using version 16 of the 
Statistical Package for Social Science (SPSS). The 
mean (M) ± SE represents the data. Statistically, the 
differences at p < 0.05 are significant. To evaluate 
significant differences between the groups, post 
hoc Tukey’s test and one-way ANOV A I were used 
(Schefler, 1980).

current experiment, ensuring proper care and use of 
laboratory animals (ESCVM, No. 2134.1292024). 
Results
Effects of the combination of S. chinensis and vitamin E 
on liver enzymes in cisplatin-exposed rats 
The effects of S. chinensis extract, vitamin E, and 
cisplatin on liver enzymes are presented in Table 1. The 
intraperitoneal injection of cisplatin for only 8 weeks 
caused a significant elevation (p < 0.05) in aspartate 
transaminase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase 
(ALT) levels compared with the control and other 
treatment groups. In contrast, the concentration of each 
AST and ALT significantly declined (p < 0.05) in the 
CSP+SCH+Vit. E group in comparison with CSP, CSP 
+ Vit. E, and CSP + SCH groups, with non-significant 
variances (p > 0.05) compared with the control. 
Interestingly, the administration of both S. chinensis 
extract and cisplatin (CSP + SCH) and both vitamin 
E and cisplatin (CSP + Vit. E) caused a significant 
decrement (p < 0.05) in ALT and AST concentrations 
when compared with rats that received cisplatin only, 
with non-significant differences (p > 0.05) in AST 
values between CSP + SCH and control groups, as well 
as in ALT values among CSP + SCH, control, and CSP 
+ SCH + Vit. E groups.
Impact of the combination of S. chinensis and vitamin 
E on oxidant and antioxidant markers in cisplatin-
exposed rats 
Table 2 explains the impact of S. chinensis hydro-
ethanolic extract, vitamin E, and cisplatin on oxidant 
and antioxidant parameters. The statistical analysis of 
MDA results showed a significant increase (p < 0.05) 
in CSP-treated rats compared with other treatment 
rats. Rats that received both vitamin E and S. chinensis 
extract recorded a significant decline  (p < 0.05) 
in serum MDA concentration compared with other 
treatment groups.
Importantly, the level of MDA registered a significant 
decrement (p < 0.05) in CSP-SCH-treated rats when 
compared with CSP and Vit. E, whereas a non-
significant variance (p > 0.05) was recorded between 
SCH and control rats.
The statistical analysis of SOD and CAT results 
recorded a significant reduction (p < 0.05) in CSP-
treated rats compared with other treatment rats. Rats 
that received both S. chinensis extract and Vit. E 
registered a significant elevation (p < 0.05) in serum 
SOD and CAT concentrations compared with other 
treatment groups (Table 2).
Importantly, compared with the control group, CSP-
Vit. E-treated rats registered a significant decrement 
(p < 0.05) in the serum SOD and CAT concentrations 
(Table 2). The levels of SOD and CAT recorded a non-
significant variance (p > 0.05) in CSP-SCH-treated rats 
compared with control rats (Table 2).
Effects of S. chinensis, vitamin E, and cisplatin on 
creatinine, uric acid, and cystatin C levels in rats 
The results of the creatinine (mg/dl) and uric acid 
concentrations are explained in Figures 1 and 2, 
respectively; rats that were injected with cisplatin 
showed a significant (p  < 0.05) increment in serum 
concentrations of creatinine and uric acid (1.767 ± 0.167

and 6.425 ± 0.364), respectively, in comparison with 
other treatment groups. Concentrations of creatinine and 
uric acid in rats that received a combination of SCH + 
Vit. E recorded a significant decrement (p < 0.05), with 
values of 0.174 ± 0.080 and 1.516 ± 0.187, respectively, 
when compared with other treatment groups. The serum 
concentrations of UA and creatinine were significantly 
decreased (p  < 0.05) in SCH-treated rats (3.132 ± 
0.281 and 0.516 ± 0.03), respectively, compared with 
the Vit. E groups and CSP, with non-significant (p  > 
0.05) differences with the control group. The creatinine 
and uric acid levels declined significantly (p < 0.05) in 
CSP+Vit. E-treated rats, with values  of 0.489 ± 0.024 
and 4.313 ± 0.179, respectively, compared with the CSP 
group, while they increased significantly (p  < 0.05) in 
comparison with other treatment groups.
The results of cystatin C are explained in Figure 3. The 
IP-injection of cisplatin caused a significant (p < 0.05) 
elevation in cystatin C concentration in the CSP group, 
with a value (1.574 ± 0.069), compared with other 
treatment groups. Interestingly, the administration of 
both S. chinensis extract and vitamin E in the CSP-
SCH-Vit. E group caused a significant (p < 0.05) 
decline in the serum level of cystatin C with a value 
(0.608 ± 0.029) when compared with the control and 
other treated groups. 
The statistical analysis of serum cystatin C concentration 
revealed a return to control levels, with no significant 
(p > 0.05) differences among SCH plus cisplatin, Vit. 
E plus cisplatin, and control rats, with values  of 0.814 
± 0.022, 0.859 ± 0.030 and 0.754 ± 0.012, respectively.            
Effects of vitamin E and S. chinensis hydro-ethanolic 
extract on cytokine parameters in rats exposed to 
cisplatin
The level of TNF-α was significantly (p < 0.05) 
increased in CSP rats, with a value of 85.466 ± 
1.123, compared with that in all experimental groups. 
Interestingly, TNF-α was significantly (p < 0.05) 
decreased in the CSP + CSH + Vit. E group, with a 
value of 27.828 ± 1.085, compared to all experimental 
rats. The administration of S. chinensis hydro-ethanolic 
extract to CSP-treated rats caused a significant decrease 
(p < 0.05) in that mediator, TNF-α (50.314 ± 1.094), 
compared with that of CSP and Vit. E groups, whereas 
the CSP-Vit. E-treated rats recorded a significant 
increment (p < 0.05), with a value of 58.965 ± 0.943, 
compared with the CSP plus SCH group, control group, 
and CSP-SCH-Vit. E group, and a significant reduction 
(p < 0.05) compared with CSP rats (Fig. 4).
The level of IL-10 lowered significantly (p <0.05) in 
CSP- and CSP-Vit. E-treated rats compared with the 
CSP+SCH+Vit. E, control, and SCH+CSP groups 
(Fig. 5). It was significantly elevated (p < 0.05) in rats 
that received a combination of S. chinensis hydro-
ethanolic extract and vitamin E after exposure to 
cisplatin compared to all experimental groups (Fig. 5). 
Compared with CSP and CSP+Vit. E, the IL-10 level 
was increased (p < 0.05) in the CSP+ SCH rats (Fig. 
5). The IL-10 values of CSP+SCH+Vit. E, CSP+SCH, 
CSP+Vit. E, CSP, and control rats were 48.415 ± 0.363, 
29.897 ± 0.598, 24.153 ± 0.880, 11.544 ± 0.869, and 
31.951 ± 0.722, respectively.

exposed to cisplatin only (CSP group; Fig. 6B) and 
stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) revealed 
a hydropic degeneration around the central vein and 
portal area, congestion, sinusoidal dilation, and signs 
of inflammation in hepatic tissues characterized by 
the aggregation of Kupffer cells and inflammatory cell 
foci. Some hepatocytes exhibited pyknotic nuclei, and 
their disorganized architecture of the hepatic cords was 
more prominent than that of the control group (Fig. 
6A), which showed preserved hepatic features without 
any signs of injury, congestion, or inflammation. 
Observations of the hepatic sections after Vit. E 
administration or S. chinensis extract after injection of 
cisplatin showed a reduction in the histological changes, 
and hepatic tissues displayed mild congestion with 
fewer infiltration of inflammatory cells; hepatic cords 
and sinusoids seemed to be a normal appearance (Fig. 
6C and D). Interestingly, the hepatic sections of SCH-
Vit. E-CSP rats (Fig. 6E) showed normal sinusoids, 
normal portal tracts with normal hepatic cords, which 
arranged radially around central veins, similar to the 
appearance in control rats.  
The histological sections of rats treated with cisplatin 
(Fig. 7B) showed nephrotoxic lesions, which appeared 
as severe degenerative changes and congestion, 
expansion of Bowman’s space, dilation in the 
glomerular capillaries, and apoptosis in the tubular 
lining epithelium when compared with the control group 
(Fig. 7A), which showed a normal appearance in renal 
corpuscles and tubules. However, this disturbance was 
partially reversed with the administration of either S. 
chinensis hydro-ethanolic extract or Vit. E, where mild 
congestion and the Bowmans’ space persisted, a slight 
bit bigger when compared to the control group (Fig. 
7C, D). Importantly, the administration of S. chinensis 
hydro-ethanolic extract with Vit. E to rats exposed 
to cisplatin seemed to   restore to normal architecture 
as control groups, with normal Bowman’s space and 
glomerular capillaries (Fig. 7E). 
Discussion
Cisplatin is commonly utilized as an antitumor 
medication for treating several tumors, including lung, 
ovarian, testicular, head, neck, and colorectal cancers. 
However, it can cause several cellular alterations and 
ROS generation that affect metabolisms inside cells 
(Abdel-Daim et al., 2020).  
The present results showed that the rats exposed to 
cisplatin exhibited significant alterations in hepatic 
function markers, as reported by a significant elevation 
in the levels of AST and ALT in the CSP group. 
Although cisplatin is effective against tumors, it can

cause cellular toxicity, and its hepatotoxicity remains 
a significant dose-dependent side effect, observable 
even after a single low-dose administration (Dkhil et 
al., 2013). These biochemical markers serve as critical 
indicators of hepatocellular injury, as alterations in 
hepatocyte cell permeability lead to the release of 
these enzymes into the bloodstream (Louisa et al., 
2023). The current experiment was consistent with 
the findings obtained by Hosack et al. (2023), who 
correlated the structural damage of hepatic tissues 
with an elevated level of hepatic enzymes located in 
the cytosol and mitochondria and leakage to the blood 
circulation following cellular injury, indicating the 
onset of hepatotoxicity. 
Various experimental studies have shown that 
following exposure to cisplatin, these parameters were 
significantly elevated, and this rise was accompanied 
by histological alterations in the liver’s structure due 
to the exposure of the hepatocyte cellular membrane 
to excessive amounts of free radicals, causing cell 
membrane damage as well as AST and ALT leak from 
hepatocytes (Gazwi et al., 2024; Satyam et al., 2024).   
The present experiment reported that S. chinensis 
extract could reduce AST and ALT enzyme levels due to 
its ability to diminish and treat liver damage caused by 
cisplatin and preserve hepatocyte integrity. This finding 
was supported by El-Saeed and El-Khawaga (2024), 
who reported enhancement and protection of hepatic 
tissues from damage caused by lead acetate, resulting in 
improvement of hepatic enzymes, including ALP, ALT, 
and AST. Interestingly, the administration of vitamin 
E to rats in the CSP+Vit. E group could enhance the 
hepatic functions and reduce the activities of both AST 
and ALT enzymes via its antioxidant features. These 
findings align with those of Palipoch et al. (2014), who 
concluded that pretreatment with tocopherol could 
safeguard against cisplatin-induced hepatotoxicity 
as AST and ALT. Additionally, Vit. E is considered a 
good hepatoprotective supplement due to its ability 
to maintain the hepatocellular membrane integrity 
from oxidative damage caused during treatment with 
cisplatin (Alghamdi et al., 2020).    
The combined therapy of S. chinensis extract and Vit. E 
reported a more noticeable reduction in AST and ALT 
levels. This suggests   a potential synergism between 
the S. chinensis extract and Vit. E in the amelioration 
of cisplatin-induced hepatotoxicity. In comparing S. 
chinensis extract with Vit. E, both compounds reported 
significant hepatoprotective effects, but S. chinensis 
extract appeared to be more effective in reducing AST 
and ALT levels. These results are noteworthy as AST 
and ALT are vital enzymes that reflect mitochondrial 
damage, and this reduction indicates the ability of 
natural antioxidant constituents of S. chinensis extract 
such as polyphenols (e.g., flavonoids) and kaempferol 
to protect against mitochondrial injury via a potential

antioxidant free radical scavenging capacity (Borgne-
Sanchez and Fromenty, 2018; Feki et al., 2022; Khafaji, 
2023a).
The current finding revealed that the I.P. injection of 
cisplatin caused a rise in serum MDA in CSP-rats, 
which might be due to the ability of cisplatin to induce

free radical generation via several pathways, including 
induction of protein denaturation, DNA damage, lipid 
peroxidation, inflammation, and programed cell death 
(Ahmed and Ghobara, 2016). CSP-induced generation 
of NOS and ROS caused exacerbation of oxidative 
stress by reducing the generation of enzymatic 
antioxidants, including CAT and SOD, and non-
enzymatic antioxidants, such as glutathione, which led 
to toxicity (Abdel-Daim et al., 2020). Consistent with 
previous studies (Abo-Elmaaty et al., 2020; Habib et al., 
2021), these studies reported that CSP administration 
in rats and mice, respectively, could cause an elevation 
in MDA levels in the kidneys and liver, accompanied 
by a reduction in SOD, CAT, and GSH levels. The 
present results were supported by the findings of Cesur 
et al. (2025), who concluded that the administration of 
cisplatin as a single dose per six weeks could elevate 
MDA levels and reduce glutathione levels.
The present findings of a decrease in MDA levels in 
vitamin E-treated rats were consistent with those 
of Hakiminia et al. (2019), who reported that the 
administration of vitamin E could reduce oxidative 
stress biomarkers, such as decreasing the levels of 
MDA and NO and enhance the activities of renal 
antioxidant enzymes, including renal CAT and SOD. 
Importantly, Vit. E could reduce and/or prevent lipid 
peroxidation by eliminating free radical generation 
due to its chromanol hydroxyl group (Niki, 2014). The 
antioxidant capacity of vitamin E, which is known 
to inhibit lipid peroxidation, is positively reflected in 
the increase in SOD and CAT activities, which is in 
agreement with the previous findings of Alghamdi and 
colleagues (2020), who concluded that vitamin E boosts 
antioxidant defenses and mitigates the toxic effects 
of cisplatin in the liver and kidneys by ameliorating 
the activities of antioxidant, CAT, and glutathione 
peroxidase and reducing lipid peroxidation. In fact, 
tocopherols reduce oxidative damage primarily due 
to their ability to neutralize and remove lipid peroxyl 
radicals more rapidly than these radicals can react with 
proteins or fatty acid side chains. This is positively 
reflected in the levels of SOD and CAT, which scavenge 
the ROS involving superoxide anion (O2) and hydrogen 
peroxide (H2O2), respectively (Hedayati-Moghadam et 
al., 2023; Zishan et al., 2025).
Administration of the S. chinensis extract or Vit. 
E during rats’ intoxication with cisplatin, lipid 
peroxidation could be reduced and the hepatocellular 
and renal cellular antioxidant capacity could be 
improved (Zhang et al., 2021), due to the biological 
components of S. chinensis that possessed potential 
roles as antioxidant agents, such as flavonoids and 
phenolic acid, which can provide hepatoprotection and 
renal protection against oxidative toxicity caused by 
free radicals generated during injection with cisplatin 
(Badr et al., 2017). Lipoxygenase inhibitors in S. 
chinensis extract can suppress leukotriene synthesis 
and thereby reduce ROS generation and oxidative 
stress (Abdel-Mageed et al., 2014; Siahaan, 2020). 
Importantly, the findings obtained by Okasha et al. 
(2025) that improved the potential antioxidant capacity 
of S. chinensis via the elevation of SOD and CAT 
activities more than the administration of vitamin D are 
consistent with the present findings.
Interestingly, S. chinensis extract could enhance the 
generation of antioxidant enzymes by promoting 
upregulation of Nrf2 gene expression, a protein that 
regulates antioxidant enzymes (Salama et al., 2025). 
Therefore, it can protect the hepatocellular and renal 
cellular membranes by several pathways, including 
a direct mechanism via scavenging ROS and NOS, 
reducing lipid peroxidation and protecting cellular 
membrane integrity, and an indirect mechanism via 
induction of antioxidant synthesis in hepatocellular 
cells (Kandil et al., 2022; Zhou et al., 2022). 
Additionally, S. chinensis seed extract is rich in natural 
antioxidants, including hydroxytoluene derivatives, 
omega-3 fatty acids, and phytic acid. Phytic acid 
prevents the Fenton reaction by binding to iron ions, 
which are crucial for the activity of the toxic compound 
MPP+ (Abou-Zeid et al., 2021; Abdel-Wahhab et al., 
2016). By inhibiting this reaction, phytic acid reduces 
the production of harmful free radicals, including 
superoxide and hydroxyl radicals, in the mitochondria 
(Khattab et al., 2010; Abdel-Wahhab et al., 2016). 
In addition, the presence of γ, δ, and α tocopherols 
in S. chinensis seed, along with the double bonds in 
unsaturated fatty acids such as oleic, linoleic, linolenic, 
docosenoic, and eicosanoic acids, makes the extract a 
potentially powerful antioxidant that can help to remove 
free radicals and reduce oxidative stress (Atteya et al., 
2021; Awad et al., 2022; Ma et al., 2023).  
Clinically, CSP is one of the main contributors to AKI 
in patients with cancer (Yang et al., 2018). The results 
of the current study are in line with the results of recent 
studies that have shown that cisplatin causes direct 
damage to renal nephrons, resulting in a decrease in the 
glomerular filtration rate, resulting in an accumulation of 
creatinine in the blood (McSweeney et al., 2021; Imam 
et al., 2023; Mahmoud and Shams, 2024). In addition, 
the indirect pathway of damage was the activation of 
inflammatory pathways such as NF-κB and TNF-α by 
cisplatin, resulting in worsening cellular damage and 
renal fibrosis and necrosis. In addition, high creatinine 
levels were often present within a few days after taking 
cisplatin and increased with cumulative doses or risk 
factors (Fang et al., 2021).  
Vit. E can reduce oxidative stress in kidney cells by 
enhancing the body’s ability to eliminate free radicals 
and boosting antioxidant enzymes, such as GPx, CAT, 
and SOD (Fang et al., 2021; Ni et al., 2023; Bogacka 
et al., 2024). These enzymes protect renal tubular 
cells and capsules from oxidative damage. Vit. E also 
suppresses pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-α, 
increasing cellular resistance to inflammation. This 
leads to improved glomerular filtration and reduced

waste accumulation, resulting in lower blood creatinine 
levels (Koay et al., 2021; Jin et al., 2024; Meng et al., 
2025). 
The concentration of uric acid was increased in cisplatin-
treated animals due to increased cell degradation and 
oxidative stress, leading to a higher rate of purine 
production and conversion to uric acid, as well as the 
inhibitory effect of cisplatin on the kidneys’ ability 
to secrete this acid (Jana et al., 2023). Furthermore, 
cisplatin can disrupt organic anion transporters (OAT1/
OAT3) and urate transporters responsible for UA 
reabsorption and secretion in the proximal tubules of 
the kidney (Hu et al., 2017; Oliveira et al., 2024).  
The administration of jojoba seed extract had a 
valuable impact on decreasing UA levels through 
multiple mechanisms. Among these mechanisms 
was the biological role of the bioactive components 
of S. chinensis seed extract, including phenols and 
tocopherols, which can inhibit the activity of xanthine 
oxidase, an enzyme responsible for the conversion 
of xanthine into uric acid (Selamoglu et al., 2017), 
thereby reducing the production of uric acid in the cell 
and enhancing cell membrane stability and protecting 
mitochondria from oxidative stress (Baptista et al., 
2024). Jojoba seed extract suppresses the activity 
of inflammatory pathways that can increase the 
production of nitrogenous waste products, including 
UA. Additionally, a previous study suggested that 
ellagic acid, a component of S. chinensis extract, 
could reduce renal inflammation and oxidative stress, 
resulting in improved kidney function and preserving 
the integrity of kidney tissue mitochondria against 
ROS (Belhadj et al., 2018).
According to a previous study (Baptista et al., 2024), 
the phenolic compounds in S. chinensis seed extract 
have the potential to play a role in the treatment of 
chronic kidney disease (CKD) by reducing uric acid 
levels, a risk factor for the development of CKD. 
Polyphenols, the primary bioactive components of S. 
chinensis seed extract, can donate hydrogen atoms to 
neutralize free radicals and prevent cellular oxidative 
damage, which is reflected in the suppression of uric 
acid generation (Abou-Zeid et al., 2021; Tsuchimoto 
et al., 2022).
The administration of S. chinensis extract and Vit. E, 
alone or in combination, in rats exposed to cisplatin 
resulted in the suppression of uric acid and creatinine 
production due to the potential synergistic protective 
effects of these compounds and their bioactive gradients 
against cisplatin-induced renal toxicity (Baptista et al., 
2024; Ramadan et al., 2024).
The rise in cystatin C levels in the CSP group, an 
indicator of kidney function injury, was consistent with 
the results of Benoit et al. (2020). In addition, recent 
research showed that cisplatin administration caused 
damage to kidney tubular cells, resulting in increased 
levels of cystatin C in the blood (Abo-Elmaaty et 
al., 2020), which was in agreement with the study 
conducted by Conrad et al. (2023), who observed that 
serum cystatin C levels rise significantly in cisplatin-
treated rats before the increase in creatinine, indicating 
early kidney dysfunction, highlighting cystatin C as a 
sensitive indicator of glomerular filtration rate (GFR) 
and a reliable marker for the early detection of acute 
kidney failure associated with chemotherapy, especially 
cisplatin (Mody et al., 2024).
Importantly, S. chinensis seed extract could reduce the 
production of cystatin C by preventing the generation 
of ROS within renal cells, minimizing damage to 
glomerular membranes (Kara, 2017; Alrubaie and 
Khafaji, 2025), and maintaining the glomerular 
filtration rate, thereby preventing cellular inflammation, 
inhibiting the activation of the nuclear transcription 
factors NF-kB and TNF-α, and protecting the integrity 
of renal cells from oxidative damage (El Gendy et al., 
2023).
The current administration of alpha-tocopherol may 
prevent oxidative damage to cellular proteins and 
membranes in the glomeruli and renal tubules by 
interrupting ROS cascade reactions at the cellular level 
(Khafaji et al., 2019; Galli et al., 2022). On the other 
hand, Vit. E prevented the expression of inflammatory 
cytokines, including TNF-α and IL-6, which are 
responsible for elevated cystatin C in toxic exposures 
that may cause nephritis, by inhibiting the activation 
of nuclear transcription factor NF-κB (Tripathi and 
Alshahrani, 2021).
Recent research has indicated that Vit. E enhances the 
generation of antioxidant enzymes, such as SOD and 
CAT, in kidney cells, thereby improving their self-
defense capabilities and preventing persistent oxidative 
stress (Zhang et al., 2024). Interestingly, the present 
administration of Vit. E. with cisplatin-treated rats was 
linked with a reduction in the level of cystatin C due 
to its ability to protect renal cells from oxidative stress 
and cellular inflammation, maintaining the integrity of 
glomerular filtration. These results are consistent with 
previous findings (Dada et al., 2023; Park et al., 2025).
Cisplatin is metabolically converted to a strong 
potential toxic agent that causes oxidative stress that 
influences the cellular respiration pathway, causing 
mitochondrial DNA damage and nuclear DNA injury, 
resulting in a cascade of inflammation responses 
and activation of apoptotic pathways, as reported 
by Amirshahrokhi and Khalili (2015), who noted 
suppressed IL-10 and an elevation in pro-inflammatory 
cytokines, TNF-α and IL-1β, as indicative of a link 
between oxidation and inflammation in cisplatin to 
induced nephrotoxicity in rats (Madhusudhana Rao et 
al., 2011; Gatea et al., 2022). The current results are in 
line with the findings obtained by Gazwi et al. (2024), 
who reported that the administration of cisplatin for 
21 days increased the levels of MDA and nitric oxide 
(NO) and pro-inflammatory cytokines, TNF-α and IL-
6, with a reduction in IL-10, indicating oxidative stress 
and subsequent inflammation.

3498
Importantly, the present results indicated that cisplatin 
injection could elevate the serum concentration of 
TNF-α due to the ability of cisplatin to induce the 
extrinsic pathway via upregulation of TNF-α with 
its receptors, as well as FAS ligand/receptor system 
activation, leading to activation of caspase 8 and 3, 
subsequently triggering cell death “apoptosis” (Yu et 
al., 2018; Patel et al., 2025). TNF-α serves as a key 
mediator in the extrinsic pathway and also plays a 
role in the inflammatory processes associated with 
cisplatin nephrotoxicity (Elmorsy et al., 2024). This 
involves the activation of pro-inflammatory cytokines 
and the recruitment of leukocytes, which contribute to 
oxidative stress (Khafaji et al., 2024; Li et al., 2024). 
TNF-α acts as an inducer of ROS formation, which 
triggers the activation of nuclear factor κB (NFκB), 
which subsequently initiates the transcription of 
inflammatory cytokines, including TNF-α (Patel et al., 
2025). The findings of this study are consistent with the 
conclusions of Khafaji and Khafaji (2023) and Zheng 
et al. (2024). 
Intriguingly, the administration of vitamin E in the 
current experiment, particularly as α-tocopherol, can 
reduce inflammatory pathways by suppressing the 
NF-kB pathway, as suggested by the researchers (Wu 
et al., 2024), who documented that the production of 
pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as TNF-α and IL-
6, was decreased, accompanied by increased IL-10 
production, which is crucial in regulating the immune 
response and inflammation (Wallert et al., 2021).
Additionally, the present results are consistent with 
the findings of Abdel-Wahhab et al. (2016), who 
demonstrated the protective role of ethanolic jojoba 
seed extract on the livers of rats fed a fumonisin-
contaminated diet. Their results showed that 
incorporating this polyphenol-rich extract into the 
diet of rats resulted in a reduction in inflammatory 
cytokines, including TNF-α, IL-1α, and NO, along with 
an increase in serum IL-10. The current findings are in 
line with those of Feki et al. (2022), who reported the 
protective and anti-inflammatory role of S. chinensis 
seed extract in paracetamol-treated rats via down-
regulation of TNF-α, and Bax, a pro-apoptotic protein, 
accompanied by up-regulation of IL-10 and Bcl-2, an 
anti-apoptotic protein (Abou-Zeid et al., 2021; Khafaji, 
2023b).
The CSP injection in the current experimental rats caused 
histopathological changes in hepatocytes, aligning with 
the findings of previous studies (Folayan et al., 2022; 
Cesur et al., 2025). Importantly, these alterations might 
be due to the excessive accumulation of cisplatin in 
hepatocytes, causing hepatotoxic oxidative stress and 
apoptosis, resulting in hepatocyte damage, hyperemia, 
and sinusoidal and vascular dilation (Ekincı-̇Akdemır 
et al., 2020; Rady et al., 2023). The current findings 
are in agreement with the study by Yılmaz (2025), 
who demonstrated the ability of cisplatin to cause 
expansion in the sinusoids, hydropic degeneration that 
spreads throughout the hepatic tissues, and excessive 
infiltration of inflammatory cells (Kaymak et al., 2022; 
El-Hak et al., 2022).
The histological results of S. chinensis extract-treated 
groups (CSP + SCH) indicated the effectiveness of 
S. chinensis extract to recover and protect the portal 
tracts, sinusoids, and hepatic cords from any damage 
that might be caused by the action of cisplatin. This 
confirms the ability of S. chinensis extract to sustain 
the integrity of hepatocytes and protect against free 
radicals, oxidative stress, and hepatotoxicity induced 
by cisplatin. This is supported by the findings of Abdel-
Wahhab et al. (2015), who proved the hepatoprotective 
roles of jojoba (S. chinensis) ethanolic seed extract 
in an in vivo  study and concluded that both low and 
high doses (0.5 and 1 mg/kg, respectively) could 
reduce oxidative stress in a mycotoxin-induced liver 
damage model. The current findings are in line with 
those of a previous study (Salama et al., 2025), which 
concluded that the anti-inflammatory effect of jojoba 
seeds with hepatoprotective effects could improve 
the hepatocellular appearance without necrosis or 
hemorrhage. This suggests that the presence of 
unsaturated fatty acids and δ, α, and γ tocopherols 
(Atteya et al., 2021; Awad et al., 2022) renders jojoba 
seeds one of the most powerful antioxidants, enabling 
them to eliminate free radicals and thereby reduce 
oxidative damage in tissues (Ma et al., 2023). 
Investigations of the hepatic slides of Vit. E-cisplatin 
showed some healthy appearance, which confirmed the 
protective effects of Vit. E-cisplatin on inflammation 
reduction, as well as enhancing the pathological 
alteration in hepatic tissues, which agrees with the 
findings of Mohamed et al. (2022). Vitamin E acts as a 
potential suppressant of lipid peroxidation and protects 
against free radical damage to fatty acids that exist as 
unsaturated phospholipid membranes of hepatocytes 
(Hedayati-Moghadam et al., 2023). A previous study 
reported that Vit. E could protect hepatocytes from 
oxidative stress induced by cisplatin (Omar et al., 
2023). Importantly, the current histopathological 
alterations of hepatic tissues in the cisplatin-treated S. 
chinensis-Vit. E-treated rats showed more improvement 
and enhancement, which might be attributed to the 
synergistic effect of S. chinensis hydro-ethanolic 
extract with vitamin E, which collaboratively acts 
as anti-inflammatory, antiapoptotic, and antioxidant 
factors that diminish the oxidative stress and avoid 
exhaustion of the endogenous antioxidants such as 
CAT, SOD, GSH, and vitamins C and E, which support 
the integrity of hepatocytes membrane via diminishing 
lipid peroxidation induced by ROS in hepatic tissues 
(Hedayati-Moghadam et al., 2023; Salama et al., 2025).
The intraperitoneal injection of cisplatin to rats (CSP 
group) caused severe damage in renal tissues, which 
is consistent with the findings of a previous study 
(Darwish et al., 2017) that reported necrosis in proximal 
and distal tubules after cisplatin injection via its ability

to induce more potential of caspase-3, caspase-8, and 
caspase-9 gene expression in tubular epithelial cells 
in the cortex and medulla, leading to cell membrane 
degeneration (Mostafa et al., 2018; Li et al., 2023; 
Cesur et al., 2025). Several studies have suggested that 
the balance of oxidants/antioxidants is the basic cause 
of renal tissue injury during cisplatin chemotherapy. 
It has also been reported that cisplatin administration 
could generate nitric oxide (NOx), MDA, and 
myeloperoxidase (MPO) and further upregulate the 
gene expression of endothelial nitric oxide synthase 
and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) in renal 
corpuscles and tubular cells, resulting in excessive 
oxidative stress and cell damage (McSweeney et al., 
2021; Makled et al., 2025; Rasheed et al., 2025).
The administration of S. chinensis hydro-ethanolic 
extract could improve the histopathological damage 
by mitigating the cellular inflammation response 
by inhibiting ROS generation, oxidative toxicity, 
and apoptosis. The findings of Abou-Zeid et al.  
(2021) supported the current results. A previous 
study concluded that treatment with S. chinensis  
seed could restore the normal renal structure and 
remove the toxicity in the kidney, suggesting that 
the S. chinensis seed contains several antioxidant 
compounds, including anthocyanins and tannins, 
presenting compelling evidence to elucidate the 
observed beneficial effects in combating oxidative 
stresses (Belhadj et al., 2020).  
The protective role of vitamin E in rats co-treated with 
cisplatin was supported by evidence from Darwish et 
al. (2017), who concluded that the supplementation 
of 75 mg/kg of Vit. E, along with a single dose of 
cisplatin for 4 weeks, could reduce renal inflammation 
and apoptosis by suppressing ROS generation and lipid 
peroxidation that caused renal nephron and tubular 
damage and apoptosis due to the potential antioxidant 
role of Vit. E against free radical (Raouf, 2020) and 
Vit. Vit. E could improve nephron integrity and reduce 
the generation of MPO, NOx, and iNOS (Nasiri et 
al., 2020; Obaid et al., 2022). Intriguingly, the renal 
histology observations of co-administration of SCH 
and Vit. E in cisplatin-treated rats were improved due 
to a synergistic protective role of both Vit. E and S. 
chinensis extract, which had antiapoptotic and anti-
inflammatory properties, caused the regeneration of 
renal tissues, as well as the recovery and restoration 
of the structural components of Bowman’s capsule 
and glomerulus, which reflected positively on the 
enhancement of the current studied biomarkers of renal 
functions (Abdalla et al., 2024; Meng et al., 2025).  
Limitations
Although this study offers valuable insights into 
the observed protective effects, certain limitations 
merit consideration. The exclusive use of male rats 
and a single-dose cisplatin model may limit broader 
applicability and clinical relevance. In addition, the 
absence of molecular pathway analysis constrains 
mechanistic interpretation. Furthermore, further studies 
on the molecular mechanisms are required to identify 
the protective role of S. chinensis. 
Conclusion
The current study concluded that the administration 
of S. chinensis alone or with vitamin E can mitigate 
cisplatin-induced renal and hepatic toxicity in rats via 
its potent antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. 
The current research is the first to demonstrate the 
synergistic protective effects of the combination of 
S. chinensis with Vit. E, which can exert a preventive 
role in renal and hepatic toxicity. Further studies 
are essential to clarify the therapeutic potential of S. 
chinensis nanoparticles in reproductive and cancer-
related disorders. In addition, investigating their role 
in modulating inflammatory and apoptotic pathways 
will enhance our understanding of their mechanisms. 
Moreover, cytotoxicity assays such as MTT and LDH 
are recommended to validate their cellular safety and 
efficacy.
