Abstract
Aspartate aminotransferase fromCorynebacterium glutamicum(CgAspAT) is a PLP-
dependent enzyme that catalyzes the production ofL-aspartate andα-ketoglutarate from
L-glutamate and oxaloacetate inL-lysine biosynthesis. In order to understand the molecular
mechanism ofCgAspAT and compare it with those of other aspartate aminotransferases
(AspATs) from the aminotransferase class I, we determined the crystal structure ofCgAs-
pAT. CgAspAT functions as a dimer, and theCgAspAT monomer consists of two domains,
the core domain and the auxiliary domain. The PLP cofactor is found to be bound toCgAs-
pAT and stabilized through unique residues. In our current structure, a citrate molecule is
bound at the active site of one molecule and mimics binding of the glutamate substrate. The
residues involved in binding of the PLP cofactor and the glutamate substrate were con-
firmed by site-directed mutagenesis. Interestingly, compared with other AspATs from ami-
notransferase subgroup Ia and Ib,CgAspAT exhibited unique binding sites for both cofactor
and substrate; moreover, it was found to have unusual structural features in the auxiliary
domain. Based on these structural differences, we propose thatCgAspAT does not belong
to either subgroup Ia or Ib, and can be categorized into a subgroup Ic. The phylogenetic
tree and RMSD analysis also indicates thatCgAspAT is located in an independent AspAT
subgroup.
Introduction
Corynebacterium glutamicum(initially reported asMicrococcus glutamicus) is an aerobic,
gram-positive, short and rod-shaped bacterium, and is known to be involved in the fermenta-
tion of various amino acids, such as
L-lysine andL-glutamate [1]. Over several decades, various
C. glutamicum mutants have been isolated, which produce significant amounts of differentL-
amino acids [2]. In 2003, the genome ofC. glutamicum ATCC 13032 was sequenced, providing
an abundant source of data on the metabolic pathways used for the biosynthesis of industrially
important products [2, 3]. During last 10 years, the market size of amino acid for livestock has
been continuously increasing.
L-methionine, L-lysine, L-threonine, L-tryptophan, andL-valine
are essential amino acids manufactured industrially. [2, 4, 5].

Aspartate aminotransferase (AspAT) catalyzes the reaction fromL-glutamate and oxaloace-
tate toL-aspartate andα-ketoglutarate [6]. AspAT utilizes pyridoxal 5’-phosphate (PLP, Vita-
min B6) as a cofactor and is the most extensively studied PLP-dependent enzyme. The catalysis
of AspAT consists of two reaction steps. In the first reaction step, the enzyme converts amino
acid substrate to ketoacid while the PLP bound in the enzyme (internal aldimine form) is con-
verted to pyridoxamine phosphate (PMP). In the second reaction step, another ketoacid is con-
verted to the amino acid product, and PMP returns to its initial state (Fig 1A)[ 7, 8].
Aminotransferases (ATs) have been classified into five classes by evolutionary relationship.
Class I includes aspartate AT, phenylalanine AT, and tyrosine AT, and class II contains glycine
AT, arginine AT, and lysine AT. And, class III contains ornithine AT, isoleucine AT, leucine
AT, valine AT and
D-amino acid AT, and class IV contains phosphoserine AT and serine AT.

Competing Interests:The authors have declared
that no competing interests exist.
Finally, class V contains serine-pyruvate AT [9– 11]. Among the five classes, AspAT proteins
belong to class I AT that is further divided into 2 subcategories, subgroup Ia and Ib [9, 12].
Most eukaryotic AspAT enzymes, such asGallus gallus, Sus scrofa, Saccharomyces cerevisiae,
Plasmodium falciparum, Gaiardia lamblia, Trypanosoma brucei, andLeishmania majorand
several bacterial AspAT enzymes includingEscherichia coliwere classified into subgroup Ia,
whereas other bacterial AspAT enzymes, such asThermus thermophilusand Thermotoga mari-
time, were classified into subgroup Ib [12– 21].
In this study, we report a crystal structure of AspAT fromCorynebacterium glutamicum
ATCC13032 (CgAspAT) in complex with a PLP and citrate molecule. Compared with AspATs
from subgroup Ia and Ib,CgAspAT showed unusual structural features at the auxiliary domain
and unique binding sites for both cofactor and substrate. Based on these observations, we pro-
pose thatCgAspAT can be categorized into a new subgroup, subgroup Ic.
Materials and Methods
Cloning, expression and purification
The gene codingCgAspAT was amplified through polymerase chain reaction (PCR) usingC. glu-
tamicum strain ATCC 13032 chromosomal DNA as the template. The PCR products were sub-
cloned into pET30a (Novagen), and the resulting expression vector pET30a:CgAspAT was trans-
formed into aE. coli BL21(DE3)-T1R strain, which was grown in 1 L of LB medium containing
100 μM kanamycin at 310 K. At an OD600 of 0.65,CgAspAT protein expression was induced by
adding 1 mM IPTG. After 20 h at 293 K, the cells were harvested through centrifugation at 4,000
g for 20 min at 277 K. The cell pellet was resuspended in buffer A (40 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0) and
disrupted by ultrasonication. The cell debris was removed through centrifugation at 13,500g for
25 min, and the lysate was applied onto a Ni-NTA agarose column (Qiagen). After washing with
buffer B (40 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0 and 30 mM imidazole), the bound proteins were eluted with
buffer C (40mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0 and 300 mM imidazole). Finally, the trace amount of contami-
nants was removed by size-exclusive chromatography using a Sephacryl S-300 prep-grade col-
umn (320 ml, GE Healthcare) equilibrated with buffer A. The eluted protein had a molecular
weight of about 90 kDa, indicating a dimeric structure. The protein was concentrated to 50 mg
mL
-1 using spin column (Amicon Ultra Centrifugal Filter, 30 kDa pore size), and kept at 193 K
for further experiments. All purification steps were performed at 277 K.
Crystallization and data collection
Crystallization of the purifiedCgAspAT protein was initially performed with commercially
available sparse-matrix screens including Index, PEG I and II (from Hampton Research), Wiz-
ard Classic I and II, Wizard CRYO I and II (from Rigaku Reagents), and Structure Screen I and
II (from Molecular Dimensions), using the sitting-drop vapor-diffusion method on the MRC
Crystallization plate (Molecular Dimensions) at 295 K. Each experiment consisted of mixing
1.0 μL protein solution (50 mg/C1mL
−1, 40 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0) with 1.0μL reservoir solution
and then equilibrating against 50μL reservoir solution.CgAspAT crystals were observed in
several crystallization screening conditions. After several steps of improvement using the hang-
ing-drop vapor-diffusion methods, crystals of the best quality appeared using 28% polyethylene
glycol 3350 and 200 mM Ammonium citrate dibasic as reservoir solution and protein concentra-
tion of 50 mg/C1mL
−1, were finished out with a loop larger than the crystals and flash-frozen by
immersion in liquid nitrogen at 100 K. The data were collected to a resolution of 2.0 Å at beamline
7A at the Pohang Accelerator Laboratory (PAL, Pohang, Republic of Korea) using a Quantum
270 CCD detector (ADSC, USA) (Table 1). All data was indexed, integrated, and scaled together
using the HKL2000 software package [22]. The crystals ofCgAspAT belonged to the space group

C2. Assuming twoCgAspAT molecules in the asymmetric unit, the crystal volume per unit of
protein mass was 2.45 Å3/C1Da−1, which means that the solvent content was 49.92% [23].
Structure determination
The structure was determined by molecular replacement using the CCP4 version of MOLREP
[24] and the structure of the putative aminotransferase fromCorynebacterium diphtheria
(PDB code 3D6K) as the search model. Model building was performed manually using the pro-
gram WinCoot [25], and refinement was performed with CCP4 refmac5 [26] and CNS [27].
The data statistics are summarized inTable 1. The refinedCgAspAT model was deposited in
protein data bank (PDB code 5IWQ).
Site-directed mutagenesis and activity assay
Site-specific mutations were created using the Quick Change kit (Stratagene), and sequencing
was performed to confirm the correct incorporation of the mutations. Mutant proteins were

purified in the same manner as the wild type. Because the reaction of AspAT cannot detect
directly, theCgAspAT activity assay was performed in duplicate reaction with malate dehydro-
genase. At the first reaction,CgAspAT enzymes catalyzeL-asparate andα-ketoglutarate toL-
glutamate and oxaloacetate, and at the second reaction, oxaloacetate is converted to malate, by
malate dehydrogenase using NADH as a cofactor. Oxidation of NADH to NAD was monitored
through the decrease of absorbance at 340 nm (extinction coefficient of 6.22 x 10
3 M−1/C1cm−1)
(S1 Fig). All assays were formed with a reaction mixture of 1 mL total volume, and performed
at 303 K. The reaction mixture contained 100 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 300 mML-aspartate, 50
mM α-ketoglutarate, 80μM NADH, and 10 unit/C1mL−1 malate dehydrogenase. The reaction
was initiated by the addition of enzyme to a final concentration of 1μg/C1mL−1. The decreased
absorbances at 340 nm for 20 sec after the initiation of the reaction were measured.
Results and Discussion
Overall structure ofCgAspAT
In order to elucidate the molecular mechanism ofCgAspAT, we determined the crystal struc-
ture of the protein at 2.0 Å. There were twoCgAspAT molecules in each asymmetric unit,
which form a homodimer of the protein. The atomic structure was in good agreement with the
X-ray crystallographic statistics for bond angles, bond lengths, and other geometric parameters
(Table 1).
The monomer structure ofCgAspAT consists of two domains: a core domain
(Leu56-Gly304) and an auxiliary domain (Ala55-Lys34 and Asp305-Asn426). The core
domain has 10α-helices (α4-α13) that surround the 7-stranded (β1-β7) β-sheet located in the
middle of the domain (Figs1B and 2A). The auxiliary domain has 6α-helices (α1- α3 andα14-
α16), with five arranged in a line, and 2β-strands (β8-β9), which are located between theα-
helix line and the core domain (Figs1B and 2A). Dimerization is mainly mediated through the
contact between the core domains of the two subunits with threeα-helices (α6, α8, andα12) of
one molecule in contact with the correspondingα-helices of the other molecule (Fig 2B). For
dimerization, 63 amino acids are involved in each monomer, and a total of 2472.5 and 2486.2
Å2 of solvent-accessible surface areas per each monomer are buried, which correspond to
13.9% of the total surface areas of each monomer, respectively. The cofactor- and substrate-
binding pockets are at the domain interface, which will be described in the following sub-
sections.
PLP binding mode and catalytic residue ofCgAspAT
Since we observed the electron density for the PLP cofactor in our structure without adding it
in the crystallization process (Fig 3A), we speculate that the PLP cofactor binds strongly to
CgAspAT. Moreover, the enzyme exhibited AspAT activity without the addition of PLP in the
reaction mixture, supporting the high affinity between the enzyme and the PLP cofactor. The
PLP-binding pocket is composed of six loops (α3-α4, β1-α6, β2-α8, β4-α10, β5-α11, andβ6-
β7). Pyridoxal ring was stabilized by the hydrogen bonds with residues Tyr142, Asn191,
Asp220, Tyr223, and Lys259. The nitrogen atom of pyridine ring was hydrogen bonded with
Asp220, and the carbonyl group with Asp220 and Tyr223. Tyr223 was also involved in the
interaction with the aldehyde-group with the aid of Tyr142 and Lys259 (Fig 3B). Conserved
hydrophobic residues, such as Leu105 and Val186, also contribute to the stabilization of pyri-
doxal ring, among the residues involved in PLP binding, Asn191, Asp220, and Tyr223 were
conserved in AspAT enzymes from other organisms (Figs1B and 3B).
Interestingly, the phosphate moiety was stabilized in a unique mode. Unlike the binding of
the phosphate moiety in other AspAT enzymes, where side chains of arginine, threonine, and

one or two serine residues are involved, the moiety ofCgAspAT was stabilized by the side
chains of one tyrosine (Tyr73) and four serine residues (Ser103, Ser104, Ser256, and Ser258)
through a hydrogen bond network (Fig 3B). In detail, Tyr73 and Ser258 form hydrogen bonds

with the O1 atom, and Ser103 and Ser256 stabilize the O2 and O3 atoms, respectively. More-
over, Ser104 forms hydrogen bonds with both O3 and O4 atoms (Fig 3B). Near the aldehyde
group of the bound PLP, we observed the conserved Lys259 residue. Since this lysine residue is
known to function as a catalytic residue in other AspAT enzymes by forming an enzyme aldi-
mine covalent bond, we speculate thatCgAspAT may catalyze the enzyme reaction in a way
similar to other AspAT enzymes. The residues involved in the cofactor binding were further
confirmed by site-directed mutagenesis experiments. Mutants, such as Y73A, Y142A, N191A,
D220A, Y223A, and K259A, exhibited almost complete loss of enzyme activity, indicating that
these residues are crucial for PLP binding. However, mutations of serine residues (S103A,
S104A, and S258A) involved in the stabilization of the phosphate moiety showed ~70% AspAT
activities compared with the wild type, indicating that these residues, individually, do not influ-
ence much the stabilization of the phosphate moiety (Fig 3C).
Substrate binding mode ofCgAspAT
In our current structure, one citrate molecule, a component of the crystallization solution, is
observed to be bound (Fig 4A and 4B), and the superposition of our structure with the AspAT
from Escherichia coli(EcAspAT) structure in complex with the glutamate substrate (pdb code
1X28) allows us to speculate the substrate binding ofCgAspAT. InEcAspAT, theα-carboxyl group
of glutamate is stabilized by hydrogenbonds with Asn183 and Arg374 residues. Theα-carboxyl
group of glutamate might be similarly stabilized inCgAspAT, because residues of Asn191 and
Arg394 are located at the corresponding positions of Asn183 and Arg374, respectively (Fig 4C).
However, the binding mode of theγ-carboxyl group of glutamate inCgAspAT seems to be quite
different compared with that inEcAspAT. InEcAspAT, four residues such as Trp130, Arg280,
Ser284, and Asn285 are involved in stabilization of theγ-carboxyl group of glutamate by direct
and water-mediated hydrogen bonds, and none of these residues are conserved inCgAspAT. In
CgAspAT, Arg39, Tyr142 and Arg144 arepositioned in the vicinity of theγ-carboxyl group of glu-
tamate (Fig 4C). As observed above, inCgAspAT, a citrate molecule is bound at the position that
the glutamate substrate is bound inEcAspAT. Because the citrate molecule is stabilized by hydro-
gen bonds with the highly positively-charged residues such as Arg39, Lys41, Arg144 and Arg394,
binding of the citrate molecule seems to mimic the substrate binding ofCgAspAT (Fig 4B and 4C).
The involvement of these residues in substrate binding is further confirmed by site-directed muta-
genesis experiments. When we replace the Arg39, Tyr142, Arg144, Asn191 and Arg394 residues
by alanine, all mutants showed reduced or almost complete loss of enzyme activity, indicating that
these unique residues are crucial for the binding of the glutamate substrate inCgAspAT (Fig 3C).
Comparison ofCgAspAT with subgroup Ia and Ib
AspAT enzymes belong to the aminotransferase class I. Based on amino acid sequence similar-
ity, class I was further divided into two subgroups, subgroup Ia and Ib. Although amino acid
sequence similarities within enzymes in subgroup Ia and Ib are about 40%, that between
enzymes in subgroups Ia and Ib is about 15% [12]. Subgroup Ia includes mostly eukaryotic and
some bacterial AspAT enzymes, while some extremophiles belong to subgroup Ib. However,

we observed thatCgAspAT has unique structural features compared with AspAT enzymes
from subgroups Ia and Ib, and proposed thatCgAspAT can be categorized as a new subgroup
due to the following reasons.
First, although the overall fold of the core domain in the case ofCgAspAT is similar to that
of other AspAT enzymes from subgroup Ia and Ib, the auxiliary domain ofCgAspAT showed a
unique structural conformation. In AspATs from subgroups Ia and Ib, the N-terminal region
is positioned in the vicinity of the core domain, constituting part of the substrate binding site.
However, inCgAspAT, the N-terminal region is positioned away from the core domain and is
not involved in the formation of the substrate binding-site (Fig 5A).
Second, CgAspAT uses unique residues for the stabilization of the PLP cofactor. Although
most AspATs share conserved residues for enzyme catalysis and stabilization of the pyridoxal

ring binding, the binding mode of the phosphate moiety was quite different from the other sub-
groups. In AspATs from subgroup Ia, one each of Thr, Tyr, and Arg and two Ser residues are
involved in binding phosphate moiety, while in subgroup Ib only one each of Ser, Tyr and Arg
residues. However,CgAspAT uses four Ser and one Tyr residues for the stabilization of the
phosphate moiety (Fig 5B). Moreover, two hydrophobic residues, Leu105 and Val186 that con-
tribute to the stabilization of PLP inCgAspAT, are not conserved in enzymes in subgroup Ia
and Ib. In the position of Leu105, Lys and Thr are positioned in subgroup Ia and Ib, respec-
tively. And in the position of Val186, His and Asn are positioned in subgroup Ia and Ib, respec-
tively. These residues are quite conserved within their subgroups, indicating that AspATs from
different subgroups have distinctive PLP binding modes (Fig 1B, S2 and S3 Figs).
Finally, CgAspAT also has a unique mode for substrate binding. In AspATs from subgroup
Ia, residues, such as two Arg, Asn, and Trp (or Tyr), are involved in substrate binding. AspATs
from subgroup Ib stabilize the substrate in a way similar to those from AspATs from subgroup
Ia, where Arg, Asn, Tyr, and Trp (or Tyr) are involved. On the other hand,CgAspAT utilizes
unique residues, such as one each of Tyr and Lys, dyad and three Arg residues (Fig 5C). As
observed in the residues involved in the PLP binding, these residues are also highly conserved
within its subgroup, and we suspect that these unique substrate binding-modes may be one of
the decisive structural features of each subgroup (Fig 1B, S2 and S3 Figs). Interestingly, we
found three unpublished AspAT structures in the protein data bank, AspATs fromCorynebac-
terium diphtheria(CdAspAT, PDB Code: 3D6K),Mycobacterium tuberculosis(MtAspAT,
PDB Code: 5C6U) andDeinococcus geothermalis(DgAspAT, PDB Code: 3EZ1), and these
enzymes have structural features similar toCgAspAT (Fig 5D, 5E and 5F), indicating that these
enzymes can belong to the category same asCgAspAT.
We then performed a phylogenetic tree analysis of AspATs from various organisms (Fig 6).
As expected, AspATs from subgroup Ia and subgroup Ib were located away from each other.
However, CgAspAT did not belong to either subgroup Ia or subgroup Ib, confirming that
CgAspAT can be categorized as a new subgroup. Moreover,CdAspAT, MtAspAT andDgAs-
pAT enzymes show ~40% amino acid sequence similarity withCgAspAT and are located close
to CgAspAT in the phylogenetic analysis (Fig 6). Here, combined with the unique structural
features described above, we propose thatCgAspAT, together withCdAspAT, MtAspAT and
DgAspAT enzymes, can be categorized as subgroup Ic.
Conclusion
We determined the crystal structure ofCgAspAT in complex with the PLP cofactor and we
speculated glutamate substrate binding site compare toEcAspAT structure. Many biochemical
and structural studies on AspATs have been reported for decades, which categorize these

enzymes into two subgroups, subgroup Ia and subgroup Ib. However,CgAspAT shows only
10~15% amino acid sequence similarity with AspATs from subgroup Ia and subgroup Ib and
exhibits unique structural features not only in the auxiliary domain but also at the catalytic and
substrate binding sites. These amino acid sequence analysis and the structural comparisons
reveal thatCgAspAT does not belong to either subgroup Ia or subgroup Ib, but rather should
be classified to a new category, subgroup Ic. Moreover, the RMSD analysis of the reported
AspAT structures supports new classification of enzymes in this family (S1 Table.).
