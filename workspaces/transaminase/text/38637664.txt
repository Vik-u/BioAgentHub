Cariprazine— the only single antipsychotic drug in the market which can handle all symptoms of
bipolar I disorder— involves trans-4-substituted cyclohexane-1-amine as a key structural element. In
this work, production oftrans-4-substituted cyclohexane-1-amines was investigated applying
transaminases either in diastereotope selective amination starting from the corresponding ketone or in
diastereomer selective deamination of their diasteromeric mixtures. Transaminases were identiﬁed
enabling the conversion of thecis-diastereomer of four selectedcis/trans-amines with different
4-substituents to the corresponding ketones. In the continuous-ﬂow experiments aiming thecis
diastereomer conversion to ketone, highly diastereopuretrans-amine could be produced (de > 99%).
The yield of puretrans-isomers exceeding their original amount in the starting mixture could be
explained by dynamic isomerization through ketone intermediates. The single transaminase-
catalyzed process— exploiting thecis-diastereomer selectivity of the deamination and
thermodynamic control favoring thetrans-amines due to reversibility of the steps— allows
enhancement of the productivity of industrial cariprazine synthesis.
The efﬁcient stereoselective synthesis of amines is one of the supreme wishes
of small molecule drug discovery and development due to their relevance in
medicinal chemistry— as evidenced by statistics
1,2. Numerous industrial
scale endeavors (e.g., ChiPros™ process with lipase3–8, or manufacturing of
sitagliptin with transaminase9 utilizing emerging technologies10 and key
green engineering research areas 11 like biocatalysis12–19 and ﬂow
chemistry20–23 can slake this thirst in a sustainable way. Enzyme-catalyzed
deracemization strategies24–36 with full conversion of the racemate proved to
be a viable strategy for the synthesis of pure enantiomers of amines. In
contrast, enzyme-catalyzed dynamic de-diastereomerizations are quite
rare
37.
Cariprazine, developed by Gedeon Richter Plc. and being marketed as
Reagila® in Europe and as Vraylar® in the USA, (Fig.1a) is an atypical
antipsychotic (third generation of neuroleptics) for the treatment of schi-
zophrenia, major depression disorder, and mania, mixed as well as
depression episodes associated with bipolar I. disorder38–43. A substantial
structural constituent of cariprazine is the bitopic cyclohexyl moietytrans-
1a— containing two centers of pseudoasymmetry, 1r and 4r providing the
transarrangement— which connects the two pharmacophores (Fig.1a). The
key intermediate is synthesized by a two-step hydrogenation of
4-nitrophenylacetic acid followedby an ethyl ester formation (Fig.1b)44.
Separation of the diastereomeric mixturecis/trans-1a with classical crys-
tallization affords the key intermediatetrans-1a in moderate yield governed
by the startingcis:trans ratio in extremely high diastereomeric purity44.D u e

The productivity of this patented industrial process can be improved by

protonable ketone2a. Although several biocatalysts— such as transaminase
(TA)46–48, lipase49–51, or ketoreductase52,53— were applied for stereoselective
biotransformations of cyclohexane-1-amines with substituents at 2- or 3-
position, the presence of stable centers of asymmetry rendered these pro-
cesses signiﬁcantly dissimilar to our case withthe 4-substituted derivatives
having only centers of pseudoasymmetry. The closest analogy to our case is
the application of reductive aminase for the production of isopropylcis-3-
aminocyclobutane-1-carboxylate— the intermediate of abrocitinib— having
also two centers of pseudoasymmetry
54. However, no biocatalytic processes
have been developed for preparing either the diastereomer of1a or even the
4-substituted cyclohexane-1-amine skeleton in a stereoselective way
until so far.
Here, we report a process catalyzed by a single transaminase to produce
trans-4-substituted cyclohexane-1-amines trans-1a-d from the corre-
sponding cis/trans-diastereomeric mixtures. During the diastereomer
selectivecis-deamination approach in continuous-ﬂow mode aimingtrans
4-substituted cyclohexane-1-aminestrans-1a-d with high diastereomeric
excess, a dynamiccis-to-trans isomerization was revealed— being poten-

Results and discussion
First, the diastereotope selective amination aided by various TAs has been
investigated with four 4-substituted cyclohexanones 2a-d representing
various properties (Fig.2). Convenient synthetic routes have been developed
for 2a-d and for the diastereomeric mixtures of amines 1a-d (for details, see
Section 3.1.1 and 3.1.2 in Supplementary information, respectively)
55,56.
For amination of the ketones2a-din preliminary enzyme screening, six
transaminases involving three (R)-selective— the TA fromArthrobacter sp.
(ArR-TA)57, its mutated variant (ArR-TAmut)46,f r o mAspergillus terreus
(AtR-TA)58— and three (S)-selective— the TA from Arthrobacter citreus
(ArS-TA)59,f r o mVibrio ﬂuvialis (VfS-TA)60, and mutant of TA from
Chromobacterium violaceum(CvS-TAW60C)61,62— in immobilized whole-
cell forms63 were selected using the corresponding enantiomer of 1-
phenylethan-1-amine (R)-3 or (S)-3 as amine donor at 30 °C in batch mode
(Fig. 2). For these experiments, recombinantE. coli whole-cells over-
expressing one of the above TAs were immobilized together with hollow
silica microspheres as support by entrapment in a sol-gel system. Details on
the expression ofArR-TA,ArR-TA
mut, AtR-TA,ArS-TA,VfS-TA, andCvS-
TAW60C and immobilization of TA-expressing whole-cells were published
in our preceding work63. Further details can be found in Supplementary
Information Section 1.3.2. The sol-gel entrapment method combined the
advantages of cell-adsorption on silica microspheres providing good
mechanical properties of the biocatalyst with high immobilization yield
(~100% of the cells were retained; ~0.9 g of dry TA biocatalyst could be
produced from 1 g of wet cells) by the entrapping silica matrix. The

vent tolerance of imm-CvS-TAW60C), the kinetic resolution of racemic 4-
phenylbutane-2-amine rac-8 was applied as a test reaction (Sections
1.3.4.1–1.3.4.3 of Supplementary Methods, and Supplementary
Figs. S7–S13) with slight modiﬁcations compared to our previous studies63.
Preliminary screening of diastereotope selective amination of
ketones 2a-d with immobilized whole-cell forms transaminases
in batch mode
Ketones 2a-d— selected as model substrates for this study— were investi-
gated for amination using six transaminases in their immobilized whole-cell
form (Fig.2). After the synthesis and structural characterization of pure
trans-1a-d·HCl (for details, see Section 3.1 in Supplementary Information),
the diastereotope selectivity in the batch mode reactions could be analyzed
by GC.
Irrespective of their established enantiomer preferences, the formation
of cis-diastereomer of the amines1a-d was favored with almost all inves-
tigated TAs. Interestingly,trans-diastereomer preference was observed only
in the case of1c with ArR-TAmut. High conversions from the ketones2a-d
could be achieved withArR-TAmut, CvS-TAW60C,a n dVfS-TA providing
high diastereomeric excess with only the latter two TAs.ArR-TAmut—

bulky ketones9— provided only low or moderate diastereomeric ratio.
Relatively high diastereomeric excesses of thecis-amines cis-1a-d could be
reached byVfS-TA andCvS-TAW60C.The cis-diastereomeric preference of
AtR-TA was also high, but the conversions of the ketones2a-d under these
operation conditions were unsatisfactory (<8%). While aminations of2b-d
with ArR-TA withcis-diastereomeric preference (de > 92%) proceeded in
moderate conversions, the conversion from ketone2a remained low (<2%).
The phenyl-bearing ketone2d was investigated withCvS-TA,CvS-TAW60C,
and in aminations performed in organic solvents indicating similarcis-
stereopreference as our results in aqueous systems64.
S i n c ew ec o u l dn o tﬁnd any TA capable of catalyzing the diastereotope
selective amination with the desiredtrans-diastereomeric preference to
provide the targeted amine diastereomerstrans-1a-d(Fig.1c), our attention
turned to the diastereomer selective deamination which was enabled by the
cis-preference (Fig.1d). An expected beneﬁt of the deamination strategy
from thecis/trans-1a-d mixtures was the possibility of separation of the
unreactedtrans-1a-dfrom the corresponding ketone2a-dwithout the need
of recrystallization.
Deamination ofcis/trans-1a-d by immobilized transaminases in
continuous-ﬂow mode
The isomer separation strategy (Fig.1d) based on the diastereomer selective
deamination of thecis-amines cis-1a-d was performed withVfS-TA and
CvS-TAW60C mostly in batch mode using different forms— native soluble
enzyme, immobilized whole-cells, and puriﬁed form immobilized on
polymer resin65.T h ee fﬁciency of biotransformations can be signiﬁcantly
improved by combining enzyme immobilization techniques and
continuous-ﬂow reactor systems
66.S i n c eCvS-TAW60C could be efﬁciently
immobilized on polymer resin65, we continued our experiments with this
form of the transaminase in continuous-ﬂow mode for obtainingtrans-1a-
d, inter alia, the pharmaceutical importanttrans-1a on a preparative scale.
The CvS-TAW60C (puriﬁed by standard Ni-NTA method) was
immobilized on bisepoxide-activated macroporous aminoalkyl resins.
Previous experiments with pureCvS-TAW60C (overexpressed inE. coliand
puriﬁed by standard Ni-NTA method, Supplementary Fig. S6) showed that
the best resin-immobilized TA form with high operational stability could be
obtained by covalent attachment of the enzyme to glycerol diglycidyl ether
activated ethylamine-functionalizedmesoporous polymer (for details, see
Section 1.3.3 in Supplementary Information)

separation of various amines in continuous-ﬂow mode using sodium pyr-
uvate as amine acceptor65, a similar approach for the diastereomer separa-
tion ofcis/trans-1a-d seemed to be straightforward by deamination ofcis-
diastereomer from the mixture to leave the desired unreactedtrans-1a-d
and the corresponding ketone2a-d (Fig. 3a). Because in the kinetic reso-
lution of racemic amines employing a stoichiometric equivalent of the
amino acceptor— usually pyruvate (or relatedα-keto acid)— the thermo-
dynamic equilibrium is on the product side
67, the diastereomer selective
approach seemed to be favored as well.
Because the imm-CvS-TAW60C was investigated in continuous-ﬂow
mode in kinetic resolutions of racemic amines only at ambient temperature
(30 °C) for short reaction times (~1 h)65, investigations for extending the
reaction conditions were performedﬁrst (for details, see Section 1.3.4 in
Supplementary Information). Based on these results, deamination in
continuous-ﬂow mode was accomplished at 40 °C providing signiﬁcantly
enhanced reaction rates with sufﬁciently high operational stability. In the
continuous-ﬂow system (Supplementary Fig. S14), the buffered solution
(pH 7, HEPES) supplemented with the diastereomeric mixtures of the
amines cis/trans-1a-d·HCl, sodium pyruvate, dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO)
(to enhance substrate solubility) and PLP was pumped through the packed-

amines cis/trans-1a,b,d, where the diastereomeric excess of the residual
trans-amine remained lower than 99%, the number of columns was
increased (Entries 1,2,4 of Table1, see Section 1.3.5.1 in Supplementary
Information).
The long-term operational stability of immobilizedCvS-TAW60C bio-
catalyst was apparent during the preparative scale continuous-ﬂow opera-
tions of diastereomer selective deamination starting fromcis/trans-1a-
d·HCl at 40 °C in HEPES buffer containing DMSO (Table1 and Section
1.3.5 in Supplementary Information). The system could be operated for at
least 36 h (including at least 24 h stationary operation) without observable
loss of activity for each diastereomeric mixturecis/trans-1a-d (Fig. 3).
According to our preliminary investigations (Section 1.3.4.4.3 in Supple-
mentary information and Supplementary Fig. S15) the immobilizedCvS-
TAW60C biocatalyst-ﬁlled columns lost a part of their activity after 24 h
stationary operation, with ~40–50% residual activity in the 36–70 h period.
Assuming high diastereomer selectivity in an irreversible process, the
expected amount of the residualtrans-1a-d could not exceed the original
amount in the starting diastereomeric mixturecis/trans-1a-d. Entries 1,3,4
of Table 1, however, indicated signiﬁcantly less amount of the forming
ketone (2a,c,d, respectively) as compared to the molar fraction of thecis-
amine in the startingcis/trans-1a,c,d mixture. The signiﬁcantly higher
isolated yield of the diastereopuretrans-amine (trans-1c,d, Entries 3,4 of
Table 1) than the original amount in the diastereomeric mixture further
conﬁrmed these results.
Although the space-time yield (STY) of the non-optimized production
of trans-1a-d (8-30 kg m−3 d−1 =0 . 3 3–1.26 × 10−3 kg·L−1·h−1,s e eT a b l e1)
remained beyond the >1 kg L−1 h−1 values required for an industrially viable
process68,t h eSTY values reported here can be considered as acceptable
values at laboratory scale. However, compared to the 103 kg m−3 d−1 STY
value achieved in our previous on lipase-catalyzed dynamic-kinetic-
resolution of benzylic amines in continuous-ﬂow PBR system36,t h eSTY of
the transaminase-catalyzed process reaching 7–20% of the lipase-catalyzed
method is promising. The lower STY’s can be rationalized by taking speciﬁc
reaction rates (rﬂow) into account. While lipases known as the workhorses of

biocatalysis even at an industrial scale can providerﬂow values well above

engineered for this purpose afford onlyrﬂow =0 . 0 5 5–0.203 µmol g−1 min−1
for production of trans-1a-d (Table 1). The apparent residence times
(τapp =5 4–216 min) estimated for the production oftrans-1a-d (Table 1)
were in good agreement with the times required to reach the stationary state
(2–5 h) in the continuous-ﬂow systems (Fig.3).
The greater-than-expected amount oftrans-1a-dcould be rationalized
by assuming a dynamic isomerization catalyzed by a single transaminase
(imm-CvS-TA
W60C). Since the TA-catalyzed processes are reversible, the
diastereomer selective deamination process is not fully irreversible and the
partial reversibility allows the prevalence of thermodynamic consequences.
Since the trans-diastereomers are thermodynamically more favored, a
process exploiting the combination of kinetic selectivity and thermo-
dynamic equilibrium can surpass the limitation of thetrans-diastereomer
amount in the original mixture by the dynamic isomerization.
Although TAs
46–48 were applied for stereoselective biotransformations
of cyclohexane-1-amines with substituents at 2- or 3-position, the presence
of two stable centers of asymmetry in such compounds renders their dia-
stereomer selective transformations signiﬁcantly different from the case of
the 4-substituted derivatives. The stereochemistry within the 4-substituted
cyclohexane-1-amines1a-d is determined by two centers of pseudoasym-
metry at the 1- and 4-substituents at the cyclohexane ring (1r,4r for trans,o r
1 s,4 s for cis; the centers of pseudoasymmetry are markedr/s in the CIP
system, see pp. 52–54 in ref.45). A unique feature of such systems is that if
one center of pseudoasymmetry is eliminated (e.g., an 1r center is destroyed
upon deamination to ketone2a-d), the other (in this case 4r)i sa l s oe r a -
dicated without altering any of the four covalent bonds directly attached to
the central atom. In this respect, thecis/trans-stereochemistry is deﬁned by
the two centers of pseudoasymmetry behaving as a single stereogenic unit.
Importantly, thecis-to-trans dynamic isomerization observed during
the diastereomer selective deamination of cis/trans-1a-d mixture in
continuous-ﬂow mode could be catalyzed by a single transaminase— by
imm-CvS-TA
W60C in this study. The favored formation oftrans-1a-d is
based on thecis-diastereomer selectivity in the deamination of thecis/trans-
1a-dmixture and the moderate diastereotope selectivity in the amination of
the corresponding ketones2a-d, since the reversibility of the process allows
thermodynamic control leading to the more stabletrans-diastereomers
trans-1a-d. The fact that using 1 molar equivalent pyruvate (100% of amine
acceptor) resulted in only 17–60% ketone formation could be due to a
mixture of kinetic and thermodynamic reasons. Thus, in the process of
using TA in a packed-bed reactor under continuous-ﬂow conditions both
kinetic and thermodynamic components play a role. Due to the large
amount of catalyst, kinetic selectivity is more pronounced, and almost
diastereomerically puretrans-amines are forming but partial equilibration
(thermodynamics) allows isomerization to the more stable isomer and
thereby formation oftrans-amines in higher amounts than present in the
original mixture (Fig. 4). Usually, increasing pyruvate concentration
increases the rate ofcis-deamination (mostly inﬂuenced by kinetic factors).
On the other hand, increasing pyruvate concentration increases the pro-
portion of the 1-cyclohexanone-compound in theﬁnal mixture (mostly
inﬂuenced by thermodynamic factors)
64.
T h er e q u i r e m e n to fo n l yas i n g l ee n z y m ef o rt h ed y n a m i ccis-to-trans-
isomerization of 4-substituted cyclohexane-1-amines1a-d is in stark con-
trast to the deracemization of the racemic amines which is also a dynamic
process based on enantiomer selectivity and reversibility of enzyme cata-
lysis. Due to the same energy of the two enantiomers in deracemization, the
governing effect of thermodynamic preference cannot be exploited and the
process can only be performed with two enantiocomplementary enzymes
(sequential usage or remarkably different kinetics proﬁles)
24,25.
Consequently, a single transaminase— such asCvS-TAW60C with the
proper diastereomer selectivity— could be applied for interconversion of the
cis-t ot h etrans-diastereomer of 4-substituted cyclohexane-1-amines1a-d,a
process being useful for enhancing the industrial process of the cariprazine
synthesis (Fig.4)
64. The patent application on using this dynamic isomeriza-
tion process for enhancing the cariprazine synthesis involves further examples
— with proper single transaminases such asCvS-TA,VfS-TA or their various
mutants— achieving up to 80%cis-to-transconversion from thecis-1a isomer
providingtrans-1a in ~80%de nearby the thermodynamic equilibrium64.
Conclusion
In conclusion, transaminases withcis-selectivity could be applied to produce
the trans 4-substituted cyclohexane-1-amines from the correspondingcis/
trans diastereomeric mixtures by selective deamination. Implementing the
process in continuous-ﬂow mode using packed-bed reactorsﬁlled with
immobilized W60C mutantof the transaminase fromChromobacterium
violaceum could produce the targetedtrans-4-substituted cyclohexane-1-
amines inde > 99%. The yield of puretrans-isomers exceeding their original
amount in the starting mixture revealed a dynamic isomerization via the
ketone intermediate. Although dynamicequilibration-based processes were
already exploited to shift the composition of enantiomeric mixtures of
amines (i.e., racemic amines) towards the direction of either enantiomers,
these so-called deracemizations could exploit only kinetic differentiation
and— due to the thermodynamic equivalency of the enantiomers— required

two transaminases with different kinetics and enantiopreference. In con-
trast, the dynamic isomerization process convertingcis/transdiastereomeric
mixtures of 4-substituted cyclohexane-1-amines to the thermodynamically
favoredtransdiastereomer required only a single transaminase with proper
diastereomer preference. The results with four different 4-substituted
cyclohexane-1-amines— in which two centers of pseudoasymmetry deter-
mining thetrans or cis stereochemistry behave as one stereogenic unit—
requiring only a single transaminaseto convert the thermodynamically less
favored cis- to the more favoredtrans-diastereomer. Besides the general
applicability of this type of dynamic isomerization, this bioprocess provides
an appealing approach to improve the industrial synthesis of cariprazine by
converting thecis/trans-diastereomeric mixture totrans-ethyl 2-(4-ami-
nocyclohexyl)acetate— a key intermediate of the process.
Methods
General
GC-FID analysis was performed on Agilent 5890 GC equipped with a non-
polar HP-5 column (Agilent J&W; 30 m × 0.25 mm × 0.25 µmﬁlm thickness
of (5%-Phenyl)-methylpolysiloxane). High-resolution Mass Spectrometry
(HR-MS) and coupled Mass Spectrometry-Mass Spectrometry (MS-MS)
analyses were performed on a Thermo Velos Pro Orbitrap Elite (Thermo
Fisher Scientiﬁc) system. 1D and 2D NMR spectra were recorded on a
Avance III HDX spectrometers from Bruker BioSpin GmbH, Rheinstetten,
Germany. Infrared spectra were recorded on a Bruker ALPHA FT-IR
spectrometer and wavenumbers of bands are listed in cm
−1.C o l u m nc h r o -
matography was performed on silica gel (Kieselgel 60, 0.040–0.063 mm,
230–400 mesh, Merck, Darmstadt, Germany). TLC was carried out using
Kieselgel 60 F254 (Merck) sheets. Commercially available chemicals and
reagents were purchased from Sigma Aldrich (Saint Louis, MO, USA), Alfa
Aesar Europe (Karlsruhe, Germany), Merck (Darmstadt, Germany), Fluka
( M i l w a u k e e ,W I ,U S A ) ,M a t e r i u mI n n o v a t i o n s( G r a n b y ,Q C ,C a n a d a ) ,
Resindion S.r.L. (Binasco, Italy). Transaminases (ArR-TA, ArR-TA
mut, AtR-
TA), ArS-TA, VfS-TA, andCvS-TAW60C) were immobilized in whole-cell
form (imm-whc-TAs)62 or in porous polymeric beads by covalent binding
(imm-CvS-TAW60C)65. Details on enzyme coding plasmids, transaminase
sequences, and immobilization methods are described in Section 1.2, Section
3.2, and 3.3. in Supplementary information; respectively. CatCart™ columns
(inner diameter: 4 mm; total length: 70 mm; packed length: 65 mm; inner
volume: 0.816 mL) were products of ThalesNano Plc. (Budapest, Hungary).
Synthesis of ketones 2a-d and the diastereomeric mixtures of the
amines cis/trans-1a-d
The preparation of the ketones is shown in Supplementary Fig. S1 and
described in Section 1.3.1.1. of Supplementary Methods.
Amination of ketones 2a-d with immobilized whole-cell TAs in
batch mode in an analytical scale
The immobilized whole-cell TA biocatalyst (50 mg) was suspended in
phosphate buffer (100 mM, pH 7.5) containing pyridoxal-5’-phosphate
monohydrate (PLP, 0.05 mM, 5 n/n%) in 4 mL vials and incubated for 1 h.
Then the corresponding enantiomer of 1-phenylethan-1-amine [15 mM, 3
eq.; (S)-3 for ArS-TA, VfS-TA, CvS-TA
W60C and (R)-3 for ArR-TA, ArR-
TAmut, AtR-TA] was added to the suspension and incubated for 30 min
again. Finally, the ketones (2a-d,5 m M )w e r ea d d e d .T h eﬁnal reaction
volume was 1 mL. The reaction mixture was shaken on an orbital shaker
(600 rpm) at 30 °C for 24 h. After the addition of sodium hydroxide (100 µL,
1 M) to the samples taken from the reaction mixture (800 µL), the resulting
mixture was extracted with ethyl acetate (800 µL). After derivatizing the
amines1a-din the extract by addition of acetic anhydride (10 µL, 60 °C, 1 h),
the organic phase was dried over Na
2SO4 and analyzed by gas chromato-
graphy [on Agilent 5890 equipment, FID detector and HP-5 column
(Agilent J&W; 30 m × 0.25 mm × 0.25 µmﬁlm thickness of (5%-phenyl)
methylpolysiloxane); H2 carrier gas, injector: 250 °C, detector: 250 °C, head
pressure: 12 psi, split ratio: 50:1]. GC methods and reference chromato-
grams of ketones2a-d and diastereomeric acetamidescis/trans-7a-d are
shown in Supplementary Table 1, and Supplementary Figs. S2-S5, respec-
tively. Further GC data are provided in Supplementary Data 2 as Figure
GC1-GC4.
Deamination ofcis/trans-1a-d with immobilizedCvS-TAW60C in
continuous-ﬂow mode
After ﬁlling CatCart™ columns with covalently immobilizedCvS-TAW60C
biocatalyst (ﬁlling weight = 375±12 mg/column), the system (detailed in
Section 1.3.4.4 of Supplementary Information) consisting of the indicated
number ofCvS
W60C-TA-ﬁlled columns (see Table1) was prewashed by
HEPES buffer (50 mM, pH = 7.0) containing PLP (~5× volume of the col-
umn void). Then the substrate solution [1a-b (20 mM) or1c-d (15 mM) in
HEPES buffer (50 mM, pH = 7.0) containing DMSO as cosolvent (10% v/v
for 1a-b, 20% v/v for1c-d), sodium pyruvate (1. eq.) and PLP (1% n/n)] was
pumped through the column thermostated at 40 °C with 10 µL min
−1 of
ﬂow rate. Samples were taken from the efﬂuent and analyzed by GC (as
described in Section 1.3.1.3 of Supplementary Information). After the sta-
tionary operation was established (5–8 h from the start of the experiment,
depending on the number ofCvSW60C-TA-ﬁlled columns), the product
mixture was collected for 30–48 h.
From the mixture collected during the stationary phase of the opera-
tion, the puretrans-producttrans-1a-d was isolated. The pH of the mixture
was set to 1 by the addition of aqueous cc. HCl, followed by removal of the
formed ketone2a-d by extraction with dichloromethane (3 × 50 mL). Then
the pH of the aqueous phase was set to 12 by the addition of ammonium
hydroxide (25%v/v) andtrans-1a-d was extracted with dichloromethane
(3 × 50 mL). The uniﬁed organic phase was washed with brine (30 mL) and
dried over Na
2SO4. After the removal of the solvent in a vacuum, the residue
was dissolved in diethyl ether (5 mL).The precipitate forming by HCl-gas
treatment was collected byﬁltration and dried to give the corresponding
trans-amine hydrochloride salt (trans-1a-d·HCl). NMR data are provided in
Section 1.3.5.2 in Supplementary Information and in Supplementary Data 1.
