ABSTRACT: Three enzymatic routes towardγ-hydroxy-α-amino acids
by tandem aldol addition−transamination one-pot two-step reactions are
reported. The approaches feature an enantioselective aldol addition of
pyruvate to various nonaromatic aldehydes catalyzed by trans-o-
hydroxybenzylidene pyruvate hydratase-aldolase (HBPA) from Pseudo-
monas putida. This aﬀords chiral 4-hydroxy-2-oxo acids, which were
subsequently enantioselectively aminated usingS-selective transaminases.
Three transamination processes were investigated involving di ﬀerent
amine donors and transaminases: (i)
L-Ala as an amine donor with
pyruvate recycling, (ii) a benzylamine donor using benzaldehyde lyase
from Pseudomonas ﬂuorescens Biovar I (BAL) to transform the
benzaldehyde formed into benzoin, minimizing equilibrium limitations,
and (iii)
L-Glu as an amine donor with a double cascade comprising
branched-chain α-amino acid aminotransferase (BCAT) and aspartate amino transferase (AspAT), both fromE. coli, usingL-Asp as a
substrate to regenerateL-Glu. The γ-hydroxy-α-amino acids thus obtained were transformed into chiralα-amino-γ-butyrolactones,
structural motifs found in many biologically active compounds and valuable intermediates for the synthesis of pharmaceutical agents.

■ INTRODUCTION
γ-Hydroxy-α-amino acids represent compounds with relevant
biological and pharmacological importance.1 Examples include
antidiabetics such as (2 S,3R,4S)-4-hydroxyisoleucine,
4-hydroxy-L-norvaline, and 4-hydroxypipecolic acid and nutri-
tional supplements in the food industry, e.g.
trans-4-hydroxy-
L-proline.1a,2 Moreover, they constitute struc-
tural motifs of more complex naturally occurring and synthetic
molecules, namely antibiotics, 3 antimitotics, 4 and (bio)-
herbicides,5 as well as chiral building blocks for the production
of active ingredients, e.g. α-amino- γ-butyrolactones,
4,5-dihydroxynorvaline, and 4-hydroxypyroglutamic acid and
derivatives (Figure 1).
2b,d,6
Therefore, substantial research eﬀorts have been devoted to
their synthesis using multistep catalytic or stoichiometric
chemical approaches (Figure 2).
1a,2g,7 Biocatalytic access to
these compounds is regarded as a powerful strategy because of
their simplicity and stereoselectivity starting from simple
achiral materials (Figure 2).
2c,e,8
In this sense, the sequential combination of carboligases and
transaminases in one-pot one-step or one-pot two-step
reactions with or without substrate recycling o ﬀers broad
synthetic possibilities. Using this route, chiral
L-a n d
D-homoserine, D-anti-dihydroxynorvaline, 4-hydroxyisoleucine,
norpseudoephedrine, and norephedrine were prepared.2e,8b,e,9
However, the number of examples is scarce and, although they
represent a remarkable achievement, they are often limited by
the poor stereoselectivity pro ﬁle of pyruvate aldolases as
catalysts to generate the corresponding 4-hydroxy-2-oxo acid
precursors or the lack of transaminase selectivity toward the
aldol adduct.
Herein, we report three strategies for the biocatalytic
diastereoselective synthesis of γ-hydroxy-α-amino acids by
combining an enantioselective pyruvate-aldolase and
S-selective transaminases,
8b starting from pyruvate and diverse
aldehyde substrates.

metabolic degradative pathway of naphthalene and naphtha-
lenesulfonates.10 In vivo, HBPA catalyzes the reversible aldol
condensation of pyruvate to salicylaldehyde in two steps: an
aldol addition and a subsequent dehydration, both steps being
catalyzed by the enzyme. Interestingly, it has been reported
that HBPA catalyzes the aldol addition ofﬂuoropyruvate to
aromatic aldehydes with high stereoselectivity, in which the
dehydration products were not detected, likely because the
ﬂuorine atom precludes the dehydration step by the enzyme.
11
We envisioned that HBPA could catalyze aldol additions of
pyruvate to nonaromatic ele ctrophiles, in which the
dehydration activity could be largely minimized or even
suppressed, rendering aldol adducts with high enantioselectiv-
ity. We assayed various nonaromatic electrophiles ( 1a−s;
Scheme 1) as substrates of HBPA in the aldol addition of
pyruvate.
Good to excellent conversions to 4-hydroxy-2-oxo acids3
(70−95%) were achieved for most of the electrophiles,
indicating an excellent structural substrate tolerance of
HBPA (Scheme 2). A single residue mutation, the HBPA
H205A variant, greatly improved the catalyst eﬃciency toward
1c,k,o, yielding 3c,k,o, respectively, in 66−75% conversion.
Molecular models of the complex of pyruvate-enamine-
bound HBPA with aldehydes 1c,o suggest that the H205A
mutation generates a new cavity in the HBPA active site, which
reduces the steric hindrance. This cavity can be occupied by
the phenyl moiety of the incoming aldehyde (Figure 3 and
Figure S93), thus facilitating the interactions with residues
Trp224 and Phe269. Moreover, an analysis of the HBPA
structure shows that the carboxylic groups of Glu206, Asp207,
Asp208, and Asp265 are within 5 Å of theδ and ε-N atoms of
the imidazole group of His205, stabilizing its protonated state

(Figure 4). This positive charge is also stabilized by aπ-cation
interaction with the aromatic moiety of Trp224. Therefore,
removal of this protonated imidazole, which is∼8 Å from the
ε-amino group of the essential Lys183, by the H205A mutation
modiﬁes the electrostatic environment of the active site, which
could also contribute to the enhanced activity of this mutant
toward the selected substrates.
Enantiomeric ratios were determined by HPLC on a chiral
stationary phase after transforming the aldol adducts3 into
3-hydroxy ester derivatives 4 (Scheme 2 and Figures S74−
S85). The corresponding authentic racemic samples were
produced by employing 2-oxo-3-deoxy-L-rhamnonate aldolase
(YfaU), which yielded aldol adducts3 as racemic mixtures with
the selected electrophiles (see the Supporting Information).
Excellent levels of enantioselectivity were achieved for3a,f−h
(96−90% ee), while they were good to moderate for3b,e,i,j
(88−8 0 %e e ) .T h i si ss i g n iﬁcant considering the low
stereoselective proﬁle of wild-type pyruvate aldolases toward
low-molecular-weight electrophiles.12 Low enantioselectivy was
attained with the methoxy derivative 3d (42% ee), whereas
racemates were obtained with phenylacetaldehyde (3l) and
3-(benzyloxy)propanal (3m). Cbz-, Boc-, and Ts-protected
aminoethanal compounds 1p ,r,s, respectively, and
(S)-Cbz-2-aminopropanal (1q) were not converted. Thus,
PhAc was the amino protecting group of choice for
aminoaldehydes in the planned HBPA catalysis. Interestingly,
PheAc has the advantage that it can be removed by penicillin G
acylase, a mild and orthogonal protection compatible with
most common amino masking groups.
13
Single-crystal X-ray diﬀraction studies of compounds4e,f,j
indicate that HBPA renders aldol adducts having an R
conﬁguration as the major products ( Figure 5 ). This is
consistent with the reported stereochemical outcome of the
reactions between ﬂuoropyruvate and (hetero)aromatic
aldehydes.
11 Therefore, an R conﬁguration may safely be
assumed for the major enantiomers of3a−k (Scheme 2).
Molecular models of the complexes of HBPA were obtained
with (i) the covalently bound pyruvate enamine and the
electrophile molecules (Figures S88−S93) and (ii) the imines
derived from the aldol adducts ( Figures S94−S99). These
models suggest that there is no steric restriction to there-o rsi-
face approach of the electrophile to the enamine. Thus, it is not
clear why there is a preference for there-face approach, which
would generate theR-aldol adducts as major products of the
reaction. A more in depth theoretical study would be required
to determine the source of this preference; however, this is
beyond the scope of this paper.

with good conversions and enantioselectivities by HBPA
catalysis (Figures S8−S12). We used L-Ala (5) as an amino
donor in a one-pot two-step reaction sequence (Scheme 3).
Thus, for the screening, the enzymatic aldol addition was run
ﬁrst and, once the formation of3 reached a maximum,
L-Ala
(5) (500 mM, ≥ 10 equiv with respect to 3) and the
transaminase (T###) were added, allowing the reaction to
proceed for 24 h. Since unpuri ﬁed aldol adducts 3 were
supplied for the screening reactions, HPLC analysis was the
method of choice to detect false positives caused by
transamination of the remai ning unreacted aldehyde 1.
Compounds 6b,e, bearing aromatic moieties, were directly
detected by HPLC. The percentages of 6a,g,h formed were
estimated by measuring the consumption of3a,g,h by HPLC,
after precolumn derivatization of the carbonyl group via oxime
formation (see theSupporting Information).
Roughly, 4 out of the 50 di ﬀerent transaminases were
selected as promising candidates for the transamination
reaction ( Figures S8 −S12). For scale-up experiments, we
capitalize on a strategy developed by our group consisting of a
one-pot reaction recycling of pyruvate 2, formed in the
transamination reaction, into the aldol reaction (Scheme 4).
8b
This approach e ﬀectively shifts the equilibrium of the
transamination to the product, since the pyruvate is
continuously removed by the aldol reaction.

detailed in theSupporting Information.

To successfully perform this strategy, the transamination of
the aldehydes 1 must be largely avoided or minimized. To
evaluate the degree of conversion for each aldehyde and
establish suitable reaction conditions for the one-pot cascade
process, we ran control experiments incubating aldehydes
1a,b,e,g,h (100 mM) with selected transaminases ( Figures
S13−S18). Having established the suitable conditions, we
started testing a range of starting pyruvate (2) concentrations
between 5 and 100 mM, against 100 mM of
L-Ala. Using 1g
(100 mM) as the electrophile and HBPA/T039 catalysts, 42
mM of 6g (42% yield) was formed at 5 mM pyruvate
concentration, indicating pyruvate recycling (Figure 6A and
Figure S21). At 50 mM of pyruvate,6g reached a maximum
(55 mM, 55% yield), with no e ﬀective pyruvate recycling.
Further increasing the initial pyruvate concentration (i.e., up to
100 mM) caused an increase in 3g production, but 6g
decreased, likely due to an equilibrium limitation of the
transamination. Using 1a (200 mM) and HBPA/T039, the
best initial pyruvate concentration was 100 mM (Figure 6B
and Figure S19). Under these conditions, 47 mM of6a (47%
yield, with respect to the limiting substrate5) was formed, but
no pyruvate recycling occurred. Aldol adduct 3a was most
probably in an equilibrium between the cyclic hemiketal and
the acyclic form. It is likely that the hemiketal was not a
substrate for the transaminase and its activity was limited by
the actual concentration of the acyclic adduct. Disappointingly,
this strategy failed to produce the corresponding
γ-hydroxy-α-amino acid derivatives 6 for the rest of the
aldehydes with the selected transaminases and aldol adducts3
were the only species detected (see Figure S20 for an
example).
One problem that jeopardizes the pyruvate recycling strategy
was that the aldolase and transaminase were not suﬃciently
active toward the aldehyde and aldol adduct, respectively, in
comparison with the system reported by us for the synthesis of
homoserine.
8b This makes a rapid conversion diﬃcult for both
the initial pyruvate and the aldol adduct formed, compromising
the eﬃciency of the recycling process. Therefore, the one-pot
two-step reaction sequence appears to be the most convenient
route in dealing with aldolases and/or transaminases with
kinetic and thermodynamic limitations. In this case, however,
an eﬀective method to overcome the equilibrium limitations of
the transaminase must be implemented.
Synthesis of γ-Hydroxy-α-amino Acid Derivatives
Using a Biocatalytic One-Pot Two-Step Approach
Using Benzylamine as an Amine Donor.Another strategy
was devised for the synthesis of the selected targetγ-hydroxy-
α-amino acid derivatives using benzylamine ( 7)a sa n
alternative amine donor (Scheme 5). The eﬀective shift of
the equilibrium of the transamination was accomplished by
converting the benzaldehyde (8) formed into benzoin (9)b y
benzaldehyde lyase from Pseudomonas ﬂuorescens Biovar I
(BAL) ( Scheme 5 ). BAL is highly selective toward
benzaldehyde, ensuring an almost quantitative conversion

into the mostly insoluble benzoin, which beneﬁts the reaction
equilibrium.14 Benzylamine has been reported to be a suitable
amine donor, and di ﬀerent strategies to eliminate the
benzaldehyde were proposed: e.g. conversion into benzoic
acid under 1 atm of oxygen,15 extraction with hexane in an
aqueous−organic two-phase system,16 and reduction to benzyl
alcohol during a cascade synthesis ofω-amino fatty acids and
α,ω-diamines from ω-hydroxy fatty acids and α,ω-diols,
respectively.17
For this strategy, an extended panel of 194 transaminases
from Prozomix Ltd. was screened in a one-pot two-step
sequence (Figure S22 and Table S7) using the crude reaction
products of adducts3a,b,e,g,h as starting materials.
Next, we rescreened 27 positive hits from theﬁrst screening
in the two-step sequence, removing the HBPA before starting
the transamination reaction aldolase to avoid retroaldolysis
(see the Supporting Information). In this case, the aldol
adducts 3, products 6, benzaldehyde (8), and benzoin (9)
were analyzed and quantiﬁed by HPLC. Only transaminase
T039 was able to convert the aldol adducts3a,b,e,g into the
corresponding products 6 (Figure S24). The reaction with
aldehyde 1h resulted in a false positive, because no product
could be detected in scale-up experiments.
The same two-step reaction sequence was then repeated
with and without removing HBPA, using T039 and including
aldehydes 1i,j (Figure 7A). The HBPA did not aﬀect the yield
of 6a,g,i,j, indicating that T039 was rather selective toward the
corresponding aldol adducts and that no retroaldolysis was
taking place. On the other hand, elimination of HBPA
beneﬁted 6b,e in comparison with those products without
aromatic substituents. Next, we investigated the eﬀect of BAL
on the yield of6a,g,i,j (Figure 7B). The addition of BAL was
largely positive for 6a,i and less so for 6g,j
. Overall, this
depends on each individual case and should be considered for
establishing the optimal operational conditions. Moreover, no
aldol condensation of pyruvate to benzaldehyde catalyzed by
HBPA was detected.
The low conversion of aldol adducts with aromatic
substituents, 3b,e, and the need for a highly selective
transaminase for the 4-hydroxy-2-oxo acids3 prompted us to

α-amino acid aminotransferases (BCATs).18
Synthesis of γ-Hydroxy-α-amino acid Derivatives
Using a Biocatalytic One-Pot Two-Step Approach with
the PLP-Dependent Branched-Chain Amino Acid Ami-
notransferase (BCAT) from E. coli . The branched-chain
α-amino acid aminotransferase (BCAT) from E. coli was
selected to convert3 into 6, employing
L-Glu (10) as an amine
donor and delivering 2-oxoglutarate (11), which is a strong
inhibitor of BCAT (e.g., 10 mM of11 reduces the activity up
to 80%).19 Thus, the regeneration ofL-Glu was needed, which
was accomplished by coupling with aspartate aminotransferase
(AspAT) from E. coli that employed L-Asp ( 12) as the
substrate ( Scheme 6 ). The resulting oxaloacetate 13
spontaneously decomposes into CO2 and pyruvate, shifting
the transamination equilibrium to the formation ofγ-hydroxy-
α-amino acids 6.
The reaction system worked successfully with the aldol
adducts 3, with better performances for some examples in
comparison to those with the benzylamine/T039 system
(Scheme 7). For instance, this reaction system converted the
aldol adduct 3k, which was not a substrate for T039 (Scheme
8). On the other hand, benzylamine/T039 aﬀorded product
6n, whereas its precursor3n was not converted by the BCAT/
AspAT system. Therefore, both methodologies are somehow
complementary. Despite the fact that pyruvate is released
because of the decarboxylation of oxaloacetate13, attempts to
run the reaction with one-pot pyruvate recycling failed to
provide the correspondingγ-hydroxy-α-amino acids 6 (Figure
S25).
Finally, for the laboratory-scale preparation of
γ-hydroxy-α-amino acids 6 we chose a system with better
performance for conversion, isolation, and product puriﬁca-
tion. Products 6 were converted into the corresponding
Cbz- N
α-γ-butyrolactone derivatives 14 (Scheme 7 ).
α-Amino-γ-butyrolactones are structural motifs found in
biologically active compounds in addition to being valuable
chiral intermediates for the synthesis of pharmaceutical
agents.
6a,20 The optimal lactonization conditions were
established, and particular attention was paid to avoid eroding
the enantiopurity of 14 (Table S7). The R conﬁguration for
aldol adducts 3b,c,e−g,i (Scheme 2) and theS conﬁguration
generated by the transaminases 8b,19c aﬀorded the expected
2S,4R-conﬁgured hydroxy amino acid derivatives6, which were
conﬁrmed by a NMR diastereochemical analysis of products
14. Exceptions were the products6n,o. In this case, the aldol
addition reaction was not stereoselective, yielding a mixture of
diastereoisomers (5R/5S)-14n and (5R/5S)-14o, respectively.
Interestingly, the enzymatic transamination reaction of aldol
adducts 3k , h led to the formation of
(2S,4R)-(−)-trans-4-hydroxyproline (15k)( Scheme 8 A) and
γ-hydroxypyroglutamic acid (15h)( Scheme 8B), respectively.
The ﬁrst product could be formed by an intramolecular
nucleophilic substitution of the terminal Cl at C5 by the amine
group after the transamination reaction.

The γ-hydroxypyroglutamic acid 15h was probably formed
by intramolecular aminolysis of the ethyl ester group during
the attempts to protect the amino group by Cbz. The basic
conditions necessary to conduct the reaction with CbzOSu
likely favored the reaction (Scheme 8 B). On the other hand,
the corresponding isopropyl ester derivative of
Cbz-N
α-γ-butyrolactone 14i could be isolated, most likely
due to the steric hindrance imposed by the isopropyl group,
which precluded an intramolecular aminolysis.
Deprotection of the Cbz group of butyrolactones 14 was
accomplished by catalytic hydrogenolysis with H
2 in the
presence of Pd/C, while PheAc was removed by enzymatic
hydrolysis mediated by penicillin G acylase (PGA) (Scheme
9). Hydrogenolysis of (5 R/5S)-14n and (5 R/5S)-14o
furnished the lactones (5R/5S)-17n and (5R/5S)-17o, which
upon treatment with PGA and puriﬁcation by cation exchange
chromatography, with NH
4OH as eluent, led to the
corresponding amide derivatives (4 R/4S)-18n and carbox-
ylates (4R/4S)-18o.
■ CONCLUSIONS
A tandem enantioselective aldol addition −transamination
approach was established for the production of chiral
γ-hydroxy-α-amino acids. The trans-o-hydroxybenzylidene
pyruvate hydratase-aldolase a ﬀorded chiral 4-hydroxy-2-oxo
acids with a remarkable eﬃciency, broad substrate tolerance,
and unparalleled stereoselectivity, far beyond those of the
pyruvate aldolases hitherto reported. Thus, the HBPA/
benzylamine/T039 and HBPA/Glu/BCAT/AspAT systems
are adequate complementary approaches for the asymmetric
synthesis of chiral γ-hydroxy-α-amino acids 6. Overall, the
HBPA/Glu/BCAT/AspAT system renders, in some instances,
better results mainly due to the selectivity of the
α-transaminase BCAT for the 2-oxo acids and its inability to
catalyze the transamination of the remaining aldehyde from the
aldol addition. Moreover, the reaction can be carried out in
whole cells. The HBPA/benzylamine/T039 system is more
unspeciﬁc, allowing the conversion of various structurally
diﬀerent substrates, such as that of the aldehydes 1 into
primary amines. The HBPA/
L-Ala/T039 approach with
pyruvate recycling is not straightforward and needs an
optimization of the activities of the aldolase and transaminase
involved to develop an eﬀective process.
Using the strategy developed in this work, an unprecedented
number of chiralγ-hydroxy-α-amino acids and the correspond-
ing α-amino-γ-butyrolactones were constructed in two steps
with high stereoselectivity from small functionalized aldehydes.
