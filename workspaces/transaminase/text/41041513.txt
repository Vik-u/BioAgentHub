ABSTRACT: The increasing demand for furfurylamine (FA), a versatile biobased
building block, necessitates the development of efficient and sustainable production
processes. This study presents a continuous biocatalytic process for the amination of
furfural (FUR) to FA, aligning with green chemistry principles and circular economy
strategies. A systematic screening of ω-transaminases (ω-TAs) and amine donors
identified N-His
6
-ATA-wt and (S)-(−)-α-methylbenzylamine as the optimal pair,
achieving a 96% FA gross yield within 30 min at equimolar substrate concentrations,
surpassing previously reported ω-TA-based FA productions. To enable biocatalyst
long-term use in continuous processes, the enzyme was covalently immobilized on
synthesized and functionalized magnetite nanoparticles (MNPs) using glutaraldehyde (GA) as a cross-linker. At optimized
immobilization conditions, 92.8% recovered activity was achieved with 80 mg enzyme/g dry MNPs and 2% (v/v) GA in a batch
process. The immobilized biocatalyst was integrated into a custom 3D-printed magnetic field-assisted microreactor and evaluated in
continuous-flow operation for 18 days. The system reached a maximum space-time yield of 1.07 g/(L h) and a total turnover
number of 2.04 × 10
7
. These results, along with favorable green chemistry metrics, highlight the potential of this integrated
approach�combining enzyme engineering, nanomaterials, and flow technology�for scalable and sustainable FA production.

INTRODUCTION
Furfurylamine (FA) has attracted considerable attention due to
its numerous current and potential industrial applications, e.g.,
as an intermediate in the production of pharmaceutical
compounds such as antiseptics, antihypertensives, and
diuretics.
1
Selective reductive amination of furfural (FUR) is
a reliable process to produce FA, in which FUR and ammonia
are mixed with poly(N-vinyl-2-pyrrolidone)-capped Ru-sup-
ported hydroxyapatite (Ru-PVP/HAP) and H
2
(≥2.5 bar).
However, the conventional approach for this synthetic reaction
has some drawbacks. The reductive conditions pose a
challenge as they render the furan ring sensitive, leading to
the formation of undesired byproducts, often in the form of
secondary or tertiary amines. The environmental footprint of
this traditional synthesis is further exacerbated by the use of
reducing agents, the generation of byproducts, and the high
energy consumption.
1,2
To overcome these drawbacks,
considerable efforts have been devoted to developing a more
environmentally friendly process for the production of organic
amines. In particular, the establishment of a biocatalytic route
using ω-transaminases (ω-TAs) is very promising in this
context.
3−7
ω-TAs have also attracted attention for the amination of
FUR and its analogs.
1,7,8
Among the amine donors for ω-TA-
catalyzed reactions, isopropylamine (IPA) is preferred in
industry because it is inexpensive, is achiral, and generates
acetone as a byproduct that can be easily removed from the
reaction due to its low boiling point.
9
D - or L -Alanine as amine
donors are also used, but are expensive,
7
while methylbenzyl-
amine is cheap and often used to produce pure enantiomers.
10
However, for all the biocatalyzed FUR aminations listed above,
a large excess of amine donors limits the practical application
of such production processes.
Microreactors offer a transformative approach to bioprocess-
ing by overcoming the challenges associated with traditional
batch processes. Their small scale and large surface area-to-
volume ratio allow precise control of reaction parameters, such
as temperature, pressure, and flow rates, resulting in improved
reaction efficiency and product yield. The continuous flow of
microreactors facilitates real-time process monitoring and
control, reducing the risk of side reactions and improving
product quality. All this makes the microreactor ideal for
complex biochemical conversions, especially in pharmaceutical

and fine chemical synthesis, where precision and efficiency are
crucial.

Their miniaturized design reduces the consumption
of reagents and solvents, resulting in less waste generation and
lower energy requirements, in line with the principles of green
chemistry. In addition, the scalability of microreactor systems
by numbering up enables a seamless transition from laboratory
scale to industrial applications, bridging the gap between
research and commercialization.
12
Enzyme immobilization is an important strategy in
biocatalysis, allowing for improved enzyme stability, reus-
ability, and operational control. Immobilization of enzymes on
a solid support minimizes enzyme loss during reactions and
enables continuous processing. This approach increases the
enzymes’ resistance to denaturation and harsh operating
conditions and is therefore essential for biotechnological
processes in the fields of pharmaceuticals, fine chemicals, and
biofuels.
13
Immobilization of enzymes on magnetite (Fe
3
O
4
)
nanoparticles (MNPs) offers unique advantages due to the
large surface area of nanoparticles, their biocompatibility, and
their magnetic properties. These features facilitate efficient
enzyme loading, increase catalytic activity, and allow easy
separation from reaction mixtures by external magnetic fields.
Additionally, MNPs provide a versatile platform for function-
alization, enabling tailored interactions between the enzyme
and the support, which further improves the stability and
activity of enzyme. This method is particularly valuable in
continuous-flow systems, where the rapid separation and reuse
of enzymes significantly reduce operating costs and waste
generation.
14−16
Efficient enzyme immobilization, along with continuous
operation and process miniaturization, paves the way for the
intensification of biocatalytic processes.
11
This concept refers
to a suite of technologies that replace large, energy-intensive,
and costly equipment with smaller, more efficient, and cost-
effective alternatives or that integrate multiple operations into
a single device or streamlined process.
17
In this context,
enzyme immobilization holds strong potential to promote the
broader industrial adoption of biocatalysis by enhancing
catalyst stability, reusability, and compatibility with continuous
processes.
18,19
The primary objective of this work was to identify the
optimal combination of ω-TA and amine donor for the
efficient synthesis of FA, targeting the lowest feasible amine
donor-to-acceptor ratio. To support the development of a
continuous, intensified, and sustainable process, an efficient
enzyme immobilization strategy was established, and a novel
3D-printed microreactor was designed and fabricated. A
systematic screening of various ω-TAs and amine donors,
namely, IPA, D -alanine (ALA), and (S)-(−)-α-methylbenzyl-
amine (MBA), was conducted for the transamination of FUR
to FA. The effects of enzyme concentration and amine donor-
to-acceptor molar ratio on FA production were thoroughly
investigated. Key green chemistry metrics, such as atom
economy, excess reactant factor, reaction mass efficiency, and
amine donor cost per reaction, were assessed and compared
with literature values to evaluate process economics and
environmental performance. Enzyme immobilization on
synthesized and surface-functionalized MNPs was optimized
regarding the cross-linker (GA) concentration. The trans-
amination reaction system was then implemented in the 3D-
printed microreactor, and the operational stability of the
immobilized biocatalyst was assessed under continuous-flow
operation.

(GA), (3-aminopropyl)triethoxysilane (APTES), hydrochloric acid
35%, imidazole, and materials for preparing Luria−Bertani (LB)
medium were all purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, Missouri,
USA). Disodium hydrogen phosphate dihydrate, isopropanol, and
sodium dihydrogen phosphate monohydrate were purchased from
Merck (Darmstadt, Germany). DpnI was purchased from Thermo
Fisher Scientific (Waltham, Massachusetts, USA). Isopropyl-β-
thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) was purchased from GoldBio (St.
Louis, Missouri, USA). A nickel-plated neodymium (NdFeB)
cylindrical magnet, grade N45 with axial magnetization, was
purchased from Svet Magnetov (Kamnik, Slovenia).
Biocatalysts. Three different ω-TAs were screened, namely, N-
His
6
-ATA-wt, pEG 97-TA(R)-AspTerr, and the mutated version pEG
97-TA(R)-AspTerr-T130M-E133F. N-His
6
-ATA-wt is a mutant of the
wild-type ω-TA (ATA-wt) with a hexahistidine tag (His
6
-tag) at the
N-terminus.
20
The original plasmid of ATA-wt was obtained from the
metagenomic library of c-LEcta GmbH (Leipzig, Germany) and
shows 92% identity with a potential protein from Pseudomonas
mandelii.
21,22
A plasmid for pEG 97-TA(R)-AspTerr, which is an ω-
TA from Aspergillus terreus with His
6
-tags at the C-terminus,
23−26
was
a generous gift from W. Kroutil (University of Graz). A version of the
latter, namely, pEG 97-TA(R)-AspTerr-T130M-E133F, was prepared
as described in the following section. All ω-TAs used were expressed
as soluble intracellular proteins in Escherichia coli BL21 (DE 3), as
described below.
Mutation of pEG 97-TA(R)-AspTerr. A variant of pEG 97-
TA(R)-AspTerr-T130M-E133F was prepared by changing threonine
at position 130 to methionine (T130M) and glutamic acid at position
133 to phenylalanine (E133F) as described by Di et al.
8
Mutations
T130M and E133F were introduced with PCR by amplifying the
plasmid pEG 97-TA(R)-AspTerr, bearing the wild-type transaminase
sequence, using primers, harboring the mutated nucleic acid
sequence: TA97-T130M-E133F−F (TGGCATGCGTCCGTTTGA-
TATTGTTAATAATCTGTATATGTTTGTGC) and TA97-
T130M-E133F-R (TATCAAACGGACGCATGCCACGAA-
CACCTTTCAG). Agarose gel electrophoresis was used to confirm
the correct size of the final product, which was then treated with DpnI
to degrade the template and transformed into chemically competent
E. coli DH5α cells with heat shock. The cells were plated on LB agar
plates with ampicillin and incubated overnight. Recombinant plasmids
were isolated from subsequent overnight cultures from single colonies.
The correct nucleic acid sequence with introduced mutations was
confirmed with Sanger sequencing (Eurofins Genomics, Ebersberg,
Germany).
Enzyme Expression, Cell Lysis, and Protein Purification.
Enzymes were expressed as soluble intracellular proteins in E. coli
BL21 (DE 3). Competent E. coli BL21 (DE 3) cells (100 μL) were
mixed with 2 μL of the plasmid for transformation and incubated on
ice for 30 min. The cells were heated at 42 °C for 45 s and then
incubated again on ice for another 2 min. LB medium (500 μL) was
added to the transformed cells and incubated at 37 °C in the shaker at
180 min
−1
for 1 h. After the transformation was done, 300 μL of the
transformed cells was transferred to 3 mL of LB medium containing
100 mg/L ampicillin for all three used enzymes and incubated at 37
°C in the shaker at 180 rpm overnight. The content was transferred to
the fresh LB medium with dissolved 100 mg/L ampicillin or 50 mg/L
kanamycin, depending on which plasmid was used, and incubated in a
shaker again until OD
600
using a UV−vis spectrophotometer (UV-
2600, Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan), reaching 0.6. IPTG was added to
reach a final concentration of 0.2 mM, and the enzyme expression
took place overnight in the thermostated shaker at 18 °C at 180
min

resuspended in 50 mM Tris−HCl buffer, pH 7.4, which contained 0.1
mM PLP and 5 mM imidazole. Cell lysis was acquired by three cycles
of sonication of harvested cells kept on the ice to prevent overheating,
followed by centrifugation at 20,000g and at 4 °C for 30 min.
For enzyme purifications, HisTrap FF (GE Healthcare, Danderyd,
Sweden) was used with loading, washing, and elution buffers; 50 mM
Tris−HCl with dissolved in 0.1 mM of PLP and 5, 30, and 250 mM
imidazole. The enzymes were further transferred to potassium
phosphate buffer (100 mM, pH 7.5) containing 0.1 mM PLP using
a centrifuge filter unit Amicon Ultra-4 with a nominal molecular
weight limit of 10,000 Da (Merck Millipore Ltd., Cork, Ireland). In
the final step, the purified enzymes were flash-frozen and kept at −20
°C until further usage.
Furfural Biotransformation and Evaluation of Enzyme-
Specific Activities. If not stated otherwise, batch experiments
were performed in closed test tubes containing 10 mM FUR, 10 mM
IPA/ALA/MBA as the amine donor, and 0.1 mg/mL purified enzyme.
All components were dissolved in potassium phosphate buffer (100
mM, pH 7.5). The reaction was carried out at 30 °C and stirred with a
magnetic stirrer at 300 rpm. The blank reaction was also carried out
under the same conditions, but without a biocatalyst. Samples were
removed after 5 min, the reaction was quenched by diluting 5-fold
with potassium phosphate buffer (100 mM, pH 7.5) prewarmed to
100 °C, and the mixture was heated at 100 °C for a further 5 min.
The solution was then analyzed as described below. The initial FUR
bioamination reaction rate (v
0
) was calculated from the linear part of
the curve showing molar FA concentrations over time. One unit (U)
was defined as the amount of enzyme catalyzing the conversion of 1
μmol of FUR per min.
The gross yield (eq 1) and the space−time yield (STY) (eq 2)
were calculated as follows:

In some batch biotransformations, the concentrations of IPA, ALA,
and MBA were increased to achieve the molar ratios with FUR
described in the Results and Discussion section, while all other
conditions remained unchanged.
The Influence of Enzyme Concentration on Furfurylamine
Synthesis. The experiments were performed in closed test tubes with
N-His
6
-ATA-wt and MBA as the amine donor, as described in the
previous section, with 10 mM FUR and equimolar MBA
concentration. The only change was the enzyme concentration (γ),
which varied from 0.1 to 0.5 mg/mL.
Enzyme Immobilization on Functionalized Magnetite
Nanoparticles. MNP Synthesis and In Situ Modification with
APTES. The protocol for the synthesis of MNPs and their
functionalization with APTES was adopted from Bo ̂ a Morte et al.

O were
dissolved in 200 mL of Milli-Q water in a flask under inert
atmosphere at 50 °C with constant stirring at 600 rpm for 5 min. 8 M
NaOH solution was added until the pH reached 10, and stirring was
continued for another 5 min. The temperature was then increased to
80 °C, and the pH was adjusted to 8 with a 4% (v/v) aqueous HCl
solution.
For in situ modification of MNPs, 88.5 μL of APTES was slowly
added to the reaction mixture under constant mixing at 500 rpm. The
mixture was stirred at 80 °C for 1 h to complete the surface
modification. The particles were washed with isopropanol, Milli-Q
water, and 100 mM sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7). After activation,
the modified nanoparticles (MNP-APTES) were dried in a vacuum
chamber to obtain 2.43 g of a dry powder.
Enzyme Immobilization on MNP-APTES via Glutaraldehyde. The
MNP-APTES particles were suspended in 100 mM sodium phosphate
buffer (pH 7) at a ratio 1:200 (w/v) and activated with GA at the
final concentration of 2% (v/v) in the buffer. The mixture was
incubated at 25 °C for 1 h. After activation with GA, the particles
were successively washed with isopropanol, Milli-Q water, and 100
mM sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7) and then dried in a vacuum
chamber to obtain the dry particles (MNP-APTES-GA). To
immobilize the enzyme, N-His
6
-ATA-wt (0.4 mg/mL, 1 mL) was
added to the MNP-APTES-GA particles in 100 mM sodium
phosphate buffer (pH 7), with enzyme amounts of 80−100−120
mg per gram of the dry activated MNPs, and incubated for 30 min.
The effects of GA concentration on the recovered enzyme activity and
immobilization yield were evaluated at 1, 2, and 3% (v/v) of GA and
at 80 mg of enzyme per gram of the dry activated MNPs. All other
conditions, including the volume of APTES added, the temperature
(25 °C), and the buffer (100 mM sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7),
were adopted from Bo ̂ a Morte et al.
29
These parameters were not
taken into consideration for optimization in the present study.
Determination of Enzyme Immobilization Yield and Recovered
Activity. The enzymatic activity of free and immobilized enzyme was
assessed by monitoring FUR bioamination to FA. Batch experiments
were performed in closed Eppendorf tubes, each containing 10 mM
MBA, 10 mM FUR, and N-His
6
-ATA-wt enzyme immobilized on
MNPs. All components were dissolved in 100 mM potassium
phosphate buffer (pH 7.5), and the total volume was 1.05 mL. The
reaction was carried out at 30 °C with stirring at 1500 rpm for 5 min
in a thermoblock and quenched as described above. The
immobilization yield was calculated using eq 3, and the recovered
activity was determined using eq 4:

The observed activity refers to the activity of the enzyme
immobilized on MNPs, while the offered activity corresponds to the
enzyme activity added to the tube. The unbound activity represents
the total enzyme activity that did not bind to the MNPs. This
unbound activity was measured by attaching magnets to the bottom
of the Eppendorf tube, allowing the MNPs to detach, and transferring
the supernatant to a new Eppendorf tube to measure the activity as
described above. All activities are expressed in units (U), where one U
is defined as the amount of enzyme catalyzing the conversion of 1
μmol FUR per min.
Microreactor Setup. The microreactor (Figure 1) was designed
using CAD software (Fusion 360, Autodesk, California, USA) and
microfabricated with an Asiga Pro 4K 45 3D printer (Asiga,
Alexandria, Australia). It was printed using FunToDo NanoClear
resin (3D Resine, Bruay-sur-l’Escaut, France), with printing
parameters set according to the resin manufacturer’s standard
recommendations. The microreactor consists of a coil structure
with a circular tube having an inner diameter of 0.8 mm wrapped
around a cylindrical nickel-plated neodymium permanent magnet
(diameter: 2.2 cm, height: 3 cm). The total tube length in the coil was
131.5 cm, resulting in a reactor volume of 661 μL. High-grade
polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) tubing with an inner diameter of 0.8
mm (Darwin Microfluidics, Paris, France) was used to connect the
syringe to the 3D-printed microreactor.
Enzyme Immobilization in a Microreactor. The MNP-APTES-
GA previously activated in the batch with 2% (v/v) GA were
introduced into the reactor in sodium phosphate buffer (100 mM, pH
7). The cylindrical permanent magnet was positioned in the opening
to keep the particles within the microreactor. Purified N-His
6
-ATA-wt
(661 μL, γ = 0.4 mg/mL) in 100 mM sodium phosphate buffer (pH
7) was pumped through the reactor at a flow rate of 5 μL/min using a
Harvard syringe pump (Holliston, Massachusetts, USA). After 132.2
min of enzyme introduction, the inlet was switched to a sodium
phosphate buffer (100 mM, pH 7), and an additional 661 μL of buffer

was passed through the system to wash unbound enzymes from the
MNPs.
The immobilization yield (eq 3) and recovered activity (eq 4) were
then determined as explained above. The enzyme load was calculated

Continuous Transamination in the Microreactor. An equimolar
concentration of FUR and MBA (10 mM) in potassium phosphate
buffer (100 mM, pH 7.5) was pumped with a syringe pump into a 3D-
printed reactor with enzyme immobilized on MNP-APTES-GA at
flow rates of 15 to 150 μL/min at room temperature. Once steady-
state conditions were reached, samples were taken from the reactor
outlet and analyzed by HPLC to determine the concentrations of
FUR, MBA, FA, and ACP. Following each run, the reactor was
cleaned by flushing with pure isopropanol at a flow rate of 25 μL/min
for 1 h using a syringe pump, followed by Milli-Q water using the
same conditions. The reactor was then dried with compressed air and
reloaded with fresh MNP-APTES-GAs for the subsequent run.
The operational stability of the microreactor system was evaluated
by performing continuous biotransformation over several days. The
reaction mixture, consisting of an equimolar concentration of FUR
and MBA without exogenously added PLP, was pumped through the
3D-printed microreactor at a flow rate of 15 μL/min using a syringe
pump. Samples were taken daily from the microreactor outlet and
analyzed by HPLC for substrate and product concentration
determination. Gross yield was calculated using eq 1, where the
FUR concentration in the inlet (c
inlet,FUR
) was used instead of c
0,FUR
.
STY was calculated using eq 2, replacing t with residence time (τ).
Operational stability was quantified using relative productivity
defined as the ratio of the observed STY on a given day to the initial
STY (eq 6):

STY was calculated according to eq 2, using the residence time (τ)
of 44.07 min, which was the highest τ tested.
The enzyme catalytic constant (k

constant (k

) were determined as described in the Supporting
Information (Figures S5 and S6). The total turnover number (TTN)
was calculated from estimated k

Enzyme leaching during the process was assessed by measuring the
enzyme activity in the outlet samples. Each sample was analyzed by
HPLC immediately after sampling and then reanalyzed after
incubation at room temperature for 2 h. An increase in product
concentration during this period would have indicated enzyme
leaching from the microreactor.
Green Chemistry Metrics and Reaction Economics. Several green
chemistry metrics and economic parameters were evaluated for the
reactions with various amine donors, including atom economy (eq 8),
excess reactant factor (eq 9), and the reaction mass efficiency (eq

To determine the economic efficiency of the FUR amination
reactions, the prices of the tested amine donors were sourced from the
catalog of Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany (Table S3).
Analysis. HPLC Analysis. HPLC analysis was employed to
quantify the concentrations of FUR, FA, MBA, and ACP in the
reaction and blank test mixtures. An HPLC system equipped with a
diode array detector (Shimadzu, Tokyo, Japan) and a Gemini-NX 3
μm C18 110 Å (150 × 4.60 mm) column (Phenomenex, Torrance,
USA) was used to separate and detect the compounds using the
isocratic methods described below. The method had a total run time
of 7.5 min at a flow rate of 0.8 mL/min.
The mobile phase consisted of acetonitrile and demineralized water
(pH adjusted to 11 with 100 mM NaOH) in a ratio of 40:60. The
HPLC column was thermostated at 30 °C. FA was monitored by
measuring absorbance at 217 nm, while all other compounds were
monitored at 250 nm. The retention times were as follows: 2.848 min
for FA, 3.364 min for FUR, 4.365 min for MBA, and 6.433 min for
ACP. The retention times for the Schiff bases formed were 4.852 min
for (S,E)-1-(furan-2-yl)-N-(1-phenylethyl)methanimine (Schiff base
1), 5.562 min for (E)-1-(furan-2-yl)-N-isopropylmethanimine (Schiff
base 2), 6.492 min for (R,E)-2-((furan-2-ylmethylene)amino)-
propanoic acid (Schiff base 3), and 6.524 min for (E)-1-(furan-2-
yl)-N-(furan-2-ylmethyl)methanimine (Schiff base 4).

H NMR Spectroscopic Analysis. An aliquot of 900 μL of the
reaction mixture, which was previously centrifuged, was diluted with
100 μL of D
2
O and analyzed by
1
H NMR spectroscopy (Bruker
Avance NEO 600 MHz instrument, Fa ̈llanden, Switzerland). The
relative distribution of the compounds in the reaction mixtures was
determined by integrating the representative resonances.
Transmission Electron Microscopy Analysis. For transmission
electron microscopy (TEM), the sample was suspended in Milli-Q
and homogenized in an ultrasonic bath. The sample was then applied
to a TEM grid and dried. The analysis was performed with a TEM
(Jeol 2100, Jeol Ltd.) coupled with an energy-dispersive X-ray
spectroscope (EDXS, JED 2300 EDS).
Vibrating-Sample Magnetometer Analysis. Magnetic character-
ization was carried out at room temperature using a vibrating-sample
magnetometer (VSM) (7307 VSM; Lake Shore Cryotronics,
Westerville, Ohio) with a maximum applied field of 10 kOe. All
measurements were performed in a continuous-loop mode.
Scanning Electron Microscopy Analysis. The sample with MNPs
was deposited onto a precoated track-etched membrane with a pore
size of 0.2 mm and subsequently dried. Imaging was performed using
an Apreo 2 field emission scanning electron microscope (SEM,
Thermo Scientific, Waltham, Massachusetts, USA). The analysis was
conducted at an accelerating voltage of 2 kV using the T2 Trinity
detection system.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Screening of Enzymes and Amine Donors for Furfural
Amination. The first objective of this research was to
determine the most cost-effective approach for FA production
by identifying the specific ω-TA that catalyzes the reaction of
FUR with the selected amine donor, and the minimum amine
donor-to-acceptor ratio. A preliminary enzyme screening of
three enzymes, namely, pEG 97-TA(R)-AspTerr, its variant
pEG 97-TA(R)-AspTerr-T130M-E133F, and N-His
6
-ATA-wt
at a concentration of γ = 0.1 mg/mL, and three amine donors,
namely, ALA, IPA, and MBA, was performed using amine
donors and acceptors at equimolar concentrations.
The results obtained with enzyme pEG 97-TA(R)-AspTerr
using various amine donors within 3 h were not promising. FA
formation was only observed when ALA was used, resulting in
3% FA gross yield with a FUR conversion of 18% (Figure 2a).
In contrast, no detectable amount of FA was observed when
IPA and MBA were used as amine donors, although FUR
conversions of 29 and 28%, respectively, were observed. In all
three cases, the conversion of FUR was significantly higher
than the corresponding FA gross yield. This can be attributed
to the formation of Schiff bases 1, 2, 3, and 4 (Figure S1).
When IPA, MBA, and ALA were used as amine donors with
the enzyme pEG 97-TA(R)-AspTerr, Schiff bases were formed
in all cases (Figure S2).
Since high amine donor-to-acceptor ratios in enzymatic
reactions are known to shift the reaction equilibrium toward
FA production,
1,8
molar ratios of 10:1 for IPA and 16:1 for
ALA were tested. This approach resulted in higher gross yields
of FA (Figure 2b) compared to the previously used equimolar
concentrations. When IPA was used in excess, the gross yield
reached 40% after 21 h, while the use of ALA at a molar ratio
of 16:1 resulted in a remarkable 55% FA gross yield, which is
the most favorable result in terms of the desired product gross
yield. Based on eq 2, the STY for the bioamination of FUR
using IPA was calculated to be 0.019 g/(L h), while with ALA
as an amine donor, it was 0.026 g/(L h). For both enzymatic
reactions, the presence of Schiff bases 2, 3, and 4 was
confirmed by HPLC (Figure S3). This indicates that the excess
amine donor in the reaction mixture with pEG 97-TA(R)-
AspTerr shifted the equilibrium toward FA formation but did
not prevent spontaneous reactions leading to the formation of
Schiff bases.
A 5:1 molar ratio of MBA to 10 mM FUR was also
evaluated. However, mixing MBA and FUR at these
concentrations in buffer resulted in turbidity, indicating limited
substrate solubility in aqueous media. This condition was
therefore excluded from further study. To address the same
challenge, Zhu et al.
7
employed a toluene/water biphasic
system to dissolve 200 mM FUR, while Di et al.
8
used a deep
eutectic solvent�specifically a choline chloride:malonic acid−
water system�to solubilize up to 500 mM FUR.
Subsequent studies focused on testing an engineered ω-TA.
Based on the report by Di et al.,
8
a variant pEG 97-TA(R)-
AspTerr-T130M-E133F was constructed to enhance activity
toward FUR. The enzyme was tested with all the amine donors
mentioned above. No formation of FA was observed with any
of the amine donors tested when used in an equimolar ratio
with FUR, but the formation of Schiff bases 1, 2, 3, and 4 was
observed by HPLC analysis (data not shown). When the
amine donor-to-acceptor molar ratios were increased to 10:1
for IPA or 16:1 for ALA, the FA gross yield reached only 1% in
24 h. Compared to the previous cases using the pEG 97-
TA(R)-AspTerr enzyme with higher ratios of amine donor to
acceptor, this variant did not show similar results and did not
shift the reaction equilibrium toward FA production. These
results indicate that both Aspergillus terreus-derived TAs are
ineffective for FA production at equimolar concentrations of
the tested amine donors and FUR. On the other hand, with
pEG 97-TA(R)-AspTerr, FA formation was observed only at
very high donor-to-acceptor ratios. These conditions were not
the focus of this study as the use of such an excess of reagents
in an industrial setting is hardly economically and environ-
mentally justifiable.
Finally, the enzyme N-His
6
-ATA-wt, an (S)-selective
tetrameric ω-TA from the metagenomic library,
21,22
was tested
with all three amine donors at equimolar concentrations with
FUR. When ALA was used as the amine donor, Schiff bases 3
and 4 formed without any trace of FA. With IPA as amine
donor, a low gross yield of 1% FA was observed, including the
formation of Schiff bases 2 and 4. However, using MBA as the
amine donor resulted in a significant 70% gross yield of FA
within only 3 h (Figure 3), corresponding to a STY of 0.23 g/
(L h). This result represents an 8.85-fold improvement
compared to the best result obtained with ALA.
The Effect of Enzyme Concentration on Furfural
Biotransformation. The results of enzyme concentration on
FA gross yield presented in Figure 4a show that when the
enzyme concentration was doubled to γ = 0.2 mg/mL, the
gross yield of FA reached 64% in only 50 min. In comparison,
this yield was achieved in the previous scenario with the same
enzyme at a concentration of 0.1 mg/mL within 3 h, which
represents a significant reduction in reaction time. The highest
gross yield of 96% was achieved with γ = 0.4 mg/mL at the end

different amine donors in molar ratios ALA:FUR = 16:1 and
IPA:FUR = 10:1. The error bars indicate the standard deviation of

of the reaction after 30 min (Figure 4b), with the
corresponding STY of 1.87 g/(L h), which is eight times
higher than the STY obtained with γ = 0.1 mg/mL.
Subsequent increases in the amount of enzyme added showed
no further improvements (Figure 4a). Additional confirmation
of the reaction’s success was provided by
1
H NMR
spectroscopy, which identified ACP and FA as the main
products, with only trace amounts of the starting materials,
namely, FUR and MBA. The corresponding
1
H NMR spectra
are available in the HYPERLINK data repository.
Characterization of Synthesized MNPs. The micro-
scopic TEM images revealed that the MNPs obtained are quite
polydisperse and have a spherical crystalline morphology
(Figure 5a). The core sizes range from 7.0 to 26.7 nm, with an
average size of 15.1 ± 3.9 nm. Some particle aggregation was
observed, partly due to the drying process of the sample prior
to deposition on the TEM grids. Additionally, the APTES
coating on the particle surface provides only moderate
stabilization, which also contributes to the observed
aggregation. Aggregation was also observed using scanning
electron microscopy (SEM), as shown in Figure 5b. Although
APTES helps to maintain a certain particle dispersion, its
stabilizing effect is not optimal. However, this coating is
necessary to enable the subsequent immobilization of the
enzymes.
The magnetic properties of the synthesized MNPs were
investigated using VSM at room temperature. Figure S4 shows
the magnetization curve as a function of the applied magnetic
field strength. The nanoparticles exhibit ferrimagnetic behav-
ior, as indicated by the hysteresis loop, with a maximum
saturation magnetization of 51.497 emu g
−1
, a coercivity of
54.240 Oe, and a remanent magnetization of 4.1372 emu g
−1
.
Enzyme Immobilization Optimization in the Batch
Process. The cross-linker concentration has a significant
impact on immobilization efficiency, but its optimal value
depends on the specific cross-linker, enzyme, and nanoparticle
surface�typically requiring empirical optimization. In this
study, GA was used as the cross-linker. GA reacts with primary
amine groups on both the nanoparticle surface and the lysine
residues of the enzyme, forming Schiff bases.
The effect of the GA concentration was investigated at a
fixed enzyme-to-activated MNP mass ratio, while all other
immobilization parameters (buffer, pH, and temperature) were
adopted from Bo ̂ a Morte et al.,
29
who successfully immobilized
Amano lipase AK from Pseudomonas fluorescens on function-
alized MNPs prepared using the same method applied in our
work.
Based on recovered activity and immobilization yield (Table
S1, Supporting Information), an enzyme loading of 80 mg per
gram of dry MNPs was selected for further evaluation of GA
concentration, tested at 1, 2, and 3% (v/v). As shown in Table

S2 (Supporting Information), the highest recovered activity
was achieved at 2% (v/v) GA, which also resulted in the
second-highest immobilization yield. Consequently, this
concentration was selected for enzyme immobilization in the
microreactor. This outcome is consistent with previous reports
indicating that insufficient GA can lead to poor immobilization
efficiency, whereas excessive GA may impair enzyme activity
and stability due to overcross-linking and conformational
rigidity.
Continuous Furfurylamine Production in a Micro-
reactor. The stability of a biocatalyst is crucial for its industrial
application, as it reduces process costs and minimizes
downtime associated with catalyst replacement. To evaluate
the stability of the enzyme and its operating time in a
microreactor system, a continuous bioamination of FUR at
room temperature without the addition of PLP was performed.
As previously described, the exogenous addition of PLP is not
necessary for N-His
6
-ATA-wt, as this tetrameric transaminase
forms a stable complex with PLP.
20−22,31
MNPs were first activated with 2% (v/v) GA in a beaker and
subsequently introduced into the microreactor. A cylindrical
permanent magnet was placed in designated slots of the reactor
to retain the particles in the microreactor via the magnetic
field. Subsequently, the enzyme solution in buffer was
introduced using a syringe pump. The resulting enzyme load
(eq 5) was 0.39 U/mL, with an immobilization yield of 65%
(eq 3) and a recovered activity of 60% (eq 4).
The lower immobilization yield compared to the batch
process is likely due to a reduced effective surface area of the
functionalized MNPs’ available for enzyme attachment within
the microreactor. Under the influence of the magnetic field, the
particles accumulated along the reactor wall adjacent to the
magnet, rendering the surface facing the magnet inaccessible
for immobilization. This uneven particle distribution ultimately
led to decreased enzyme loading and lower recovered activity
relative to the batch system.
The continuous reaction in a magnetic field-assisted
microreactor with N-His
6
-ATA-wt immobilized on function-
alized MNPs was monitored by analyzing the concentration of
FUR and FA at the reactor outlet at different flow rates and
thus residence times (τ). As can be seen in Figure 6a, longer
residence times resulted in significantly higher FA gross yields,
reaching over 80% at τ = 44 min.
Furthermore, the operational stability of the system was
evaluated over 18 days, and the results are shown in Figure 6b.
At the beginning of the continuous process, the STY was 1.07
g/(L h). Over time, a decrease in relative productivity (eq 6)
was observed, decreasing to 35% by day 18. Analysis of outlet
samples performed immediately after collection and after 2 h
of samples incubation at room temperature revealed no change
in product or substrate concentrations, indicating that the
enzyme remained stably immobilized within the microreactor
and did not leach from the reactor.
The observed decline in performance is therefore attributed
to enzyme deactivation over time, likely caused by
acetophenone�a known inhibitor of ω-TAs.
21,22
As aceto-
phenone exits only through the reactor outlet, the immobilized
enzyme is continuously exposed to it along the flow channel,
contributing to gradual loss of activity.
The kinetic parameter k
cat
was estimated from batch
experimental data fitted using a Ping-Pong Bi−Bi kinetic
model without inhibition and was found to be 13 s
−1
(see the
Supporting Information, Figure S5). Additionally, data from
the continuous process with immobilized N-His
6
-ATA-wt were
used to calculate the deactivation rate constant (k
d
) based on
the first-order deactivation kinetics (see the Supporting
Information, Figure S6), yielding a value of 0.0554 day
−1
and a corresponding enzyme half-life (t
1/2
) of 12.51 days. The
total turnover number (TTN) for FUR bioamination,
calculated according to eq 7, was 2.04 × 10
7
. Comparison
with the threshold TTN value considered commercially
relevant (>10
6
)
32
indicates strong commercial potential for
industrial application of this process.
To enhance the sustainability of the process, the micro-
reactor was reused across multiple cycles. After each run, the
reactor was cleaned with Milli-Q water and isopropanol and
then reloaded with fresh MNP-APTES-GAs. This approach
enables repeated use of the system, contributing to cost
reduction and improved process efficiency over time.
However, as previously discussed, substrate solubility
remains a considerable limitation as it was not possible to
dissolve 10 mM FUR and 50 mM MBA in the buffer system.
To address this challenge, an alternative solvent system is
required that enhances substrate solubility while preserving
sufficient enzyme activity. Consequently, our research will
focus on screening environmentally friendly (green) solvents
that improve substrate solubility and, in turn, increase the STY
of the process.
Green Chemistry Metrics and Amine Donor Price per
Reaction. The principles of green chemistry advocate
minimizing excess substrate to avoid waste production during
reactions. To identify the most environmentally friendly
(“greenest”) reaction among those reported in the liter-
ature
1,7,8
and our own proposed pathway using N-His
6
-ATA-
wt, we evaluated the cost of various amine donors required to
convert 10 mM FUR. For consistency, the comparison was

based on a uniform FUR concentration of 10 mM, applying
the amine donor:FUR ratios reported in each study, as
summarized in Table 1. In addition, atom economy, excess
reactant factor, and the reaction mass efficiency were calculated
based on the substrate concentrations listed in Table 1.
The cost of the amine donor was calculated assuming that a
single experiment is performed in a batch reaction setup with a
reactor volume of 5 mL and an initial FUR concentration of 10
mM. The use of ALA as an amine donor resulted in the highest
cost due to its high price and the significant excess required to
drive the reaction toward FA production. This increases costs
and raises environmental concerns due to the large amount of
amine donor required, which is reflected in the high excess
reactant factor compared to the other reactions. In contrast,
IPA was the most affordable amine donor, 106 times cheaper
than ALA,
8
even when used at a 10:1 ratio. However, the
excessive reactant factor for this reaction is 4.88 times higher
compared to our proposed reaction. In our proposed reaction,
MBA is used as an amine donor in equimolar concentrations
with FUR. Although our proposed reaction is slightly more
expensive�only 0.0022 € more than the cheapest alter-
native�it shows significant improvements in the excess
reactant factor, which was the lowest of all reactions
considered.
In terms of atom economy, it is important to emphasize that
the limitation of the formula is that it does not consider what
excess reactant was used and what yield was obtained in the
reaction. For example, comparing our proposed reaction with
that of Dunbabin et al.,
1
we use an equimolar MBA
concentration, whereas their ratio was 5:1. Despite this
difference, we obtained 16% higher FA yield, and according
to the formula, both reactions had the same atom economy
value (Table 1). In addition, our reaction had the lowest atom
economy value compared to reactions using an even higher
amine donor-to-acceptor ratio. When comparing our proposed
reaction to the reaction with the highest amine donor-to-
acceptor ratio, the atom economy improvement is almost 18%.
When considering the reaction mass efficiency, which takes
into account the reactant excess in the reaction and the mass of
the product obtained, our proposed pathway gives the highest
value compared to other proposed reactions. Compared to
other reactions (Table 1), it is 3.30 times more efficient than
when IPA was used,
1
7.31 times more efficient for ALA,
8
and
3.88 times more efficient when the MBA ratio is 5:1.
1
Considering both the economic and environmental impacts,
our proposed reaction with an equimolar concentration of
FUR and MBA appears to provide a balanced approach that
minimizes excess substrate consumption and associated waste
while maintaining cost efficiency.
■
CONCLUSIONS
In this study, a highly efficient and sustainable bioprocess for
the synthesis of FA from FUR by biocatalysis in a microfluidic
reactor was successfully developed. By screening different
enzymes and amine donors at different molar ratios with FUR,
a highly efficient biotransformation using N-His
6
-ATA-wt at a
concentration of 0.4 mg/mL and MBA as amine donor at
equimolar concentration with FUR was developed and an
impressive yield of 96% was achieved within only 30 min. This
approach eliminates the excessive need for amine donors
previously required for all reported FUR bioamination
reactions. This advancement not only lowers production
costs but also conforms to green chemistry principles by
minimizing waste generation.
Furthermore, the immobilization of the selected enzyme on
synthesized, characterized, and functionalized MNPs, and their
integration into a 3D-printed, magnetic field-assisted micro-
reactor, demonstrated great potential for continuous FA
production. The enzyme achieved a TTN of 2.04 × 10
7
,
underlining its promising suitability for industrial-scale
applications. This approach not only improves the efficiency
and cost-effectiveness of FA production but also supports
sustainable practices, reinforcing its potential for wider
implementation in green chemistry initiatives. To support
industrial implementation, future work will focus on optimizing
the reaction medium using green solvents to enable industrially
relevant substrate concentrations. In addition, model-based
microreactor optimization including enzyme loading will be
pursued to maximize process productivity.
