Abstract 
Serum activities of alanine- and aspartate aminotransferases (ALT and AST) are considered the “gold standard” biomarkers of 
hepatocyte injury in clinical practice and drug development. However, due to the expression of ALT and AST in myocytes, the 
diagnosis of hepatocellular injury in patients with underlying muscle diseases, including drug-induced muscle injury, is severely 
limited. Thus, we proposed glutamate dehydrogenase (GLDH) as a liver-specific alternative to serum ALT and AST. In fact, our 
exploratory studies showed that GLDH has comparable performance to ALT for detecting hepatocyte injury without interference 
from concomitant muscle injury. Here, we report the results of studies confirming the reference intervals in a healthy human 
population and the sensitivity and specificity of GLDH for the detection of hepatocyte injury in human subjects. In human subjects, 
we could not perform liver biopsies due to ethical reasons; we also confirmed the relationship of GLDH and histopathologic lesions 
using 32 model toxicants in rats. Furthermore, we have shown that injury to tissues that are known to express appreciable levels of 
GLDH does not affect serum GLDH measurements, indicating excellent liver specificity of serum GLDH. Finally, we observed faster 
elimination of GLDH than ALT in humans, indicating that decreasing GLDH values could be considered an early sign of recovery. This 
study provides comprehensive evidence of excellent sensitivity and liver specificity of GLDH for diagnosis of hepatocellular injury, 
including evaluation of reference intervals, which is essential for the interpretation of serum GLDH in human subjects.

Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase 
(AST) serum activities are considered the gold standard bio -
markers for diagnosis of hepatocellular injury in both clinical 
practice and drug development ( Amacher et al. 2013 ). As a conse -
quence of compromised cell membrane integrity upon hepato -
cyte injury, ALT and AST leak into systemic circulation where 
they are easily detected by their enzymatic activities ( Karmen 
et al. 1955 ). Due to the large functional reserve capacity of the 
liver, transaminase increases precede the functional changes 
that manifest as increased serum bilirubin and coagulation time. 
Thus, transaminases are especially important for the early diag -
nosis of hepatocellular injury before it has progressed to liver 
failure.
Although ALT and AST have proven to be sensitive markers of 
hepatocellular injury, both enzymes lack liver specificity. Large 
amounts of these enzymes are present in other tissues, with the 
highest extrahepatic expression in myocytes. Clinically, this 
severely limits the utility of ALT and AST as markers of 
hepatocellular injury in subjects with underlying chronic or 
acute muscle impairments, such as Duchenne muscular dystro -
phy, myositis, rhabdomyolysis, and drug-induced muscle injury 
( Schomaker et al. 2020 ). Persistent transaminasemia is fre -
quently misdiagnosed as hepatocellular injury in patients with 
such conditions, leading to additional unnecessary tests and 
causing delays in diagnosis and treatment of the neuromuscular 
disease ( Rutledge et al. 1985 ; Begum et al. 2000 ; Nathwani et al. 
2005 ). Similarly, the lack of liver specificity of ALT severely limits 
hepatocellular injury detection in subjects with underlying 
muscle impairments in clinical trials for new therapies to treat 
muscle disorders. Additionally, several widely used therapeutics, 
such as statins and fibrates, are known to cause muscle toxicity. 
When these drugs are taken concomitantly during clinical trials, 
the interpretation of increases in serum ALT, particularly those 
that are relatively small and transient, can be challenging. This 
can be complicated even further because significant increases in 
ALT and AST can occur even in healthy subjects after strenuous

exercise and changes in diet ( Apple and Rogers 1984 ; Purkins 
et al. 2004 ; Pettersson et al. 2008 ; Wei et al. 2019 ). Therefore, the 
development of liver-specific biomarkers of hepatocyte injury is 
an important unmet medical need.
Here, we propose the use of glutamate dehydrogenase (GLDH) 
as a liver-specific biomarker to rule out hepatocellular injury 
when ALT is elevated in the setting of neuromuscular disease or 
muscle damage. GLDH is a mitochondrial enzyme that plays a 
role in amino acid oxidation and urea production. It is primarily 
found in the liver, with only a trace amount in skeletal muscle 
( Mastorodemos et al. 2005 ). We and others have demonstrated 
that serum GLDH is a sensitive biomarker of hepatocyte injury in 
patients with a variety of liver diseases ( Schomaker et al. 2013 ), 
including hepatic ischemia ( Schmidt and Schmidt 1988 ; 
Kretzschmar et al. 2003 ), APAP overdose ( McGill et al. 2012 ; 
Schomaker et al. 2013 ; Antoine et al. 2014) , mild hepatocyte 
necrosis after treatment with heparin ( Harrill et al. 2012 ), and 
alcohol-induced injury ( Kravos and Male �si �c 2008 ; Kravos and 
Malesic 2010 ). Importantly, however, GLDH did not increase fol -
lowing muscle injury or degeneration or in response to strenuous 
exercise ( Thulin et al. 2014 ; Schomaker et al. 2020 ). These studies 
served as the foundation for initiating a formal biomarker qualifi -
cation at the FDA and EMA (https://www.fda.gov/drugs/bio -
marker-qualification-program/biomarker-qualification-submis -
sions).
In the present study, we set out to build on our prior results by 
establishing reference intervals in a healthy human population, 
and to determine the sensitivity and specificity of GLDH for hepa -
tocyte injury in human subjects with a variety of liver diseases. 
Since, in human subjects, we could not perform liver biopsies 
due to ethical reasons, we also confirmed the relationship 
between GLDH and hepatic histopathologic lesions in a series of 
studies in rats. To complete the assessment of liver specificity of 
serum GLDH, we then measured serum GLDH levels in patients 
with GI, pancreas, or kidney impairments, all known organs with 
appreciable GLDH expression. Finally, to facilitate interpretation 
of GLDH values, i.e. time course, we have assessed the elimina -
tion kinetics of GLDH. Overall, our study provides comprehensive 
evidence for the excellent sensitivity and liver specificity of 
GLDH for the diagnosis of hepatocellular injury in humans. We 
also provide general guidance for the interpretation of serum 
GLDH data ( Aithal et al. 2011 ; Schomaker et al. 2013 , 2020 ).
Materials and methods
Acquisition of samples from healthy subjects
Blood samples from 125 healthy subjects were collected from the 
University of Michigan health care system (UM) under an 
approved IRB (HUM0044422). Researchers did not have access to 
any potentially identifying personal information. The University 
of Michigan IRB committee waived the requirement for informed 
consent for this sample-set collection, for current and future 
unspecified project usage. Samples were defined as healthy 
based on normal levels of ALT, AST, alkaline phosphatase (ALP), 
total bilirubin (TBil), glucose, blood urea nitrogen, serum creati -
nine, and creatinine kinase (CK). Subjects whose values for one 
or more of the above endpoints exceeded the normal reference 
range were not used in this study. In addition, any healthy sub -
ject that had an ongoing health problem or immunological flare 
was omitted from the cohort. Most samples were collected from 
subjects who were at the University of Michigan for routine 
health examinations.
All samples in study HUM0044422 were collected between July 
12, 2013 and April 2, 2019.
Acquisition of samples from subjects with liver, 
muscle, kidney, pancreas, or GI injury
Blood samples from subjects with liver, muscle, kidney, pan -
creas, or GI injury were collected from the University of Michigan 
health care system (UM) under an approved IRB (HUM0044422). 
Researchers did not have access to any potentially identifying 
personal information. Dr K. Johnson and Dr R. Warner provided 
medical adjudication of subjects from UM and had access to 
medical records as required by UM. The University of Michigan 
IRB committee waived the requirement for informed consent for 
this sample-set collection, for current and future unspecified 
project usage. Samples for hepatocellular injury featured abnor -
mal hepatic enzyme profiles such as AST and ALT levels greater 
than 2 times normal healthy levels and with a diagnosed disease 
resulting in impaired liver function were grouped and loosely 
categorized as liver transplant (liver transplant within the last 
3 yr), hepatic carcinoma (diagnosed by biopsy or resection), coro -
nary artery disease–coronary heart disease (aortic aneurism, 
myocarditis, atrial mass, aortic valve replacement, or heart cath -
eterization), cirrhosis and hepatocellular injury (Hepatitis B or C, 
hepatic graft vs host disease, ethanol cirrhosis, drug abuse, or 
transaminitis/hepatic congestion), pulmonary (Influenza A, 
H1N1 Influenza, acute respiratory distress syndrome, or latent 
tuberculosis), and acetaminophen toxicity (APAP-induced liver 
failure). Samples classified as muscle injury featured abnormal 
CK enzyme activity levels or clinically demonstrable muscle 
injury as assessed by medical adjudication. Clinically determined 
injuries could include, but were not limited to, primary disorders 
of muscle (dystrophies, myotonic disorders, congenital myopa -
thies, and mitochondrial myopathies) and toxic myopathies 
(drug, alcohol, and toxicants), as exhibited by myositis (inflam -
matory muscle injury), neurogenic atrophy, necrotizing inflam -
matory muscle injury, chronic severe atrophy, angulated 
atrophic fibers, type II-fiber atrophy, nuclear myobags, denerva -
tion atrophy, and/or increased lipids in myofibers. Additional 
comorbidities were often present. Samples from patients with 
hepatocellular injury were excluded from this analysis because 
GLDH would be expected to be elevated in these subjects due to 
hepatocellular injury. For the specificity analysis (muscle, kid -
ney, pancreas, or GI injury studies), subjects with hepatocellular 
injury based on the clinical chemistry criteria (>5× ALT or >2× 
ALP or [>3× ALT and >2× Tbil]) or evidence of hepatocellular 
injury in the medical records were excluded.
Patients classified as having kidney injury were medically adju -
dicated as having chronic kidney disease (CKD) diagnosed by either 
(i) Biopsy-Proven or (ii) Clinically Demonstrable Deficiencies, which 
could include, but are not limited to, Diabetes, High Blood Pressure, 
Glomerulonephritis, Interstitial Nephritis, Polycystic Kidney 
Disease, and Malformations, as exhibited by CKD stage II–V, 
end-stage renal disease and patients on dialysis.
Patients with pancreatic injury were medically adjudicated 
as having pancreatitis (Acute, Chronic, Hereditary) that is diag -
nosed by either (i) Persistent Severe Epigastric Pain, (ii) Diagnostic 
Armamentarium (Endoscopic Ultrasound, Magnetic Resonance 
Cholangiopancreatography, Computerized Tomography, or 
Transabdominal ultrasound), (iii) Clinically Demonstrable 
Deficiencies, or (iv) Amylase or Lipase 3X upper limit of normal 
(ULN).
Patients with gastrointestinal injuries were medically adjudi -
cated as having gastrointestinal abnormalities diagnosed by 
172 | Aubrecht et al.  
either (i) Endoscopy, (ii) Sigmoidoscopy or (iii) Colonoscopy, or (iv) 
Clinically Demonstrable Deficiencies, which could include, but 
are not limited to, Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease, Esophagitis, 
Irritable Bowel Syndrome, Celiac Disease, Crohn’s Disease, 
Ulcerative Colitis, Ulcerative Pancolitis, Ulcerative Proctosigmoiditis, 
and Appendicitis.
Additional samples were collected from acetaminophen 
(APAP) overdose patients at the University of Kansas Medical 
Center (IRB 11962). All patients or next of kin were informed of 
the study objectives and design by a physician and signed a con -
sent form. All patients were required to meet at least 2 of the fol -
lowing inclusion criteria: (i) a reported history of APAP overdose, 
(ii) high plasma APAP levels based on the Rumack–Matthew 
nomogram, and (iii) both ALT >1,000 U/l and prothrombin time 
≥18 s. Patients were excluded if there was reasonable evidence of 
hepatocellular injury due to another etiology (e.g. acute viral 
hepatitis) or if they were <18 yr of age.
All samples in study HUM0044422 were collected between July 
12, 2013 and April 2, 2019. All samples collected at the University 
of Kansas Medical Center (IRB 11962) were originally published in 
McGill et al. (2012) . A subset of samples reported here was pub -
lished in the Llewellyn et al. paper. The breakdown of each injury 
type subset used in the Llewellyn et al. paper out of the total con -
firmatory subjects included here is as follows: 135/294 healthy 
subjects, 104/197 liver disease, 74/128 muscle injury, 34/57 pan -
creatic injury, 37/118 gastrointestinal injury, and 40/62 kidney 
injury.
Sample preparation and analysis
Serum samples were recovered from serum-separator tubes fol -
lowing centrifugation of whole blood at 3000 × g for 10 min at 
room temperature. Serum samples were kept at 4
�
C for up to 
72 h before aliquots were frozen at −80
�
C and stored until 
shipped for biomarker analysis. A stability assessment of GLDH, 
MDH, PNP, and PON1 confirmed acceptable stability at 4
�
C for 
up to 96 h. All analytes were measured in serum on the Siemens 
ADVIA 1800 or ADVIA 2400 Automated Chemistry System at 
Pfizer, Groton, Connecticut. ALT and AST (Siemens) and GLDH 
(Randox Labs Ltd, Roche) were measured using commercially 
available kits within the stability range (within 18 mo per Table 
S1). MDH, PNP, and PON1 were determined according to 
Bergmeyer et al. (1983) , Chu et al. (1989) , and Li et al. (1995) , 
respectively. The GLDH assay completed validation in a CLIA- 
certified lab. A summary of the GLDH assay validation results, 
including validation acceptance criteria and assay performance 
characteristics, is included in Tables S1 and S2, respectively.
Statistical analysis
Reference ranges were computed using the nonparametric 
approach recommended in the Clinical Laboratory Standards 
Institute (CLSI) document C28-A2 (CLSI 2000). ULNs were com -
pared across subgroups using quantile regression ( Koenker 2005) . 
Linear regression was used to assess the correlation between ALT 
and GLDH, and to estimate GLDH thresholds of concern corre -
sponding to those used with ALT in the Expert Working Group 
(EWG) definition of hepatocellular injury. Logistic regression and 
ROC curve analysis were used to assess the predictivity of GLDH 
as a predictor of hepatocellular injury. Statistical analyses were 
conducted in R ( R Core Team 2021 ).
Rat studies
Data were obtained from a variety of PSTC member companies 
conducting toxicology studies investigating liver biomarkers in 
rodents ( Bailey et al. 2012 ). Generally, studies utilized multiple 
doses to achieve a diversity of injury diagnoses and severity; all 
studies utilized a vehicle-treated control group. All sites used a 
common lexicon developed by pathologists within the PSTC 
Hepatotoxicity Working Group (HWG) to define histopathology 
diagnoses and severity. A histopathology diagnosis of hepatocel -
lular necrosis, graded 0 to 4 in severity, was used for the purposes 
of detection of hepatocellular-based DILI. Blood samples were 
obtained prior to necropsy. Serum samples were recovered 
according to the standard operating procedures at the member 
company conducting the study.
The table in Supplementary Material S1 lists the model toxi -
cants evaluated in the rat to define the sensitivity and specificity 
of GLDH as a biomarker to detect hepatocellular injury. As with 
nearly all toxicants, target organ/tissue toxicity is dose and route 
of administration dependent. Therefore, we have listed the toxi -
cants based on their primary target organ/tissue. Please note that 
histopathological evaluation was used to define whether or not a 
toxicity occurred in an individual animal.
Linear regression was used to assess the correlation between 
ALT and GLDH. Logistic regression and ROC curve analysis were 
used to assess the predictivity of GLDH and ALT as predictors of 
hepatocellular necrosis.
Results
Establishing the reference interval for serum 
GLDH in human subjects
A detailed understanding of reference intervals in healthy 
human subjects, including the effects of gender, age, and 
ethnicity, is essential for the interpretation of biomarker data. To 
characterize reference intervals in healthy human subjects, we 
calculated the mean, median, and standard deviation of GLDH, 
as well as a 97.5% reference interval using the nonparametric 
approach recommended in the Clinical Laboratory Standards 
Institute (CLSI) document C28-A2 (CLSI 2000). Then, we com -
pared the reference interval parameters across 2 datasets, one 
from an initial exploratory population and one confirmatory, and 
evaluated the effects of age, gender, and ethnicity. To facilitate 
the acceptance of GLDH as a liver-specific alternative to ALT, we 
also compared GLDH reference intervals with those for the gold 
standard biomarker ALT. Our exploratory population included 
665 healthy subjects combined from 3 separate cohorts from 
prior studies ( Schomaker et al. 2013 , 2020 ) and the new confirma -
tory study (presented here) included data from 294 healthy sub -
jects (Table 1). Although we have previously published some data 
from the exploratory cohorts, all data and analyses presented in 
this manuscript are new.
The mean and median serum activities of serum GLDH were 
almost identical across all cohorts in both the exploratory and 
confirmatory studies. The ULN in the exploratory population was 
10 U/l and this cutoff was supported by the confirmatory group, 
which had a similar ULN of 7 U/l. Combining all groups resulted 
in an overall ULN of 9 U/l. Because the exploratory population 
was larger and more diverse than the confirmatory population, 
we chose 10 U/l as our ULN moving forward. Median, mean, and 
ULN values for ALT proportionally mirrored the GLDH levels 
across the datasets, with the lowest ULN in the confirmatory 
study (28 U/l) and higher in the exploratory study (41 U/l). 
Combining both datasets resulted in an overall ULN of 39 U/l. 
Statistical tests comparing the ULN values across studies 
revealed a statistically significant difference in ALT (P < 0.001) 
but not GLDH (P ¼ 0.14). Even for ALT, however, the differences 
Toxicological Sciences, 2025, Vol 203, Issue 2 | 173  
across studies were not considered clinically significant to influ -
ence the interpretation of hepatocellular injury.
Effect of sex, age, and ethnicity on serum GLDH
Because sex, age, or ethnicity might affect biomarker values in 
healthy populations, we next evaluated reference range parame -
ters across these categories in the combined (i.e. exploratory and 
confirmatory) dataset of 959 subjects (Table 1). The analysis of 
this dataset consisting of 490 female and 469 male subjects did 
not show any appreciable influence of gender on serum GLDH 
(ULN P ¼ 0.73). In contrast, serum ALT mean, median, and ULN 
values were lower in females than males (33 U/l vs 42 U/l; ULN 
P < 0.001). The analysis of the effect of age on GLDH and ALT lev -
els revealed that, for both serum GLDH and serum ALT, the ULN 
values trended lower in younger (<20 yo) and older (>61 yo) sub -
jects (ALT ULN P ¼ 0.01; GLDH ULN P ¼ 0.03). Across ethnic 
groups, GLDH and ALT appeared to have similar patterns, includ -
ing, for example, somewhat lower ULN values in the Asian sub -
group. However, unlike ALT, the differences across ethnic 
subgroups were not statistically significant for GLDH (P ¼ 0.47).
Intraindividual variability of serum GLDH
Our datasets included 2 to 4 repeat measurements of serum 
GLDH and serum ALT each over the course of 3 wk for 81 subjects 
and totaled 257 individual measurements. Figure 1 shows the 
repeat GLDH and ALT measurements relative to each subject’s 
mean GLDH and ALT values, respectively. Within-subject varia -
bility, as measured by the standard deviation of repeat measure -
ments, was 1.6 for GLDH, and 3.8 for ALT. Serum GLDH and 
serum ALT values from most subjects minimally changed over 
the 3-wk period. Of a total of 257 GLDH measurements, only 7 
(2.7%) fell outside the reference range described above. In the 
case of ALT, 13 measurements out of 257 were above the ULN.
Sensitivity and specificity of serum GLDH for 
diagnosis of hepatocellular injury
To evaluate the diagnostic performance of GLDH for hepatocellu -
lar injury, we measured serum levels in a total of 338 patients 
(141 from the exploratory study; 197 from the confirmatory 
study) with chronic and acute liver diseases. Since liver biopsies 
were not ethically feasible, we utilized a biochemical criterion 
developed by the International DILI EWG ( Aithal et al. 2011 ) to 
adjudicate hepatocellular injury. According to this biochemical 
criterion, hepatocellular injury is defined as any of the following 
3 criteria: (i) an ALT value >3×ULN and TBil >2×ULN, (ii) ALT 
>5×ULN, or (iii) ALP >2×ULN. In a combined dataset of subjects 
with hepatocellular injury and healthy volunteers in our explora -
tory population, we observed a strong correlation between GLDH 
and ALT, shown in Fig. 2a (Pearson R ¼ 0.93) ( Schomaker et al. 
2013 ). In the confirmatory study presented here, the correlation 
was 0.86. Combining the exploratory and confirmatory studies 
resulted in an overall correlation of 0.89.
To assess the sensitivity and specificity of serum GLDH alone 
to diagnose hepatocellular injury, we computed ROC curves 
using the exploratory studies ( Schomaker et al. 2013 ). 
Specifically, a logistic regression model was constructed using 
the presence of DILI as defined by the EWG as the response (141 
subjects with hepatocellular injury, 617 without hepatocellular 
injury) and GLDH levels as the explanatory variable. The result -
ing model was used to estimate sensitivity and specificity across 
the range of GLDH thresholds, yielding the ROC curve shown in  
Fig. 2b. The area under the ROC curve is 0.987, suggesting that 
GLDH has excellent discriminatory power to identify liver dam -
age. In the confirmatory study presented here, the area under 
the ROC curve was 0.928 (not shown). Combining the exploratory 
and confirmatory studies resulted in an area under the ROC 
curve of 0.958 (not shown).
To estimate the serum GLDH diagnostic thresholds for hepa -
tocellular injury, which correspond to commonly accepted serum 
ALT thresholds (3× and 5× ULN), we fit a simple linear regression 
model with log[GLDH] and log[ALT]. Based on data from the 
exploratory population, we used 10 U/l and 41 U/l as the ULN (i.e. 
97.5th percentile) for serum GLDH and or ALT, respectively. As 
shown in Fig. 2a, the linear regression model identified 25 U/l and 
48 U/l (2.5 and �5× ULN) as serum GLDH thresholds of concern 
that corresponded to 3× ULN (123 U/l) and 5× ULN (205 U/l) 
thresholds of concerns for serum ALT. Confidence intervals 
(95%) for these cut-offs are (2.1, 3.4) and (3.9, 6.6), respectively.
Serum GLDH correlates with liver lesions
The rigorous assessment of serum GLDH performance to diag -
nose hepatocellular injury also requires histopathologic evalua -
tion of liver tissues. Because obtaining liver biopsies from human 
subjects was not feasible due to ethical considerations, we eval -
uated the correlation of serum GLDH with liver lesions in rats. 
First, we evaluated the correlation of serum GLDH and serum

ALT and then compared their sensitivity and specificity to detect 
hepatocellular injury (Supplementary Material S1). To visualize 
the relationship between serum GLDH and serum ALT in the 
rats, we plotted their values on a log scale for animals that had 
normal histopathology (n ¼ 676), and those that were positive for 
hepatocellular necrosis (n ¼ 222), regardless of treatment group. 
However, from this group, we removed animals that were posi -
tive for skeletal muscle injury (n ¼ 5) or had been treated with 
skeletal muscle toxicants (n ¼ 16). The correlation of ALT and 
GLDH values from 877 rats is shown in Fig. 3.
As in human subjects, we observed a strong correlation 
between serum GLDH and serum ALT in rat studies (r ¼ 0.85). To 
assess the sensitivity and specificity of serum GLDH to diagnose 
hepatocellular necrosis detected by histopathology, we 
computed ROC curves using the classification of hepatic necrosis 
regardless of its severity score. The precise estimation of the ROC 
curve was facilitated by a wide range of serum GLDH and serum 
ALT values across the treated and vehicle animals. As expected, 
the ROC analysis revealed excellent specificity and sensitivity of 
serum GLDH to detect hepatocellular necrosis caused by hepato -
toxicants, which was almost identical to serum ALT. The areas 
under the curve (AUC) for GLDH and ALT were 0.84 or 0.83, 
respectively. The GLDH was not affected by muscle toxicants.
Assessment of liver specificity of serum GLDH in 
human subjects
In contrast to serum ALT, the serum GLDH is particularly useful 
for the diagnosis of hepatocellular injury in patients with 
Fig. 1. Intra-individual variability of serum GLDH (a) and serum ALT (b). The bars with open circles represent average, minimum, and maximum values

underlying muscle diseases ( Schomaker et al. 2020 ). This is due 
to the fact that, unlike ALT, GLDH is not expressed in myocytes 
( Braakman et al. 1991 ; Kasarala and Tillmann 2016 ). However, 
since an appreciable amount of GLDH is expressed in the kid -
neys, pancreas, and intestine ( Schmidt and Schmidt 1988 ; 
Mastorodemos et al. 2005 ), we next sought to evaluate the poten -
tial interference of kidney, pancreas, and GI disease in the detec -
tion of liver damage using GLDH. We evaluated serum GLDH 
levels in 237 subjects with adjudicated pancreatic, GI, or kidney 
injuries and compared them with serum GLDH in healthy sub -
jects. To confirm the lack of interference of muscle injury on 
serum GLDH, we also examined samples from an additional 128 
subjects with adjudicated muscle injury. We used the false posi -
tive rate (FPR) to assess potential confounding effects of organ 
injuries expressing GLDH on serum GLDH by calculating the per -
centage of subjects with GLDH values exceeding ULN (10 U/l), 
2.5× ULN (25 U/l), and 5× ULN (50 U/l).
Among the 237 subjects with adjudicated kidney, pancreas, or 
GI injury (Table 2), we found only one subject (GLDH ¼ 13 U/l) 
with serum GLDH greater than the ULN (10 U/l), yielding an FPR 
of only 0.4%. The analysis of 128 samples from subjects with 
muscle injury revealed that 12 subjects had serum GLDH above 
the ULN, including 2 subjects with levels above 2.5× ULN. This 
resulted in an FPR of 9.4% for subjects above the ULN and 1.6% 
for subjects exceeding the first serum GLDH level of concern 2.5× 
ULN. The adjudication of the absence of hepatocellular injury in 
subjects with underlying muscle impairments using serum 
chemistries and medical records is complicated by the serum 
ALT interference and might lead to underdiagnosing of hepato -
cellular injury.
Assessment of elimination kinetics of serum 
GLDH
Understanding the elimination kinetics of serum GLDH and their 
relationship to serum ALT in human subjects is essential for the 
interpretation of serum GLDH in the context of the time course 
of hepatocellular injury. We therefore calculated the elimination 
halftime (T
1/2
) of serum GLDH and serum ALT in subjects with 
accidental APAP overdose. In total, 33 subjects who recovered 
from APAP overdose had sufficient serum GLDH and ALT time 
course values for inclusion in the analysis. In addition, we also 
calculated T
1/2 
of GLDH and ALT in a previously described lethal 
case ( Krauskopf et al. 2020 ). In all cases, the serum GLDH 
decreased about twice as fast as ALT (median T
1/2 
ratio ALT/ 
GLDH ¼ 1.8 to 2.1). Although there was considerable variability in 
T
1/2 
values for both GLDH and ALT, which can be attributed to 
differences in individual cases of accidental APAP overdose and 
potentially also to differences in the rate of recovery, the median 
T
1/2 
values for serum GLDH and serum ALT in patients that 
recovered from APAP overdose were 22 and 40 h, respectively 
(Table 3). Furthermore, the median T
1/2 
values of serum GLDH 
and ALT in the lethal case of APAP poisoning were consistent 
with T
1/2 
values from recovering patients with T
1/2 
ALT/GLDH 
ratios 2.1 and 1.8, respectively.
Discussion
Serum ALT is the gold standard biomarker of hepatocellular 
injury. However, persistent transaminasemia misdiagnosed as 
liver disease leads to delayed diagnosis of neuromuscular dis -
eases due to unnecessary and invasive follow-up examinations. 
Therefore, the development of liver-specific biomarkers capable 
of detecting hepatocellular injury in patients with muscle injury 
is a critical unmet medical need.
Several strategies to detect hepatocellular injury in patients 
with muscle damage have been proposed. For example, the devi -
ation of measured ALT levels from predicted ALT levels deter -
mined by the correlation relationship with muscle-specific CK is 
considered indicative of hepatocellular injury ( Edge et al. 2006 ; 
Mathur et al. 2014 ). However, the natural variability of ALT and 
CK levels in subjects with muscle injury makes this approach dif -
ficult. In the search for liver-specific biomarkers, several groups 
proposed serum gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT). Although 
GGT levels are unaffected by muscle diseases ( Rosales et al. 
Fig. 3. Performance of GLDH to detect liver injury in rats treated with model toxicants. a) The data represent individual serum GLDH and ALT values 
measured in 877 rats treated with 30 model toxicants across 29 studies. b) The performance of serum GLDH to detect liver injury was compared with 
serum ALT using ROC analysis.
176 | Aubrecht et al.  
2008 ), the known poor performance of GGT for detection of hepa -
tocellular damage—including the complete lack of sensitivity to 
detect hepatocellular injury in cases of acetaminophen poison -
ing—precludes the use of GGT for this purpose ( Goldberg 1980 ; 
Robles-Diaz et al. 2015 ; Krauskopf et al. 2020 ). More recently, we 
proposed serum GLDH as a liver-specific alternative to ALT 
( Schomaker et al. 2020 ).
Serum GLDH is a promising biomarker capable of detecting 
drug-induced hepatocellular injury ( Aubrecht et al. 2013 ; Roth 
et al. 2020 ). Because of its localization within the mitochondrial 
matrix, GLDH has been proposed as a mechanistic biomarker of 
mitochondrial damage ( McGill et al. 2012 , 2014), though that idea 
remains controversial ( Church et al. 2020 ; McGill and Jaeschke 
2021 ). It has also been proposed for use as a prognostic marker in 
acute liver failure (McGill et al. 2014) and drug-induced hepato -
cellular injury ( Church et al. 2019 ). Like ALT, GLDH is released 
from injured hepatocytes following acute hepatocellular injury 
( Schmidt and Schmidt 1988 ; Kretzschmar et al. 2003 ; Harrill et al. 
2012 ; Antoine et al. 2014) . Since only a trace amount of GLDH is 
expressed in myocytes, muscle injury does not affect serum 
GLDH and it could serve as a liver-specific alternative to ALT and 
AST ( Thulin et al. 2014 ; Schomaker et al. 2020 ). Nevertheless, the 
lack of reference intervals, defined thresholds of concern for hep -
atocellular injury, unknown interference of GLDH from extrahe -
patic tissues, and the lack of understanding of GLDH clearance 
kinetics limit the application of GLDH as a liver-specific bio -
marker of hepatocellular injury. Thus, we set out to define those 
parameters in the present study.
Reference intervals in healthy human populations are essen -
tial for the interpretation of biomarker data. We evaluated serum 
GLDH levels across a series of studies that included 959 healthy 
subjects and with serum ALT. All parameters, including mean, 
median, and ULN for both serum GLDH and serum ALT, were 
consistent across all studies. The combined ULN for serum GLDH 
was within the range of 7 to 11 U/l. This is in agreement with 
published studies ( Kravos and Male �si �c 2008 ; Kravos and Malesic 
2010 ; Kravos 2021 ). The serum ALT ULN from our combined data -
set was within the range of 28 to 41 U/l. This is also in agreement 
with the literature ( Kasarala and Tillmann 2016 ). As previously 
reported ( Schomaker et al. 2013 , 2020 ; Llewellyn et al. 2021 ), the 
serum GLDH proportionally mirrored serum ALT. In our study, 
the ULN of serum GLDH and ALT showed similar trends across 
ages, both having lower values in young (<6yo) and old (>61yo) 
age groups. Lower ALT levels in older and younger age groups 
were also observed in published studies ( Ceriotti et al. 2010 ; 
Schwimmer et al. 2010 ; Sun et al. 2022 ; Vera et al. 2022 ). Close cor -
relation between GLDH and ALT was observed when analyzing 
the effects of ethnic origin, with lower levels in the Asian popula -
tion. On the other hand, sex had no effect on GLDH, whereas the 
serum ALT ULN was consistently lower in females than in males. 
The latter observation is consistent with prior literature on ALT 
( Ceriotti et al. 2010 ; Vera et al. 2022 ). Thus, GLDH may be a better 
marker than ALT across sexes.
To evaluate the diagnostic performance of serum GLDH to 
detect hepatocellular injury, we analyzed serum samples from 
subjects with a variety of chronic and acute liver diseases, includ -
ing some with acetaminophen (APAP) overdose. We observed a 
tight correlation of serum GLDH with serum ALT with r ¼ 0.89, in 
line with our previously published observations ( Schomaker et al. 
2013 ), and this correlation allowed us to determine thresholds of 
concern for GLDH, 2.5- and 5-fold over the ULN, that correspond 
to widely accepted serum ALT thresholds of 3- and 5-fold over the 
ULN. Thus, these thresholds could be used during clinical trials to 
indicate drug-induced hepatocellular injury. To further explore 
the relationship between GLDH and liver damage, we compared 
serum GLDH with microscopic hepatocellular lesions as a hepato -
cellular injury endpoint in rats treated with model hepatotoxi -
cants. As in humans, serum GLDH is tightly correlated with ALT in 
rats as well as with the histological evidence of tissue damage.
The major advantage of serum GLDH is its potential to detect 
hepatocellular injury in subjects with underlying muscle damage 
( Schomaker et al. 2020 ). Indeed, the absence of muscle injury 
interference was confirmed using a separate cohort of patients 
with a variety of acute and chronic muscle diseases (Table 2). In 
the cohort of 128 subjects with muscle injury, only 12 subjects 
had serum GLDH above the ULN and only 2 had levels above 
2.5×ULN. The incidence of patients with higher levels of serum 
GLDH in the cohort with muscle diseases can be explained by the 
patient selection criteria that relied on biomarkers that make 
diagnosis of mild liver impairment impossible due to the lack of 
liver-specific biomarkers of hepatocellular injury. The extrahe -
patic expression of GLDH is limited to the pancreas, kidney, and 
GI tissues ( Schmidt et al. 1967 ; Schmidt and Schmidt 1988 ). 
Therefore, we assessed whether injury to these organs can inter -
fere with serum GLDH levels. We analyzed GLDH levels in serum 
samples from 237 subjects with a variety of diseases of the pan -
creas, kidney, and GI tract. Only one subject out of 237 had serum 
GLDH above the ULN, demonstrating that elevated serum GLDH 
is specific to the liver and not affected by damage to other organs 
that express appreciable amounts of GLDH. Our studies demon -
strate the utility of GLDH for diagnosing hepatocellular injury in 
subjects with acute muscle damage ( Schomaker et al. 2020 ),

characterizing ALT increases associated with therapy ( Harrill et al. 
2012 ), monitoring liver safety in the clinical development of drugs 
for fatal neuromuscular diseases ( Chowdhury et al. 2018 ; Wagner 
et al. 2021 ), and in studies assessing origin of ALT increases in 
absence of histopathological correlate ( Harrill et al. 2014 ).
The relationship of biomarker response with the progression 
or recovery of tissue injury is essential for the interpretation of 
biomarker data. The serum GLDH in patients recovering from 
APAP overdose declines faster than serum ALT ( Schomaker et al. 
2013 ). This might be attributed to differences in elimination 
kinetics of GLDH (T
1/2
¼17 h) and ALT (T
1/2
¼ 42 h) reported by 
Schmidt and Schmidt (1988) and Schmidt et al. (1967) . To investi -
gate the elimination kinetics of these enzymes, we calculated T
1/ 
2 
in a set of 34 patients with APAP overdose including one fatal 
case. The median T
1/2 
values for serum GLDH and ALT in our 
study (22 and 40 h for recovering patients and 17 and 35 h for the 
lethal case) were similar to T
1/2 
values reported in the literature 
( Schmidt et al. 1967 ; Schmidt and Schmidt 1988 ). The similar T
1/2 
between the nonlethal and lethal cases suggests that elimination 
of GLDH and ALT by Kupfer cells is not affected. The shorter T
1/2 
of serum GLDH in comparison to ALT might be advantageous for 
assessing recovery and/or improving prognosis of acute hepato -
cellular injury caused by chemicals or drugs.
To our knowledge, our studies provide the most comprehen -
sive evaluation of serum GLDH as a liver-specific biomarker of 
hepatocyte injury to date. In healthy subjects, the serum GLDH 
ULN (10 U/l) is stable and in contrast to ALT, it is not affected by 
gender. Since serum GLDH and ALT are tightly correlated, we 
linked the serum GLDH thresholds of concern (2.5× and 5× ULN) 
to ones of ALT (3× and 5× ULN). This is expected to significantly 
facilitate the interpretation of GLDH data. Applying these thresh -
olds, we have shown that GLDH exhibits comparable perform -
ance to detect hepatocellular injury as serum ALT. The major 
advantage of GLDH over the gold standard ALT is its liver specif -
icity and its ability to detect hepatocellular injury in subjects 
with underlying muscle impairments. Although more studies are 
needed, the shorter T
1/2 
of GLDH than the one of ALT could also 
be advantageous for assessing recovery and/or prognosis of acute 
hepatocellular injury.
In conclusion, the presented data provide compelling evidence 
that serum GLDH should be considered as a liver-specific alter -
native to gold standard serum ALT that improves diagnosis of 
hepatocellular injury in subjects with muscle impairments, diag -
nosis of neuromuscular diseases, and liver safety monitoring in 
the development of drugs for muscle disorders.
