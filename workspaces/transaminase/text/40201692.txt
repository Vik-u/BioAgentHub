Introduction: Drug-induced liver injury (DILI) represents a distinct form of
hepatic damage resulting from exposure to pharmacological agents. The
pathological mechanisms underlying DILI are multifaceted and remain
incompletely elucidated. However, emerging evidence suggests that cell
pyroptosis, a form of programmed cell death associated with inﬂammation,
may serve as a common mechanistic pathway in DILI pathogenesis.
Methods: To investigate the role of pyroptosis in DILI, we established a murine
model of DILI using triptolide and evaluated the therapeutic potential of
phenethyl isothiocyanate (PEITC), a naturally occurring compound, in
mitigating liver injury through the modulation of hepatocyte pyroptosis. Mice
were administered PEITC at doses ranging from 5 to 20 mg/kg. Cytokine
expression was measured using quantitative polymerase chain reaction or
biochemical indicator analyzer. Cell signalings were assayed by western blot
and immunohistochemistry. The AML12 hepacytes were cultured to investigate
the in vitro effects.
Results: PEITC treatment markedly attenuated hepatic tissue damage, restored
normal liver architecture, and signi ﬁcantly reduced serum levels of
transaminases (AST and ALT), while normalizing hepatic metabolic function.
These protective effects were mechanistically linked to the suppression of
hepatocyte pyroptosis, as PEITC effectively reversed the upregulation of the
NLRP3 inﬂammasome, Caspase-1 cleavage, and Gasdermin D (GSDMD) in
triptolide-exposed livers. In vitro studies using cultured hepatocytes further
demonstrated that PEITC inhibited the expression and activation of NLRP3,
Caspase-1, GSDMD, and other key proteins involved in the pyroptosis pathway.
Ultrastructural analysis via electron microscopy corroborated these ﬁndings,
revealing that PEITC prevented pyroptosis-induced membrane pore formation
in hepatocytes.

Introduction
The liver serves as the primary organ for drug metabolism and is
consequently subject to the highest levels of toxicity from various
medications, whether derived from the original compounds or their
metabolites. The metabolism of numerous drugsin vivo, particularly
those that require prolonged administration, has been associated
with a range of adverse effects, most notably liver damage. While
certain drug-related liver injuries are benign and may resolve upon
discontinuation of the medication, an increase in drug-induced liver
injury (DILI) can lead to chronic liver conditions or, in severe cases,
acute liver failure (Zhang et al., 2023; You et al., 2018).
DILI can arise from a wide array of medications, including
prescription drugs, over-the-counter medications, herbal remedies,
and, occasionally, recreational substances. Generally, DILI is classiﬁed
into two categories: intrinsic and idiosyncratic types (Huang et al.,
2019). Intrinsic toxicity can be reliably replicated in animal studies
and is characterized by a dose-dependent relationship, even at
sublethal concentrations. Furthermore, environmental factors and
genetic predispositions may inﬂuence the toxicity associated with
intrinsic hepatotoxicants (Cai et al., 2021).
Triptolide is a bioactive compound derived from the traditional
Chinese medicinal herb known as Tripterygium wilfordii.T h i s
compound shows a range of distinct pharmacological effects, which
make it especially signiﬁcant in both research and therapeutic
applications. However, it is important to look out that triptolide is
also associated with considerab le adverse effects, particularly
concerning liver toxicity. Research has shown that triptolide can
induce a form of programmed cell death called PANoptosis in
macrophages in vitro. Furthermore, triptolide has exhibited both
nephrotoxic and hepatotoxic effects that correlate with its ability to
induce PANoptosis (Zhang et al., 2023). It disrupts mitochondrial
function, reducing adenosine triphosphate (ATP) production and
causing mitochondrial membrane depolarization. This dysfunction
leads to energy depletion in liver cells, contributing to hepatocyte
death through apoptosis or necrosis (You et al., 2018). Triptolide
also causes the body to consume large amounts of xanthine and
uric acid, causing the generation of various reactive oxygen species
(ROS) due to oxidative stress, stimulates the signaling pathway of toll-
like receptors and enhances the phosphorylation of the downstream
protein nuclear factorκ-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-
κB), which induces inﬂammation and eventuallyresults in cellular
dysfunction and apoptosis (Huang et al., 2019; Cai et al., 2021). Recent
studies suggest that pyroptosis, a form of inﬂammatory cell death, plays
a crucial role in triptolide-induced liver injury. Triptolide may activate
inﬂammasomes like nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-like
receptor protein 3 (NLRP3), lead ing to Caspase-1 activation,
Gasdermin D (GSDMD) cleavage, and subsequent pyroptotic liver
cell death. This process is connected to the release of inﬂammatory
cytokines, further exacerbating liver inﬂammation and injury (Cai et al.,
2021). Pyroptosis also occurs in thioacetamide- and acetaminophen-
induced liver damage accompanied by intense oxidative stress and
inﬂammation (Chen et al., 2016). Therefore, triptolide may be a good
compound to induce a DILI model, particularly in experimental
settings where researchers aim to study mechanisms of liver
damage, toxicity, and inﬂammation. Investigating the pyroptosis
process induced by triptolide may advance treatment strategies for a
range of drug-induced liver injuries.
Phenethyl isothiocyanate (PEITC) is one of the major bioactive
compounds present in cruciferous vegetables (such as watercress,
broccoli, and sprout kale). Owing to the presence of electron-
withdrawing ITC groups (N=C=S), PEITC is highly reactive with
cysteine, leading to multiple intracellular targets. PEITC inﬂuences
crucial cellular signaling routesassociated with the advancement of
cancer, notably the NF-κB, protein kinase B (Akt), and mitogen-
activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways, which play a role in
activating B cells (Wang et al., 2011; Cavell et al., 2012). It can alter
the cytoskeletal structure and epigenome of bacterial cells, and induce
the unfolded protein response (UPR) and autophagy (Dayalan Naidu
et al., 2018). Additionally, it has been demonstrated that PEITC activates
the cytoprotective pathway facilitated by the transcription factor Nrf2
(nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2) and the heat shock response
(HSR) controlled by heat shock factor 1 (HSF1), while also inhibiting
phase 1 enzymes when present in elevated concentrations. It is also a
potential natural nutraceutical with bioactive structure that promote
gastrointestinal health (Gupta et al., 2014). Our earlier research has
demonstrated that PEITC protects the liver (Wang et al., 2022). Thus,
we examined alterations of protein expression, formation of pores in the
cell membrane and process of pyroptos i si nl i v e r sf r o mm i c et r e a t e dw i t h
triptolide. We further tested whether and how PEITC could alleviate the
drug-induced injury bothin vivoand in vitro.

were procured from Beyotime Biotechnology (Shanghai, China).
Insulin-transferrin-selenium (ITS) media supplements were
provided by R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN, United States).
Antibodies targeting α-tubulin were sourced from Abmart

procured from Sangon Biotech (Shanghai, China).
Animal experiments
ICR mice (6– 8 weeks old) were purchased from SPF (Beijing)
Biotechnology Company, Inc. and housed in an SPF-grade animal
facility maintained on a 12:12 h light/dark cycle, with ambient
temperatures ranging from 22
°Ct o2 5°C. They had unrestricted
access to food and sterile water. Based on references (Wang et al.,
2023; Yang et al., 2012) and preliminary experimental results, a
model of drug-induced liver injury was established through the oral
administration of Triptolide at a dosage of 0.75 mg/kg once daily for
two consecutive days. PEITC was carefully diluted in olive oil to the
desired concentration for oral administration. Twenty-ﬁve male
mice were randomly assigned to ﬁve groups: control, Triptolide
treatment, Triptolide + 5 mg/kg PEITC, Triptolide + 10 mg/kg
PEITC, and Triptolide + 20 mg/kg PEITC. Female mice were
grouped identically to the males. Mice in each group received
varying concentrations of PEITC 3 days prior to the
administration of triptolide, while those in the normal control or
Triptolide-treated group also received equivalent volume of olive oil
(10 mL/kg) at the same time. Theﬁnal Triptolide dose was given 24 h
prior to serum collection, and thereafter, the mice were euthanized.
The livers were harvested, weighed, and photographed for
documentation. A portion of the liver right lobe tissue wasﬁxed in
paraformaldehyde, embedded in paraf ﬁn, sectioned, and the
remaining tissue was stored at−80
°C( Wang et al., 2022).
Hematoxylin-eosin (HE) staining and
histological activity index (HAI)
Following ﬁxation of liver tissue with paraformaldehyde, the
samples were processed by Wuhan Servicebio Co., Ltd. (Wuhan,
China) for parafﬁn embedding and sectioning, followed by HE
staining. The HAI scoring system was utilized to evaluate hepatic
inﬂammation and necrosis in HE-stained sections. HAI, a cumulative
score of liver inﬂammation reﬂecting lobular, periportal, portal
inﬂammation, and fusion necrosis, ranges from 0 to 18, with
scores of 7 or higher indicating signiﬁcant necroinﬂammation.
Analysis of serum biochemical indicators
Hitachi 7600-020 automatic biochemistry analyzer was
employed to measure the serum concentrations of aspartate
aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), γ-
glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH),
triglycerides (TG), total cholesterol (CH), direct bilirubin (DBIL),
and albumin (ALB).
Real-time PCR
RNA was extracted from liver tissues using TRIzol reagent,
following the manufacturer’s protocol. The extracted RNA was
reverse-transcribed into cDNA according to the same TRIzol
protocol. The ampliﬁcation conditions were as follows: an initial
step at 95
°C for 2 min (1 cycle), followed by 45 cycles of denaturation
at 95°C for 10 sec, annealing at 60°C for 30 sec, and extension at 95°C
for 10 sec. The primers used in this study were shown in
Supplementary Table.
Western blot
Immunoblotting was performed essentially as described
previously (Wang et al., 2023). Brieﬂy total protein extraction from
mouse liver tissue was conducted using RIPA buffer supplemented
with the protease inhibitor 1% phenylmethylsulfonylﬂuoride (PMSF).
Liver tissues were lysed in this buffer, and after 30 min of incubation
on ice, the supernatant containing the extracted proteins was collected
via centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 15 min. Protein concentrations
were determined using the BCA protein assay kit, with bovine serum
albumin (BSA) as the standard. The total protein samples were
resolved using 10% Tris-glycine SDS-PAGE and subsequently
transferred to a polyvinylidene ﬂuoride (PVDF) membrane. The
primary antibody was diluted to a working liquid with 3% BSA
(NLRP3, 1:1,000; Caspase-1, 1:1,000; GSDMD, 1:1,000; IL-1β, 1:1000;
Tubulin, 1:4,000). Various antibodies were employed for incubation at
4
°C for 12 h, based on the molecular weight of the target proteins.
Immunohistochemistry
Immunoﬂuorescence analysis was performed as previously
described (Wang et al., 2023). Liver specimens underwent dewaxing
with xylene, followed by dehydrationthrough a gradient ethanol series
to facilitate antigen retrieval in a water bath at 95°Cf o r1 5m i nu s i n g
citrate buffer (pH 6.0). Sections were treated with 0.3% H2O2 for 7 min
to eliminate endogenous peroxidase activity and then incubated with
2% BSA for 30 min to block non-speciﬁc binding sites. The slices were
incubated overnight at 4
°C with primary antibodies (NLRP3, 1:200;
Caspase-1, 1:100; GSDMD, 1:200; IL-1β, 1:200). After washing with
phosphate-buffered saline (PBST), sections were stained according to
the instructions provided with the anti-mouse/rabbit universal
immunohistochemical detection kit, followed by counterstaining
with hematoxylin.
Cell culture
AML12 cells were obtained from the National Collection of
Authenticated Cell Cultures (Shanghai, China). These cells were
Frontiers inPharmacology frontiersin.org03
An et al. 10.3389/fphar.2025.1539934
cultured in DMEM/F12 medium supplemented with 10% fetal
bovine serum (FBS) and an ITS solution at aﬁnal concentration
of 1x, along with 40 ng/mL of dexamethasone. A penicillin-
streptomycin solution at 1x concentration was also added to
minimize bacterial contaminati on. The cells were maintained in
an incubator with a controlled environment of 5% (v/v) carbon
dioxide and 37
°C. To assess the effects of PEITC on the drug-
induced liver injury model, AML12 cells were treated with
P E I T C( 0 . 1 ,0 . 3 ,1 ,o r3µ M )f o r1ha n ds u b s e q u e n t l yw i t h
40 nM Triptolide for 24 h. The cells were then collected for
further experiments.
Immunoﬂuorescence assay
AML12 cells underwent a series of preparatory steps,
including ﬁxation, permeabilization, and blocking, to facilitate
effective antibody binding. Following these preparations, the cells
were incubated overnight at 4°C with anti-GSDMD antibodies
diluted with 3% BSA [1:100]. After extensive washing with
phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) to remove unbound
antibodies, the cells were treated with Alexa Fluor 488-
conjugated anti-rabbit IgG for visualization. The nuclei were
stained using DAPI, a ﬂuorescent dye that binds to DNA,
providing clear contrast for e xamining cellular structures
under microscopy.
Electron microscopy
Cell samples were ﬁxed using standard protocols for electron
microscopy (Servicebio, Wuhan, China) and subsequently processed
f o rs c a n n i n ge l e c t r o nm i c r o s c o py at Wuhan Servicebio Co., Ltd.
(Wuhan, China).
Statistical analysis
Results are expressed as mean ± SEM, with each experiment
performed in triplicate. Statistical analyses were conducted using
GraphPad Prism 8 software (San Diego, CA, United States). Data
were analyzed using Student’s t-test or one-way analysis of variance
(ANOVA), followed by Bonferronipost hoc correction. A P-value
of <0.05 was considered statistically signiﬁcant.

once daily for two consecutive days. In each experimental group,
varying concentrations of phenethyl isothiocyanate (PEITC) were
administered orally to the PEITC-treated mice, while the triptolide-
treated mice received a speciﬁed volume of solvent (olive oil),
beginning 3 days prior to triptolide administration and
continuing daily until the end of the study. The mice were
euthanized 24 h after theﬁnal triptolide administration, and their
livers were excised and photographed.
During the initial 3 days of oral PEITC administration, no
signiﬁcant differences in body weight were noted among the various
groups of mice (Figure 1B). However, following triptolide treatment, a
marked reduction in body weight was observed. The livers of the
triptolide-treated mice appeared smaller and exhibited a whitish surface
compared to those in the control group. In contrast, PEITC treatment
resulted in improved liver morphology across all experimental groups
(Figures 1C,D). Histological examination using H&E staining revealed
distinct hepatic cords radiating from the central vein in the livers of the
normal control group, where hepatocytes were closely packed, uniform
in size, and retained normal structural characteristics. Conversely,
triptolide-treated mice displayed pronounced pathological changes,
including cell necrosis, structural distortions, disorganized hepatic
cords, indistinct boundaries of the central portal vein, and
inﬂammatory cell inﬁltration. However, the liver morphology of
mice treated with PEITC showed dose-dependent restoration, with
notable improvements toward normalcy (Figure 1E). Additionally,
histopathological analysis scores of H&E-stained liver tissue sections
indicated that PEITC treatment signiﬁcantly reduced liver pathology
scores compared to the triptolide group (Figure 1F). These ﬁndings
suggest that PEITC markedly ameliorates liver tissue pathology in mice
experiencing acute drug-induced liver injury induced by triptolide.
PEITC reduced hepatic biochemical indices
in mice with triptolide-induced liver injury
Transaminase activity levels in serum are widely recognized as
indicators of liver cell damage and are considered highly sensitive
and speciﬁc biomarkers for hepatotoxicity. Our study focused on
measuring the levels of key liver biochemical markers-AST, ALT,
GGT, and LDH-in the various treatment groups of mice. We
observed that PEITC effectively inhibited the increase in serum
levels of AST, ALT, GGT, and LDH in mice treated with triptolide
(Figures 2A– D).
Additionally, we analyzed the serum levels of triglycerides (TG),
cholesterol (CH), total bilirubin (TBIL), and albumin (ALB) across
the different treatment groups. Ourﬁndings revealed that in the
triptolide-treated group, cholesterol levels increased, while total
bilirubin and triglycerides decreased ( Figures 2E – G). These
results suggest that cholesterol metabolism in the liver is
impaired, resulting in reduced bile synthesis and compromised
triglyceride digestion and absorption. In contrast, treatment with
PEITC led to varying degrees of improvement in these metabolic
indicators. Albumin (ALB), a critical protein in the blood, typically
decreases in the context of liver dysfunction and malnutrition.
However, in the cases of triptolide-induced acute liver injury
observed in our study, serum albumin levels exhibit an increase
(Figure 2H). This phenomenon may be related to compensatory
synthesis. In the early stages of acute injury, liver damage may not be
severe in some animals, allowing the liver to compensate by
increasing the synthesis of albumin to counteract losses due to
other factors, such as the need for enhanced transport functions or
inﬂammatory reaction. A comparison of serum ALB levels among

Frontiers inPharmacology frontiersin.org05
An et al. 10.3389/fphar.2025.1539934
the different groups demonstrated that PEITC mitigated the change
in serum ALB levels caused by triptolide treatment.
Overall, theseﬁndings demonstrate that PEITC offers protective
effects against acute drug-induced liver injury and contributes to the
restoration of normal liver metabolic function.
PEITC prevented hepatocyte pyroptosis in
mice with triptolide-induced liver injury
Hepatocyte death is a signiﬁcant mechanism underlying liver
injury. The objective of this study was to determine whether PEITC
can directly prevent hepatocyte death. Given PEITC ’s well-
documented anti-in ﬂammatory properties and the role of
pyroptosis as a form of cell death closely associated with
inﬂammatory responses, particularly in the context of acute
drug-induced liver injury, we investigated the signi ﬁcance of
pyroptosis in liver damage.
Analysis using quantitative PCR (qPCR) revealed that the
mRNA expression levels of pyroptosis-related proteins Nlrp3,
casp1, Gsdmd, and Il-b were signiﬁcantly elevated in the liver
tissue of mice treated with triptolide. In contrast, PEITC
treatment resulted in reduced mRNA expression levels of these
pyroptosis-related proteins in mice (Figure 3).
In addition, Western blotting was conducted to conﬁrm the
expression levels of the pyroptosis-related proteins NLRP3, pro-
Caspase-1, cleaved Caspase-1, GSDMD, GSDMD-N, and IL-1β in
the livers of the mice treated with triptolide. The results revealed an
increase in the expression of NLRP3, as well as increased cleavage
and activation of the pyroptosis-related proteins caspase-1,
GSDMD, and il-1 β, comparable to those in the normal
group. However, after PEITC treatment, there was a signiﬁcant
reduction in the expression of NLRP3 and the levels of cleaved
Caspase-1, GSDMD-N and mature IL-1β (Figure 4).
Next, we performed immunohistochemical analysis on liver
sections from the mice in each group. The immunohistochemistry
results revealed that the expression levels of NLRP3, cleaved caspase-
1, GSDMD (GSDMD and GSDMD-N), and IL-1β were greater in the
triptolide-treated group than in the normal group (Figures 5A– E).
PEITC inhibited the expression of NLRP3, cleaved caspase-1,
GSDMD (GSDMD and GSDMD-N) and mature IL-1β in a dose-
dependent manner (Figure 5). These ﬁndings indicate that the
improvement of DILI by PEITC is indeed accompanied by
signiﬁcant inhibition of cell pyroptosis process. However, whether

this effect directly affects hepatocytes will be demonstrated later
through in vitro experiments.
PEITC effectively inhibited pyroptosis in
AML12 cells treated with triptolidein vitro
AML12 cells are a type of liver cell line derived from mouse
hepatocytes and retain many of the functional characteristics of
primary hepatocytes, including the ability to metabolize drugs and
produce proteins typically associated with liver function. So we used
AML12 cells treated with triptolide to mimic anin vitroDILI model.
We subsequently assessed the expression of pyroptosis-related proteins
in the presence and absence of PEITC. Ourﬁndings indicated that the
expression and activation levels of NLRP3, Caspase-1, GSDMD, and
IL-1β were increased in AML12 cells following stimulation of
triptolide. However, the addition of PEITC reduced the expression
and activation of these proteins (Figure 6).
Additionally, our immunoﬂuorescence analysis demonstrated
that PEITC effectively inhibited the expression and localization of
the key pyroptotic protein GSDMD in AML12 cells (Figure 7A). The
typical characteristics of pyroptosis observed in AML12 cells
following triptolide treatment included cell swelling, rupture of
the cytoplasmic membrane, and the formation of intracellular
vacuoles. In contrast, the morphology of AML12 cells treated
with PEITC was restored, exhibiting a more intact plasma
membrane and a reduction in intracellular vacuoles (Figure 7B).
Discussion
Our study demonstrates that triptolide induces DILI with
pronounced pyroptosis in hepatocytes in bothin vivo studies and
in vitroexperiments. Conversely, PEITC, a natural compound found
in cruciferous vegetables, exhibits a substantial protective effect
against this liver injury. PEITC alleviates hepatic lesions, restores
normal liver architecture, reduces serum transaminase levels in
mice, and reestablishes normal hepatic metabolic function,
underscoring its potential to mitigate DILI. This ﬁnding is
pivotal for clinical applications, as triptolide, acetaminophen, and
numerous chemotherapeutic agents that may induce hepatic injury
possess unique pharmacological proﬁles, including potent anti-
inﬂammatory, immunosuppressive, anti-tumor, and anti-ﬁbrotic
properties. These characteristics render them indispensable in
speciﬁc therapeutic settings despite their hepatotoxicity, which
constrains their clinical utility. Intensive research is underway to
develop analogs or formulations that preserve these therapeutic
beneﬁts while minimizing toxicity.

Triptolide is one of the main active components of traditional
Chinese medicine Tripterygium wilfordii, which has been widely
used for its signiﬁcant anti-cancer effects and the clinical treatment
of systemic lupus erythematosus and rheumatoid arthritis. UHPLC-
ESI-QTOF-MS method was used to observe the effects of
Tripterygium wilfordii on serum and liver metabolites of mice. A
total of 30 metabolites were identiﬁed, of which 29 were associated
with toxicity severity. These metabolites are involved in a variety of
metabolic pathways, including glutathione metabolism,
tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA cycle), purine metabolism,
glycerophospholipid metabolism, etc.( Zhao et al., 2018). Among
them, the study conﬁrmed that triptolide can induce oxidative stress
in HL7702 cells and HepG2 cells in mice, rats and human normal
liver, signi ﬁcantly reduce superoxide dismutase (SOD) and
Glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) activities, and signi ﬁcantly
increase malondialdehyde (MDA) levels. In addition, it induces
lipid peroxidation, increase autophagy activity, and inhibit Notch1,
thereby increasing oxidative stress (Yang et al., 2012; Xu et al., 2019;
Wei et al., 2019; Shen et al., 2019; Liu et al., 2013). The clinical use of
triptolide typically begins with low doses; however, its therapeutic
index is very narrow. As the dose increases beyond a certain
threshold, symptoms of toxicity may emerge suddenly. The most

prominent reaction associated with this acute poisoning is damage
to the digestive system, particularly affecting the liver. The model
used in this experiment simulates a state of acute poisoning induced
by triptolide administration. In our study, triptolide administration
resulted in hepatic injury characterized by a range of biochemical,
and histological changes in mice (Figures 1, 2). Liver cell swelling,
necrosis and inﬂammatory inﬁltration are observed. In addition,
there was a signi ﬁcant release of cellular contents, including
inﬂammatory molecules. NLRP3 in ﬂammasome and caspases
activation are also detected. All these data indicate that
pyroptosis, a unique type of cell death, is widely occurring in the
liver after triptolide is given to mice.
Pyroptosis represents a type of programmed cell death
characterized by the lysis of cells and is facilitated by proteins
that create pores, which are referred to as gasdermins. The family
of gasdermins includes GSDMA, GSDMB, GSDMC, GSDMD,
GSDME, and GSDMF, which is also known as PJVK or
DFNB59. With the exception of PJVK, other gasdermin family
members contain both C-terminal and N-terminal domains
(Cavell et al., 2012 ). Gasdermins has a lipophile n-terminal
domain with inherent pore-forming capabilities, as well as a
C-terminal domain connected by a linker subregion. In the
resting state, the C-terminal domain inhibited the pore-forming
activity of the N-terminal domain. However, speciﬁc proteases are
activated in response to different signals, cutting this junction region
and separating the n-terminal and C-terminal domains, thus easing
intramolecular inhibition. After lysis, the n-terminal domain is
transferred to the plasma membrane, where it interacts with
acidic phospholipids (such as inosine phosphate) on the
cytoplasmic side of the membrane. N-terminal domains
subsequently oligomerize and form annular pores in the plasma
membrane, leading to cell lysis and pyroptosis. (Dayalan Naidu
et al., 2018). In the canonical pathway, protein complexes including
NLRP1, NAIP, NLRC4, AIM2, NLRP3, and Pyrin activate and
cleave procaspase-1, producing active caspase-1. This active
caspase-1 then processes GSDMD, producing an N-terminal
truncated form (GSDMD-N) with pore-forming activity that
ultimately leads to the release of the pro-inﬂammatory cytokines
IL-1β and IL-18, which trigger an inﬂammatory response (Gupta
et al., 2014; Wang et al., 2022). Alternatively, In the non-canonical
pathway, lipopolysaccharide (LPS) can directly bind and activate
caspases 11, 4, or 5, which subsequently cleave GSDMD to produce
GSDMD-N (Wang et al., 2023). Activation of caspase-11/4 has been
observed in the livers of both mice and patients with alcoholic fatty

liver disease (HA), leading to hepatocyte pyroptosis via cleaved
GSDMD (Zhao et al., 2018). Our previous research demonstrated
that PEITC has a protective effect against acute immune-mediated
liver injury induced by Concanavalin A and chemical liver injury
caused by CCl
4, primarily through direct interaction with GSDMD.
Based on theseﬁndings, we further evaluated its effects on DILI in
this study.
PEITC is a small-molecule compound derived from edible
cruciferous vegetables, known for its antibacterial, anti-
inﬂammatory, antioxidant, and anticancer properties ( Coscueta
et al., 2022). In a clinical trial of PEITC for managing prostate
hyperplasia, we observed a reduction in serum transaminase levels
among elderly patients. Additionally, PEITC signiﬁcantly stimulates
the reverse cholesterol transport pathway by regulating key proteins
such as peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma (PPARγ),
liver-X-receptor α (LXR-α), ATP binding cassette subfamily A
member 1 (ABCA1), scavenger receptor A (SR-A1), cluster of
differentiation 36 (CD36) 1, and NF-κB, thereby reducing lipid
accumulation and in ﬂammatory responses. Notably, PEITC
supplementation has been shown to decrease lipid accumulation
in the liver and mitigate atherosclerotic plaque formation in the
aorta (Gwon et al., 2020). In this study, we found that PEITC
signiﬁcantly ameliorated liver damage induced by triptolide in mice
(Figures 1C,E). During the experiment, we observed that the female
representative liver of the triptolide group appears smaller and
whiter than the one from the male. However, there are no
signiﬁcant differences in the parameters, such as body weight
changes, serum transaminase concentrations, and pathological
sections, between male and female mice. It has been reported
that female mice experience more pronounced liver damage than
male mice during acute liver injury induced by triptolide. Which
may be attributed to the in ﬂuence of estradiol in regulating
macrophage-mediated in ﬂammation and hepatocyte function
(Zhang et al., 2024). These issues may be investigated in future

studies. The activities of ALT, AST, and GGT, which are considered

markedly reversed following PEITC administration in mice with
liver injury. Moreover, PEITC effectively restored the metabolic
function of liver substances in a dose-dependent manner compared
to the control group (Figure 2). It has been reported that olive oil,
particularly its bioactive compounds such as monounsaturated or
polyunsaturated fatty acids, may provide a certain level of
hepatoprotection (Amamou et al., 2015; Albrahim et al., 2022).
However, in our pilot experiment, we set up an olive oil solvent
control and did not observe any protective effect on Triptolide-induced
liver injury (data not shown). Duringthis experiments, the equivalent
volume of olive oil was also administered to the mice in the normal
control and the Triptolide-treated only group. Livers from mice treated
with Triptolide sustained notable damage ( Figures 1C,E , 2).
Consequently, it appears that PEITC was primarily responsible for
the observed liver protective effects in this study.
The dose-dependent effects of phenethyl isothiocyanate (PEITC)
on liver injury can be attributed to multiple mechanisms that vary
with the concentration of PEITC administered. At low concentrations,
PEITC has been shown to enhance the activity of antioxidants, such as
glutathione peroxidase and superoxide dismutase, through the
activation of the Nrf2 pathway. Additionally, it suppresses the
expression of pro-inﬂammatory cytokines (e.g., TNF-α, IL-6) and
inhibits the nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) signaling pathway
(Coscueta et al., 2022 ). The presence of intracellular reactive
oxygen species and inﬂammatory factors, such as IL-1β,s u g g e s t s
the occurrence of pyroptosis, a speciﬁc form of cell death, in
hepatocytes following acute liver injury.
We further investigated whether PEITC could protect
hepatocytes and the liver by inhibiting triptolide-induced
pyroptosis. Compared to the model group, the PEITC-treated
group exhibited reduced levels of pyroptosis-related proteins in
liver tissues across all experimental groups (Figure 3A). Western
blot and immunohistochemistry analyses demonstrated that PEITC
signiﬁcantly decreased the expression of pyroptosis-related proteins
in the liver tissue of mice with triptolide-induced liver injury
(Figures 4, 5). The clear dose-response relationship (5– 20 mg/kg)
in vivoindicates that PEITC may directly affect signaling pathways
associated with pyroptosis, thereby protecting liver cells.
The therapeutic signiﬁcance of PEITC in this context lies in its
ability to modulate key signaling pathways associated with
pyroptosis, particularly the NLRP3 in ﬂammasome pathway. In
Figure 6, it was shown that by inhibiting NLRP3 oligomerization
and subsequent caspase-1 activation, PEITC effectively prevented
the cleavage of GSDMD into its active form. PEITC also
downregulated the expression of pro-inﬂammatory cytokines IL-
1β, which are released during pyroptosis. By reducing the levels of
these cytokines, PEITC helped attenuate the inﬂammatory response
that often accompanies liver injury and cell death. As a form of
programmed cell death, pyroptosis is characterized by distinct
morphological features. In AML12 hepatocytes treated with
triptolide, electron microscopy revealed numerous vesicle
formations, membrane pore formation, membrane rupture, and
cytoplasmic leakage. Following PEITC treatment, the morphology
of AML12 cells showed signiﬁcant improvement (Figure 7). These
unique phenomenon conﬁrmed PEITC’s potential as a therapeutic
agent in the treatment of DILI, particularly in cases involving
pyroptosis-related liver injury. By targeting the underlying
processes that drive cell death and inﬂ
ammation, PEITC offers a
novel approach to protecting hepatic function and promoting
recovery in patients suffering from drug-induced liver toxicity.
Further research into these mechanisms can help re ﬁne
therapeutic strategies and solidify the role of PEITC in liver health.
Conclusion
In summary, PEITC demonstrates signi ﬁcant therapeutic
potential in the treatment of drug-induced liver injury (DILI),
particularly in cases involving hepatotoxic agents such as
triptolide. The evidence highlights PEITC ’s ability to mitigate
liver damage through mechanisms that include the reduction of
plasma transaminase, inhibition of pro-inﬂammatory IL-1beta, and
suppression of pyroptotic cell death. These multifaceted actions
position PEITC as a promising candidate for the management of
liver injury caused by hepatotoxic substances, offering a novel
approach to minimizing liver damage and promoting recovery.
Moving forward, future research should delve into the
exploration of combination therapies that could enhance the
protective efﬁcacy of PEITC. Investigating synergistic effects with
other hepatoprotective agents or integrating PEITC into existing
treatment regimens may yield improved therapeutic outcomes for
patients affected by DILI. Additionally, further studies are warranted
to elucidate the precise molecular mechanisms underlying PEITC’s
protective effects and to establish optimal dosing strategies that
maximize its beneﬁts while minimizing any potential risks. Given
that PEITC has entered clinical trials in both the United States and
China, it will be crucial for translating theseﬁndings into effective
therapeutic interventions and for evaluating PEITC’s role within
broader strategies for managing hepatotoxicity.
