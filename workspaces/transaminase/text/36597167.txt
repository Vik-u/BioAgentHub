Abstract 
Background: Critically ill patients must be monitored constantly in intensive care units (ICUs). Among many labora-
tory variables, nutritional status indicators are a key role in the prognosis of diseases. We investigated the effects of 
l-carnitine adjunctive therapy on monitoring variables in critical illness.
Method: A prospective, double-blind, randomized controlled trial was implemented in a medical ICU. Participants 
were 54 patients, aged > 18 years, with multiple conditions, randomly assigned to receive 3 g l-carnitine per day or 
placebo, along with enteral feeding, for 1 week. Primary outcomes included monitoring variables related to nutritional 
status.
Result: Of 54 patients randomly assigned, 51 completed the trial. Serum albumin (Alb) (P-value: 0.001), total protein 
(P-value: 0.003), and calcium (Ca) (0.044) significantly increased in the intervention vs. control group. Alanine transami-
nase (ALT) (0.022), lactate (<0.001), creatinine (Cr) (0.005), and international normalized ratio (INR) (0.049) decreased 
meaningfully in the intervention vs. control group.
Conclusion: l-Carnitine supplementation in critically ill patients can improve several parameters including INR, Cr, 
ALT, lactate, Ca, Alb, and total protein.

Introduction: background and objectives
Patients who are admitted to the intensive care unit 
(ICU) are, typically, critically ill with one or more com -
plications and comorbidities, such as multiple organ 
failure, acute pancreatitis, surgical process, critically ill 
obesity, sepsis, and trauma [1]. Clinical nutrition can play 
a key role in ameliorating and managing patients’ mor -
bidities by supplying micro- and macronutrients, anti -
oxidants, and anti-inflammatory agents [2]. Following 
admittance to the ICU for even a short time, malnutri -
tion is probable, because of receiving a lack of nutritional 
requirements, high levels of catabolism, and physical 
inactivity, among other things [3]. Patients in the ICU are

monitored for metabolic responses continuously, and any 
changes in these variables can demarcate the deteriora -
tion of illness [4]. For example, albumin (Alb) can be a 
marker of disease severity, but not a malnutrition indi -
cator, whilst low levels of Alb can be associated with an 
increased mortality rate in hospitalized patients [5]. In 
addition, elevated serum lactate in critical patients is cor-
related with mortality rate and poor outcomes, especially 
in septic patients [6].
l-Carnitine is an indispensable factor in the energy 
production of cells that are synthesized from lysine and 
methionine. About one-quarter of l-carnitine is provided 
endogenously and three-quarters must be provided exog-
enously. l-Carnitine in the energy production cycle acts 
as a regulating agent for acetyl coenzyme A (CoA) to CoA 
ratio. Excess acetyl CoA can lead to malfunction, energy 
imbalance, and eventually malnutrition [7, 8]. It is esti -
mated that about 300 mg/kg of l-carnitine exists in our 
body, predominantly in the muscles and the liver. Exog -
enous l-carnitine is obtained from some animal foods, 
where its bioavailability from foods is about 54–87% vs. 
5–18% from pharmaceutical sources [9]. Therefore, mega 
pharmacological doses are needed in patients that cannot 
receive normal forms of foods orally, such as patients in 
ICU. On the other hand, l-carnitine deficiency is a com -
mon problem in critically ill patients because of acute 
kidney injury (AKI), malnutrition, prolonged parental 
nutrition (PN), and some infectious diseases, including 
human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), sepsis, trauma, 
and drug therapy [10]. A meta-analysis of 13 indicated 
that l-carnitine supplementation can significantly reduce 
inflammatory biomarkers (C-reactive protein (CRP), 
interleukin-6 (IL-6), and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-
α)). Further subgroup analysis showed that supplemen -
tation for more than 12 weeks is more effective for CRP 
and TNF-α and that l-carnitine only at dosages ≥ 2 g/day 
can significantly decrease TNF-α [11]. Another system -
atic review showed that serum carnitine has an inverse 
association with sequential organ failure assessment 
score (SOFA) in septic patients, and l-carnitine supple -
mentation leads to a reduction in the 28-mortality rate 
[12]. To our knowledge, limited randomized clinical con -
trolled trials have been conducted on ICU patients about 
the evaluation of the effects of l-carnitine supplementa -
tion on monitoring laboratory variables. Therefore, we 
sought to assess the effects of a high dose of l-carnitine 
supplementation (3 g/day) on patients’ clinical and moni-
toring parameters admitted to the ICU.
Materials and methods
Trial design
This original prospective 1-week double-blinded parallel 
randomized controlled trial is a part of a whole program, 
in which a total of 54 patients were randomly assigned 
into intervention or placebo arms. Recruitment of par -
ticipants was carried out between June 2018 and August 
2019. The whole protocol was approved by the Research 
Ethics Committee of Mashhad University of Medical Sci -
ences (registration code: IR.MUMS.fm.REC.1396.671) 
and was registered in the Iranian Registry of Clinical Tri -
als (registration code: IRCT 20151108024938N2).
Participants
Critically ill patients who were admitted to the general 
ICUs of Imam Reza Hospital, Mashhad, Iran, partici -
pated in this study. Our inclusion and exclusion criteria 
are detailed in Table 1. After checking participant eligibil-
ity, written informed consent was obtained from patients 
or legal guardians.
Interventions
At first, before allocation, the principal investigator 
(FY) explained the aims of this project to eligible par -
ticipants who were admitted to the ICU and have been 
hemodynamically stable and received supplemental 
nutrition (first 24–48 h) via enteral tube feeding with 25 
kcal/kg/day energy and obtained written informed con -
sent. Nutritional support was administered in the bolus 
method, 7 times a day. Then, patients in the intervention 
group received 3 doses of 1 g l-carnitine (in total 3 g/day) 
in soluble form (from BSK, Zist Takhmir Co, Tehran, 
Iran), along with enteral feeding, for 7 days. Participants

in the control group received a placebo (distilled water) 
with the same dose and duration.
Participants in different treatment arms received all 
common medications and the standard treatments, and 
our intervention was used as adjunctive therapy. l-Car -
nitine and placebo vials were produced by the BSK, Zist 
Takhmir Co, Tehran, Iran, with similar shape, odor, taste, 
and package and tagged 1 and 2.
All of the participants were visited routinely on all 
intervention days and probed for any undesirable effects 
by a physician and reported. Return empty drug vials 
were used for assessing adherence.
Randomization
The block randomization method with a fixed block size 
of 4 was used for assigning participants into interven -
tion or control arms. Allocation sequence generation was 
conducted by a blinded statistician.
Blinding
Drugs (l-carnitine and placebo) were produced by the 
mentioned company with 1 or 2 labels in a similar vial 
package, so patients or their guardians, physicians, and 
investigators were fully blinded. A sealed and opaque 
envelope was prepared by the company and presented 
along with drugs that were only revealed after analysis of 
data to determine the contents of the vial. Furthermore, 
nurses, laboratory staff, and analysts were also blinded. 
The data coordinator and trial steering committee had 
access to group allocations by accessing concealment 
sealed envelopes.
Outcomes
Fasting blood glucose (FBG), sodium (Na), potassium 
(K), calcium (Ca), magnesium (Mg), aspartate ami -
notransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), 
Alb, total protein, and lactate are the primary outcomes 
of the current study. Secondary outcomes include white 
blood cells (WBC), hemoglobin (Hb), platelet (PLT), 
blood urea nitrogen (BUN), serum creatinine (Cr), and 
international normalized ratio (INR). All outcomes were 
assessed at baseline and the 7th day after the interven -
tion. Blood samples were drawn from patients, and after 
adding EDTA to samples and centrifuging at 3000 rpm 
and 4 °C, samples were stored at −80 °C.
All measurements were routinely performed in the 
central clinical laboratory of Imam Reza Hospital, Mash -
had, Iran, using standard kits.
Statistical methods
Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) ver -
sion 16 was used for analyzing data. Statistical signifi -
cance was accepted, a priori, at a P-value < 0.05. Data 
were tested for normality by the Q-Q plot and Kolmog -
orov-Smirnov test. Baseline data of each group were ana -
lyzed by the chi-squared test and independent sample 
t-test. Intergroup comparisons of pre-intervention and 
post-intervention were assessed using a paired samples 
t-test. After adjusting baseline variables, intragroup com -
parisons were carried out using analysis of covariance 
(ANCOVA). The Muchly test of sphericity was evalu -
ated, and when it was violated, we adopted a multivari -
ate analysis of variance. Differences between qualitative 
outcomes were compared by using the chi-squared test 
or Fisher exact test. Continuous and categorical vari -
ables were reported as mean ± standard deviation (SD) 
(except for mean change of variables that were reported 
as mean ± standard error (SE)) and frequency (per -
centage), respectively. Before analysis, non-normal, 
positively skewed data were subjected to logarithmic 
transformation.
Results
A total of 460 patients were assessed for eligibility; among 
them, 390 patients were excluded for not meeting the 
inclusion criteria (68 for personal reasons and 2 refused 
to take part in the study). Finally, 54 patients were ran -
domly assigned into the intervention (3 g l-carnitine per 
day) and control (3 g placebo per day) groups. It is impor-
tant to note that 3 participants in the intervention group 
dropped out (2 persons expired and 1 person for hemodi-
alysis). In the control group, no dropout occurred. There-
fore, 24 participants in the l-carnitine group and 27 in 
the placebo group completed the trial. The CONSORT 
diagram of the current study is shown in Fig. 1.
The baseline data are detailed in Table 3. The mean age 
of study participants was 57.7 ± 14.9 years, whilst 29 of 
the participants were men and 22 were women. There 
were no significant differences between the two groups 
in terms of demographic variables (Table  3) (P-value for 
all > 0.05). Differences between monitoring variables at 
baseline were non-significant (P-value > 0.05), except for 
total and direct bilirubin (P-value < 0.05). At baseline, the 
underlying diseases of included patients were not signifi -
cantly different (all P-value > 0.05) (Tables 2 and 3).
The mean levels of monitoring laboratory variables 
before and after intervention are shown in Table 4.
In regard to primary outcomes, l-carnitine supple -
mentation significantly reduced ALT (P-value: 0.003), 
AST (P-value: 0.020), total bilirubin (P-value: 0.026), and 
lactate (P-value: 0.013) and significantly increased Alb 
(P-value: 0.000) and total protein (P-value: 0.001) in the 
intervention group, at the end of the study, compared 
with baseline. The between-group analysis revealed that 
l-carnitine significantly decreased ALT (P-value: 0.022), 
lactate (P-value < 0.001), and increased Ca (P-value: 
Page 4 of 8Yahyapoor et al. Trials            (2023) 24:3 
0.044), Alb (P-value: 0.001), and total protein (P-value: 
0.003) in the intervention group, in comparison with the 
control group (Table 4).
In regard to ancillary outcomes, l-carnitine supple -
mentation significantly reduced Cr (P-value: 0.028) in 
the intervention group, at the end of the study, compared 
with baseline. The between-group analysis revealed that 
l-carnitine significantly decreased INR (P-value: 0.049) 
and Cr (P-value: 0.005) in the intervention group, in 
comparison with the control group (Table 4).
Discussion
Our clinical trial, which was carried out in critically ill 
patients, demonstrated a statistically significant reduc -
tion in INR, Cr, ALT, and lactate and significant increases 
in Ca, Alb, and total protein, following l-carnitine sup -
plementation, in comparison with the placebo group.
l-Carnitine supplementation in critically ill patients is 
a contemporary topic of debate [13]. To our knowledge, 
this is the first study to have evaluated the effects of 3 g/
day l-carnitine enteral supplementation on monitoring 
variables in general ICU patients. In recent years, many 
studies have investigated l-carnitine effects on various 
conditions; in 2014, Lee et  al. showed that 1 g/day of 
l-carnitine capsules resulted in a reduction of inflam -
mation in coronary artery disease (CAD) patients [14]. 
A recent trial that we conducted on 56 ICU-admitted 
patients with 3 g l-carnitine supplements revealed that 
CRP and IL-6 were reduced significantly in the interven -
tion group vs. the control group. SOFA and APACHE

of the patients and predicts mortality risk were reduced 
significantly in the intervention group in compari -
son with the control group. Additionally, the duration 
of mechanical ventilation was reached in a significant 
reduction, and also, ICU discharge was significantly 
shorter in the l-carnitine group in comparison with the 
control group [15]. A meta-analysis by Song et al. which 
was conducted on 17 randomized clinical trials cleared 
that l-carnitine supplementation can improve clinical 
symptoms and cardiac function [16]. In another placebo-
controlled trial conducted in hemodialysis patients, 
participants received 1 g l-carnitine for 3 months, and 
at the end of the trial, CRP was significantly reduced, 
although Alb, parathyroid hormone (PTH), and ferritin 
did not change [17]. Mahmoodpoor et  al. administered 
2 g l-carnitine per day by enteral tube feeding, in com -
parison with water as a placebo, to traumatic brain injury 
(TBI) patients for 7 days and revealed that l-carnitine 
can improve neurobehavioral function and cerebral 
edema [18]. In a randomized controlled trial carried out 
on 250 septic shock patients, single infusion doses of 18 
g, 12 g, and 6 g of l-carnitine, vs. a saline placebo, had no 
effects on the 28-mortality rate at any dose [19]. Chronic 
critically ill ICU patients are at risk for l-carnitine defi -
ciency due to prolonged parenteral nutrition, malnutri -
tion, and renal failure; in addition, studies have revealed 
that serum carnitine tends to be notably reduced in these 
patients [7, 10, 20].
The findings of the current study indicated that 3 g/day 
l-carnitine for 7 days can increase Alb and total protein.

A randomized controlled trial conducted on 42 hemodi -
alysis patients who were supplemented with intravenous 
(IV) l-carnitine, at a dosage of 20 mg/kg after each hemo-
dialysis round (three times per week), revealed that, after 
6 months, total protein and Alb significantly increased in 
the intervention group [21]. Another trial conducted on 
hemodialysis patients who received 15 mg/kg of l-car -
nitine, intravenously, 3 times/week, found that after 3 
months, total protein was increased, and after 6 months, 
Alb was significantly increased [22]. Nevertheless, 2000 
mg/day l-carnitine or placebo oral supplementation in 
46 chronic hemodialysis patients for 3 months showed 
no effect on serum Alb [17]. In malnourished ICU stay 
patients, Alb and total protein are usually decreased 
[23]. The Alb enhancement in the current trial might be 
attributable to the reduction in inflammation because it 
is a negative acute phase protein indicator [24]; indeed, 
we hypothesized that total protein increments might be 
due to metabolism improvement and boosting anabolism 
of patients. Moreover, in the current study, Ca increased 
significantly in the intervention group compared with 
the control group, which might be due to the improve -
ment in energy hemostasis and nutritional status of the 
patients in response to the l-carnitine supplementation.
ALT and AST were significantly reduced in our study 
at day 7 in the intervention group but were only signifi -
cant between the groups for ALT. Because of tissue dam -
age, ALT and AST increased, and, typically, ALT will be 
raised to a greater extent than AST [25]. Concordant 
with our results, a randomized clinical trial that evalu -
ated the effects of 750 mg l-carnitine 3 times per day or 
placebo, in 60 type 2 diabetic patients with nonalcoholic 
fatty liver disease (NAFLD), reported that ALT and AST 
declined significantly in the intervention vs. the control 
group [26]. In another study, 2000 mg/day l-carnitine 
supplementation in 74 participants with nonalcoholic 
steatohepatitis (NASH), for 6 months, yielded a reduc -
tion in ALT and AST in the intervention group at study 
cessation [27]. Interestingly, a systematic review and 
meta-analysis of 19 randomized trials reported a reduc -
tion of ALT and AST following l-carnitine supplemen -
tation. Moreover, in the ensuant subgroup analysis, the

authors showed that l-carnitine supplementation had a 
significant and beneficial effect on ALT and AST, only at 
dosages ≥2 g/day, whilst treatment periods less than 12 
weeks or more than 12 weeks were both meaningful [28]. 
It is plausible that a reduction in inflammatory biomark -
ers and hepatic fibrogenesis may have contributed to a 
reduction in ALT and AST.
Creatinine is the product of muscle creatine catabo -
lism, and in the present study, it decreased significantly, 
which may be attributable to improved muscle damage. 
Similarly, in a previous meta-analysis study, l-carnitine 
supplementation improved muscle damage, where the 
authors posited that the reduction in muscle damage 
might be because of a concurrent improvement in oxida -
tive stress status [29].
In accordance with our results, Hajihashemi et  al. 
found a reduction in lactate in migraine patients in 
response to 8 weeks of supplementation with l-carnitine 
and CoQ10 (500 mg and 30 mg per day, respectively), in 
comparison with placebo [30]. Bakker et  al. noted that 
decreased tissue oxygenation can increase serum lactate, 
which is an important practical monitoring variable in 
many diseases, including critically ill patients. Critically 
ill patients are under consistent biological stress condi -
tions, wherein lactate will be derived from anaerobic 
glucose metabolism (glycolysis), which produces energy 
2−3 times faster than oxidative phosphorylation, and is 
vital to critical patients who are in an energy crisis [31]. 
Once a patient enters the recovery phase, lactate converts 
to pyruvate for energy production in large amounts, and 
l-carnitine might be boosting this action.
The antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects of l-car-
nitine have been discussed previously, but the concurrent 
effects on monitoring variables have not been reported. 
Our study was the first in this regard. Other strengths of 
our trial include the acquisition of full monitoring data. 
However, despite the novelty of the current study, some 
limitations should be noted: for instance, the low quan -
tity of participants. Moreover, due to budgetary limita -
tions, we were unable to assess plasma carnitine levels, 
which would have represented a useful addition. Heter -
ogenous participants can be another limitation; however, 
given the nature of the population, this may be unavoid -
able. Additionally, we could not assess micronutrients 
in the blood, whilst precise weight and height measure -
ments were infeasible due to the ICU conditions.
Conclusion
Our trial results showed that l-carnitine supplementa -
tion in critically ill patients can improve several param -
eters, including INR, Cr, ALT, lactate, Ca, Alb, and total 
protein. However, more clinical trials are needed to clar -
ify these results.
