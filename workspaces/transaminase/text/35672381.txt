Elevated plasma concentrations of asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA) are associated with an 
increased risk of mortality and adverse cardiovascular outcomes. ADMA can be metabolized by 
dimethylarginine dimethylaminohydrolases (DDAHs) and by alanine‑glyoxylate aminotransferase 
2 (AGXT2). Deletion of DDAH1 in mice leads to elevation of ADMA in plasma and increase in blood 
pressure, while overexpression of human DDAH1 is associated with a lower plasma ADMA 
concentration and protective cardiovascular effects. The possible role of alternative metabolism of 
ADMA by AGXT2 remains to be elucidated. The goal of the current study was to test the hypothesis 
that transgenic overexpression of AGXT2 leads to lowering of plasma levels of ADMA and protection 
from vascular damage in the setting of DDAH1 deficiency. We generated transgenic mice (TG) 
with ubiquitous overexpression of AGXT2. qPCR and Western Blot confirmed the expression of the

transgene. Systemic ADMA levels were decreased by 15% in TG mice. In comparison with wild type 
animals plasma levels of asymmetric dimethylguanidino valeric acid (ADGV), the AGXT2 associated 
metabolite of ADMA, were six times higher. We crossed AGXT2 TG mice with DDAH1 knockout mice 
and observed that upregulation of AGXT2 lowers plasma ADMA and pulse pressure and protects the 
mice from endothelial dysfunction and adverse aortic remodeling. Upregulation of AGXT2 led to 
lowering of ADMA levels and protection from ADMA‑induced vascular damage in the setting of DDAH1 
deficiency. This is especially important, because all the efforts to develop pharmacological ADMA‑
lowering interventions by means of upregulation of DDAHs have been unsuccessful.

Elevated plasma concentrations of asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA) are independently associated with 
adverse cardiovascular  effect1 increased mortality, and adverse cardiovascular  outcomes2. In vitro experiments 
and mouse models of  disrupted3,4 or  augmented5,6 ADMA metabolism suggest a causal role. The ADMA action 
as an inhibitor of nitric oxide  synthase7,8 is considered a major, but possibly not the only, underlying patho-
mechanism. This has opened the quest for therapeutic approaches to lower plasma ADMA, with a focus on 
 metabolism9 and transport as possible  targets10. The major metabolic route responsible for ADMA breakdown is 
its hydrolysis by dimethylarginine dimethylaminohydrolases 1 and 2 (DDAH1 and DDAH2) with formation of 
citrulline and dimethylamine. The relative contribution of DDAH2 towards ADMA clearance is still a matter of 
 controversy4,8,11,12. The DDAH-ADMA pathway has been shown to play an important role in vascular homeostasis 
in vivo13. Heterozygous Ddah1 knockout mice demonstrated increased ADMA levels, elevated blood pressure 
and impairment of NO-related endothelial  function3. In contrast, overexpression of either DDAH1 or DDAH2 
in transgenic mice led to decreased plasma ADMA levels and increased NO  bioavailability11,14.
Several studies suggested that the increase of ADMA in cardiovascular and metabolic diseases is caused by 
downregulation of DDAHs at the level of expression or  activity15–17. Manipulations of activity of ADMA-lowering 
enzymes might be a promising strategy for treatment of cardiovascular diseases. To our best knowledge, multiple 
attempts to develop small molecules upregulating DDAHs have failed, potentially because these enzymes are 
very small and possibly do not have sites for allosteric  regulation18–20.
Although the DDAHs are thought to represent the main and the best characterized metabolic pathway for 
the elimination of ADMA, the enzyme alanine:glyoxylate aminotransferase 2 (AGXT2) has also been suggested 
to play an important role in ADMA catabolism. AGXT2 is a mitochondrial aminotransferase, expressed primar-
ily in kidney and liver, catalyzing transamination of ADMA as the amino donor with formation of asymmetric 
α-keto-δ-(N,N-dimethylguanidino)valeric acid (ADGV). Downregulation of AGXT2 leads to elevation of sys-
temic ADMA  levels21,22. We have previously demonstrated that overexpression of AGXT2 by adenoviral vectors 
lowers ADMA in vivo23. However, the transient character of adenoviral overexpression did not allow estimation 
of the long term physiological consequences of AGXT2 upregulation.
AGXT2 might be an alternative target for ADMA-lowering interventions. The goal of the current study was 
to test the hypothesis that upregulation of AGXT2 can protect from ADMA-induced vascular damage in the 
setting of DDAH1-deficiency. To test this hypothesis we generated and characterized AGXT2 transgenic mice 
and determined, whether this transgene can protect Ddah1 knockout mice from ADMA elevation, endothelial 
dysfunction and aortic remodeling.
Materials and methods
Generation of AGXT2 transgenic mice. All animal experiments were approved by local authorities and 
were performed according to the guidelines from Directive 2010/63/EU of the European Parliament on the 
protection of animals used for scientific purposes. The study is reported in accordance with ARRIVE guidelines.
C57BL/6J mice (The Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, ME, USA) were used to create the AGXT2 transgenic 
line (AGXT2 TG). Protocols were approved by the animal welfare committee of the Technische Universität 
Dresden, Germany. Mice were maintained on a 12-h light/dark cycle and provided with standard chow and 
water ad libitum. A human AGXT2 transgenic construct, containing human AGXT2 coupled with a FLAG 
epitope on C-terminus (GenBank accession number KU847977), a CAG  promoter24 and RNA processing signals 
from SV40 polyA was synthesized by GenScript (www. gensc ript. com). This 3761-bp sequence was cloned into 
the EcoRV site of the pUC57 vector. The resulting construct was digested with ScaI/SalI/BglII. After agarose 
gel electrophoresis, the DNA fragment containing the targeting construct was excised as a ScaI-SalI fragment, 
purified and used for the generation of transgenic mice. Fertilized eggs were harvested from superovulated 
C57BL/6J mice for pronuclear injection of 5 µL of purified DNA. Embryos were transferred into the oviducts 
of pseudopregnant foster mothers. Genomic DNA was isolated from tail biopsies at 3–4 weeks of age using a 
DNeasy kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) and analyzed by PCR to identify the presence of the transgene. PCR 
analysis was performed using transgene-specific oligonucleotide primers (forward 5′-GTT GGC AGA GGC AGC 
ATT  and reverse 5′-GTC GTC ATC CTT GTA ATC CTT AGC ). Transgenic mice were compared with age-, weight-, 
and sex-matched wild type littermates.

Crossing of AGXT2 TG mice with DDAH1 KO mice. Ddah1 knockout mice were bred, genotyped and 
housed as previously  described4. Heterozygous Ddah1 knockout mice (DDAH1 KO) were bred with heterozy-
gous AGXT2 TG mice to generate homozygous DDAH1 KO littermates with and without AGXT2 transgene.
Collection of plasma and tissues. Mice were anesthetized with ketamine/xylazine solution (15 mg/mL 
ketamine, 1 mg/mL xylazine, dose 0.1 mL/10 g body weight) and blood was collected by cardiac puncture into 
ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA)–containing tubes (final concentration of EDTA: 5 mmol/L). Plasma 
was separated by centrifugation and stored at − 80 °C. Tissue samples of aorta, brain, heart, kidney, liver, lung, 
skeletal muscle and spleen were collected, immediately afterwards flash frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored 
at − 80 °C until further analysis.
Measurement of ADMA, SDMA, ADGV and creatinine in plasma and urine. Plasma and urine 
levels of ADMA were measured by isotope dilution liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC–
MS–MS) as described  previously25. ADGV levels in plasma were also determined by LC–MS/MS, applying the 
procedure specific for this  analyte26. Creatinine was measured by high-performance liquid chromatography as 
described  previously27.
Blood pressure measurements. Blood pressure was measured in 16 week old mice using an intra-arte-
rial telemetric transmitter system  (PhysioTel®, TA11PAC10, Data Sciences International (DSI), New Brighton, 
MN, USA) as described in Ref.28. Briefly, a catheter connected to the blood pressure sensor was placed in the left 
common carotid artery under general isoflurane anesthesia and the transmitter was implanted subcutaneously 
over the abdominal area. Mean arterial pressure was detected and recorded continuously for 4 weeks by the 
Dataquest A.R.T. TM System (Data Sciences International (DSI), New Brighton, MN, USA). Mean blood pres-
sure values or heart rates were calculated by the  Dataquest® software. The protocol was approved by the animal 
welfare committee.
Real‑time polymerase chain reaction. Messenger RNA (mRNA) levels of human AGXT2 transgene, 
mouse AGXT2, total (endogenous + transgenic) AGXT2 genes, DDAH1 and DDAH2 genes were determined 
by real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). The RNA isolation from tissues was 
carried out using the RNeasy RNA extraction kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). Reversed transcription of the 
isolated RNA to cDNA was achieved by applying the High Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription Kit (Applied 
Biosystems, Foster City, USA). All kits were applied according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The amplifica-
tion of the cDNA templates for quantification was carried out using the Maxima SYBR Green/ROX Master Mix 
(Thermo Fisher Scientific, Dreieich, Germany). DNA was first denaturated for 10 min at 95 °C, followed by 40 
cycles of denaturation for 15 s at 95 °C and annealing and extending for 60 s at 60 °C. Data were analyzed using 
Applied Biosystems 7500 software (version 2.0.5, Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) and expressed as 
a ratio to levels of hypoxantin-guanin-phosphoribosyltransferase (HPRT) mRNA. The primer pairs used in the 
real-time RT-PCR for amplification of the respective cDNA sequences were designed using the Sigma Oligo-
architect primer tool (www. oligo archi tect. com). The selected primer pair sequences for mouse AGXT2 were 
forward 5′-CAG GGA GGA AGG CGA GAA TG and reverse 5′-CTT  GGC AGC AGT CTG TAG CA; human trans-
genic AGXT2 forward 5′-GTT GGC AGA GGC AGC ATT  and reverse 5′-GTC GTC ATC CTT GTA ATC CTT AGC; 
total (transgenic + endogenous) AGXT2 forward 5′-TGG GCT  CTC ACT TCT GGG  and reverse 5′-CAC  CTC 
AAG CAC AGC AGA T; mouse DDAH1 forward 5′-CTA CGC AGT CTC TAC AGT  and reverse 5′-TCA TAA CGA 
TGG TCA CTC A; mouse DDAH2 forward 5′-AAA GCA GTC AGG GCA ATG  and reverse 5′-CCA GGA CGC AGA 
AAG AGA , mouse HPRT forward 5′-CTT  TGC TGA CCT GCT GGA TTAC and reverse 5′-GGA CCT CTC GAA 
GTG TTG GAT. The primer oligomers were synthesized by Biomers (Ulm, Germany).
Western blot. Tissue samples of mice were homogenized in ice-cold 0.2% SDS solution containing a pro-
tease inhibitor mixture (Mini-complete Protease Inhibitor Cocktail Tablets; Roche Diagnostics-Applied Science, 
Mannheim, Germany). Protein concentrations were determined using a standard BCA protein assay (Rockford, 
IL, USA) according to manufacturer’s instructions.
For immunoblot analysis, tissue homogenates (15 μg of total protein) from aorta, brain, heart, kidney, liver, 
lung, skeletal muscle and spleen of mice were prepared and diluted with Laemmli buffer (62 mM Tris–HCl pH 
6.8, 2% SDS, 10% glycerol, 0.01% bromophenol blue, and 0.4 mM dithiothreitol). After incubation at 95 °C for 
5 min, proteins were separated by SDS–PAGE under reducing conditions on 10% polyacrylamide gels and trans-
ferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Protran Nitrocellulose Transfer Membrane; Whatman, Dassel, Germany) 
using a tank blotting system from Bio-Rad (Munich, Germany). The Western Blot analysis was performed as 
described in Ref.29. Membranes were stained by Ponceau reagent (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MI, USA) to control 
for the protein transfer and then blocked in 5% milk for 1 h at 37 °C. For AGXT2-FLAG detection membranes 
were incubated overnight at 4 °C with a 1:500 mouse monoclonal anti-FLAG antibody (Sigma-Aldrich, St. 
Louis, MI, USA, Catalog #F3165), washed three times in TBST (50 mM Tris–HCl pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 0.1% 
Tween 20) and then incubated with a 1:10,000 horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse antibody 
(BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA, USA) for 2 h at room temperature (RT). Immunoreactive bands were visualized 
using Roche Lumi-Light Western Blotting Substrate (Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany). To control for 
sample loading, membranes were incubated with 1:500 polyclonal rabbit anti-GAPDH antibodies (Trevigen, 
Gaithersburg, MD, USA, Catalog # 2275-pc-100) for 1 h at RT, washed three times in TBST (50 mM Tris–HCl 
pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20) and then incubated with a 1:10,000 horseradish peroxidase-conjugated

goat anti-rabbit antibody (The Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, ME, USA) for 2 h at RT. Blotted proteins were 
detected using a PeqLab Fusion Fx7 Imaging System (PeqLab, Erlangen, Germany).
Vasomotor function studies ex vivo. Mice were anesthetized with ketamine (100 mg/kg i.p.) and xyla-
zine (10 mg/kg i.p.) followed by dissection of the thoracic aorta. Aortas were placed in Krebs’ buffer, connective 
tissue was removed, and vessels were cut into rings (length 3–4 mm). Aortic rings were placed into individual 
wells of 48-well cell-culture dishes containing 0.5 mL Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium containing 5 mmol/L 
glucose, 120 U/mL penicillin, 120 g/mL streptomycin and 50 g/mL polymyxin B. Vascular rings were connected 
to a force transducer at a final tension of 0.5 g to measure isometric tension in an organ bath containing Krebs’ 
solution maintained at 37 °C as previously  described30,31. At the beginning of the experiment dose–response 
curves to phenylephrine (PE) were obtained. After resting tone was reestablished, the vessels were precontracted 
to 60% of the maximal response to PE. Afterwards, relaxation dose–response curves were generated by cumula-
tive addition of the endothelium-dependent vasodilator acetylcholine (ACh) or the endothelium-independent 
vasodilator sodium nitroprusside (SNP). The percent contraction in response to SNP and ACh was calculated 
in comparison to baseline.
Cell culture studies. Primary aortic cells were isolated from murine aortas as described  previously32. 
Briefly, two male mice were anesthetized with an intraperitoneal injection of 0.3–0.4 mL of pentobarbital sodium 
(10 mg/mL) per mouse. The aorta was dissected from the aortic arch to the abdominal aorta, and immersed in 
DMEM with 20% FBS containing 1000 U/mL of heparin. The fat and connecting tissues were rapidly removed 
with fine forceps under a stereoscopic microscope. A 24-gauge cannula was then inserted into the proximal 
portion of the aorta. After ligation at the site with a silk thread, the lumen was briefly washed with serum-free 
DMEM. The other side was sutured and the aorta was filled with collagenase type II solution (2 mg/mL, dis-
solved in serum-free DMEM). After incubation for 45 min at 37 °C, endothelial cells were removed from the 
aorta by flushing with 5 mL of DMEM containing 20% FBS. Endothelial cells were collected by centrifugation 
at 1200 rpm for 5 min. The pelleted cells were gently resuspended by pipette with 2 mL of 20% FBS-DMEM 
and cultured in a 35 mm collagen type I-coated dish. To remove smooth muscle cells, after 2 h incubation at 
37 °C the medium was removed, the cells were washed with warmed PBS, and medium G (20% FBS, 100 U/
mL penicillin-G, 100 μg/mL streptomycin, 2 mM l-glutamine, 1 × non-essential amino acids, 1 × so-1 × sodium 
pyruvate, 25 mM HEPES (pH 7.0–7.6), 100 μg/mL heparin, 100 μg/mL ECGS, and DMEM) was added. The cells 
were grown for 1 week, and used for subsequent immunocytochemistry.
Immunocytochemistry. To analyze human AGXT2 transgene expression cell slides with primary aortic 
cells were fixed with 1:1 acetone-methanol solution for 10  min at 4  °C, washed 3 × 2  min with ice-cold PBS 
and blocked with Dako Protein Blocking solution for 20 min at room temperature. Afterwards, chamber slides 
were incubated with 1:100 rabbit polyclonal anti-FLAG antibodies (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MI, USA, Catalog 
#7425) for 2 h at 37 °C, washed 3 × 2 min with PBS and subsequently incubated with 1:250 anti-rabbit antibod-
ies coupled with fluorescence dye (The Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, ME, USA) at room temperature for 
1 h. Finally, slides were washed 3 × 2 min with PBS, stained with 1:1000 DAPI and mounted with Moviol. To 
demonstrate the expression of human AGXT2-FLAG transgene in endothelial cells 1:100 rat anti-CD31 anti-
bodies (Biolegend, San Diego, CA, USA, Catalog # 102401) (as marker of endothelial  cells33), and 1:250 anti-rat 
secondary antibodies (The Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, ME, USA) were used. Double staining of CD31 and 
FLAG-tagged transgene was performed in the same way.
Histochemistry. Immediately after isolation heart samples were fixed in cold 4% paraformaldehyde diluted 
in phosphate-buffered saline at 4 °C and processed for paraffin embedding, cross-sectioned to obtain 4 µm-thick 
sections and mounted on glass slides. Tissue sections were deparaffinized in xylene 3 × 5 min and rehydrated 
in descending concentrations of ethanol (100%, 96%, 70% and 40%, 2 min each). Picrosirius red staining for 
collagen I and III was performed on rehydrated sections using 1% Sirius Red/Fast Green solution for 30 min at 
room temperature. Staining for elastin was performed on rehydrated sections using resorcin-fuchsine solution 
for 30 min at room temperature. The slides were then washed in distilled water for 2 min, immersed in 80% 
ethanol for 5–10 min and put in distilled water. The sections were then dehydrated in ascending concentrations 
of ethanol, cleared in xylene 3 × 5 min and mounted with DePeX mounting medium. The morphometric analysis 
was performed in ImageJ (National Institute of Health).
Statistical analysis. Statistical analysis was performed using GraphPad Prism 9.0.0. Comparisons between 
the groups were performed by one-way ANOV A (with factor groups) followed by Tukey multiple comparison 
test or two-way ANOV A (with a repeated measures factor time and factor group) followed by Sidak multiple 
comparison test. Statistical significance was defined as a P value < 0.05. Values are reported as mean ± standard 
error of the mean. N number and the name of the specific statistical test performed are provided in the figure 
legends.
Results
Phenotype of AGXT2 transgenic mice. We successfully generated the AGXT2 transgenic mice. PCR 
analysis revealed the 150-bp PCR fragments of the transgene in AGXT2 TG mice, whereas in WT mice these 
fragments were absent (Fig.  1). Transgenic mice did not differ from control littermates in general appearance. 
They developed normally and were fertile. Transgenic offspring was obtained in a Mendelian ratio. Detailed

necropsies of 15 mice (7 male/8 female) aged 12 weeks revealed no anatomic abnormalities. There was no signifi-
cant difference in the systolic blood pressure between the TG and WT mice measured by the telemetric transmit-
ter system method (Supplementary Data). Aortas from transgenic mice had improved endothelial response to 
acetylcholine as compared to wild type littermates (Supplementary Data).
Distribution of AGXT2 transgene in various tissues. The AGXT2 transgene was detected by qPCR in 
all tissues examined. The maximum amount of human AGXT2 was revealed by Western Blot in heart, liver and 
skeletal muscle (Fig. 2a). These results were consistent with results obtained by RT-PCR (Fig. 2b). Total expres-
sion of AGXT2 in kidney and liver (the only organs expressing endogenous AGXT2) from AGXT2 transgenic 
mice were ~ 10 times higher than in WT mice (Fig. 2c). There were no major differences in DDAH1 and DDAH2 
expression levels between transgenic and wild-type animals (Fig. 2d,e).
Effect of transgenic AGXT2 overexpression on ADMA and ADGV plasma, urine and tissue lev‑
els. Biochemical analysis of mice overexpressing AGXT2 demonstrated lower plasma ADMA levels in these 
mice (13% lower versus WT mice; Fig. 3a), whereas ADGV levels in both plasma and urine of TG mice were 4 
times higher (Fig.  3a,b) in comparison with controls. Tissue content of ADMA in hearts and lungs of AGXT2 
transgenic mice were 50% lower in comparison with WT controls. The tissue levels of ADGV in hearts and lungs 
and of AGXT2 TG mice were significantly higher than in controls (Fig. 3c,d).
Immunofluorescence analysis of AGXT2 TG aortas. To further confirm the expression of AGXT2 
transgene in endothelial cells in the aorta we used double immunofluorescence staining. The AGXT2 transgene 
was detected in primary cells from aortas, which also expressed CD31 as an endothelial  marker28 (Fig. 4).
Rescue of phenotype of DDAH1 KO mice by transgenic overexpression of AGXT2. Aortas from 
DDAH1 KO mice crossed with AGXT2 TG mice demonstrated significantly improved endothelium-dependent 
vasodilatation in comparison with DDAH1 KO mice (Fig.  5a). Endothelium-independent vasodilatation was 
diminished at low concentrations of sodium nitroprusside in the AGXT2 TG group compared to the AGXT2 
TG crossed with DDAH1 KO mice (Fig. 5b). Plasma ADMA levels in DDAH KO mice crossed with AGXT2 TG 
mice were significantly lower than in DDAH1 KO mice (Fig. 5c). AGXT2 TG mice also had substantially reduced 
pulse pressure as compared to the DDAH1 KO mice crossed with AGXT2 TG animals (Fig.  6). There were no 
significant differences in systolic and diastolic blood pressure, heart rate or activity of the animals (Fig. 7a–d). In 
line with the difference in pulse pressure, the elastin content was increased in AGXT2 TG crossed with DDAH1 
KO mice as compared to the DDAH1 KO animals (Fig. 8).
Discussion
In the current manuscript we report the successful generation of transgenic mice with global overexpression of 
human AGXT2. The mice were viable, with normal growth development and fertility. The transgene was present 
in all tissues examined and did not influence the expression of DDAH1 or DDAH2 in the majority of tissues.

metabolism by AGXT2) in comparison to the wild type animals demonstrated the physiological importance of 
AGXT2 in maintaining homeostatic levels of endogenous methylarginines. The observation that the decrease 
in plasma ADMA levels was less pronounced, than the associated with it increase in ADGV levels points to the 
vital importance of maintaining homeostatic ADMA concentrations and tight regulation of its levels.
In the second part of the manuscript, we were able to demonstrate that overexpression of AGXT2 restores 
physiological levels of ADMA and protects from endothelial dysfunction in DDAH1 deficiency. The mechanism 
responsible for the impaired response to the low concentrations of the endothelium-independent vasodilator SNP 
observed in the AGXT2 TG mice irrespective of DDAH1 is not clear. It might indicate a slight desensitization of 
the signal transduction pathway downstream of NO, as a possible compensatory effect for chronically decreased 
intracellular ADMA levels. Furthermore, overexpression of AGXT2 in DDAH1 KO mice led to a decrease in 
pulse blood pressure without affecting physical activity and heart rate. Interestingly, the amount of elastic fibers 
in aortas of DDAH1 KO mice was lower than in aortas of the DDAH1 KO/AGXT2 TG littermates. This suggests 
that a decrease in pulse pressure in the DDAH1 KO/AGXT2 TG compared to the DDAH1 KO littermates could 
be explained by the protective effects of AGXT2 overexpression and ADMA lowering on aortic remodeling.
Generation of the DDAH1 transgenic mice (DDAH1 TG) was a major breakthrough in cardiovascular 
research. It demonstrated that upregulation of DDAH1 lowers plasma and tissue ADMA levels and increases 
basal and stimulated NO production. It also protected from experimental atherosclerosis, hind limb ischemia,

myocardial ischemia–reperfusion injury, from vascular hypertrophy and stiffening in the setting of hypertension 
and hyperhomocysteinemia and from graft coronary artery  disease5,6,14,34–40. Given the multiple cardiovascular 
protective effects of DDAH1 overexpression in mice mentioned above, therapeutic upregulation of DDAH1 
may provide major benefits to patients with high cardiovascular risk. Several screens for small molecules modu-
lating DDAH1 activity yielded multiple specific DDAH1 inhibitors, but unfortunately no promising DDAH1 
 activators18–20,41. One potential explanation might be that DDAH1 has a relatively small size and does not require 
cofactors. Therefore, it is unlikely that the enzyme has endogenous allosteric regulatory mechanisms, which could 
be therapeutically upregulated. Lack of DDAH1 activators might have affected the interest to target ADMA as a 
cardiovascular risk factor. In contrast to DDAHs, AGXT2 is larger and requires a cofactor, which increases the 
probability that this enzyme could be allosterically upregulated by small molecules (i.e. serve as a target for phar-
macological interventions). Our study is therefore a key “proof of principle” investigation analysing the feasibility 
of therapeutic lowering of ADMA by targeting AGXT2. At least in our model, chronic upregulation of AGXT2 
activity lowered systemic ADMA levels and protected from ADMA-induced vascular injury without any obvious 
phenotypical abnormalities. Further investigations of physiological consequences of chronic AGXT2 upregula-
tion in other models of cardiovascular, metabolic and renal injury are needed to further assess the potential of 
AGXT2 upregulation as a therapeutic ADMA-lowering intervention. Our newly generated AGXT2 TG mouse 
line provides a valuable research tool for this purpose. However, it has to be emphasized that AGXT2 has multiple 
substrates, which raises a concern about potential side effects of the chronic increase of its enzymatic activity.

While the multiple protective cardiovascular phenotypes of DDAH1 transgenic mice are strongly supportive 
for the causative role of ADMA in cardiovascular injury, a possibility still exists that at least some of the ben-
eficial cardiovascular effects of DDAH1 upregulation might be ADMA-independent. Indeed, in last few years 
the non-enzymatic effects of DDAH1 have been investigated. The group of Tokuo and colleagues showed that 
DDAH1 can bind to tumor suppressor neurofibromin 1 (NF1), which is a negative regulator of the Ras pathway 
increasing its phosphorylation by protein kinase  A42. NF1 is known to regulate the migration and proliferation of 
vascular smooth muscle  cells43. Therefore, there is an intriguing possibility that the altered NF1 function may be 
at least partially responsible for the vascular phenotype observed in the DDAH1 transgenic mice. The existence of 
ADMA-independent functions of DDAH1 is also supported by the study showing that upregulation of DDAH1 
with mutated active site was able to influence the growth of glioma xenografts, while the total DDAH activity 
in the cells lysates was no  altered44. What is more, downregulation of DDAH1 in a mouse model of bleomycin-
induced lung fibrosis decreased collagen production by fibroblasts in an ADMA-independent  manner45. Genera-
tion of the AGXT2 TG mice, which is described in the current manuscript, provides a valuable tool for lowering 
ADMA in vivo by a DDAH1-independent mechanism and therefore allows discrimination between protective 
effects mediated by lowering ADMA and other potentially beneficial mechanism implicating the non-enzymatic 
functions of DDAH1. Our current data from DDAH1 KO mice overexpressing AGXT2 showed for the first time 
that ADMA-lowering can protect from vascular injury even in the complete absence of DDAH1.
In the summary, our study demonstrated for the first time that chronic AGXT2 upregulation can protect 
from ADMA-mediated vascular injury in vivo without causing obvious phenotypical abnormalities. We have 
created a unique mouse model for studying the in vivo effects of ADMA lowering by a DDAH1-independent 
mechanism, which creates a basis for further exploration of AGXT2 as a possible target for cardiovascular pro-
tective interventions.
Limitations. The transgenic AGXT2 mouse line, which we generated to assess chronic vascular benefits 
of ADMA lowering by a DDAH1-independent mechanism and the safety of chronic upregulation of AGXT2, 
overexpresses AGXT2 ubiquitously. It will have to be assessed in the future studies, whether tissue-specific over-
expression of AGXT2 in its endogenous locations, i.e. in the liver and kidneys, would also lead to cardiovascular 
and/or metabolic benefits.
