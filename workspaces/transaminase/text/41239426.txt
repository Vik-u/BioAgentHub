Abstract
Background Metabolic Dysfunction-Associated Steatohepatitis (MASH) is a severe and progressive form of Metabolic 
Dysfunction-Associated Steatotic Liver Disease (MASLD), with approximately 25% of adults worldwide suffering from 
MASLD, of which 20%-30% progress to MASH, and the global incidence continues to rise. Oxidized mitochondrial 
DNA (Ox-mtDNA) release is a key contributor to MASH. However, its underlying mechanism remains unclear. Clarifying 
this process may provide a theoretical foundation for MASH treatment.
Methods In this study, we separately established MASH models using methionine- and choline deficient diet 
(MCD) fed mice in vivo and free fatty acid (FFA)-stimulated THP-1 derived macrophages in vitro. Cyclosporin A (CsA: 
mitochondrial permeability transition pore, mPTP , channel inhibitor) was used to inhibit the release of Ox-mtDNA. 
8-OH-dG detection and fluorescent probe were used to evaluate Ox-mtDNA release. Liver lipid deposition was 
analyzed by Triglyceride (TG) and Oil Red O, and tissue damage were analyzed by aspartate transaminase and 
alanine aminotransferase (ALT, AST) and H&E staining. Pyroptosis markers, such as cleaved-Caspase1, GSDMD-N, 
and inflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin − 1β, interleukin 18 (IL-1β, IL-18), were detected by WB, ELISA and 
transmission electron microscopy (TEM) experiments, and the key pyroptosis pathways activated by Ox-mtDNA 
were screened by RNA-seq. Finally, ITPR3 was silenced by siRNA in vitro and by Adeno-associated virus (AAV) in vivo 
respectively, which confirmed the role of ITPR3/Ca2+/NLRP3 axis in Ox-mtDNA regulating macrophage pyroptosis 
mediated MASH.
Results The cytosolic Ox-mtDNA level was significantly increased during MASH. Inhibition of Ox-mtDNA release 
alleviated macrophage pyroptosis to improve the pathological phenotype of MASH. RNA-seq analysis showed that 
cytosolic Ox-mtDNA triggered an inflammatory response by activating the NOD-like receptor pathway, in which 
FFA induced upregulation of inositol 1,4,5-Trisphosphate Receptor Type 3 (ITPR3, IP3R) expression, and Inhibition of 
Ox-mtDNA release could relieve this effect. ITPR3 silencing significantly reduced Ca²⁺ release, which in turn inhibited 
MPTP mediated Ox-mtDNA release inducing 
macrophage pyroptosis and exacerbating 
MCD-induced MASH via promoting the ITPR3/
Ca2+/NLRP3 pathway

Introduction
Metabolic Dysfunction-Associated Steatohepatitis 
(MASH), the progressive form of Metabolic Dysfunc -
tion-Associated Steatotic Liver Disease (MASLD), pose a 
significant global health concern, affecting approximately 
20%-25% of the population [ 1]. This condition can lead 
to liver fibrosis, cirrhosis, and even hepatocellular carci -
noma (HCC) [2, 3]. MASH is also the main indication for 
liver transplantation because it is associated with the risk 
of progression to end-stage liver disease [ 4]. Therefore, 
there is an urgent need to elucidate the pathogenesis of 
MASH in order to develop effective treatments.
The liver innate immune system plays a key role in the 
pathogenesis of MASH, involving coordinated interac -
tions between immune cells such as liver macrophages, 
Natural Killer Cells (NK cells), Type 1 Congenital Lym -
phoid Cells (ILC1), and neutrophils [ 5, 6]. NK cells/
ILC1 promote M1 macrophage polarization through 
Interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) and Tumor Necrosis Factor-
alpha (TNF-α), while exerting anti-fibrotic effects [ 7–9]. 
Neutrophils cause early hepatocyte damage through 
the formation of elastases and neutrophil extracellular 
traps (NETs) [ 10]. Notably, hepatic macrophages induce 
inflammation by sensing pathogen-associated molecular 
patterns/damage-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs/
DAMPs) and metabolites (e.g., FFA) and secrete chemo -
kines to recruit and activate other immune cells [ 11]. It 
is the main immune cell that coordinates inflammation 
and fibrosis [7, 12]. Therefore, it is of great significance to 
explore the mechanism of immune-inflammatory media -
tion mediated by liver macrophages in MASH.
The pathogenesis of MASH involves chronic inflam -
mation and progressive hepatocellular injury with fibro -
sis [ 13, 14], with macrophage pyroptosis being a key 
pathologic event [ 15]. Pyroptosis is mediated by the 
nucleotide-binding domain and leucine-rich repeat pro -
tein-3 (NLRP3) inflammasome-Gasdermin D (GSDMD) 
signaling axis, triggering programmed cell death [ 16, 
17]. NLRP3 inflammasome activates Caspase1, cleaves 
GSDMD, releases GSDMD-N, and its oligomerization 
forms membrane pores (10–20 nm), resulting in osmotic 
imbalance, pyroptosis, and the release of inflammatory 
factors such as IL-1β/IL-18 [ 18, 19]. However, in MASH, 
the factors and mechanisms that induce pyroptosis in 
macrophages have not been fully elucidated [20, 21].
Oxidized mitochondrial DNA (Ox-mtDNA), a charac -
teristic damage molecule resulting by cytosolic reactive 
oxygen species (ROS) attack, inducing inflammatory cas -
cades through activating the NLRP3 inflammasome [ 22]. 
Recent studies demonstrate Ox-mtDNA’s critical role in 
various pathologies, including metabolic diseases (e.g., 
MASH) [ 23], autoimmune disorders, and neurodegen -
erative diseases [ 24, 25]. Notably, Ox-mtDNA has been 
shown to regulate macrophage pyroptosis in both cellu -
lar and mouse models [ 26]. However, its exact molecular 
mechanisms and therapeutic potential in MASH require 
further investigation.
Inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate receptor type 3 (ITPR3, 
IP3R) is a key channel protein for endoplasmic reticu -
lum (ER)-mediated calcium ions (Ca 2+) release [ 27], and 
recent studies have shown that ITPR3-mediated Ca 2+ 
release promotes LPS-induced cardiomyocyte pyropto -
sis [ 28]. However, in MASH, it is unclear whether Ox-
mtDNA mediates macrophage pyroptosis via the ITPR3/
Ca2+/NLRP3 axis or not.
In this study, we used MCD to build a MASH model 
[29–31], and the results showed that Ox-mtDNA 
was significantly upregulated in free fatty acid (FFA)-
treated THP-1 derived macrophages and MCD ani -
mal model, and pyroptosis occurs in macrophages. We 
found that ITPR3 is a key reactive protein downstream 
of Ox-mtDNA by RNA-seq. Furthmore, ITPR3 acti -
vated NLRP3 inflammasome by promoting the release of 
Ca2+ the ER. Pharmacological inhibition of Ox-mtDNA 
release was found to significantly attenuate ITPR3/Ca² ⁺/
NLRP3 signaling axis activity, accompanied by signifi -
cant reductions in macrophage pyroptosis. These find -
ings provide evidence that the ITPR3/Ca²⁺/NLRP3 axis is 
a key mechanism of Ox-mtDNA influencing macrophage 
pyroptosis and aggravating MCD animal model, which 
is expected to provide some basic theory for clinical 
research on MASH.
Materials and methods
Animal experiment
MASH animal model
Male wild-type (WT) C57BL/6 mice (6–8 weeks, n = 6/
group) were purchased by the Experimental Animal 
Center of Chongqing Medical University (IACUC-
CQMU-2025-0304), initially weighing 19.7 ± 0.7g, were 
nucleotide-binding domain and leucine-rich repeat protein-3 (NLRP3) inflammasome activation and macrophage 
pyroptosis. Cytosolic Ox-mtDNA promotes Ca²⁺ release by upregulating ITPR3, activates NLRP3-dependent 
macrophage pyroptosis, and ultimately exacerbates liver injury and MASH progression.
Conclusions This study demonstrates that Ox-mtDNA drives MASH progression by promoting macrophage 
pyroptosis via the ITPR3/Ca²⁺/NLRP3 axis, providing a novel therapeutic strategy for targeted intervention.

used in the present study. The MASH animal model was 
established according to the previous report (use MCD: 
Research Diets, A02082002BR). After adapting for one 
week, the mice were maintained in an animal room 
with controlled conditions: light/dark cycle of 12 h/12 h, 
22 ± 2℃, and humidity of 55%-65%. Humane care guided 
by the guidelines of the National Institutes of Health was 
provided to all animals. All mice were raised under spe -
cific pathogen-free conditions, following the procedures 
approved by the Animal Use and Ethics Committee of the 
2nd Affiliated Hospital of Chongqing Medical University.
Animals were randomly divided and there were 6 mice 
in each group: (1) SHAM group: Mice were raised with 
normal food. (2) MCD group: Mice were raised on MCD 
feed. (3) MCD + CsA group: the cyclosporin A (CsA), a 
specific inhibitor of the mPTP (10  mg/kg/day), blocked 
the release of Ox-mtDNA by gavage for 7 weeks, and 
began to establish the MCD model after 3 weeks. (4) 
MCD + DMSO group: 1% DMSO working solution (1% 
DMSO, 40% PEG300, 5% Tween 80, and 54% ddH 2O) 
was prepared and given gavage in equal parts with CsA. 
(5) MCD ITPR3-AAV group: AAV-F4/80-ITPR3-EGFP-
specific silenced liver macrophage ITPR3, titer was 
1.5 × 1011TU/mL (interference sequence:  C A G C U G G A 
A G A U C A A C U U A U U U), mice were adaptively fed for 
1 week, injected through tail vein. The MCD model was 
constructed after 4 weeks. (6) MCD + NC group: adeno-
associated virus containing only blank vector (NC) was 
injected into the tail vein with a titer of 1.5 × 1011 TU/
mL, and the MCD animal model was constructed after 
4 weeks.
Isolation and cultivation of liver macrophages
Primary liver macrophages were isolated from normal 
liver tissue using a three-step enzymatic-mechanical dis -
sociation protocol adapted from Li et al. [ 32], involving: 
(1) collagenase IV (Sigma-Aldrich) digestion, (2) den -
sity gradient centrifugation, and (3) selective adherence 
purification. Isolated cells were maintained in complete 
DMEM medium (Gibco) supplemented with 10% fetal 
bovine serum (Gibco), 100U/mL penicillin G, and 100U/
mL streptomycin (both from Beyotime), under standard 
culture conditions (37 °C, 5% CO₂ humidified atmo -
sphere). Finally, the separation effect was verified by flow 
cytometry (Fig. S1. A).
H&E staining
H&E staining was applied for detecting pathological 
changes in the liver. Fresh liver tissue was fixed with 4% 
paraformaldehyde, embedded in paraffin, and sliced (the 
thickness was 4 μm). After dewaxing and hydrating, the 
slices were stained with hematoxylin (Sigma, Shang-
hai, China) at room temperature (RT), and then rinsed. 
After differentiating with 5% acetic acid for 1  min, the 
slices were rinsed and then stained with eosin (Sigma) for 
1 min.
NAS scoring
The most commonly used NAS score is a semi-quan -
titative scoring system, in which hepatocyte steatosis 
is 0–3 points, balloon-like degeneration is 0–2 points, 
and inflammation is 0–3 points, with a total score of 8 
points. The NAS score was obtained by adding the above 
three scores: hepatocyte steatosis, hepatocyte balloon -
ing, and intralobular inflammation. A NAS score of ≥ 5 
is diagnostic of MASH; A NAS score of 3 to 4 suspects 
nonalcoholic steatohepatitis; A NAS score of < 3 does 
not diagnose nonalcoholic steatohepatitis. All scoring is 
blinded.
Oil red O staining
To stain triglycerides (TG), frozen liver tissue sections 
(5µM) or THP-1 derived macrophages were washed 
twice with PBS and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 
10 min at RT. After two additional PBS washes, samples 
were stained using an Oil Red O Kit (Beyotime, C0158S) 
following the manufacturer’s instructions. Excess stain 
was removed, and samples were rinsed three times with 
distilled water before microscopic examination. The 
Olympus inverted fluorescence microscope IX73 was 
used for capture at 20x. Finally, imageJ (win-64) was used 
to quantify the entire image.
Immunohistochemical staining (IHC)
The paraffin-embedded sections were first heated in a 
60 °C oven, followed by deparaffinization through immer-
sion in xylene and a graded ethanol series. For antigen 
retrieval, the slides were microwaved in Tris-EDTA buf -
fer (Beyotime) at medium-high power for 8 min and then 
at medium-low power for 20 min, before cooling to RT. 
Endogenous peroxidase activity was blocked by incubat -
ing the sections with 3% hydrogen peroxide for 10 min at 
RT. After PBS washing, the sections were probed over -
night at 4  °C with primary antibodies against Caspase1 
(1:500, Huabio) and GSDMD (1:400, Abcam). Unbound 
antibodies were removed by PBS rinsing, and the sec -
tions were then treated with an IHC Kit reagents (includ-
ing enhancer and IgG polymer, AiFang Biological) at RT. 
Immunoreactivity was visualized using 3,3 ′-diaminoben-
zidine (DAB), followed by haematoxylin counterstaining. 
Finally, the slides were dehydrated in an ascending eth -
anol series and xylene, mounted with neutral gum, and 
examined under a light microscope. Finally, imageJ (win-
64) was used to quantify the entire image.
Biochemical analysis
Serum samples were used for biochemical analy -
sis. Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate

aminotransferase (AST) were measured using the ALT/
AST Kit (Solarbio, BC1555/BC1565). Please refer to the 
instructions for specific steps.
Triglyceride content detection
The triglyceride (TG) test Kit (Solarbio, BC0625) was 
used to analyze the liver TG level according to the manu-
facturer’s instructions. Weigh about 0.1 g of liver tissue, 
add 1mL of n-heptane and isopropanol mixture for ice 
bath homogenization, 8000 g, centrifuge at 4 degrees for 
10  min. Take the supernatant and read the absorbance 
at 420  nm with a microplate reader (Thermo Fisher 
Scientific).
Cell culture and treatment
THP-1 derived macrophages were cultured in RPMI-
1640 (Gibco) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum 
(Pricella, 164210-50) and antibiotics (Hyclone, HYC-
SV 30010) in a cell culture incubator with 5% CO 2 at 
37  °C until the logarithmic growth phase. Using Phor -
bol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA: 100ng/mL) to induce 
THP-1 derived macrophages adherence (24  h) and vali -
date their differentiation in macrophages (Fig.  S1 . B). 
THP-1 derived macrophages were cultured with 0.5mM 
concentration of FFA for 24  h to establish an in vitro 
model. In addition, the cells were treated in advance 
using 1µM CsA (MCE, HY-B0579) for 24 h to inhibit the 
opening of mPTP channels. Use DMSO as a negative 
control. To knock down ITPR3 in vitro, siITPR3 was pre-
transfected into THP-1 derived macrophages using Lipo -
fectamine 2000 (Invitrogen, USA). In some experiments, 
cells were incubated with ionomycin (4µM) (MCE: 
HY-13434) for 8  h to increase intracellular Ca 2+ levels. 
Diphenyleneiodonium chloride (DPI: 10µM) is a ROS 
scavenger and will be used in some experiments (MCE: 
HY-100965).
Configuration of FFA
Palmitic acid-BSA conjugate
Solution A: 0.2 g NaOH in 50mL ddH₂O; Solution B: 
0.9188g palmitic acid (sigma, P0500) solution was added 
to 50mL of solution A and heated at 80  °C until clear; 
Solution C: 1 g BSA (Beyotime, ST023-50 g) in 10mL 
ddH₂O. Next at 55  °C, slowly add 50µL Solution B to 
950µL Solution C. Finally, 0.22µM filter, then store at 4 °C 
in a dark place.
Oleic acid-BSA conjugate
Solution A: 2.0094 g sodium oleate (sigma, O7501-
250MG) in 50mL ddH₂O; Solution B: 1 g BSA in 10mL 
ddH₂O. Next at 55  °C, slowly add 50µL Solution A to 
950µL Solution B. Finally, 0.22µM filter, then store at 4 °C 
in a dark place.
ELISA
IL-1β and IL-18 levels in mouse serum or THP-1 derived 
macrophages supernatant were quantified using com -
mercial ELISA Kits (Beyotime, PI553 and PI301) accord -
ing to the manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly, 50µL of 
each sample was added to the wells, followed by 100µL of 
HRP-conjugated detection antibody. The plate was sealed 
and incubated at 37 °C for 60 min. After aspiration, wells 
were washed five times with wash buffer. Next, 50µL each 
of substrate A and B was added, followed by a 15  min 
incubation at 37 °C. The reaction was stopped with 50µL 
stop solution, and absorbance was measured at 450  nm 
within 15  min. Sample concentrations were determined 
from the standard curve.
Western blot (WB)
Protein samples were extracted from cells or tissues using 
RIPA lysis buffer (Beyotime) supplemented with 1× pro -
tease phosphatase inhibitor cocktail (Beyotime). Follow -
ing lysis, samples were centrifuged at 12,000×g for 15 min 
at 4  °C, and the supernatant was collected for protein 
quantification using a BCA Protein Assay Kit (Beyotime). 
Equal amounts of protein were mixed with 5× SDS-PAGE 
loading buffer, denatured at 100 °C for 10 min, and sepa -
rated by SDS-PAGE.
After electrophoresis, proteins were transferred to 
PVDF membranes, which were then blocked with 5% 
BSA for 1 h at RT. The membranes were probed with pri-
mary antibodies overnight at 4  °C, followed by incuba -
tion with HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies (1:8000, 
BOSTER) for 1  h at RT. Protein bands were visualized 
using a Bio-Rad Universal Hood III imaging system and 
quantified using ImageJ Lab software (version 3.0). All 
antibodies used in this study are listed in Table 1.
RT-qPCR
High-quality total RNA was rapidly extracted using the 
RNA-Quick Purification Kit (ESscience, ES-RN001) and 
cDNA was obtained using reverse transcription. The 
reverse transcription conditions were: 25  °C for 5  min; 
55 °C for 15 min; 85 °C for 2 min. qRT-PCR analysis was 
performed using SYBR Green qPCR Master Mix (No 
ROX, HY-K0523, MCE). β-Actin was used as internal 
controls. The 2 −∆∆Ct method was used to calculate the 
relative expression. The primers used for RT-PCR analy -
sis are as follows:
 
ITPR3(human) forward:  A C G G A C G A G G A G G G C T T T

mary liver macrophages and THP-1 derived macro -
phages using a fluorometric Caspase1 activity assay Kit 
(Beyotime, C1101), with all procedures performed in 
strict accordance with the manufacturer’s instructions.
LDH release assay
According to the manufacturer’s protocol, LDH in mouse 
serum or THP-1 derived macrophages supernatant 
was quantitated by the LDH activity assay Kit (Abcam, 
ab65391) The absorbance was read at 490  nm with a 
microplate reader (Thermo Fisher Scientific).
Transmission electron microscopy (TEM)

pyroptosis and Ox-mtDNA release
In order to explore the specific mechanism of Ox-
mtDNA driving pyroptosis and MASH, we selected MCD 
to establish a model and verify the model results (Fig. S2. 
A-G), and carried out the following experiments. Fig -
ure 1. A is the mouse modeling process. IHC showed that 
the expression of Caspase1 and GSDMD (red arrows) in 
liver tissue in the MCD group was significantly increased 
(Fig. 1. B-C), indicating that pyroptosis occurred mainly 
in non-parenchymal cells (e.g., macrophages). WB 
experiments on our isolated primary liver macrophages 
showed that showed that the levels of cleaved-Caspase1 
and GSDMD-N proteins in the MCD group were signifi -
cantly up-regulated (Fig.  1. D-E). Caspase1 activity and 
LDH were significantly upregulated (Fig.  1. F-G). The 
release of IL-1β and IL-18 was increased in the MCD 
group by Elisa (Fig.  1. H). TEM showed typical pyropto -
sis morphological features of macrophages in the MCD 
group, including plasma membrane rupture (blue arrow) 
and mitochondrial swelling (red arrows) (Fig.  1. I). The

mitochondrial swelling score was significantly higher 
than that of the SHAM group (Fig.  1. J). Both total and 
intracellular 8-OH-DG levels increased (Fig.  1. K-L), sug-
gesting oxidative damage to DNA in the cytoplasm. The 
levels of mitochondrial markers (D-loop, COX1, and 
Non-Numt) in the cytoplasm increased (Fig.  1. M). The 
above results suggest that the content of Ox-mtDNA in 
the cytoplasm is increased.
These results indicate that in MCD animal model, liver 
macrophages undergo significant pyroptosis, character -
ized by Caspase1/GSDMD activation, inflammatory fac -
tor release, and typical morphological changes.
Ox-mtDNA release may be a key factor in triggering 
pyroptosis in macrophages, thereby exacerbating inflam -
mation and liver damage in MASH.
Blocking Ox-mtDNA release mitigates pyroptosis of 
macrophages and liver damage in MCD animal model
To determine whether Ox-mtDNA release promotes 
pyroptosis and MASH progression in macrophages, we 
used CsA to inhibit mitochondrial DNA release (Fig.  2. 
A). It was found through confocal microscopy that CsA 
does not cause damage to mitochondria (Fig. S2. H). 
In addition, we found that CsA significantly inhibited 
the release of Ox-mtDNA in liver macrophages (Fig.  2. 
B-C) (D-loop, COX1 and Non-Numt are mitochondrial 
markers). And CsA does not affect total Ox-mtDNA 
production (Fig. S2. I-J). WB showed that the expres -
sion of cleaved-Caspase1 and GSDMD-N proteins was 
up-regulated (Fig.  2. D-E). The Caspase1 activity was 
enhanced (Fig. 2. F). Also, LDH, IL-1β, and IL-18 releases 
increased (Fig.  2. G-H). It was shown that the release of 
Ox-mtDNA was a key factor in triggering pyroptosis in 
macrophages.
H&E staining, NAS score, and oil red O staining (Fig. 2. 
I-L) showed that Inhibits Ox-mtDNA release signifi -
cantly reduced liver injury and lipid droplets. Serum ALT 
and AST levels (Fig.  2. M) and liver TG (Fig.  2. N) were 
also significantly reduced.
These results suggest that inhibition of Ox-mtDNA 
release is effective in attenuating macrophage pyroptosis, 
thereby improving liver injury in MCD animal models.
FFA induces Ox-mtDNA release via mPTP , leading to 
pyroptosis of THP-1 derived macrophages
Using PMA to induce THP-1 derived macrophages 
adherence, and then add FFA to model it for 24 h. Oil red 
O staining showed a significant increase in lipid droplets 
in the FFA group compared with the CON (Fig. S3. A-B). 
Fluorescence detection showed that the mPTP channel 
was significantly opened after FFA stimulation (Fig. 3. A). 
To identify triggers for mPTP opening, we detected cyto -
solic ROS, as both ROS and calcium overload are thought 
to drive mPTP opening [ 22]. Flow cytometry confirmed 
(See figure on previous page.)

a significant increase in cytosolic ROS in the FFA group, 
however, DPI effectively cleared cytosolic ROS (Fig. S3. 
C). After DPI treatment, the mPTP channel was closed, 
indicating that the key trigger for its opening was cyto -
solic ROS (Fig. S3. D). We isolated THP-1 derived macro-
phage cytoplasm and mitochondria. Elisa, qPCR (human 
mitochondrial markers D-loopHV1, COX2, ND1), and 
fluorescence colocalization showed that the cytosolic 
Ox-mtDNA levels in the FFA group were significantly 
higher than those in the CON group (Fig. 3. B-D), indi -
cating that excessive ROS-induced mPTP opening led to 
the release of Ox-mtDNA.
Pyroptosis-related indexes in the FFA group changed 
significantly: WB showed that the expression of cleaved-
Caspase1 and GSDMD-N proteins was up-regulated 
(Fig. 3. E-F). Caspase1 activity was enhanced (Fig.  3. G); 
LDH, IL-1β, and IL-18 release from cell supernatant 
increased (Fig.  3. H-I). TEM observations showed that 
the FFA group showed typical pyroptosis patterns: mem -
brane pore formation (blue arrow), mitochondrial swell -
ing (red arrows), etc. (Fig.  3. J), and the mitochondrial 
swelling score was increased (Fig. 3. K).
In conclusion, molecular and morphological evidence 
suggests that FFA can effectively induce pyroptosis in 
THP-1 derived macrophages.
Blocking Ox-mtDNA release attenuates THP-1 derived 
macrophages pyroptosis and reduces lipid droplets in vitro
To elucidate the role of cytosolic Ox-mtDNA on pyrop -
tosis in macrophages, we used CsA to block Ox-mtDNA 
release. As shown in Fig.  4. A, where CsA significantly 
inhibited mPTP channel opening compared to the FFA 
group. Elisa and qPCR showed that FFA stimulation 
resulted in the release of Ox-mtDNA into the cyto -
plasm, but in the FFA + CsA group, cytosolic Ox-mtDNA 
was significantly reduced (human mitochondrial mark -
ers D-loopHV1, COX2, ND1) (Fig.  4. B-C). In addition, 
immunofluorescence staining showed that CsA sig -
nificantly enhanced the colocalization of mtDNA with 
mitochondria (Fig.  4. D), indicating that CsA effectively 
limited cytoplasmic translocation of Ox-mtDNA. WB 
analysis revealed that inhibiting Ox-mtDNA release sig -
nificantly attenuated FFA-induced cleaved-Caspase1 and 
GSDMD-N expression (Fig. 4. E-F). At the same time, the 
Caspase1 activity assay showed a significant decrease in 
the CsA group (Fig.  4. G). Analysis of cell culture super -
natants showed that FFA stimulation resulted in a sig -
nificant increase in the release of LDH, IL-1β, and IL-18, 
after inhibiting the release of Ox-mtDNA, the release 
decreased (Fig.  4. H-I). Macrophage pyroptosis is fur -
ther confirmed. TEM confirmed that the CsA group cells

exhibited improved morphology, characterized by pres -
ervation of membrane integrity (blue arrow) and reduced 
mitochondrial swelling (red arrow) (Fig.  4. J-K). Addi -
tionally, Oil Red O staining demonstrated that inhibiting 
Ox-mtDNA release significantly alleviated FFA-induced 
lipid droplets (Fig. 4. L-M).
Collectively, these findings indicate that inhibiting Ox-
mtDNA release not only mitigates FFA-induced THP-1 
derived macrophages pyroptosis but also ameliorates 
lipid droplets within the cytoplasm.
Ox-mtDNA activates NLRP3 by regulating the release of 
Ca2+ from ITPR3 channels
RNA-seq analysis of THP-1 derived macrophages treated 
with FFA or FFA + CsA showed that there were 556 sig -
nificant up-regulation genes (logFC ≥ 1, p < 0.05) and 668 
down-regulation genes (logFC ≤ -1, p < 0.05) (Fig. 5. A). 
According to gene ontology (GO) analysis, differentially 
expressed genes (DEGs) were significantly enriched in 
the calcium-related pathway (Fig. 5. B). Kyoto Encyclo -
pedia Gene and genome (KEGG) enrichment analysis 
was associated with NOD pathway (Fig. 5. C), ITPR3 
was significantly enriched in the NOD pathway (Fi5. 
D). The heat map showed that ITPR3 was significantly 
down-regulated in the FFA + CsA group compared to the 
FFA group (Fig. 5. D). Given that ITPR3 is a key channel 
protein for the release of Ca 2+ on the ER, it can activate 
NLRP3 inflammasomes [ 33, 34]. Therefore, ITPR3/Ca 2+/
NLRP3 may be a key mechanism by which Ox-mtDNA 
promotes pyroptosis in macrophages.
Next, based on the RNA-seq we performed the fol -
lowing validation: the mRNA level of ITPR3 was verified 
by qPCR (Fig.  5. E). WB analysis showed that FFA sig -
nificantly increased the expression of ITPR3, but block -
ing the release of Ox-mtDNA decreased the expression 
of ITPR3 (Fig.  5. F-G). Notably, while the RNA-seq did 
not show changes in NLRP3 mRNA levels (Fig.  5. D), 
WB showed that FFA significantly enhanced NLRP3 
expression (Fig.  5. F-G), suggesting that Ox-mtDNA 
may regulate NLRP3 at post-translational levels. Next, 
immunofluorescence showed that the expression of 
ITPR3 and NLRP3 was significantly reduced after inhib -
iting the release of Ox-mtDNA compared with the FFA 
group (Fig.  5. H). Fluo-4 AM Ca 2+ imaging confirmed 
that intracellular Ca² ⁺ concentrations were significantly 
increased in FFA-treated cells, and this phenomenon was 
effectively inhibited by inhibition of Ox-mtDNA release 
(Fig. 5. I).
It has been shown that the release of ox-mtDNA pro -
motes the expression of ITPR3 and NLRP3, and the level 
of intracellular Ca2+.
Inhibition of ITPR3/Ca²⁺ axis alleviates NLRP3-dependent 
pyroptosis in liver macrophages and reduces the 
intracellular lipid droplets
Next, we further validate the mechanism in vitro. We 
successfully knocking down ITPR3 in THP-1 derived 
macrophages (Fig. S4. A), we restored intracellular Ca² ⁺ 
levels using a Ca 2+ carrier (Ionomycin: Iono) to ver -
ify the role of the ITPR3/Ca² ⁺ pathway in pyroptosis.

Fluorescence results showed that ITPR3-siRNA down-
regulated intracellular Ca 2+ levels, however, intracel -
lular Ca 2+ levels increased after Iono treatment (Fig.  6. 
A). The WB results showed that ITPR3-siRNA reduced 
the expression levels of ITPR3, NLRP3 and other pyrop -
tosis-related indicators (Fig.  6. D-H). However, after the 
increase of intracellular Ca 2+, the expression of NLRP3 
increased (Fig.  6. B-C), and the expression of pyroptosis-
related indicators increased (Fig.  6. D-H). TEM results 
showed that knockdown of ITPR3 reduced the occur -
rence of pyroptosis: membrane rupture (blue arrow) and 
mitochondrial swelling (red arrow), which was exacer -
bated by increased intracellular Ca 2+ (Fig. 6. I-J). In addi -
tion, oil red O staining showed that ITPR3 knockdown 
significantly attenuated FFA-induced lipid droplets, while 
restoring intracellular Ca²⁺ increased lipid droplets com -
pared to the knockdown group, but not as much as in the 
FFA group (Fig. 6. K-L).
These results conclusively demonstrate that the ITPR3/
Ca²⁺/NLRP3 signaling axis serves as a crucial regula -
tory mechanism for Ox-mtDNA mediated macrophage 
pyroptosis.
Inhibition of ITPR3/Ca²⁺ signaling blocks Ox-mtDNA 
induced liver macrophages pyroptosis and mitigates MCD 
animal model damage
To confirm the above conclusions in vivo, we specifi -
cally knocked out ITPR3 of liver macrophages by inject -
ing adeno-associated virus into the tail of mice (Fig.  7. A) 
and verified (Fig. S4. B). WB analysis revealed that com -
pared to the MCD group, the ITPR3-AAV group exhib -
ited significantly reduced expression of ITPR3, NLRP3, 
cleaved-Caspase1, and GSDMD-N (Fig.  7. B-E). Func -
tional assays demonstrated that ITPR3-AAV group mark-
edly decreased Caspase1 activity (Fig.  7. F) and reduced 
serum levels of LDH, IL-1β, and IL-18 (Fig.  7. G-H). 
TEM analysis (Fig. S4. C) Macrophage morphology was 
improved in the ITPR3-AAV group, characterized by

swelling was significantly reduced after specific knock -
down of ITPR3 (Fig. S4. D). H&E staining and Oil Red 
O staining further confirmed that ITPR3 knockout effec -
tively alleviated FFA-induced liver injury and intracellu -
lar lipid droplets (Fig.  7. I-J). Serum biochemical assays

showed that macrophage-specific ITPR3 deletion signifi -
cantly reduced ALT and AST levels (Fig.  7. K), and liver 
TG levels (Fig. 7. L).
These in vivo results conclusively suggest that Ox-
mtDNA promotes pyroptosis in liver macrophages by 
activating the ITPR3/Ca² ⁺/NLRP3 signaling pathway, 
thereby exacerbating MCD-induced MASH progression 
(Fig.  8). This issue is likely to provide a new potential 
therapeutic target for MASH.
Discussion
In this study, we reported a discovery that Ox-mtDNA 
is released into the cytoplasm through mPTP channels 
in macrophages during MCD-induced MASH. More 
importantly, a new mechanism was elucidated by which 
cytosolic Ox-mtDNA triggers the ITPR3/Ca 2+/NLRP3 
signaling pathway to mediate macrophage pyroptosis and 
exacerbate MCD-induced MASH.
MCD mice showed significant inflammation at week 
4. However, the HFD-fed mice fed for 8 weeks showed 
only mild inflammation and fibrosis, and by week 16, the 
HFD-fed mice showed a significant increase in inflam -
mation and fibrosis, highlighting the different progres -
sion patterns of liver pathology in the HFD model [ 35]. 
At the same time, HFD-fed mice only showed a large of 
lipid droplets at week 8 [ 36], while we found that mice 
fed MCD had a large of lipid droplets at week 4. For in 
vivo experiments, An MCD diet is a classic method to 
induce MASH in animal models. MCD diets promote the 
dysfunction of liver mitochondrial β-oxidation, thereby 
establishing an animal model of MASH [ 37]. This model 
is mainly used to study inflammation, oxidative stress, 
mitochondrial damage, and liver fibrosis related to MASH 
[38, 39]. This model has the advantages of a short mod -
eling time, little influence by individual differences, and 
good uniformity and stability of liver inflammation [39].
In FFA-induced THP-1 derived macrophage mod -
els, we observed significant accumulation of cytosolic 
Ox-mtDNA, which is consistent with the mitochondrial 
DNA release mechanism associated with impaired mito -
chondrial quality control [40, 41]. It is interesting that the 
accumulation of Ox-mtDNA has different biological sig -
nificance in the bloodstream and cytoplasm. Circulatory 
Ox-mtDNA predominantly resides in extracellular fluids 
(e.g., blood), functioning as both a systemic inflamma -
tory mediator and clinical biomarker that reflects tissue 
damage severity [ 12, 42]. Cytosolic Ox-mtDNA localizes 
to the cytosol where it acts as a direct effector molecule 
of metabolic stress, participating in cell-autonomous 
immune regulation [ 13]. These two forms demonstrate 
functional complementarity: circulatory Ox-mtDNA 
provides diagnostic utility for clinical evaluation, while

intracellular Ox-mtDNA serves as a mechanistic research 
target [14].
Mitochondrial DNA can be released into the cyto -
plasm through mPTP channels or BAX/BAK pores [ 43, 
44]. Among them, the mPTP channel mainly releases oxi-
datively damaged mtDNA (Ox-mtDNA), which is pro -
duced by ROS attack [ 22, 42]. And the mtDNA released 
by BAX/BAK pores is mainly related to apoptosis [ 44]. 
Notably, our study confirms that targeted interven -
tion of mPTP channels reduces Ox-mtDNA release and 
improves macrophage pyroptosis and MCD-induced 
MASH. This further provides direct evidence for thera -
peutic strategies for Ox-mtDNA release.
Our RNA-seq showed that the mRNA level of ITPR3 
was significantly upregulated in FFA induced THP-1 
derived macrophages, while the mRNA level of ITPR3 
was downregulated after CsA inhibited Ox mtDNA 
release. Subsequent experiments have confirmed that the 
expression of ITPR3 protein is consistent with changes 
in mRNA levels. In addition, FFA induced a significant 
increase in intracellular Ca 2+ levels in THP-1 derived 
macrophages, while inhibition of Ox mtDNA release 
or ITPR3 knockout significantly reduced intracellu -
lar Ca 2+ levels. In fact, recent research findings indicate 
that changes in ITPR subtype expression are associated 
with various human diseases, from fatty liver to cancer, 
ITPR3 is emerging as the isoform that is particularly 
important in the pathogenesis of various human diseases 
[45]. According to relevant literature reports, the ITPR3/
Ca2+ axis can mediate apoptosis [ 46], and in addition, 
it can reduce the Ca 2+ concentration in the cytoplasm 
and mitochondria, thereby inhibiting macrophage M1 
polarization [ 47]. However, our discovery of the ITPR3/
Ca2+ signaling pathway provides new insights into the 
mechanism of NLRP3 inflammasome activation. Previ -
ous studies have shown that mitochondrial DNA induces 
pyroptosis in nucleus pulposus cells via the TLR9-NF-
κB-NLRP3 axis [ 29, 48], but our study reveals a novel 
ITPR3-mediated Ca2+ signaling axis that activates NLRP3 
and thus promotes macrophage pyroptosis and MASH. 
Ca2+ signaling plays a key role in the activation of NLRP3 
inflammasomes in liver macrophages [ 49, 50]. Ca² ⁺ acts 
as a second messenger, activating the downstream effec -
tor CaMKII, which subsequently synergistically amplifies 
the storm of pro-inflammatory factors such as TNF-α 
and IL-1β by phosphorylating key molecules of the 
NF-κB pathway (e.g., P65) and enhancing NLRP3 activ -
ity, thereby promoting the inflammatory response in the

brain [51]. In addition, the pathological effects of Ca² ⁺ go 
far beyond that. NFAT family (especially NFATc1/c3), as 
downstream targets of Ca² +, is mediated by calcineurin, 
and NFATc1 signaling drives chronic ER stress response 
and promotes MASLD progression [52].
This study has important theoretical and clinical impli -
cations. The elucidated Ox-mtDNA-ITPR3/Ca 2+/NLRP3 
axis complements the popular “multiple hit” theory of 
MASH pathogenesis [53, 54]. Also, we demonstrated that 
release of Ox-mtDNA is a key target for the treatment 
of MASH, providing a theoretical basis for clinical treat -
ment; Macrophage Ox-mtDNA, ITPR3, Ca 2+ and pyrop-
tosis are expected to be markers to assess the degree of 
inflammation in liver disease. These findings not only 
deepen the understanding of the pathogenesis of MASH, 
but also provide a theoretical basis for Ox-mtDNA tar -
geted therapy.
However, despite some progress in our research, there 
are still important limitations in this study: How Ox-
mtDNA directly interacts with ITPR3 and the specific 
signaling molecules involved in this process need to be 
studied more deeply; Although CsA is a classic mPTP 
inhibitor, its inhibitory effect on calcineurin may lead 
to off-target effects; Challenges such as AAV delivery 
and potential side effects also need to be addressed. This 
study lacks long-term observation of the progression of 
MASH, and it is also necessary to further explore the 
results of different patient groups. The above limita -
tions limit its potential for clinical translation, and in the 
future, we will explore these limitations in depth.

Fig. 7 Inhibition of ITPR3/Ca²⁺ signaling blocks Ox-mtDNA induced liver macrophages pyroptosis and mitigates MCD animal model damage. The mice 
in the experimental group were injected with ITPR3-AAV through the tail vein: A. Schematic diagram of animal experiments. B-E. The levels of ITPR3, 
NLRP3, Caspase-1, cleaved-Caspase1, GSDMD and GSDMD-N were measured by WB. F. Caspase1 activity was determined with the Caspase1 assay kit. G. 
Supernatant levels of LDH were measured by LDH assay kit. H. Supernatant levels of IL-1β and IL-18 were tested by ELISA. I-J. NAS score and lipid droplets 
relative area analysis were based on liver slice H&E staining and oil red staining (scale bar, 100µM) of different groups of mice. K-L. Serum levels of ALT, AST 
and liver TG were measured by biochemical kit. All data are shown as the mean ± SD (n = 6). ***P < 0.001, **P < 0.01 and *P < 0.05
