Transaminases for the synthesis of enantiopure
beta-amino acids
Jens Rudat*, Birgit R Brucher and Christoph Syldatk
Abstract
Optically pure b-amino acids constitute interesting building blocks for peptidomimetics and a great variety of
pharmaceutically important compounds. Their efficient synthesis still poses a major challenge. Transaminases (also
known as aminotransferases) possess a great potential for the synthesis of optically pureb-amino acids. These
pyridoxal 5’-dependent enzymes catalyze the transfer of an amino group from a donor substrate to an acceptor,
thus enabling the synthesis of a wide variety of chiral amines and amino acids. Transaminases can be applied
either for the kinetic resolution of racemic compounds or the asymmetric synthesis starting from a prochiral
substrate. This review gives an overview over microbial transaminases with activity towardsb-amino acids and their
substrate spectra. It also outlines current strategies for the screening of new biocatalysts. Particular emphasis is
placed on activity assays which are applicable to high-throughput screening.

Introduction
Since the discovery of transamination in biological sys-
tems (Braunstein and Kritzmann 1937,Moyle Needham
1930,) the significance of transaminases (TAs) for amino
acid metabolism has been the subject of intensive
research. Over the last 15 years, TAs have gained
increasing attention in organic synthesis for the biocata-
lytic production of a wide variety of chiral amines and
a-amino acids. This has been discussed in detail in a
series of excellent reviews (Höhne and Bornscheuer
2009,; Koszelewski et al. 2010,; Taylor et al. 1998,; Ward
and Wohlgemuth 2010). Advantages in the use of TAs
lie in mostly low-cost substrates, no necessity for exter-
nal cofactor recycling and the enzymes’ high enantios-
electivity and reaction rate. For the synthesis of
enantiopure b-amino acids only a limited number of
TAs are available. Therefore efficient screening techni-
ques for TAs with high activities as well as broader sub-
strate specificity and differ ent enantioselectivities are
crucial for the successful application of transaminases
for the synthesis ofb-amino acids. Of particular interest
are methods that can be used at small scale compatible
with microtiter plates.
Enantiopure b-amino acids represent highly valuable
building blocks for peptidomimetics and the synthesis of
bioactive compounds. In order to distinguish positional
isomers of b-amino acids, the terms b
2-, b3-a n db2,3-
amino acids have been introduced by Seebach and cow-
orkers (Hintermann and Seebach 1997,; Seebach et al.
1997,). With the exception ofb-alanine and b-aminoiso-
butyric acid which constitute key intermediates in sev-
eral metabolic pathways, b-amino acids are not as
abundant in nature as a-amino acids. However, they
occur as essential parts in a variety of biologically active
compounds. Notable representatives are the antineoplas-
tic agent paclitaxel (= Taxol™, Bristol-Myers Squibb)
(Wani et al. 1971,) and the chromophore of C-1027 (=
lidamycin), a radiomimetic antitumor agent (Hu et al.
1988) (Figure 1a). b-Amino acids have drawn much
attention as building blocks for synthetic peptides. They
can form oligomers analogous to a-peptides with one
additional carbon atom in the oligomer backbone (Fig-
ure 1b). These b-amino acid oligomers (= b-peptides)
can form highly ordered secondary structures analogous
to a-peptides (Iverson 1997,; Koert 1997,; Seebach et al.
1996,; Seebach and Matthews 1997).b-Peptides are not
recognized by most peptidases and thus not cleaved

leading to a much higherin vivo stability compared to
a-peptides (Frackenpohl et al. 2001,; Gopi et al. 2003,;
Hintermann and Seebach 1997,; Hook et al. 2004,). It
has also been observed that the substitution of only a
few a-amino acids in a peptide by the correspondingb-
amino acid lowers the proteolytic susceptibility (Horne
et al. 2009,; Steer et al. 2002,). Apparently, theb-resi-
dues in mixed a/b-peptides tend to protect nearby
amides from proteolytic cleavage. Interestingly, such
mixed a/b-peptides often retain their biological activity
(Aguilar et al. 2007,; Horne et al. 2009,; Montero et al.
2009,; Nurbo et al. 2008,Seebach and Gardiner 2008
A plethora of chemical approaches have been estab-
lished to produce chiralb-amino acids including (1) the
resolution of racemicb-amino acids, (2) the use of natu-
rally occurring chirala-amino acids, and (3) asymmetric
synthesis (Liu and Sibi 2002,). As resolutions of racemic
mixtures are complex and time-consuming procedures,
t h ec h i r a lp o o lo fn a t u r a la-amino acids is limited and
catalysts or chiral auxiliari es cause high costs, all of
these strategies have their limitations when applied on
an industrial scale (Weiner et al. 2010).
Several enzymes have successfully been tested to pro-
duce enantiopure b-amino acids from different starting
compounds (for an overview see Liljeblad and Kanerva
2006). Most strategies resemble kinetic resolutions ofN-
acylated or esterified b-amino acids by hydrolytic
enzymes, e.g. lipases (Tasnádi et al. 2008,). Although
industrially applied for certain products, this strategy is
limited to a maximum yield of 50%, and so is the
recently tested b-amino acid synthesis via Bayer-Villiger
monooxygenases (Rehdorf et al. 2010). As the latter
enzymes are cofactor (NADPH) dependent, these pro-
cesses rely on cofactor recycling which is achieved by
whole cell biotransformations, assumingly leading to
side products as well as transport limitations depending
on the substrate which moreover needs to be N-
protected.
Two other novel approaches seem to be more promis-
ing as they - at least theoretically - can lead to a 100%
conversion of the substrates used and thus overcome
the inherent drawback of kinetic resolutions with the
above described enzymes:
(1) Various aminomutases have been used for the con-
version of aliphatic and aromatic a-amino acids to the
corresponding b-isomers (for an overview see Wu et al.
2010a). Coupling the catalysis of a promiscuous alanine
racemase with that of phen ylalanine aminomutase
(PAM) increased the production of enantiopure (R)-b-
arylalanines from the corresponding racemic a-isomers
(Cox et al. 2009). Using PAM in tandem with a phenyla-
lanine ammonia lyase (PAL), various aromatic (S)-b-
amino acids can be obtained (Wu et al. 2010b,). These
latter studies deal with one potential pitfallo fu t i l i z i n g
these enzymes which lies in the reaction’s equilibrium
and the thus limited final yields of the desired products.
Another limitation for application in industry is the
usually low activity, leading to quite slow conversions.
Moreover, many otherwise promising aminomutases
re
quire multiple expensive cofactors and strictly anaero-
bic conditions Wu et al. 2010a.
(2) A modification of the well established hydantoi-
nase process is investigated for the production of enan-
tiopure b-amino acids from dihydropyrimidine
derivatives (Engel et al. 2011). The stereoselective hydro-
lysis of racemic phenyldihydrouracil to D- and L-N-car-
bamoyl- b-phenylalanine was shown which can be
further hydrolyzed to the corresponding b-amino acid.
However, at the moment this process lacks a suitable
racemase (or alternatively an efficient chemical racemi-
zation) to gain a 100% yield.
In conclusion, even though several chemical and enzy-
matic routes (and chemo-enzymatic tandems) are
applied and under intense investigation, there still is no
gold standard for the preparation of enantiopure b-
amino acids.
TAs can be applied either in the kinetic resolution of
racemic b-amino acids (Figure 2a) or in asymmetric
synthesis starting from the corresponding prochiral b-
keto-substrate (Figure 2b). By asymmetric synthesis, a
theoretical yield of 100% is possible. However, unlikea-
keto acids, b-keto acids decarboxylate relatively easily
under mild conditions in a mechanism involving a cyclic
transition state (Bach and Canepa 1996). Thereforein-
situ synthesis would be necessary. This can be achieved
by enzymatic hydrolysis of the corresponding b-keto
ester, as was already shown using a commercially avail-
able lipase from Candida rugosa (Kim et al. 2007,) and
a hog liver esterase (Banerjee et al. 2005).

Reaction mechanism
Formally, the reaction catalyzed by TAs can be consid-
ered a redox reaction with the oxidative deamination of
the donor in conjunction with the reductive amination
of the acceptor. The reaction is divided into two half-
reactions obeying a ping- pong bi-bi mechanism. TAs
belong to the large and diverse group of pyridoxal phos-
phate (PLP)-dependent enzymes and are ubiquitous in
living organisms playing an important role in amino
acid metabolism (Christen and Metzler 1985,Cooper
and Meister 1989; Taylor et al. 1998,). So far only the
reaction mechanism of aspartate transaminase (EC
2.6.1.1) has been studied extensively, which is assumed
to be typical of pyridoxal-5’-phosphate dependent trans-
aminases (Frey and Hegeman 2007,Shin and Kim 2002,).
The reaction starts with the deamination of aspartate to
a-ketoglutarate. In the resting enzyme PLP is covalently
bound to the ε-amino group of a lysine (Lys258) in the
a c t i v es i t eo ft h ea p o e n z y m ef o r m i n gt h ei n t e r n a la l d i -
mine. Upon contact with the substrate, the bond
between cofactor and apoenzyme dissolves, and PLP
forms a Schiff base with the substrate (= the external
aldimine). The free ε-amino group of Lys258 then acts
as a catalyst for the 1,3-prototropic shift to form the
ketimine. The ketimine is hydrolyzed to yield the keto
acid and PMP. The following second half reaction con-
sists of the formation of glutamate froma-ketoglutarate.
Following the same reaction steps in reverse, the inter-
nal aldimine is regenerated (Eliot and Kirsch 2004,Haya-
shi et al. 2003).
Classification of transaminases
Over the last decades several classification systems for
TAs were established based either on function or evolu-
tionary relationships. PLP-dependent enzymes are
divided into seven major structural groups (fold types),
which presumably represent five evolutionary lineages
(Grishin et al. 1995,Schneider et al. 2000,). Nonetheless,
PLP-dependent enzymes encompass more than 140 dis-
tinct catalytic functions, th us representing a striking
example of divergent evolution. This makes a correla-
tion between sequence and function especially demand-
ing. Recently, an extensive database has been built,
which compiles information on PLP-dependent enzymes
(Percudani and Peracchi 2009,). Among the seven fold
types of PLP-dependent enzymes, TAs occur in the fold
types I and IV. Multiple sequence alignments by the
Protein Family Database (Pfam) (Finn et al. 2010) led to
the distinction of six subfamilies (classes) of TAs within
the superfamily of PLP-dependent enzymes which are
designated by Roman numerals (Table 1). The classes I
and II, III and V all belong to the same folding type.
Representatives of class I and II are aspartate TAs and
aromatic TAs, of class III ω-TAs and of class V phos-
phoserine TAs. D-alanine TAs and branched chain
amino acid TAs are set apart, pertaining to a different
folding type, and unsurprisingly to a different subfamily.
According to EC nomenclature, TAs are classified as
transferases (EC 2) and not oxidoreductases, as the dis-
tinctive feature of the reaction is the transfer of the
amino group. Names are generated according to the
scheme donor:acceptor transaminase , e.g. asparagine:
oxo-acid transaminase (EC 2.6.1.14). As of January 2012
81 different subgroups are listed under EC 2.6.1 (exclud-
ing deleted EC numbers). A broader classification based
on the reaction catalyzed was introduced in the 1980s.
TAs are divided into two groups:a-TAs which catalyze
transamination of amino groups at thea-carbon and ω-
TAs that act on the distal amino group of the substrate
(Burnett et al. 1979,Yonaha et al. 1983,). According to
this classification, all TAs acting on b-amino acids are
considered as ω-TAs. It was observed that someω-TAs
are able to catalyze the transamination of primary amine
compounds not bearing carboxyl groups (Yonaha et al.
1977,). This led to an increasing interest in ω-TAs in
recent years for the asymmetric synthesis of chiral
amines of high enantiopurity (Hwang et al. 2005,Kosze-
lewski et al. 2010,Shin and Kim 1999). Some biotechno-
logically important ω-TAs, such as the well
characterized TA from Vibrio fluvialis JS17, have been
denominated ‘amine transaminases’ accounting for their
high activity towards amines while showing only low or
no activity towards ‘classical ’ ω-TA substrates, like b-
alanine (Shin et al. 2003).

ketoglutarate TAs (E.C.2.6.1.22) are abundant in living
cells, because they are involved in several important
metabolic pathways such as pyrimidine degradation.
Thus, numerous ω-TAs acting on aliphatic b-amino
acids are known. Table 2 only includes a few examples
which are of biotechnologic al relevance. In contrast,
only few TAs with aromatic target compounds are
known. TAs with high activity towards short-chain

aliphatic b-amino acids such asb-alanine and b-amino-
n-butyric acid often possess activity towards aromatic
amines like a-methylbenzylamine, yet no or only low
activity towards aromatic b-amino acids. The well-char-
acterized ω-TA from V. fluvialis JS17 for instance pos-
sesses high activity to a-methylbenzylamine but also
catalyzes the transamination of b-amino-n-butyric acid
to the corresponding keto acid (Shin and Kim 2002,).b-
Alanine and b-phenylalanine do not serve as substrates
Yun et al. (2004) reported an ω-TA from Alcaligenes
denitrificans Y2k-2 which converts various aliphatic b-
amino acids and amines but exhibits no activity towards
b-phenylalanine. An exception is theω-TA from Caulo-
bacter crescentus which showed minor activity towards
b-phenylalanine (Hwang et al. 2008,). However, the rela-
tive activity of the wild-type enzyme towardsa-methyl-
benzylamine was nearly 170-fold higher, towards b-
alanine and b-amino-n-butyric acid even 300-fold 56.
Shin and Kim (2002) constructed an active site model
for the ω-TA from V. fluvialis based on its substrate
spectrum. The authors tested a wide variety of donor
and acceptor substrates and postulate a two-binding site
model consisting of two po ckets, one large and one
small. The small pocket appears to accommodate no
side group larger than ethyl groups and exhibits a strong
repulsion for acidic groups. The carboxyl group is there-
fore always placed in the large pocket which results in
the other side group of the substrate to be placed in the
small pocket. Thus, high activities can be observed for
b-amino acids with small side groups, e.g. b-amino-n-
butyric acid, but not for large side chains like the aro-
matic ring of b-phenylalanine. 1-Phenylethylamine, on
the other hand, does not possess a carboxylic group.
Thus, the aromatic side-chain can be placed into the
large pocket. For the confirmation of this model, the
crystal structure will have to be elucidated. Jang et al.
recently reported the crystallization and preliminary X-
ray structure of the ω-TA from V. fluvialis (Jang et al.
2010,). The crystal structure has not been released yet
(Park and Jang 2010).
Only a small number of TAs with high activity
towards aromatic b-amino acids have been described (s.
Table 2) and only two sequences, from the TA of the
soil bacterium Mesorhizobium sp. LUK (GenBank:
A B L 7 4 3 7 9 . 1 )( K i me ta l .2 0 0 7 )a n df r o mt h eω-TA
Ml0107 from M. loti MAFF303099 (GenBank:
NP_101976.1) (Kwon et al. 2010), have been elucidated
and published to date. The TA fromMesorhizobium sp.
LUK shows, as reported by the authors, the highest
identity (53%) and similarity (66%) to a glutamate-1-
semialdehyde 2,1-aminomutase of Polaromonas sp.
strain JS666. Taking into consideration sequences which
were submitted to Genbank since the publication of this
a
rticle, the comparison of this amino acid sequence
using blastp gives a putative aminotransferase class III
from Variovorax paradoxus S110 (Gene ID: :7970445)
as the closest match with 52%identities and 69% simi-
larity. Interestingly, of the other transaminases reported
to act onb-phenylalanine, one belongs to the speciesV.
paradoxus (Banerjee et al. 2005) and two to the genus
Variovorax (Brucher et al. 2010,Mano et al. 2006). The
preliminary X-ray structure of the TA fromMesorhizo-
bium sp. LUK has been published recently (Kim 2011).
Wild-type ω-TAs almost universally exhibit (S)-selec-
tivity. Notable exceptions are theω-TA of Arthrobacter
sp. KNK168 (Iwasaki et al. 2003,Iwasaki et al. 2006) and
its homolog, the commerci ally available ATA-117
(Codexis Inc.) as well as the TA fromAlcaligenes eutro-
phus (Banerjee et al. 2005,) 59. Svedendahl and cowor-
kers (2010) could invert the enantioselectivity of an (S)-
selective ω-TA from Arthrobacter citreus by single point
mutation for their model substrate 4-fluorophenylace-
tone. This change in enantioselectivity was substrate-
dependent. Whether or not this approach proves to be
useful for the inversion of enantioselectivity of other
TAs, remains to be seen.
Protein design of TAs for a modified or expanded substrate
spectrum
Both rational design and directed evolution have been
employed with the aim to enhance the activity of TAs
towards aryl-b -amino acids 25. Hwang and coworkers
(2004) reported the directed evolution of the ω-TA
from V. fluvialis by error-prone PCR in order to
increase activity towards b-phenylalanine. The best
mutant exhibited a threefold activity increase in the
conversion of b-phenylalanine compared to the wild-
type. However, the yield of the transamination ofb-phe-
nylalanine was below 5% in 20 h. The same group later
modified an ω-TA from Caulobacter crescentus which
exhibited high activities towards short, aliphaticb-amino
acids by site-directed mutagenesis (Hwang et al. 2008).
A 3D model was constructed by homology modeling
using a dialkylglycine decarboxylase as a template. This
led to a threefold increase in activity for b-phenylala-
nine. Compared to the over 100-fold higher activity
towards short, aliphatic b-amino acids, this is still quite
low.
Screening strategies for microbial TAs acting onb-amino
acids
Enrichment culture and in-silico screening
The first directed screenings for microorganisms exhi-
biting TA activity towards b-amino acids were per-
formed by enrichment culture using the desired b-
amino acid as a major or the sole nitrogen source.
Toyama et al. (Toyama et al. 1973) isolated the strain
Pseudomonas sp. F-126 by enrichment culture from soil
using a medium containing b-alanine. Further studies

revealed it to possess anω-amino acid:pyruvate TA with
high activity towardsb-alanine and otherω-amino acids
(Yonaha et al. 1976). With a similar approach most of
the currently known TAs with activity towardsb-amino
acids were discovered. As the sequence-function rela-
tionship among TAs is as of yet poorly understood,
enrichment culture still constitutes the greatest source
of new TAs active towardsb-amino acids.
However, some attempts have been made to identify
interesting TAs from the ever growing number of com-
pletely sequenced genomes. Kaulmann et al. (2007) used
t h es e q u e n c eo ft h eω-TA from V. fluvialis for the in
silico screening of novel TAs. They cloned and purified
ap u t a t i v eT Af r o mChromobacterium violaceum which
showed a similar substrate spectrum as the one fromV.
fluvialis. In a similar approach the previously described
TA from Caulobacter crescentus was identified using the
sequence of anω-TA from Alcaligenes denitrificans as a
template (Hwang et al. 2008,). The novel TA exhibited
high activities towards short, aliphatic b-amino acids
and aromatic amines. Recently, Kwon et al. (Kwon et al.
2010) established the cell-free expression of computa-
tionally predicted putative ω-TAs, which circumvents
cloning and expression procedures. As part of this
study, the putative ω-TA Ml0107 from M. loti
MAFF303099 was identified based on its sequence
homology with the previously described TAs fromCau-
lobacter crescentus and V. fluvialis. ω-TA Ml0107 exhib-
ited activity to b-phenylalanine, 1-aminoindane and
benzylamine.
The sequences of the two TAs with high activity
towards aromatic b-amino acids (TA from Mesorhizo-
bium sp. LUK (Kim et al. 2007),ω-TA Ml0107 from M.
loti MAFF303099 (Kwon et al. 2010)) have, to the best
of our knowledge, so far not been used for in-silico
screening.
Activity assays for high-throughput screening
A major limiting step in the discovery, characterization,
optimization and purification of new TAs lies in the
determination of TA activity. This gave rise to the
development of several high-throughput (HTP)-meth-
ods. Figure 3 gives an overview over HTP-assays which
allow the screening for TA activity towards b-amino
acids.
The first assay was realized by Hwang et al. (2004). It
is based on the formation of a blue amino acid-copper
complex by thea-amino acid produced in the TA reac-
tion and a CuSO
4/MeOH staining solution (see Figure
3a). The assay was tested using a great variety of alipha-
tic and aromatic b-amino acids as amino donors with
good accuracy. Furthermore, by using both enantiomers
of an amino donor separately, information on the enan-
tiopreference of the studied enzyme could be gained. A
disadvantage of this method consists in the fact that the
staining solution inhibits the enzyme, so that it can only
be applied as an end-point measurement. Additionally,
this method does not allow the use of cell extracts as
free a-amino acids disturb the reaction. Thus, enzyme
purification is necessary. T herefore the application of
this assay is rather limited. Coupling the determination
of TA activity with drivingthe reaction to completion,
Truppo et al. (2009) developed an elegant multi-enzy-
matic system for the HTP-screening and scale-up of TA
catalyzed reactions (see Figure 3b). In this system, pyru-
vate which is generated through the TA reaction is
reduced to L-lactate by a lactate dehydrogenase (LDH).
Recycling of the LDH cofactor NADH by glucose dehy-
drogenase (GDH) ultimately leads to the formation of
gluconic acid and thus to a pH drop. The progression of
the reaction can be measured by monitoring the change
of absorbance of a pH indicator (phenol red). This sys-
tem proved to be especially useful for rapid scale-up.
While the system was only tested with ketones as sub-
strate, theoretically b-keto acids could also be employed.
Limits of the reaction are that only pyruvate dependent
TAs can be tested, no information on the enantioselec-
tivity or enantiopreference of the studied enzyme can be
gained and that as it is a multi-enzymatic system, reac-
tion conditions can only be altered marginally. Addition-
ally, most b-keto acids are instable due to spontaneous
decarboxylation. A potential solution to this crucial pro-
blem is discussed in the conclusion section. A simple
assay for the screening ofω-TAs has been developed by
Schätzle et al. (2009). The assay is based on the transa-
mination of the model substrate a-methylbenzylamine
to acetophenone (see Figure 3c). Acetophenone exhibits
high absorbance around 245 nm. While this assay does
not directly screen for activity towards b-amino acids,
a-methylbenzylamine constitutes a good model sub-
strate for ω-TAs which also possess activity towards
short-chain aliphatic b-amino acids. Advantages of this
assay are its applicability to cell extracts, the possibility
to determine the enantiopreference by using enantio-
pure a-methylbenzylamine and its high sensitivity. The
same group recently published another assay which
allows the determination of amino donor specificity (see
Figure 3d) (Schätzle et al. 2010,). The principle of the
assay differs from all other presented methods as it mea-
sures the change of conductivity of the reaction mixture.
The progression of the reaction results in a decrease of
conductivity as charged compounds (a positively
charged amine and a negatively charged keto acid) are
converted to non-conducting products (a non-charged
ketone and a zwitterionic amino acid). Advantages of
this assay are the broad spectra of amino donors and
amino acceptors which can be used and its high sensi-
tivity. Yet the mode of analysis itself makes the simulta-
neous measurement of many samples cumbersome as

each reaction tube or well would have to be equipped
with an electrode. This conductivity assay should also
work using ab-keto acid instead of ana-keto acid, lead-
ing to the zwitterionic b-amino acid and an uncharged
ketone. However, the potential spontaneous decarboxy-
lation of the chargedb-keto acid to an uncharged com-
pound might lead to some conductivity decrease even
without TA activity. Hopw ood et al. (2011) recently
described a multi-enzymatic reaction system employing
an amino acid oxidase which converts the co-product of
the transamination reaction, D- or L-alanine, to the cor-
responding imine (see Figure 3e). The hereby produced
H
2O2 oxidizes, catalyzed by horse radish peroxidase, the
dye pyrogallol red. The reaction can be monitored by
measuring the decrease in absorbance around 540 nm.
This method allows the use of many different amine
donors as well as the determination of the enantiopre-
ference of the transaminase. When using ab-amino acid
instead of an amine, false positive results might occur if
the amino acid oxidase (AAO) also oxidizes the educt
and not only the coproduct. However, to our knowledge
such AAO activity towards b-amino acids has never
been reported. Further drawbacks include that free
amino acids distort the results, which makes enzyme
purification necessary and that as it is a multi-enzymatic
reaction system, reaction conditions can only be chan-
ged marginally.
Conclusions and future areas of research
TAs possess a great potential for the enzymatic synth-
esis of enantiopure b-amino acids as these enzymes
offer the possibility to gain a 100% yield in contrast to
the conventional kinetic resolutions using other biocata-
lysts (see introduction). Transaminases are commonly
used tools in the synthesis of various chemicals and
pharmaceuticals. Thus prod uction and purification of
these enzymes in bulk quantities is well-established, and
so is immobilization. Additionally, several process para-
meters for biotechnological applications are well investi-
gated for both kinetic resolutions and asymmetric
syntheses, e.g. the usage of different (co-)solvents and
variation of pH and PLP concentration as well as differ-
ent strategies of product removal (Koszelewski et al.
2008,). Of special importance are the thoroughly tried
and tested methods to shift the equilibrium to the pro-
duct side by removal of the coproduct (kinetic resolu-
tions) or degradation of the coproduct/recycling of the
amino donor by different enzymes in asymmetric synth-
esis (Koszelewski et al. 2010).
All these benefits for technical applications are not
established with aminomutases and only in part with
hydantoinases (as described above), so TAs appear as
the most promising candidates among the potential bio-
catalysts for a 100% yield synthesis ofb-amino acids.
A key step in fulfilling this potential is the discovery of
new TAs with a broader substrate spectrum and differ-
ent enantioselectivity. This will be greatly facilitated by
the HTP-activity assays described in this article, which
allow for time and cost efficient screening, characteriza-
tion and enzyme optimization. As has been discussed,
transaminases which act on aliphaticb-amino acids are
abundant, while only a small number of transaminases
which act on aromatic b-amino acids have been
described. The application o f protein engineering to
enhance the activity of TAs towards aromaticb-amino
acids has been only moderately successful. The crystal
structure of the transaminase of Mesorhizobium sp.
LUK will lead to a more targeted approach in protein
engineering.
Little attention so far has been paid to the preparation
of the thermodynamically instable b-keto substrate. A
possible route is the enzymatic hydrolysis of the corre-
sponding b-keto-ester. Although such a route has
already been described (Banerjee et al. 2005,Kim et al.
2007,) further optimizati on will be necessary for the
development of efficient processes as the reported yields
are quite low (~20%). This might be due to the loss of
the intermediary b-keto acid via decarboxylation to acet-
ophenone (which is not discussed in Kim et al. 2007).
This instability of the potential substrates indeed
appears as the bottleneck inb-amino acid synthesis via
transaminases. A more ele gant solution could be
obtained by changing the sequence in this coupled
enzyme reaction: If the TA accepts the stable b-keto
ester (1) the intermediary synthesis of the b-keto acid
can be circumvented and (2) the adjacent application of
an enantioselective lipase to subsequently cleave the
intermediary chiral b-amino acid ester would further
enhance the ee value. As the authors assume this can
not happen in the reported reaction due to a mandatory
anchoring of the substrate’s carboxylic group by one of
the two binding pockets around the PLP-lysine Schiff
base (the external aldimine intermediate) which is cer-
tainly not possible with the esterified substrate (Kim et
al. 2007).
However, advances in protein design and substrate
modeling might help to overcome this problem, as for
example the excavation of the small pocket of the com-
monly used transaminase ATA-117 allowed the (R) -
selective amination of prositagliptin ketone to the anti-
diabetic compound sitagliptin (Savile et al. 2010) which
was not successful before using a variety of unmodified
TAs due to sterical hindrance.
Not least, the potential of TAs for the asymmetric
synthesis of b-amino acids can be assumed to be even
much higher, as most of the numerous commercially
available TAs have never been tested with b-amino
acids or b-keto acids as substrates (the latter due to
Rudat et al. AMB Express 2012, 2:11

their instability mentioned above). So the conclusive key
step will be a modification of the HTP-assays described
to allow a fast and comprehensive screening for b-TA
activity.
