ABSTRACT: Enantiomerically pure 1,2-amino alcohols are important compounds due to their biological activities and wide
applications in chemical synthesis. In this work, we present two multienzyme pathways for the conversion ofL-phenylalanine into
either 2-phenylglycinol or phenylethanolamine in the enantiomerically pure form. Both pathways start with the two-pot sequential
four-step conversion of
L-phenylalanine into styrene via subsequent deamination, decarboxylation, enantioselective epoxidation, and
enantioselective hydrolysis. For instance, after optimization, the multienzyme process could convert 507 mg ofL-phenylalanine into
(R)-1-phenyl-1,2-diol in an overall isolated yield of 75% and >99% ee. The opposite enantiomer, (S)-1-phenyl-1,2-diol, was also
obtained in a 70% yield and 98−99% ee following the same approach. At this stage, two divergent routes were developed to convert
the chiral diols into either 2-phenylglycinol or phenylethanolamine. The former route consisted of a one-pot concurrent
interconnected two-step cascade in which the diol intermediate was oxidized to 2-hydroxy-acetophenone by an alcohol
dehydrogenase and then aminated by a transaminase to give enantiomerically pure 2-phenylglycinol. Notably, the addition of an
alanine dehydrogenase enabled the connection of the two steps and made the overall process redox-self-suﬃcient. Thus, (S)-
phenylglycinol was isolated in an 81% yield and >99.4% ee starting from ca. 100 mg of the diol intermediate. The second route
consisted of a one-pot concurrent two-step cascade in which the oxidative and reductive steps were not interconnected. In this case,
the diol intermediate was oxidized to either (S)- or (R)-2-hydroxy-2-phenylacetaldehyde by an alcohol oxidase and then aminated by
an amine dehydrogenase to give the enantiomerically pure phenylethanolamine. The addition of a formate dehydrogenase and
sodium formate was required to provide the reducing equivalents for the reductive amination step. Thus, (R)-phenylethanolamine
was isolated in a 92% yield and >99.9% ee starting from ca. 100 mg of the diol intermediate. In summary,
L-phenylalanine was
converted into enantiomerically pure 2-phenylglycinol and phenylethanolamine in overall yields of 61% and 69%, respectively. This
work exempliﬁes how linear and divergent enzyme cascades can enable the synthesis of high-value chiral molecules such as amino
alcohols from a renewable material such as
L-phenylalanine with high atom economy and improved sustainability.

1. INTRODUCTION
Over the past two decades, biocatalysis has made a major
contribution toward sustainable chemical synthesis, in
particular for the highly selective syntheses of high-value chiral
molecules.
1−10 In this context, the utilization of biocatalysis to
convert biomass-derived starting materials into chiral mole-
cules as intermediates orﬁnal products for the manufacture of
active pharmaceutical ingredients, ﬂavors, fragrances, agro-
chemicals, andﬁne chemicals can make a decisive contribution
to enabling a circular economy.
11−18 Natural amino acids are
abundant and inexpensive biobased feedstocks produced by
fermentation that have been marginally used as starting
materials for the chemical synthesis of chiral molecules.
19−21
For instance, the fermentative production ofL-phenylalanine
with a titer above 70 g per liter of culture can be accomplished
from glucose or glycerol usingEscherichia coli strains in which
the
L-phenylalanine biosynthesis pathway (i.e., the shikimate
pathway) has been engineered.22−26 In contrast, chiral 1,2-
amino alcohol motifs are widespread in biologically active
compounds and bioactive natural products such as antibiotics,
neurotransmitters, β-adrenergic blockers, and antiviral
drugs.
27−29 They also ﬁnd application in asymmetric organic
synthesis as ligands, chiral auxiliaries, and even organo-
catalysts.30−32 As illustrated inFigure 1, chiral phenylethanol-
amines and 2-phenylglycinols are particularly important in this
context for their chemical and biological properties.
Highly selective asymmetric synthesis methods remain
widely sought after to obtain these and many other valuable
compounds and intermediates thereof in high chemical and
optical purities. Synthetically applied methods comprise the
Sharpless asymmetric aminohydroxylation of terminal ole-
ﬁns,
33,34 the asymmetric hydrogenation of prochiral amino
ketones,35 and the ring-opening of an epoxide with an amine as
the nucleophile.36−39 Nevertheless, these methods have some
drawbacks related to their selectivity and sustainability, as the

phenylethanolamines are hardly ever obtained in their
enantiomerically pure forms and toxic metals and reagents
are often required in superstoichiometric amounts.
40−42
Consequently, resolution techniques are still mainly used for
the preparation of optically pure 1,2-amino alcohols. 35
Notably, biocatalytic strategies for the synthesis of chiral 1,2-
amino alcohols have also been developed;
43−52 however, only a
few methods are currently available for the speciﬁc synthesis of
chiral phenylethanolamines and 2-phenylglycinols.44,49,53,54
A chemo-biocatalytic route toward phenylethanolamines
entails the ring-opening of styrene oxide with ammonia under
microwave irradiation; styrene oxide is obtained from the
bioepoxidation of styrene with a styrene monooxygenase.
55 In
full biocatalytic approaches, linear cascades have been
demonstrated to be viable options due to their often high
selectivity and atom eﬃciency.
56,57 Notable examples are a
multienzymatic cascade for the asymmetric synthesis of (R)-2-
phenylglycinol ((R)-7) from racemic styrene oxide (4);58 a
one-pot three-step enzymatic process to convert a series of
halo ketones to the corresponding amino alcohols, including
the natural antiviral product (S)-tembamide;
29 the conversion
of styrene to ( S)-phenylethanolamine ((S)-9) by modular
cascade biocatalysis; 59 and the engineered hemoprotein-
catalyzed direct enantioselective aminohydroxylation of
oleﬁns.

In this work, we exemplify the potential of biocatalysis for
the synthesis of high-value aromatic 1,2-amino alcohols such as
optically active phenylethanolamines and 2-phenylglycinols
through enzymatic cascade reactions starting from
L-phenyl-
alanine as a renewable material. These cascades harness some
of the engineered enzymes and reactions that our group has
developed over the pastﬁve years.

2. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
2.1. Conversion ofL-Phenylalanine into (R)-1-Phenyl-
ethane-1,2-diol. Scheme 1 depicts the ﬁrst part of our
synthetic strategy in whichL-phenylalanine (L-1) is converted
into ( R)-1-phenylethane-1,2-diol (( R)-5) through two-pot
four-step sequential biocatalytic cascades (or two-pot four-
stage cascades, as all four steps are separated in time) with only
one intermediate extraction step.
L-1 (20 mM, 3.1 mmol, 507
mg) was ﬁrst deaminated to cinnamic acid (2) with >99%
conversion and >99% chemoselectivity (seeFigure S2). The
reaction was catalyzed by lyophilizedE. coli cells (3 g, 20 mg
mL−1) expressing a tyrosine ammonia lyase fromRhodobacter
sphaeroides (TAL),60 which were suspended in a KPi buﬀer
(pH 9, 50 mM, 150 mL) for 24 h at 30°C. Following the
removal of the cell pellets by centrifugation, the reaction
mixture from step 1 was directly reacted in the subsequent
step. The pH of the mixture was lowered to 6.5−7 via the
addition of HCl, and lyophilizedE. colicells (3 g, 20 mg mL
−1)
expressing a ferulic acid decarboxylase from Saccharomyces
cerevisiae (FDC1/tPAD1)61 were added to perform the
decarboxylation of 2 to styrene (3) over 24 h at 30°C. At
the end of the reaction (conversion step 2 > 99%, seeFigure
S3), 3 was extracted withn-heptane and used directly in the
next one-pot two-step (or one-pot two-stage) sequential
cascade. The ﬁrst step of the second pot (Scheme 1, pot B)
was a biocatalytic epoxidation performed in an organic/
aqueous biphasic system. The inﬂuence of the ratio of the two
phases on the conversion was initially tested on an analytical
scale (total volume of 1 mL), which showed that a 1:1 volume
ratio was the optimal condition (seeSI section 3.1). Therefore,
the solution ofn-heptane (150 mL) containing intermediate3
was combined with a KPi buﬀer (pH 8, 50 mM, 150 mL)
containing lyophilized E. coli cells (5 mg mL
−1, related to the
aqueous phase) expressing our previously reported chimeric
styrene monooxygenase (Fus-SMO), where the reductive
(StyB) and monooxygenase (StyA) enzyme units were fused
together using aﬂexible linker.
62 This biocatalytic epoxidation
step required reducing equivalents that were provided by a
catalytic amount of the reduced nicotinamide adenine
dinucleotide coenzyme (NADH), which was generated in
situ and recycled from NAD
+ (1 mM) by a formate
dehydrogenase (Cb-FDH) and sodium formate (100 mM, 5
equiv). Notably, Fus-SMO and Cb-FDH were produced
together in the same E. coli cells through cloning and the
balanced expression of both genes in a Duet-vector. This is an
improvement on previous work in which the enzymes were
coexpressed using diﬀerent plasmids in the same host.62 After a
20 hr reaction time at 30°C (>99% conversion and perfect
chemoselectivity), the same reaction pot containing the (S)-
styrene epoxide ((S)-4) product was subjected to the next
step, where lyophilized E. coli cells (3 g, 20 mg mL −1)
expressing an epoxide hydrolase from Solanum tuberosum
St(R)-EH were simply added to the mixture. 63−65 The
regioselective biocatalytic hydrolysis step was run for an
additional 24 h and proceeded with the full inversion of the
stereochemical conﬁguration of (S)-4 to yield (R)-1-phenyl-
ethane-1,2-diol ((R)-5) in a quantitative conversion and 94%
chemoselectivity. The product was recovered by separation
between then-heptane phase and the aqueous phase, the latter
of which was further extracted with methyl-tert-butyl ether.
The organic phases were then dried with anhydrous MgSO4,
and the solvent was removed. In summary, at the end of this
two-pot four-step sequential biocatalytic process and workup
(see the Experimental Part for details), (R)-5 was recovered
from L-1 in a 75% overall isolated yield (320 mg) with high
chemical (>99%) and optical (ee > 99%) purities. Notably,
intermediate puriﬁcation steps were not required, thereby
minimizing waste generation and work time. (S)-Conﬁgured 1-
phenylethane-1,2-diol ((S)-5) could also be generated (98−
99% ee, 70% yield, 240 mg from (S)-4) in a similar manner
under not-fully optimized conditions by changing the
selectivity of the epoxide hydrolase in the last hydrolytic step
(see SI section 3.2). We performed this reaction using an
epoxide hydrolase from Sphingomonas sp. HXN200 (Sp(S)-
EH).
63−65
Products (R)-5 and (S)-5 were used as starting materials in
two subsequent and distinct one-pot biocatalytic cascades for
the synthesis of either optically pure 2-phenylglycinol (7)o r
phenylethanolamine (9), as described in the following sections.
2.2. Conversion of (R)-1-Phenylethane-1,2-diol into
(S)- and (R)-2-Phenylglycinol. At this stage, we initially
intended to convert (R)- or (S)-5, obtained as previously
reported, into (R)- or (S)-2-phenylglycinol ((R)- or (S)-7)
through the one-pot combination of a “secondary” NAD-

dependent alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) and an amine
dehydrogenase (AmDH), thus following our previously
developed strategy for the synthesis of optically pure
phenylpropanolamines.
63,66 However, all the tested AmDHs
proved to be unsuitable for this process (data not shown).
Therefore, we turned our attention to the alcohol amination by
combining an ADH with an ω-transaminase (ωTA), thus
following our alternative strategy for the synthesis of
phenylpropanolamines (Scheme 2).
64,67
In this alcohol amination cascade, Aa-ADH oxidizes (R)-5 to
the hydroxyketone intermediate ( 6) and then the ωTA
performs the transamination of the carbonyl moiety to yield
either (R)-7 or (S)-7; additionally, the NAD+ coenzyme and
alanine as the amine donor are internally recycled from NADH
and pyruvate, respectively, by an alanine dehydrogenase from
Bacillus sphaericus (Bs-AlaDH)
68 at the expense of the
ammonia and ammonium species that are provided by the
reaction buﬀer.
The optimal biocatalysts for this transformation were
initially tested for the separated reactions on an analytical
scale. First, we investigated the oxidation of commercially
available rac-5 (20 mM) to the hydroxyketone (6) in a Tris-
HCl buﬀer (pH 7.5, 50 mM;ﬁnal reaction volume of 1 mL)
using 12 di ﬀerent alcohol dehydrogenases, namely Bs-
BDHA,
69,70 Pp-ADH,71,72 Sy-ADH,73 Rs-ADH,74 Ls-ADH,75
three variants of Te-ADH (v1, v2, and v3),76 Aa-ADH,77 Lbv-
ADH,78 and Lb-ADH.79 For details on the abbreviations of
enzyme names and related preparations, seeSI section 1and
Table S1. The reaction with Ls-ADH was carried out in KPi
buﬀer at pH 6.5 (100 mM) rather than pH 7.5 because
previous tests performed in our laboratory demonstrated that
this enzyme was more sensitive toward higher pH values. The
tests were conducted in the presence of either NAD
+ or
NADP+ (1 mM) depending on the selectivity of the ADH.
NAD+ and NADP+ were internally recycled with speci ﬁc
oxidoreductases (10μM), which consume molecular oxygen as
oxidant. NOx from Streptococcus mutans80 and YcnD from
Bacillus subtilis81 were used for the reoxidation of NADH and
NADPH, respectively. High conversions into6 were observed
when Aa-ADH, Lbv-ADH, Bs-BDHA, and Lb-ADH were used
(considering both that the substrate5 was used as racemate
and that these ADHs have a preference toward one of the two
enantiomers). Moderate conversions were also observed with
Ls-ADH and Rs-ADH, while the remaining ADHs were not
active toward the target substrate (SI section 4and Table S3).
Among this latter group, Sy-ADH, Pp-ADH, and Te-ADH-v3
are described as “non-stereoselective” ADHs. Since these
enzymes were found not to be catalytically active toward5, the
utilization of rac-5 as a possible intermediate was ruled out at
this stage. However, this is not a synthetic limitation since
optically pure 5 can be eﬃciently obtained via the enzymatic
strategy illustrated in this work. Therefore, we tested the best-
performing ADH from the previous set of experiments with
either enantiopure (R)-5 or enantiopure (S)-5 (10 mM, SI
section 4 and Table S4). Among these four best ADHs, we
excluded Lb-ADH because it was NADP-dependent. In fact,
the use of a NAD-dependent ADH is more suitable for our
intended ﬁnal cascades, and NAD
+ is also cheaper than
NADP+.L b v - A D Hc o n v e r t e d(S)-5 into 6 with >99%
conversion, whereas Aa-ADH and Bs-BDHA converted (R)-5
into 6 with 84% and 69% conversion, respectively (SI section 4
and Table S4).
In the next step, we investigated the cascade from (R)- or
(S)-5 to (R)- or ( S)-7 using combinations of the three
previously selected ADHs (i.e., Aa-ADH, LBv-ADH, and Bs-
BDHA) and ﬁve stereocomplementary ω-transaminases,
namely At-ωTA,
82−84 Cv-ωTA,85 Bm-ωTA,86 Ac-ωTA,87,88
and Vf-ωTA.89,90 For details on the abbreviations of enzyme
names, see SI section 1 and Table S1. The reactions were
carried out at 30°C for 48 h in a HCOONH4 buﬀer (pH 8.5, 1
M) supplemented with NAD+ (1 mM), D-o r L-alanine (50
mM), ω-TA (varied concentrations of 35 −60 μM), ADH
(varied concentrations of 24−70 μM), Bs-AlaDH (20 μM),
and substrate (10 mM). The experiments showed the
inherently lower activity of Cv- ωTA toward the in situ
generated intermediate6 compared with those of At-ωTA and
Bm-ωTA. Furthermore, selected experiments where Ac-ωTA
and Vf-ωTA were used did not yield any conversion (seeSI
section 5 and Tables S5 and S6). Under the optimal reaction
conditions (Table 1), both (S)-7 and (R)-7 were obtained
from (R)-5 in high yields and excellent optical purities using
Aa-ADH from Aromatoleum aromaticum combined with At-
ωTA from Aspergillus terreus and Bm- ωTA from Bacillus
megaterium.
To prove the synthetic applicability of the one-pot
biocatalytic amination, the bioconversion of (R)-5 into (S)-7
was performed on a 101 mg scale. The product (S)-7 was
obtained in an 81% isolated yield with 98% purity and >99.4%
ee (see theExperimental Part for details).
2.3. Conversion of (S)- and (R)-1-Phenylethane-1,2-
diol into (S)- and (R)-Phenylethanolamine. At this stage,
we intended to convert (R)-5 or (S)-5, obtained as previously
reported, into either (R)- or (S)-phenylethanolamine ((R)- or
(S)-9) through the one-pot combination of a“primary” ADH
and an amine dehydrogenase (AmDH). We initially tested the
oxidation of intermediate 5 into 2-hydroxy-2-phenylacetalde-
hyde (8) using an alcohol dehydrogenase. The hT-ADH from
Bacillus stearothermophilus,
91 and the HL-ADH from Equus
caballus (i.e., horse liver)92 were tested, as both have been
known to oxidize the primary alcohol functionalities of
molecules similar to 5. Ht-ADH was used in its puri ﬁed
form (50μM), whereas HL-ADH was a commercially available
enzyme and was used as the lyophilized cell lysate (2 mg mL

crude enzyme; activity of 0.52 U mg−1; 20% protein content).
In both cases, the biocatalytic oxidation ofrac-5 (20 mM) was
performed in a Tris-HCl buﬀer (pH 7.5, 50 mM;ﬁnal reaction
volume of 1 mL) in the presence of a NAD+ recycling system
(1 mM NAD+;1 0 μM NOx). Contrary to our expectations,
hT-ADH exhibited no activity toward substrate rac-5, while
HL-ADH produced the hydroxyketone isomer6 rather than
the desired product 8, thus actually acting as a secondary
ADH. Such activity of HL-ADH on secondary alcohol moieties
with certain molecules was also reported in the literature.93−97
Therefore, we envisioned an alternative strategy for the
amination of the primary alcohol moiety of5 that combined
a variant of the choline oxidase (AcCO6) originated from
Arthrobacter chlorophenolicus 98 with an AmDH (Ch1-
AmDH).99,100 Thus, this cascade for the bioamination of the
diol 5 is comprised of two concurrent, albeit disconnected,
steps that must confer a more favorable thermodynamic
equilibrium (Scheme 3).
Another advantage of AcCO6 is that it is an oxidase;
therefore, its activity does not depend on the NADH/NAD+
coenzyme. However, a catalase must be added to prevent the
possible deactivation of any enzyme in the reaction mixture
due to the formation of H2O2 as a side product in the oxidation
reaction. Furthermore, the addition of a catalytic amount of
NAD+ and a formate dehydrogenase from Candida boidinii
(Cb-FDH) is required in the second reductive amination step
of the cascade for the in situ generation and recycling of
NADH.76,100
The reactions were performed in a HCOONH4 buﬀer (pH
8.5, 1 M) that provided both the source of the amino group
and the reducing hydride (i.e., for NADH regeneration) for the
reductive amination. The initial set of experiments (SI section
6 and Table S7) were carried out using an equimolar ratio of
AcCO6 and Ch1-AmDH (50 μM each) in a HCOONH
4
buﬀer (pH 8.5, 1 M; 0.5 mL) supplemented with a catalytic
amount of NAD+ (1 mM) and a catalase (0.1 mg mL−1). 5
was used as the substrate either as a racemate or as a single
enantiomer in the R-o r S-absolute conﬁguration (10 or 20
mM). The quantitative conversion of rac-5 into the target
amino alcohol 9 was detected at the 10 mM scale, and
oxidation at the 20 mM scale aﬀorded 90% conversion. Due to
the racemic form of the substrate, the enantiomeric excess of
the product was low in both cases (10% ee (S)). Therefore,
although AcCO6 did not strongly discriminate between the
two enantiomers of5, we observed a small preference for the
oxidation of (S)-5 over (R)-5. Next, the same reaction and
conditions were investigated to convert optically pure 5 as
substrates, obtained from L-phenylalanine (L-1) via the ﬁrst
cascades, into chiral products9.( S)-5 was converted, resulting
in a 98% (at 10 mM substrate concentration) or 88% (at 20
mM substrate concentration) yield of (S)-9. As expected, the
enantiomeric excess of the starting material (S)-5 (98−99%
ee) was the same as that in theﬁnal product (S)-9.( R)-5 was
also converted into (R)-9, with 92% or 72% conversion at a
substrate concentration of 10 or 20 mM, respectively, and
showed the same enantiomeric excess of the starting material
(>99% ee ( R)). The slightly lower conversion for ( R)-5
compared with that for (S)-5 again indicates the slightly higher
preference of AcCO6 to oxidize the (S)-enantiomer of the
substrate. Notably, the iso merization of the aldehyde
intermediate 8 to the more stable hydroxyacetophenone (6)
via keto−enol tautomerization was not detected (seeFigure
S10). However, we observed the formation of benzylamine
(11) as a side product (from 2% to 8%) in nearly all tests; the
only exception was the reaction of rac-5 at the 10 mM
concentration for which quantitative conversion into 9 was
detected. A possible explanation for this result is that the
aldehyde intermediate 8 undergoes cleavage to benzaldehyde
(10), which is then converted to benzylamine (11) by Ch1-
AmDH (seeFigure S10). To investigate that possibility, (S)-5
(20 mM) was incubated in a HCOONH4 buﬀer (pH 8.5, 1 M,
1 mL) in the presence of AcCO6 (50μM) and a catalase (0.1
mg mL−1). A negative control experiment was performed by
incubating the substrate in the same reaction mixture devoid of

AcCO6 and the catalase (for details, seeSI section 7). The
reactions in the presence of AcCO6 and the catalase led to
27% and 32% benzaldehyde (10) formation within 6 and 48 h
of incubation, respectively. In contrast, we did not observe any
formation of 10 in the negative control experiment after 48 h
(see Figure S11). Therefore, benzylamine (11) was indeed
formed by the Ch1-AmDH-catalyzed reductive amination of
side product 10.
Diﬀerent enzyme loadings were tested to improve the
conversions, especially in the case of (R)-5 (SI section 6and
Table S8). Three sets of experiments were carried out in which
the molar ratio between AcCO6 and Ch1-AmDH was varied.
The reaction of (S)-5 (20 mM) at a higher AcCO6 loading (70
μM) led to quantitative substrate conversion, although 11% of
11 was formed along with 89% of the desired product (S)-9.A t
lower AcCO6 loadings (10 or 24 μM), (S)-9 was obtained
with 41−77% conversion along with traces of 11 (2−4%).
Therefore, the use of equimolar amounts of AcCO6 and Ch1-
AmDH (50μM each) turned out to be the optimal condition
for the amination of ( S)-5, as reported in the initial
experiments. In contrast, the optimal conditions for the
amination of ( R)-5 (10 mM) were found to be 70 μM
AcCO6 and 35 μM Ch1-AmDH, which resulted in 98%
conversion into product (R)-9 and traces of11 (2%).
In summary, we could obtain our target products (S)-9 and
(R)-9 with high conversions (98%) and enantiomeric excesses
(ee up to >99%) by tuning the substrate and enzyme loadings
to enhance the formation of the desired product while also
limiting the side production of benzylamine (Table 2).
To prove the synthetic applicability of the one-pot
biocatalytic amination, the bioconversion of (R)-
5 to (R)-9
was performed on a 104 mg scale. The product (R)-9 was
obtained in a 92% isolated yield with 98% purity and >99.9%
ee (see theExperimental Part for details).
3. CONCLUSION
In this work, we have presented the stereoselective synthesis of
both enantiomers of 2-phenylglycinol ( 7)a n dt h o s eo f
phenylethanolamine ( 9) in highly optically pure forms
(>99% ee) through consecutive and divergent biocatalytic
routes starting from
L-phenylalanine ( L-1)a sr e n e w a b l e
material. In the ﬁrst route, L-1 was converted into (R)-5 or
(S)-5 at a ca. 500 mg scale with total isolated yields of 75% and
70%, respectively.
At this stage, two divergent routes were envisioned to lead to
the formation of optically pure enantiomers of either 2-
phenylglycinol (7) or phenylethanolamine (9). In the ﬁrst
route, (R)-5 was converted into (S)-7 or (R)-7 in a 97% or
70% yield, respectively, on an analytical scale. The ca. 100 mg
scale conversion of (R)-5 under the same reaction conditions
produced (S)-7 in an 81% isolated yield with >99.4% ee. In the
second route, (R)- or (S)-5 was converted into (R)- or (S)-9
on an analytical scale with 98% conversion. The ca. 100 mg
scale conversion of (R)-5 under the same reaction conditions
produced (R)-9 in a 92% isolated yield with >99.9% ee.
In summary, this work exempliﬁes the potential impact of
linear biocatalytic cascade reactions on the highly atom
eﬃcient and sustainable syntheses of high-value chiral
molecules from available and inexpensive renewable material
such as
L-phenylalanine. For instance, this amino acid is
produced by fermentation and is a suitable starting material for
further biotransformations, both in vivo and in vitro. In fact,
the fermentation product mixtures of
L-phenylalanine normally
contain low amounts of byproducts, namely acetate, lactate,
and succinate. These compounds are not known to
signiﬁcantly interfere with or inhibit other enzymes.
24
However, puri ﬁed L-phenylalanine can be obtained by
integrating a reactive extraction step into the fermentation
process, as described elsewhere at the 300 L scale.
101 In this
work, L-phenylalanine could be converted into either ( S)-
phenylglycinol or (R)-phenylethanolamine in a total combined
yield of 61% or 69%, respectively (seeFigure 2).
Notably, the process for converting L-phenylalanine into
enantiomerically pure phenylethanolamine is comprised of a
total of six steps performed in three pots. The reaction formally
consumes only dioxygen as a simple and innocuous reagent
and produces stoichiometric hydrogen carbonate as the sole
byproduct, while water and ammonia molecules are formally
exchanged along the process. These results also pave the way
for the future metabolic engineering of E. coli whole-cell
systems in which all the required enzymes for a certain cascade
are coexpressed, thereby potentially improving the eﬃciency of
the biochemical process.

4. EXPERIMENTAL PART
4.1. Two-Pot Sequential Four-Step Cascades for the
Conversion of L-Phenylalanine (L-1) into (R)-1-Phenyl-
ethane-1,2-diol ((R)-5) at a ca. 500 mg Scale.Step 1: A
KPi buﬀer (pH 8.0, 50 mM, 150 mL) andL-1 (20 mM, 3.1
mmol, 507 mg) were added into a 250 mL Erlenmeyerﬂask.
Then, the pH of the mixture was adjusted to 9.0−10.0 by
adding KOH (10 M), and to the mixture were added
lyophilized E. coli whole-cells carrying overexpressed tyrosine
ammonia lyase (TAL, 3 g, 20 mg mL
−1). The reaction mixture
was incubated at 30°C and 170 rpm for 24 h. Following the
removal of the cell debris by centrifugation (10 min, 14000
rpm, 18800 × g), an aliquot of the reaction mixture (0.5 mL)
was analyzed by RP-HPLC (method A) to determine the
conversion into the desired cinnamic acid intermediate (2). In
this work, we determined the conversion using the following

ratio: (observed product form ation)/(observed product
formation + observed remaining substrate).
Step 2: Without any intermediate workup, the pH of the
reaction mixture in the same pot from step 1 was lowered to
6.5−7.0 by adding concentrated HCl. Next, to the mixture
were added lyophilized E. coli cells carrying overexpressed
ferulic acid decarboxylase (FDC1/tPAD1, 3 g, 20 mg mL
−1).
The reaction mixture was incubated at 30°C and 170 rpm for
24 h. Following removal of the cell debris by centrifugation (10
min, 14000 rpm, 18800× g), an aliquot of the reaction mixture
(0.5 mL) was analyzed by RP-HPLC (method A) to determine
the conversion into the styrene (3) . Next,3 was extracted with
n-heptane (3× 50 mL), and the obtained organic solution was
used directly in the subsequent step.
Step 3: A KPi buﬀer (pH 8.0, 50 mM, 150 mL), lyophilized
E. coli cells carrying coexpressed chimeric styrene monoox-
ygenase and formate dehydrogenase (Fus-SMO/FDH, 5 mg
mL
−1), NAD+ (1 mM), FAD (50μM), HCOONa (100 mM, 5
equiv), and a catalase (0.1 mg mL−1) were added in a 500 mL
tribaﬄed ﬂask. Then, to the mixture was added the solution of
3 in n-heptane (150 mL) obtained from step 2. The reaction
mixture was incubated at 30°C and 200 rpm for 20 h. The
conversion was monitored by GC-FID (method A) using an
aliquot of the reaction mixture. When the conversion was
quantitative, the reaction proceeded to step 4.
Step 4: Lyophilized E. coli cells carrying overexpressed
epoxide hydrolase (St(R)-EH, 3 g, 20 mg mL
−1) were added to
the same pot from step 3 without any intermediate workup.
The reaction mixture was further incubated at 30°C and 170
rpm for 24 h. Then-heptane phase was then separated from
the aqueous phase. The latter phase was saturated with solid
NaCl and extracted with MTBE (3× 100 mL). The combined
organic phase was dried over anhydrous MgSO
4 and
concentrated under reduced pressure to yield product (R)-5
(320 mg, 75% total isolated yield calculated from the L-
phenylalanine (L-1) starting material; ee > 99% ( R); 93%
purity). The conversion and purity of the isolated product
were analyzed by GC-FID (method A), and the enantiomeric
excess was determined using chiral NP-HPLC (method B); see
SI section 3.3and Figures S4 and S5.
1H NMR (seeFigure S6)
spectra were recorded after column chromatography with
petroleum ether and ethyl acetate (1:1, v v
−1) as the eluent (Rf
= 0.3), which aﬀorded the quantitative yield of puriﬁcation.

Cascade for the Conversion of (R)-1-Phenylethane-1,2-
diol ((R)-5) into (S)-2-Phenylglycinol ((S)-7) at a ca. 100
mg Scale. An ammonium formate buﬀer (2 M, pH 8.5, 37.5
mL), H2O (28 mL), NAD+ (1 mM, 49 mg), PLP (1 mM, 19
mg), D-alanine (50 mM, 322 mg), and substrate (R)-5 (10
mM, 101 mg) were added to a 250 mL Erlenmeyerﬂask. The
pH was adjusted to 8.5 with ammonia. Then, to the mixture
were added Bs-AlaDH (20μM), Aa-ADH (70μM), and At-
ωTA (35 μM). The total reaction volume was 73 mL. The
reaction mixture was incubated at 30°C for 70 h. The aqueous
reaction mixture was basi ﬁed with KOH (10 M, 9 mL),
saturated with solid NaCl, and extracted with EtOAc (2× 40
mL). Following the drying of the combined organic phases
over anhydrous MgSO
4, the organic phase was concentrated
under reduced pressure to yield product (S)-7 (orange oil, 81%
isolated yield (81 mg), 98% purity, ee > 99.4%). The
conversion and purity of the isolated product were measured
by GC-FID (method A), 1H NMR, and 13C NMR (see SI
section 8 and Figures S12, S15, and S16). The enantiomeric
excess was determined by RP-HPLC following derivatization
with GITC (method D); seeFigure S13.
4.3. One-Pot Simultaneous Disconnected Two-Step
Cascade for the Conversion of (R)-1-Phenylethane-1,2-
diol ((R)-5) into (R)-Phenylethanolamine ((R)-9) at a ca.
100 mg Scale.An ammonium formate buﬀer (2 M, pH 8.5,
37.5 mL), H
2O (16 mL), NAD+ (1 mM, 49 mg), a catalase
(0.1 mg mL−1, 7.3 mg), and substrate (R)-5 (10 mM, 104 mg)
were added to a 250 mL Erlenmeyer ﬂask. The pH was
adjusted to 8.5 with ammonia. Then, to the mixture were
added Cb-FDH (10μM), AcCO6 (70μM), and Ch1-AmDH
(35 μM). The total reaction volume was 73 mL. The reaction
mixture was incubated at 30°C for 70 h. The aqueous reaction
mixture was basiﬁed with KOH (10 M, 9 mL), saturated with
solid NaCl, and extracted with EtOAc (2× 40 mL). Following
the drying of the combined organic phases over anhydrous
MgSO
4, the organic phase was concentrated under reduced
pressure to yield product (R)-9 (yellow oil, 92% isolated yield
(95 mg), 98% purity, ee > 99.9%). The conversion and purity
of the isolated product were measured by GC-FID (method
A),
1H NMR, 13C NMR (see SI section 8 and Figures S12,
S17, and 18). The enantiomeric excess was determined by RP-
HPLC following derivatization with GITC (method D); see
