Abstract: Asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA) and symmetric dimethylarginine (SDMA) are
endogenous inhibitors of nitric oxide (NO) synthesis, and play a critical role in the process of
endothelial dysfunction, and are considered markers of oxidative stress. The aim of the present study
was to explore relationships between ADMA and /or SDMA and the occurrence of OSA in obese
patients as well as the e ﬀect of the endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) gene polymorphism,
which may modify the inﬂuence of ADMA or SDMA on NO production. A total of 518 unrelated
obese subjects were included in this study. Body weight, height and blood pressure were measured
and data on self-reported smoking status were collected. Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) was assessed
by the apnea hypopnea index (AHI). Blood samples were collected to measure serum concentrations
of glucose, total cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol, triglycerides, creatinine, HbA1c
(%), folic acid, vitamin B 12, C-reactive protein (CRP), aspartate aminotransferase (ASP), alanine
aminotransferase (ALT) and IL-6 by routine methods. TheNOS3 gene G894T and 4a/4b polymorphisms
were detected by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP)
analysis. ADMA, SDMA and arginine concentrations were assessed simultaneously using liquid
chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) method. Adjusted multivariate
logistic regression analysis showed a signiﬁcant association between the occurrence of OSA and high
serum ADMA levels, BMI above 40, age> 43 years, hypertension and male sex. Heterozygotes for the
G894T eNOS polymorphism have the lowest serum concentrations of ADMA and SDMA, while no
eﬀect of the 4a/4b variants was observed. The results indicate that OSA in obese individuals can
coexist with high ADMA levels, which appear as a potential OSA predictor.

1. Introduction
Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a chronic, sleep-related breathing disorder with increasing
prevalence. Obesity is one of the key risk factors for OSA, and untreated OSA increases the risk of

arterial hypertension, coronary artery disease, arrhythmia, heart failure and cerebrovascular diseases
commonly associated with obesity. It can be assumed that OSA incidence will continue to rise along with
the ongoing obesity epidemic. On the other hand, available data indicate that, currently, most people
with OSA are undiagnosed and untreated [1]. Therefore, biomarkers that could help to identify obese
patients at higher risk of OSA could improve early OSA diagnosis.
Asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA) is a methylated derivative of the amino acid L-arginine,
which is receiving increased attention as a cardiovascular risk factor. As a structural analog of L-arginine,
ADMA can directly inhibit nitric oxide (NO) synthesis by competitive binding to NO synthases,
resulting in decreased NO production in blood vessels and other tissues. ADMA also enhances nitric
oxide synthase (NOS) uncoupling and the production of reactive oxidative species (ROS), such as
superoxide anion (O2−) and peroxynitrite (ONOO−), which could further reduce the cardiovascular
NO bioavailability [ 2]. Existing experimental and clinical evidence indicates that even a small
change in ADMA levels signiﬁcantly aﬀects the intensity of nitric oxide production [3]. Symmetric
dimethylarginine (SDMA) is another methylated analogue of L-arginine found in humans. ADMA and
SDMA are generated from proteins, which are methylated on arginine residues by protein arginine
N-methyltransferases (PRMTs). PRMTs utilize SAM (S-adenosylmethionine) as a methyl donor and
generate SAH (S-adenosylhomocysteine) and, ultimately, homocysteine as a byproduct [4]. ADMA is
either eliminated by renal excretion or degraded by dimethylarginine dimethylaminohydrolase (DDAH).
In contrast to its stereoisomer, SDMA is almost completely eliminated with urine [5]. Both SDMA and
ADMA may reduce NO synthesis indirectly by inhibiting the cellular uptake of L-arginine, the NO
precursor (Scheme 1). Nitric oxide is involved in many biological processes. It causes the relaxation
of smooth muscle cells and the subsequent vasodilatation of blood vessels; prevents smooth muscle
cells proliferation and migration; reduces platelet adhesion and aggregation; and reduces monocyte
stickiness. It also exerts anti-inﬂammatory activity and reduces oxidation of LDL-cholesterol [ 2].
In endothelium, NO is synthesized by speciﬁc NO synthase (eNOS). Polymorphisms of the eNOS
gene are among the factors a ﬀecting nitric oxide synthase activity and basal NO production [ 5].
Disturbances in NO production and bioavailability have been recognized to increase the risk of
developing hypertension and other cardiovascular diseases commonly associated with OSA. Clinical
and experimental evidence indicate that ADMA and SDMA are involved in the endothelial dysfunction,
oxidative stress, and inﬂammation [6,7] and are associated with an enhanced risk of cardiovascular
diseases [2,4,8]. However, there is a lack of data describing potential associations between serum
ADMA and SDMA concentrations and BMI or OSA. There is also no data on the interaction between
ADMA, SDMA, arginine and the nitric oxide synthase gene polymorphism. Thus, the aim of the
present study was to explore relationships between the occurrence of OSA in individuals with obesity
and ADMA and/or SDMA levels, as well as the eﬀect of the endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS)
gene polymorphism, which may modify the inﬂuence of ADMA or SDMA on NO production.

2. Material and Methods 
2.1. Study Population 
A total of 518 unrelated individuals with obesity we re enrolled in this study. All subjects were 
consecutively recruited on the basis of clinical investigation between September 2013 and September 
2018 from patients who had been admitted to the Orlowski Hospital in Warsaw.  
The study was carried out in accordance with the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki. The 
whole study protocol and the consent procedure were approved by the Institutional Bioethics 
Committees (KB/127/2012 and KB/67/2017 at the Medical University of Warsaw; and 7/PB/2015 at the 
Medical Centre of Postgraduate Education). Wri tten informed consent was obtained from each 
participant after a full explanation of the study. 
A detailed clinical history, and a full physical examination, was obtained for each patient. All 
participants completed a questionnaire concerning smoking habits. Smoking status was categorized 
as never a smoker, current smoker, and former smoker. In all subjects, anthropometric measurements 
(body weight, and height) were taken and body ma ss index (BMI) was calculated as the ratio of 
weight (kilograms) to the square of height (meters). The data on DXA-derived measures of total body 
fat (fat mass expressed as % fat mass and kg) was available for the whole group of participants. 
Obesity was classified according to World Health  Organization criteria, and subjects with BMI ≥30 
kg/m
2 were considered obese. Participants were clas sified as being hypertensive if they had an 
average blood pressure ≥140/90 mm Hg, assessed as previously described [9], or by a previous 
diagnosis of hypertension and they were on hypert ensive medication at the time of the interview. 
Patients were classified as diab etics based on the review of medical records (previous diagnosis of 
diabetes by a physician, and current use of glucose-lowering medications) and confirmed by current 
medical examination. The diagnosis was made using criteria consistent with those proposed by the

participant after a full explanation of the study.
A detailed clinical history, and a full physical examination, was obtained for each patient.
All participants completed a questionnaire concerning smoking habits. Smoking status was categorized
as never a smoker, current smoker, and former smoker. In all subjects, anthropometric measurements
(body weight, and height) were taken and body mass index (BMI) was calculated as the ratio of
weight (kilograms) to the square of height (meters). The data on DXA-derived measures of total
body fat (fat mass expressed as % fat mass and kg) was available for the whole group of participants.
Obesity was classiﬁed according to World Health Organization criteria, and subjects with BMI
≥30 kg/m2 were considered obese. Participants were classiﬁed as being hypertensive if they had
an average blood pressure ≥140/90 mm Hg, assessed as previously described [ 9], or by a previous
diagnosis of hypertension and they were on hypertensive medication at the time of the interview.
Patients were classiﬁed as diabetics based on the review of medical records (previous diagnosis of
diabetes by a physician, and current use of glucose-lowering medications) and conﬁrmed by current
J. Clin. Med.2019, 8, 897 4 of 15
medical examination. The diagnosis was made using criteria consistent with those proposed by the
American Diabetes Association [10] (an average fasting glucose concentration ≥126 mg/dL on two
occasions, and/or 2 h glucose >200 mg/dL during an oral-glucose-tolerance test, and/or a casual glucose
>200 mg/dL). Participants were classiﬁed as having dyslipidemia if they had received a diagnosis
from a physician according to the National Cholesterol Education Program-Adult Treatment Panel
III (ATP III) guidelines [11] and/or reported the use of lipid lowering medications. All participants
underwent standard overnight assessment (polysomnography, PSG) to evaluate the presence of
obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). OSA was assessed by the apnea hypopnea index (AHI), which is
the number of complete (apneas) or incomplete (hypopneas) obstructive events per hour of sleep,
and deﬁned as AHI ≥5 [12].
2.2. Measurements of Biomarkers
Overnight peripheral fasting blood samples were taken from all subjects, and the serum was
either isolated and used for analyses, or stored at −80 ◦C. All samples were analyzed by specialized
clinical laboratory medical personnel. The laboratory analyses included measurements of total
cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C),
triglycerides, glucose, creatinine (CRE), HbA1c(%), folic acid, vitamin B12, C-reactive protein (CRP),
aspartate aminotransferase (ASP), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and erythrocyte sedimentation
rate (ESR). Serum levels of interleukine 6 (IL-6) were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent
assay (ELISA), using the Diaclone Human IL-6 High Sensitivity ELISA kit (Diaclone SAS, Besancon
Cedex, France). The estimated glomerular ﬁltration rate (eGFR) was calculated by the modiﬁcation of
diet in renal disease (MDRD) and the chronic kidney disease epidemiology collaboration (CKD-EPI)
equations [13]:
MDRD186: eGFR (mL/min/1.73 m2) = 186 × (serum creatinine, mg/dL)−1.154 ×
(age)−0.203 × 0.742 [if female], (1)
CKD EPI: eGFR (mL/min/1.73 m2) = 141 × min(serum creatinine, mg/dL/κ, 1)α ×
max(serum creatinine, mg/dL /κ, 1)−1.209 × 0.993Age × 1.018 [if female], (2)
2.3. Genotyping of the NOS3 4a/4b and NOS3 G894T Polymorphisms
Genomic DNA was extracted and puriﬁed from peripheral blood leukocytes using the Blood Mini
genomic DNA kit (A&A Biotechnology, Gdynia, Poland) according to the manufacturer’s instructions
and quantiﬁed by a UV-Vis spectrophotometer (Quawell Q3000, Quawell Technology Inc., San Jose,
CA, USA). The 27-bp repeat polymorphism in intron 4 of the NOS3 gene (NOS3 4a/4b polymorphism)
was analyzed by PCR ampliﬁcation. The ampliﬁed products were analyzed by electrophoresis on
agarose gel containing ethidium bromide and visualized under UV light (ChemiDoc MP , Bio-Rad,
Hercules, CA, USA). The eNOS G894T polymorphism (rs1799983) was evaluated by polymerase chain
reaction - restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) analysis. The detailed information of
those sites was the same as previously described [9].
2.4. ADMA, SDMA, and Arginine Measurements
ADMA, SDMA and arginine concentrations were assessed simultaneously using liquid
chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS).
Instrumental analysis was carried out by liquid chromatography (LC) coupled with a hybrid
triple quadrupole/linear ion trap mass spectrometer (QTRAP 4000; AB SCIEX, Framingham, MA, USA).
LC analysis was carried out with an Agilent 1260 Inﬁnity (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA),
equipped with a degasser, thermostated autosampler and binary pump, and connected to a mass
spectrometer equipped with a turbo ion spray source operated in positive mode. The samples were
prepared as follows: 50 µL of plasma was transferred to an Eppendorf tube (1.5 mL), and 200 µL of
J. Clin. Med.2019, 8, 897 5 of 15
acetonitrile with the internal standards (Arg-13C6, ADMA-D6, ﬁnal concentration of 7.5 µg mL−1 and
155 ng mL−1, respectively) was then added. This mixture was mixed on a vortex for 5 min, kept at
−20 ◦C for 20 min and centrifuged at 9300 rcf in 4◦C for 10 min. The supernatant was transferred to the
appropriate high-performance liquid chromatography vials. This study used a SeQuant ZIC-HILIC
(zwitterionic hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography) column (50 mm × 2.1 mm, particle size
5 µm) supplied by Merck (Darmstadt, DE). The column was maintained at 40 ◦C and at a ﬂow rate of
0.5 mL min−1. The mobile phases consisted of water solution of 20 mM ammonium acetate as eluent A
and acetonitrile with 0.2% formic acid as eluent B. The gradient (%B) was as follows: 0 min 90%; 1 min
90%; 7 min 50%; 8 min 50%. The target compounds were analyzed in multiple reaction monitoring
mode. The transitions used for quantitation were m/z 203 > 46 and m/z 203 > 172 and m/z 209 > 77 for
ADMA, SDMA and ADMA-D6 and m/z 175 > 116 and m/z 181 > 121 for Arg and Arg-13C6, respectively.
The compound parameters, viz. declustering potential (DP), collision energy (CE), entrance potential
(EP) and collision cell exit potential (CXP) were: 61 V , 41 V , 10 V , 0 V for ADMA; 61 V , 19 V , 10 V , 10 V
for SDMA; 66 V , 45 V , 10 V , 4 V for ADMA-D6; 61 V , 21 V , 10 V , 8 V for Arg and 31 V , 21 V , 10 V , 10 V for
Arg-13C6. The curtain gas, ion source gas 1, ion source gas 2 and collision gas (all high purity nitrogen)
were set at 241 kPa, 207 kPa, 345 kPa and high instrument units, respectively. The ion spray voltage
and source temperature were set at 5500 V and 600 ◦C, respectively.
2.5. Statistical Analysis
Continuous variables are presented as the mean values (with the standard deviation) and as
median values (with the interquartile range) to allow better comparison with other publications.
Categorical variables are reported as frequencies and percentages. The normality of continuous variable
distribution was tested with the Shapiro-Wilk test. The parameters measured as continuous variables
were compared by ANOVA, Student t-test or Kruskall-Wallis tests or Mann-Whitney tests as necessary.
Categorical variables were compared using the Chi-square test. Linear regression analysis was used
to identify factors associated with serum ADMA concentrations. All variables with a signiﬁcant
univariate association with the outcome measure were included in the ﬁnal multivariate model.
A linear association between parameters was also investigated using either the Pearson correlation
coeﬃcient or Spearman’s Rank correlation coeﬃcient (Rho), according to the distribution. Multiple
logistic regression was used to assess predictors of OSA. The variables that were signiﬁcantly related
with OSA in univariate analyses were then included in the multivariate logistic regression model.
Qualitative variables were coded as 0–1 dummy variables. The results from the logistic regression
model are presented as odds ratios (OR) with a 95% conﬁdence interval (CI). The ability of ADMA
levels to discriminate between patients with and without OSA was assessed by receiver operating
characteristic curves and associated area under the curve (AUC). The optimal cutoﬀ point of ADMA
score to discriminate between patients with and without OSA was calculated by determining the value
that provided the greatest sum of sensitivity and speciﬁcity. All statistical analyses were performed
using Statistica software (Statistica version 12.0, StatSoft Inc., Tulsa, OK, USA) and ap value < 0.05 was
considered statistically signiﬁcant.
3. Results
Demographic and biochemical characteristics of the study participants are expressed in Table 1.
The study group consisted of 384 women and 134 men with a mean age of 43.8 ± 11.3 years and
an average BMI of 42.6 ± 6.7 kg/m2. The majority of participants (62.3%) had a BMI above 40 kg/m2,
28.6% had a BMI in the range of 35–39.9, and 9.1% of subjects were categorized as having class I obesity
(BMI: 30.0–34.9 kg/m2). Altogether, 242 obese subjects with OSA and 276 obese subjects without OSA
participated in the study (Table 2).
Levels of ADMA and SDMA were statistically signiﬁcantly associated with a number of the
biomarkers tested (Table 1), with moderate correlations found only between SDMA and creatinine,
and eGFR, with the remaining having weak correlations (i.e., BMI, apnea hypopnea index, folic acid,
J. Clin. Med.2019, 8, 897 6 of 15
B12, fat%, CRP , IL-6, age, HbA1c%, glucose and lipids). In addition, both ADMA and SDMA levels were
increased in patients with class II and III obesity in comparison to patients with class I obesity (p < 0.05,
Table 2). In the case of SDMA, however, post-hoc analysis using Tukey’s test did not reach signiﬁcance.
Patients with hypertension had a higher concentration of serum SDMA and lower concentration
of serum arginine when compared to the normotensive group (Table 2), while serum ADMA levels
did not diﬀer between patients with and without hypertension. However, an eﬀect of NOS3 G894T
polymorphisms on serum ADMA concentrations was found and the occurrence of the GT genotype
was associated with the lowest serum ADMA concentrations. No eﬀect of the 4a/4b NOS3 variants on
ADMA, SDMA and arginine levels was recognized (Table 3).
As ADMA and SDMA a ﬀect NO synthesis, a relation between serum ADMA and SDMA
concentrations and obstructive sleep apnea was also examined in 518 patients who underwent
overnight polysomnography (PSG). Based on PSG and according to the apnea-hypopnea index (AHI)
we divided patients into 2 groups: OSA (AHI ≥ 5) and non-OSA (AHI < 5). The patients with OSA had
signiﬁcantly higher concentrations of ADMA (0.51 ± 0.09 µmol/L vs. 0.54 ± 0.09 µmol/L) and SDMA
(1.29 ± 0.33 µmol/L vs. 1.37 ± 0.32 µmol/L) than patients without OSA (Table 3). The analyses, in which
concentrations of ADMA and SDMA in patients with mild and moderate (5 ≤ AHI ≤ 30) and severe
OSA (AHI > 30) as well as in patients without OSA (AHI < 5) were compared (Figure 1), suggest that
an association between OSA severity and ADMA and SDMA may occur. However, further studies are
needed to elucidate this relationship.

show the mean, SE (standard error) and 1.96*SE. 
Logistic regression analysis revealed that high (>50th percentile) serum ADMA and SDMA 
concentrations were associated with a higher chan ce of having OSA (with OR = 1.71; 95% CI: 1.21–
2.43 and OR = 1.58; 95% CI: 1.12 –2.24, respectively, as presented in Table 4). Individuals with 
obstructive sleep apnea have recurrent hypoxia at night, which is associated with the collapse of the 
upper respiratory tract. An important factor leading to the occurrence of obstructive sleep apnea is 
obesity, as it contributes to the expansion of the structures of the soft tissues in respiratory tract, 
thereby making a significant contribution to the narrowing of the pharyngeal respiratory tract. In our 
group, subjects with BMI above 40 had 2.09 times higher odds (OR = 2.09; 95% CI = 1.45
–3.02; Table 
4) of having OSA than those with BMI in the rang e of 30–39.9. In the OSA group, 40.5% were male, 
as opposed to 13% male participants in the non-OSA group (p < 0.001, Table 4), and the obese males 
compared to females had a 4.54-fold higher chance (OR = 4.54; 95% CI = 2.94 –7.00) of having OSA 
(Table 4). The prevalence of hypertension and higher-than-median age was also significantly higher 
in the OSA group than in the non-OSA group (p < 0.001; Table 4).  
The variables significantly associated with OSA in univariable analyses (Model 1), i.e., elevated 
ADMA and SDMA concentrations, BMI above 40, older age (i.e., higher-than-median age), 
hypertension, and male sex, were then combined in the multivariable logistic regression model. After 
adjustment for Model 1, and further for prevalence  of diabetes, dyslipidem ia, smoking status and 
eGFR > 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 (Model 2), the results for ADMA remained unchanged but the association 
for SDMA became insignificant.  
Receivers operating characteristic (ROC) curves were also used as a statistical model to evaluate 
ADMA as a marker of OSA. Upon ROC curve anal ysis, ADMA levels were found to significantly

Logistic regression analysis revealed that high ( >50th percentile) serum ADMA and SDMA
concentrations were associated with a higher chance of having OSA (with OR = 1.71; 95% CI: 1.21–2.43
and OR = 1.58; 95% CI: 1.12–2.24, respectively, as presented in Table 4). Individuals with obstructive
sleep apnea have recurrent hypoxia at night, which is associated with the collapse of the upper
respiratory tract. An important factor leading to the occurrence of obstructive sleep apnea is obesity,
as it contributes to the expansion of the structures of the soft tissues in respiratory tract, thereby making
a signiﬁcant contribution to the narrowing of the pharyngeal respiratory tract. In our group, subjects
with BMI above 40 had 2.09 times higher odds (OR = 2.09; 95% CI = 1.45–3.02; Table 4) of having OSA
than those with BMI in the range of 30–39.9. In the OSA group, 40.5% were male, as opposed to 13%
male participants in the non-OSA group (p < 0.001, Table 4), and the obese males compared to females
had a 4.54-fold higher chance (OR = 4.54; 95% CI = 2.94–7.00) of having OSA (Table 4). The prevalence
of hypertension and higher-than-median age was also signiﬁcantly higher in the OSA group than in
the non-OSA group (p < 0.001; Table 4).
The variables signiﬁcantly associated with OSA in univariable analyses (Model 1), i.e., elevated
ADMA and SDMA concentrations, BMI above 40, older age (i.e., higher-than-median age),
hypertension, and male sex, were then combined in the multivariable logistic regression model.
After adjustment for Model 1, and further for prevalence of diabetes, dyslipidemia, smoking status and
eGFR > 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 (Model 2), the results for ADMA remained unchanged but the association
for SDMA became insigniﬁcant.
Receivers operating characteristic (ROC) curves were also used as a statistical model to evaluate
ADMA as a marker of OSA. Upon ROC curve analysis, ADMA levels were found to signiﬁcantly
discriminate between patients with and without OSA, with an AUC of 0.601 (95%CI 0.55–0.65,
p = 0.0002). The cuto ﬀ to predict the presence of AHI ≥ 5 in obese individuals was an ADMA level
> 0.46 µmol/L, with a sensitivity of 84% and a speciﬁcity of 27%.

4. Discussion
Asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA), a strong inhibitor of nitric oxide synthase, and symmetric
dimethylarginine (SDMA) are toxic amino acids that inhibit nitric oxide (NO) production. The loss of
NO production and bioactivity can be associated with development of pathological conditions such
J. Clin. Med.2019, 8, 897 12 of 15
as hypertension or obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) [14,15]. Both of these conditions are characterized
by an increased expression of pro-inﬂammatory cytokines and the production of reactive oxygen
species (ROS), which are also commonly seen in obesity [16]. Studying the metabolic pathway of these
mechanisms may be of relevance to the fact that ADMA is also produced by adipocytes, which express
the whole gene set responsible for the biosynthesis and the degradation of ADMA [17]. Accordingly,
Sydow et al. [18], who investigated 980 healthy adults, found a positive correlation between ADMA
and BMI. This study showed that patients with BMI ≥ 40 had signiﬁcantly higher concentrations of
ADMA than patients with class I obesity. It can be hypothesized that increased ADMA levels and the
development of ADMA-related pathologies can, at least in part, be explained by fat mass expansion
and impaired synthesis of adipocyte-derived mediators [19].
In this study, serum ADMA and SDMA levels in obese individuals positively correlated with the
apnea hypoxia index, and the concentrations of these compounds were higher in patients with OSA
than in patients without OSA (AHI < 5). Moreover, the occurrence of high serum ADMA and SDMA
levels (>50th percentile) was associated with a higher chance of having OSA. However, in the presence
of strong OSA risk factors such as male sex, body mass index, and age, the impact of SDMA was found
to be unsubstantial. Nevertheless, our study, for the ﬁrst time, demonstrated that ADMA levels can
discriminate between patients with and without OSA, and ADMA appeared as an independent risk
factor for OSA in patients with obesity. Previously ADMA was reported as an independent predictor
of angiographic coronary atherosclerosis [20–22] and diabetes [23].
Obesity is commonly accepted as major factor leading to obstructive sleep apnea. In our study,
only subjects with BMI ≥ 30 were included. However, the authors were still able to conﬁrm that
patients with BMI above 40 had higher odds of having OSA than those with BMI in the range of 30–39.9.
The association between ADMA and OSA was signiﬁcant after adjustment for potential confounders,
such as diabetes, dyslipidemia, smoking status and eGFR > 60 mL/min/1.73 m2, the last because the
concentrations of ADMA are increased in patients with renal failure [24,25]. Thus, the authors used
eGFR to exclude the potential eﬀect of renal failure on the positive association between ADMA and
OSA. Moreover, the prevalence of hypertension, male sex and higher-than-median age was signiﬁcantly
higher in the OSA group than in the non-OSA group. These results are in accordance with previous
data showing that age, male sex and body mass index were strongly associated with OSA [26,27].
Clinical and experimental evidence indicates that ADMA and SDMA are involved in the endothelial
dysfunction and inﬂammation [6,7]. The development of inﬂammation in OSA was found to be initiated
by hypoxia through the activation of the nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-κB) [28]. This transcription factor
is responsible for the expression of IL-6. In our study, serum IL-6 concentrations were signiﬁcantly
correlated with serum ADMA and SDMA concentrations. Moreover, our present study showed
an association between ADMA and CRP in patients with obesity, conﬁrming previously published
data in varying sets of patients [ 23,29]. Inﬂammation is commonly associated with increased ROS
generation [30]. Under oxidative stress, nitric oxide synthase (NOS) uncoupling occurs and results
in increased production of the superoxide anion, which can further react with NO and generate
peroxynitrite, a very active free radical. It results in further modulation of the oxidation process [2].
Therefore, elevated concentrations of inﬂammatory cytokines and ADMA can be linked to oxidative
stress and obstructive sleep apnea [31]. The exact mechanism for increased ADMA is not elucidated in
detail. In principle, the overall ADMA elevation can be a result of increased ADMA production in
response to stresses or increased degradation and turnover of proteins containing methylated arginine,
decreased ADMA degradation by DDAH, and reduced ADMA excretion by the kidneys [2].
In our study, inverse relationships were noted between levels of folic acid, ADMA and SDMA,
and between vitamin B 12 and SDMA. Vitamin B 12 and folic acid are crucial for the production
of methyl groups involved in the metabolic pathways of ADMA and SDMA. Folate and vitamin
B12 deﬁciency results in accumulation of homocysteine. In some studies, an association between
hyperhomocysteinemia and high ADMA or SDMA was identiﬁed [32–34], but the relationship between
J. Clin. Med.2019, 8, 897 13 of 15
increased ADMA concentration and elevated concentration of homocysteine during experimental
hyper- and hypohomocysteinemia remains unclear [35,36].
Our study also showed that patients with hypertension had higher concentrations of serum
SDMA and lower concentrations of serum arginine in comparison with the normotensive group,
while serum ADMA levels were not signiﬁcantly di ﬀerent. Previously high ADMA levels were
reported in individuals with hypertension [ 37,38]. However, the authors have to emphasize that
our group was not a purely hypertensive group as in, for example, the study of Sonmez et al. [ 38],
where young male, non-obese, and newly diagnosed hypertensive individuals were enrolled to prevent
any interference of obesity, insulin resistance, hyperglycemia or medication. This study stratiﬁed
the patient population according to the presence of the endothelial nitric oxide synthase gene G894T
and the 4a /4b polymorphisms to assess the potential e ﬀects of these polymorphisms on ADMA,
SDMA and arginine concentrations. The present study’s results indicated that, among obese patients,
an association between the NOS3 894 GT genotype and low serum ADMA concentration may occur.
With regard to these results, it remains a central piece of the puzzle how the observed eﬀect of eNOS
polymorphism on ADMA can be reconciled with changes in ADMA concentrations so modest that they
are unlikely to alter NO synthesis signiﬁcantly. Further studies are needed to conﬁrm the inﬂuence of
nitric oxide synthase polymorphism on ADMA-related pathologies.
This study had some limitations. This study has not considered other possible genetic and metabolic
factors aﬀecting NO synthesis and bioavailability. Homocysteine concentrations were not measured
which could give additional insight into disturbances in ADMA and methyl group metabolism.
In conclusion, serum ADMA concentrations were found to be signiﬁcantly elevated in patients
with OSA and obesity and it was not aﬀected by hypertension, diabetes, smoking status, and renal
failure. However, further studies are needed to conﬁrm ADMA as a biomarker for OSA risk in patients
with obesity.
