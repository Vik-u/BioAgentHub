Abstract
Organisms from all kingdoms of life synthesize L-serine (L-Ser) from
3-phosphoglycerate through the phosphorylated pathway, a three-step diver-
sion of glycolysis. Phosphoserine aminotransferase (PSAT) catalyzes the inter-
mediate step, the pyridoxal 5 0-phosphate-dependent transamination of
3-phosphohydroxypyruvate and L-glutamate to O-phosphoserine (OPS) and
α-ketoglutarate. PSAT is particularly relevant in the central nervous system of
mammals because L-Ser is the metabolic precursor of D-serine, cysteine, phos-
pholipids, and nucleotides. Several mutations in the humanpsat gene have
been linked to serine deficiency disorders, characterized by severe neurological
symptoms. Furthermore, PSAT is overexpressed in many tumors and this over-
expression has been associated with poor clinical outcomes. Here, we report
the detailed functional and structural characterization of the recombinant
human PSAT. The reaction catalyzed by PSAT is reversible, with an equilib-
rium constant of about 10, and the enzyme is very efficient, with ak
cat/Km of
5.9 /C2 106 M/C0 1 s/C0 1, thus contributing in driving the pathway towards the
products despite the extremely unfavorable first step catalyzed by
3-phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase. The 3D X-ray crystal structure of PSAT
was solved in the substrate-free as well as in the OPS-bound forms. Both struc-
tures contain eight protein molecules in the asymmetric unit, arranged in four
dimers, with a bound cofactor in each subunit. In the substrate-free form, the
active site of PSAT contains a sulfate ion that, in the substrate-bound form, is
replaced by the phosphate group of OPS. Interestingly, fast crystal soaking
used to produce the substrate-bound form allowed the trapping of different
intermediates along the catalytic cycle.

1 | INTRODUCTION
L-serine (L-Ser) is produced through different biosyn-
thetic routes, including the widespread three-step phos-
phorylated pathway (PP), which uses the glycolytic
intermediate 3-phosphoglycerate (3-PG) as the precursor.
In the mammalian central nervous system (CNS), the PP
is crucial for maintaining the levels of L-Ser, as this non-
essential amino acid is transported inefficiently through
the blood–brain barrier. The first step of the PP is cata-
lyzed by 3-PG dehydrogenase (PHGDH; Murtas
et al.,
2021; Unterlass et al.,2017) which oxidizes 3-PG to
3-phosphohydroxypyruvate (3-PHP) using NAD+ as the
electron acceptor. The equilibrium of this reaction is
strongly shifted in favor of 3-PG (Grant, 2012; Murtas
et al., 2020); therefore, the subsequent reactions of the
pathway must provide a thermodynamic drive to synthe-
size L-Ser. Indeed, the second reaction, catalyzed by
phosphoserine aminotransferase (PSAT), shows an equi-
librium shifted towards the products L-O-phosphoserine
(OPS) and α-ketoglutarate (α-KG; Merrill et al.,
1981).
The final step of the PP is the hydrolysis of the phosphate
group of OPS by phosphoserine phosphatase (Marchesani
et al.,2021) with formation of L-Ser. In the human CNS,
the PP takes place in the astrocytes and the L-Ser thus
produced is used locally or transported to neurons, where
it can be converted to its enantiomer D-Ser by serine
racemase. (Marchesani, Gianquinto, et al.,
2021; Raboni
et al.,2018)
Human PSAT (EC 2.6.1.52) is a pyridoxal 5 0-
phosphate (PLP)-dependent enzyme whose coding gene
is located on the long arm of chromosome 9. The primary
gene transcript, and probably the only physiologically rel-
evant one (Baek et al.,
2003), codes for PSAT1 (or PSAT-
β). Mutations in the psat gene have been identified in
neurological diseases characterized by low L-Ser and gly-
cine (Gly) levels in the cerebrospinal fluid and in the
plasma. Most of the mutations are incompatible with life,
and even the milder ones still cause very severe symp-
toms (Abdelfattah et al.,
2020; Acuna-Hidalgo
et al.,2014; Brassier et al.,2016; Debs et al.,2021; Glinton
et al., 2018; Hart et al., 2007; Ni et al., 2019; Shapira
Zaltsberg et al.,2020; Sirr et al.,2020). On the other hand,
the increased PSAT activity in certain cancer types has
been linked to tumor progression, poor prognosis, and
poor response to therapy (de Marchi et al.,
2017; Liu
et al.,2016; Martens et al.,2005; Ravez et al.,2017; Rossi
et al., 2022; Tajan et al.,2021). Despite this, no selective
PSAT inhibitor has been identified to date.
The catalytic mechanism and the functional parame-
ters were defined for several PSATs from eukaryotes and
bacteria (Ali & Nozaki,
2006; Basurko et al., 1989;
Basurko et al., 1999; Fell & Snell, 1988; Haque
et al., 2019; Hirsch & Greenberg, 1967; Koivulehto
et al.,2020; Singh et al.,2019; Snell & Fell,1990), but this
information is lacking for the human enzyme (Baek
et al., 2003; Donini et al.,2009). In analogy to aspartate
transaminase and other PLP-dependent aminotransfer-
ases, PSAT follows a ping –pong mechanism, with L-
glutamate (L-Glu) binding first (Basurko et al.,
1989).
This half-reaction leads to the formation of pyridoxamine
phosphate (PMP), which subsequently reacts with the
second substrate, 3-PHP, to form OPS and regenerate the
PLP internal aldimine (Scheme
1).
The only complete characterization of a mammalian
PSAT available to date was published by Basurko and
collaborators on the enzyme purified from bovine liver
(Basurko et al.,1989; Basurko et al.,1999). Furthermore,
very little is known about the enzyme regulation by phys-
iologically relevant metabolites, with many studies focus-
ing on the reactivity towards amino acid substrates. In
this respect, human PSAT is quite specific for 3-PHP and
L-Glu as substrates, with moderate activity on L-aspar-
tate, L-alanine, and L-Ser (Caligiore et al.,
2022; Donini
et al.,2009).
While the Protein Data Bank (PDB) contains several
crystal structures of PSAT enzymes from unicellular
organisms (including Escherichia coli , Mycobacterium
tuberculosis, Bacillus alcalophilus, andEntamoeba histoly-
tica; Battula et al.,
2013; Coulibaly et al., 2012;
Dubnovitsky et al., 2003; Dubnovitsky, Kapetaniou, &
Papageorgiou, 2005; Dubnovitsky et al., 2005; Hester
et al., 1999; Kapetaniou et al.,2006; Singh et al.,2019)
and plants (such as Arabidopsis thaliana ; Sekula
et al., 2018), the only available mammalian structure is
the human ortholog (PDB ID: 3E77), deposited by the
Structural Genomic Consortium with no associated pub-
lication. All the orthologs are consistently dimeric, with
the cofactor bound at the monomer–monomer interface
forming polar contacts with residues from both chains.
The active site entrance is positively charged to favor the
entry of the negatively charged substrates (Coulibaly
et al.,
2012; Sekula et al., 2018). The enzyme binds its
phosphorylated substrates/products (3-PHP and OPS)
with significantly higher affinity as compared with the
bi-carboxylic ones (L-Glu and α-KG). Indeed, in the
B. alcalophilus enzymes a set of conserved residues (that
correspond to Arg45, Arg336, His44, and His335 in the
human sequence) provides a strong anchoring to the
active site for the phosphate group of the substrate
(Battula et al.,
2013). In the deposited human PSAT struc-
ture solved at 2.5 Å in the substrate-free, PLP-form, the
side chains of Arg45 and Arg336 could not be modeled,
thus hampering a full elucidation of the substrate-
binding mode and interactions. Furthermore, this struc-
ture contains a cloning-derived N-terminal sequence that

influences its conformation. As a result, the available
model of human PSAT is not suitable for the in silico
identification of enzyme inhibitors. In this work, we
report a detailed functional and spectroscopic characteri-
zation of recombinant human PSAT and two new crystal
structures of the wild-type enzyme in the substrate-free
form and in complex with OPS.
2 | RESULTS
2.1 | Substrate binding, thermal stability,
and spectroscopic features of human PSAT
Human PSAT shows the typical absorption spectrum of
transaminases, with two peaks in the visible region cen-
tered at/C24 339 and 408 nm (Figure1a).
The peak at 408 nm is observed in most PLP-
dependent enzymes and is attributed to the cofactor
bound as internal aldimine to the catalytic lysine
(Lys200) in a protonated, ketoenamine form
(Scheme S1). At least three forms of the cofactor might
contribute to the absorption in the spectral region
between 330 and 345 nm: the enolimine tautomer of the
protonated internal aldimine of PLP (λ
max = 330 nm),
the deprotonated internal aldimine (λmax = 345 nm) and
the PMP form (λmax = 340 nm; Dubnovitsky et al.,2005;
Jenkins & Sizer, 1959, 1960). The peak at 339 nm was
more intense for the protein purified in Tris buffer, sug-
gesting the presence of the PMP-enzyme form under
these conditions. The near-UV circular dichroism spec-
trum of PLP-PSAT showed two positive dichroic peaks at
/C24 339 and 408 nm (Figure S1). The addition of 0.11 mM
3-PHP to the solution containing 40μM PSAT led to a
pronounced red-shift of the band at 339 nm to 344 nm
and to an increase in the intensity of the band at 408 nm,
indicating a conversion of PMP to the PLP form
(Figure
1a). On the other hand, the addition of 20 mM L-
Glu led to the disappearance of the band at 408 nm and
to a small increase in the intensity of the band at 339 nm,
indicative of the conversion of PLP to the PMP form
(Figure
1a).
The far-UV circular dichroism spectra of PLP-PSAT
and PMP-PSAT, prepared by treating with either 3-PHP
or L-Glu, were almost superimposable, indicating a negli-
gible effect of the cofactor form on the secondary struc-
ture content of the folded protein (Figure S1). Thermal
denaturation of the two protein forms was monitored by
circular dichroism spectroscopy at 222 nm (Figure
1b).
Both showed a three-state melting curve, with formation
of an intermediate that was more stable in the case of
PLP-PSAT. Indeed, the first phase for both PMP-bound
and PLP-bound PSAT was almost superimposable,
whereas the T
m of the second phase was about 4 /C14 C

higher for the PLP-form. This behavior suggests that the
covalently bound PLP may stabilize, more than PMP, a
partially unfolded dimeric intermediate, as shown for the
E. histolyticaenzyme (Mishra et al.,2011).
The absorption spectrum of PLP-PSAT at pH 7.0
showed contributions from both the protonated and
deprotonated forms of the PLP-internal aldimine
(Figure 1c and Scheme S1), an indication that the pKa for
this equilibrium is significantly lower than the average
pKa for an imine, which is around 10 –12 (Hayashi
et al., 1998, 2003). Lowering the pH from 9.5 to 5.8
caused a decrease of the peak centered at 344 nm and a
concomitant increase of the peak at 408 nm, with an iso-
sbestic point at 365 nm, indicating an equilibrium
between only two chemical species. The pK
a for this pro-
tonation equilibrium was 7.3 ± 0.1 (Figure 1d). At
pH 5.9, a shoulder centered at about 340 nm remained
visible, suggesting that a fraction of the cofactor might
still be in the PMP form. The presence of a fraction of
cofactor in the PMP form was also apparent in the crystal

structure, where about 25% of active sites contained PMP
(vide infra).
The human PSAT sequence possesses three trypto-
phan residues (Trp107, Trp140, and Trp257), all located
in the large, N-terminal domain. Trp107 is in the active
site, with its indole ring stacking against the pyridine
ring of the cofactor (vide infra), and plays an important
role in cofactor orientation and catalysis (Mishra
et al.,
2012). We collected fluorescence excitation and
emission spectra of PSAT (Figures1e and S2). The emis-
sion spectrum of Trp residues upon excitation at 298 nm
showed a peak centered at 346 nm, irrespective of pH,
that corresponds to the direct emission of Trp residues,
with no evidence of energy transfer to the cofactor
(Mishra et al.,
2010). At pH 5.8, PLP emitted fluores-
cence with a maximum at 392 nm only when excited at
330 nm, with no appreciable emission when excited at
408 nm. This observation suggests that the predominant
form of PLP in the excited state is the enolimine, rather
than the ketoenamine. At pH 9.5, PLP showed a maxi-
mum of excitation at 344 nm, consistent with the
absorption spectrum recorded at the same pH, which
was associated with a very modest emission at around
425 nm (Figures
1f and S2).
2.2 | Human PSAT efficiently catalyzes
the transamination of 3-PHP using L-Glu
as amino donor
PSAT catalyzes a reversible reaction using 3-PHP/Glu
and α-KG/OPS in the forward and reverse directions,
respectively (Scheme 1 and Figure S3). Our preliminary
results indicated that α-KG at concentrations above
4 mM inhibits the reaction. To account for this effect and
detect any substrate inhibition that might be physiologi-
cally relevant, we determined the intrinsic kinetic and
substrate inhibition constants by varying the concentra-
tion of both substrates simultaneously and by globally fit-
ting the dependences of the observed rate on substrate
concentration to the equation for a ping–pong mecha-
nism with substrate inhibition (Equation
3). The results
for both the forward and the reverse reactions are shown
in Figure2a,b and the kinetic parameters are reported in
Table 1. Substrate inhibition was observed for both sub-
strates in the forward and reverse directions. The very
low Km,3-PHP affected the accuracy of the determination,
as mirrored by the very high standard error (Table1). We
assessed theKm,3-PHP and kcat values through an indepen-
dent method, that is, by fitting the time course ofα-KG
accumulation to the integrated Michaelis–Menten equa-
tion (Goli ˇcnik, 2013; Schnell & Mendoza, 1997;
Figure S3c).
The parameters calculated by this method
(Km,3-PHP = 6.9 ± 0.5μM andkcat = 19 ± 0.7 s/C0 1) were in
good agreement with those obtained from global fitting.
The equilibrium constant of the reaction calculated at
37/C14 C, pH 7 using the Haldane equation for a ping–pong
mechanism (Equation 5) was 9.6 ± 5.4, in very good
agreement with the Keq calculated from the concentra-
tions of 3-PHP and α-KG at equilibrium, that is,
11.3 ± 0.3 (Table S1 and Figure S4). The consistency
between the values calculated by independent methods
supports the validity of the kinetic model. The depen-
dence of the forward reaction on pH is bell-shaped, sug-
gesting that the activity is apparently controlled by two
ionizable groups of the substrate –enzyme complex
(Figure
2c). However, the small amplitude of the activity
change as a function of pH does not allow to calculate
accurate p Ka values. Maximum activity occurred at
pH 6.9, where about 70% of internal aldimine is in the
protonated state (Figure
1d), similarly to what is observed
for many aminotransferases, except aspartate amino-
transferase (Hester et al.,1999).
2.3 | Alternative substrates and activity
modulators
The reactivity of PSAT with different substrates and the
identification of biologically relevant modulators of activity
have been poorly investigated. Donini et al. (
2009) exam-
ined the ability of PSAT to transaminate the 20 proteino-
genic amino acids using glyoxylate as the amino group
acceptor. In addition to L-Glu, PSAT transaminated L-
aspartate, L-alanine, and L-Ser. Cysteine reacted with
PSAT to form the PMP intermediate (Figure S5a) and did
not lead to cofactor release by formation of the thiazolidine
ring typical of many PLP-dependent enzymes (Lowther
et al.,
2012). Cysteine sulfinate (CSA), a N-methyl-D-
aspartate agonist and a compound involved in taurine bio-
synthesis, was also reported to react with the enzyme, and
indeed it has been used to prepare the apoenzyme form
(Deu & Kirsch,
2007; Mishra et al.,2011). We found that
CSA reacts with PSAT to form the PMP intermediate, but
the transamination reaction with 3-PHP is extremely ineffi-
cient, with akcat/Km of 58.1 M/C0 1 s/C0 1 (Figure S5b).
Considering that bovine PSAT binds Cibacron blue-
agarose (Basurko et al., 1999; Lund et al., 1987), a dye
commonly used to purify nucleotide-binding proteins
(Thresher & Swaisgood,
1983), we investigated the effect
of selected nucleotides on the activity of PSAT. We found
that neither NAD+/NADH, nor ATP/AMP exerted any
effect on the activity of PSAT (see Section S3.1 and
Figure S6a). On the other hand, we observed that salts in
general, and halides in particular, increased the activity

of PSAT, likely as result of the effect of the ionic strength
(see Section S3.1 and Figure S6b–d).
In the X-ray crystal structure of human PSAT (see
below), a sulfate ion from the crystallization solution was
bound at the active site near the cofactor, interacting
with some of the residues that are part of the phosphate
binding site in the OPS-bound structure (vide infra). We
thus tested the effect on the reverse reaction of sulfate
and phosphate, at the same concentration used in the
crystallization solution (i.e., 200 mM). In the absence of
any added salts, phosphate and sulfate both activated the
enzyme by about 2-fold and 1.5-fold, respectively. For
comparison, the effect brought about by 200 mM KCl is a
4-fold to 5-fold activation (Figure
2d). Considering KCl as
reference, sulfate and phosphate both inhibited the activ-
ity of the enzyme to a similar extent. This inhibition was
competitive with respect to the phosphorylated substrate
(i.e., OPS). As a matter of fact, the inhibitory effect of
phosphate was larger at lower substrate concentrations
(Figure
3a,b). The IC50 for phosphate, measured in the
presence of 200 mM KCl to saturate any nonspecific ionic
strength effects, was 73 ± 5 mM, (Figure3c). To assess
the effect of phosphate on the enzyme conformation, we
collected fluorescence emission spectra upon excitation
at 298 nm in the presence of either KCl or potassium
phosphate (Figure
3d). The addition of 200 mM potas-
sium phosphate caused an increase in the emission maxi-
mum and a 5-nm red shift of the spectrum (Figure3d).
Conversely, the addition of 200 mM KCl caused a less
pronounced increase in the emission intensity, with no
shift in the emission maximum.

unit (Figure 4). All monomers appeared well ordered,
showing no interruptions in the electron density of the
main chains from residue 6 to 370. Each monomer
exhibits the well-conserved α/β fold of fold-type I PLP-
enzymes with two distinct domains. The large domain
(residues 19–265) is composed of seven-strandedβ sheets
flanked by sixα-helices, which mainly contribute to the
dimer interface. The small domain, formed by the C-
terminal region (266 –307) plus the first eighteen N-
terminal residues, folds into three antiparallelβ-strands
flanked by threeα-helices. The eight monomers are orga-
nized in four S-shaped dimers, each constituting the sta-
ble assembly in solution, as suggested by the PISA server
(Krissinel, 2015) and confirmed by size-exclusion chro-
matography (Figure S7). The four dimers, as well as the
eight monomers, were virtually identical, with root mean
square deviation (RMSD) ranging from 0.142 to 0.210 Å
(Tables S2 and S4).
In the substrate-free structure, solved at 2.5 Å, the
main differences between the eight chains were found in
the catalytic site and involved the state of the cofactor: in
chains A, C, D, E, F, and H, the electron density clearly
showed PLP covalently bound to Lys200, forming the
internal aldimine. Instead, in chains B and G, PMP was
present in place of PLP (Figures
4 and 5). These results
agree with the spectroscopic analysis indicating the co-
presence of PLP and PMP.
The crystal structure of PSAT in the OPS-bound
form was obtained by briefly soaking native crystals in
50 mM OPS. Longer soakings made the crystals diffract
poorly or completely dissolve. The best crystal diffracted
to 2.78 Å resolution, preserving the same cell parame-
ters and space group with eight chains per asymmetric
unit. As for the substrate-free form, all chains superim-
pose well, with minimal RMSD variations (Tables S3
and S5). Due to the very short soaking time, we could
capture subsequent steps of the OPS reaction (Figure
4),
observing differences between the catalytic sites of the
eight chains.
After modeling the predominant reaction intermedi-
ate in the initial electron density, in some chains small
blobs were left, suggesting the density might derive from
the sum resulting from the co-existence of different reac-
tion intermediates. We used polder OMIT maps
(Liebschner et al.,
2017) to confirm the differences
observed in the initial maps, and to improve the model
building and refinement. The polder maps obtained for
the final model are shown in Figure
6. Notably, in
chains A, B, and C the OPS moiety occupies the substrate
binding site with no covalent binding to the cofactor,
which is in the PMP form in chain A and in the PLP form
in chains B and C. Usually, substrate inhibition in trans-
aminases involves substrate binding to the incorrect cata-
lytic intermediate. The inhibition constant estimated for
OPS and the high concentration of OPS used in soaking
experiments (see Table
1) thus agree with the binding to
the PMP-PSAT structure. In chains D and F, the OPS-
PLP external aldimine is present, while in chain E the

geminal diamine formed by Lys200, PLP, and OPS could
be modeled.
This latter intermediate was also observed in the co-
crystallized OPS-PSAT complex of A. thaliana (Sekula
et al., 2018). In all these chains, the phosphate group of
OPS replaces the sulfate anion modeled in the substrate-
free structure. In the other two chains (G and H) not
enough density was present to model OPS. On the con-
trary, we could well fit the sulfate anion, which indeed
occupies the phosphate binding site of the substrate, near
the internal aldimine adduct in both chains.
Comparing the structures of the PSAT-PLP/PMP
dimer with that of PSAT bound to OPS, the main chains
overlap quite well: no open –close movements were
detected and both structures adopted a closed conforma-
tion (Figure
7a). While this might be expected for the
OPS-bound form, such an observation was surprising in
the case of the substrate-free form.
We performed a DALI (Holm & Rosenström,2010)
structural comparison against the PDB and the top
15 structures in the list are all PSAT (Table S6). Not sur-
prisingly, the closest structure is that of the 3E77 human
PSAT with an RMSD of 0.6 Å, indicating that the two
models do not superimpose perfectly (Figure
7b). The
present structure shows a closed conformation compared
with 3E77, with the small domain moving of about 2 Å
and with the 331–341 loop adopting a closed conforma-
tion, similar to the one observed in the OPS-bound struc-
ture of A. thaliana (Sekula et al.,
2018). The larger
difference occurs at the level of the N-terminal coil,
which in 3E77 is much shorter due to the substitution of
the first 16 amino acids with a sequence derived from
cloning (Figures
7c and S8). The present structure dem-
onstrates that also in the human enzyme, the N-terminal
coil, containing the highly conserved XGPY motif, forms
a type IV turn that narrows the entrance to the active site
and likely affects the activity of the protein, as shown for
the E. histolyticaenzyme (Singh et al.,
2019).
2.5 | Active site
The active sites are located at the monomer–monomer
interface with the two cofactors placed about 30 Å apart,
making several interactions with the backbone and side
chains of the surrounding amino acids from both chains
(Figure
5). The cofactor, either in the PLP-Lys200 or in
the PMP form, strongly interacts by pi stacking with the
indole ring of Trp107 at distances ranging from 3.76 to
4.07 Å for the PLP-Lys, and from 4.02 to 4.10 Å for the
PMP moiety (Figure
5). The O and N atoms of the pyri-
dine ring make hydrogen bonds with the side chains of
Thr156 and Asp176, respectively. The phosphate group of
the cofactor is kept in place by hydrogen bonds with the
side chains of Gln199, Asn241*, and Thr242* and the
main chains of Gly79, Cys80, and Thr242* (* refers to res-
idues of the nearby subunit). The active site, in agree-
ment with previous findings on PSATs from different
organisms, is positively charged to better accommodate
the negatively charged substrates. The surface electro-
static potential (Figure S9) is similar to that of other
PSAT structures (Coulibaly et al.,
2012), but with respect
to that of the previously deposited human enzyme
(3E77), the positively charged area is smaller, likely due
to the partial closure of the active site associated to the
presence of a full-length N-terminal sequence.
In the active sites of the substrate-free form, close to
each PLP/PMP moiety, a sulfate ion is clearly visible in
FIGURE 5 Close-up of the active site of the substrate-free phosphoserine aminotransferase. (a) Subunit A with pyridoxal 50-phosphate-

the electron density forming salt bridges with the side
chains of His44* and Arg45*, and with His335
(Figure 3e). Arg336, which is reported to be part of the
phosphate binding site (Battula et al.,2013), is not always
close enough to form strong hydrogen bonds. A sulfate
ion was also found in the corresponding site in the struc-
ture of PSAT fromM. tuberculosis(Coulibaly et al.,2012).
The presence of sulfate is probably due to its high con-
centration in the crystallization medium; nevertheless, it
mimics the binding of the phosphate moiety of the natu-
ral substrate.
In the OPS-soaked structure, in all the sites where
OPS is found, the sulfate atom is replaced by the phos-
phate group of OPS that forms salt-bridges with His44*,
Arg45*, His335, and with Arg336 (Figure
3). Notably, in
chains B and G, Arg336, which is located at the active site
entrance, has a less clear electron density map, probably
due to the acquisition of multiple orientations in the crys-
tal. Another anchoring point for the substrate is given by
Arg342, which makes salt bridges to the OPS carboxylate.
Also, in the gem-diamine case, the carboxylic group of
OPS faces towards NH1 and NH2 of the guanidinium
group of Arg342, making ionic bonds, while the binding
with OPS to the internal aldimine involves only one oxy-
gen, as the other one is facing towards the PLP moiety
(Figure
3f and Table S7). The OPS carboxylate is also
forming a hydrogen bond with the indolic nitrogen of
Trp107. The cofactors, either in the PLP-Lys or in the
PMP forms, make similar interactions as described for
the substrate-free structure. In chain E, both PLP and
OPS interact with the same residues as described above,
with the additional formation of the geminal diamine
between Lys200, PLP, and OPS. The same happens in
chains D and F, where the OPS-PLP external aldimine is
present (Figures
4, 6, and 8c). Comparing all active sites
of the four dimers among the two structures, where
different cofactor and ligand binding poses were detected,
we noticed little movements of the side and main chains
(Table S7).
3 | DISCUSSION
This study is the first detailed structural and functional
characterization of human PSAT. While the overall pic-
ture agrees with published results on PSAT from different
organisms, some specific features of the human ortholog
emerged.
Human PSAT, consistently with the enzyme from
other species, follows a ping–pong mechanism, with sub-
strate inhibition, also observed for the bovine enzyme
(Basurko et al.,
1999). However, the inhibition constants
are higher than thein vivoconcentrations for the various
substrates, thus a physiological and/or regulatory func-
tion of this inhibition is unlikely. TheK
m values calcu-
lated in this work agree with those measured for the
enzymes from bovine liver and Entamoeba (Ali &
Nozaki, 2006; Basurko et al.,1999; Table S8), while the
parameters estimated for PSAT from A. thaliana and
sheep differ from those of the human ortholog. Thekcat/
Km for PHP was among the highest ever reported for a
transaminase; for comparison, the aspartate aminotrans-
ferases from chicken (Azzariti et al., 1998) and from
water buffalo (Shahid Nadeem et al.,2011) showed kcat/
Km values in the order of 5/C2 105 M/C0 1 s/C0 1 towards the
substrate α-KG. The human tyrosine aminotransferase
showed kcat/Km values of 4.3 /C2 105 and
4.6 /C2 104 M/C0 1 s/C0 1 towards the substrates α-KG and
hydroxyphenyl pyruvate, respectively (Sivaraman &
Kirsch, 2006). The Km,3-PHP and Km,OPS are significantly
higher than the in vivo substrate concentration (Table1),
suggesting that PSAT works underkcat/Km regime in the
FIGURE 7 Comparison between

cell and is thus a sensor for the levels of 3-PHP, regulat-
ing its activity based on the availability of the glycolysis-
derived substrate. OPS formation by PSAT is 300-fold
more efficient than the reverse reaction and, considering
a K
eq of about 10, the equilibrium of the whole pathway
is shifted towards product formation, counteracting the
unfavorable equilibrium of the first reaction catalyzed by
PHGDH in the PP (Murtas et al.,
2020; Murtas
et al., 2021). Notably, human PSAT activity is strongly
stimulated by increasing the ionic strength, that is, by
200 mM KCl.
PSAT is catalytically active also in the crystal form.
Indeed, after quick soaking of the crystals in 50 mM OPS,
different reaction intermediates, including the catalytic
gem-diamine and external aldimine, could be identified.
The carboxylate group of the substrate makes a salt
bridge with Arg342, whereas the phosphate group is
anchored by ionic interactions to His44*, Arg45*, His335,
and Arg336 which constitute the phosphate binding site
(Figure
3 and Table S7). These interactions are retained
in thegem-diamine intermediate and in the external aldi-
mine. In chains B and G, Arg366 has a poor electron den-
sity, suggesting a higher flexibility of this residue, which
is located at the active site entrance. Interestingly, in the
3E77 structure, Arg366 is not visible in the electron den-
sity and the side chain has not been modeled. In our
substrate-free structure, where a sulfate ion occupies the
phosphate binding site of the substrate, the electron den-
sity for Arg336 varies between the different chains, some-
times clearly interacting with the ion. In general, we
suggest that this residue is flexible and might have an
important role in locking the substrate during the reac-
tion. PLP is close to Trp107, which likely plays the same
stabilizing role on the cofactor orientation and position
observed for the orthologous protein fromE. histolytica
and Trichomonas vaginalis (Mishra et al.,
2012; Singh
et al., 2016). The structure solved in this work contains
the same N-terminal loop that covers the active site in
most PSAT structures. This loop plays a pivotal role in
the activity of PSAT and was proposed to influence the
stability of the dimer (Singh et al.,
2019). Interestingly,
this loop contains a Pro residue (Pro14 in the human
sequence) in cis conformation, which favors the folding
of the N-terminus into a hairpin conformation that
inserts in the active site groove. This Pro belongs to a
well-conserved motif, the XGPY sequence (Singh
et al.,
2019), which was absent in the 3E77 structure
(Figure S8).
The substrate-free structure well superimposes with
the structure of OPS-bound PSAT, with an RMSD of
0.143 Å, and both show a closed conformation. On the
contrary, the superposition of our structures with the
deposited structure of human PSAT reveals main differ-
ences in the small domain that, together with the N-
terminal loop, contributes to form a close pocket. In the
case of substrate-free PSAT, a sulfate ion is visible in the
active site and its position is superimposable with that of
the phosphate moiety of OPS. We thus conclude that sul-
fate and phosphate itself can bring about most of the con-
formational changes needed for the open-to-closed
transition. We believe that the structures presented here
are good models of the human PSAT in a conformation

that is proficient for substrate binding, a useful tool to
clarify the structure –function relationships of this
enzyme under physiological as well as pathological con-
ditions related to genetic mutations.
4 | MATERIALS AND METHODS
4.1 | Expression and purification of
human PSAT
The gene coding for human PSAT-β (psat) was cloned in
the CpoI site of a modified pET28b plasmid in frame with
a sequence encoding a hexahistidine tag (Donini
et al., 2009). The expression was carried out at 20/C14 Ci n
E. coli BL21(DE3) tuner cells (Novagen®, Merck, Darm-
stadt, Germany) by addition of 0.2 mM isopropyl-β-D-
1-thiogalactopyranoside. The protein in a buffer contain-
ing 25 mM Tris pH 8.0, 300 mM NaCl, 0.2% (vol/vol)
Tween-20, 50μM PLP, 1 mM TCEP, 1 mg/mL lysozyme,
and protease inhibitors was purified by IMAC (Talon
superflow–Cytiva™) using an FPLC system (Akta Prime
-G E™). The protein was dialyzed against 25 mM Tris
pH 8, 300 mM NaCl, 1 mM TCEP and 4μM PLP, concen-
trated, flash frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at
/C0 80
/C14 C. The final yield of purification was 70 mg per liter
of culture broth. The protein for crystal preparation was
purified using the same protocol reported above using a
different buffer system (30 mM HEPES, 100 mM KCl,
4 μM PLP, and 1 mM DTT pH 7.5) and then dialyzed
against 50 mM sodium phosphate, 300 mM NaCl and
1 mM TCEP pH 8.0. The same preparation was used for
both spectroscopic characterization and crystallization
experiments. Prior to crystallization, PSAT was further
purified on a Superdex 75 16/60 column (Cytiva) equili-
brated with 20 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 300 mM NaCl, 1 mM
TCEP. The final protein sample was concentrated to 8–
10 mg/mL and immediately used for the crystallization
trials. Pure PLP-forms and PMP-forms of PSAT were pre-
pared by adding either 0.11 mM PHP or 20 mM L-Glu to
the protein solution in 25 mM Tris, 300 mM NaCl
pH 7.4. The reaction was followed spectrophotometri-
cally. Upon reaction completion, PSAT was immediately
subjected to extensive ultrafiltration against 20 mM
potassium phosphate pH 7 to remove traces of substrates
and products.
4.2 | Absorption spectroscopy
Absorption spectra were collected using a Cary4000 spec-
trophotometer (Agilent Technologies®). Protein concen-
tration was calculated using an extinction coefficient at
280 nm of 35,870 M/C0 1 cm/C0 1 (calculated by the ProtParam
server). Absorption spectra of PSAT at different pH
values were collected at room temperature in the multi-
component buffer P (50 mM MES, 50 mM HEPES,
50 mM bicine, and 100 mM NaCl). Different pH values
were obtained by mixing buffer P at acidic pH with differ-
ent volume ratios of the same buffer titrated to pH 9.5
with NaOH. Each spectrum was corrected for the base-
line contribution. The absorbance values at 408 nm and
344 nm were plotted as a function of pH and data were
fitted to Equation (
1) to calculate the pKa of the cofactor
aldimine (Montioli et al.,2013):
Abs ¼ y0 þ Abs
1 þ 10pKa/C0 pH ð1Þ
where Abs is the absorbance at either 344 nm or at
408 nm andy0 is an offset.
4.3 | Fluorescence spectroscopy
Fluorescence spectra of PSAT were collected in buffer P
at 20/C14 C using a Fluoromax spectrofluorometer (HORIBA-
Jobin Yvon®). Slits were set for optimal signal-to-noise
ratio. Emission spectra of the cofactor were collected
upon excitation at 330 nm and 344 nm at pH 5.8 and
pH 9.5, respectively (as determined by fluorescence exci-
tation spectra; Figure S2). Emission spectra of tryptophan
were collected upon excitation at 298 nm at both pH
values. The effects of potassium chloride and potassium
phosphate on the emission of tryptophan residues were
evaluated in a solution containing 4μM PSAT in 50 mM
HEPES pH 7 in the absence and presence of either 0.2 M
potassium chloride or 0.2 M potassium phosphate.
4.4 | Circular dichroism and thermal
stability
The far-UV and near-UV circular dichroism spectra of
PSAT were collected using a Jasco® 1500 spectropolari-
meter equipped with a Peltier system for the tempera-
ture control. The far-UV spectra were collected on 5μM
PSAT solutions in 20 mM potassium phosphate pH 7,
20/C14 C in a 0.1 cm optical pathlength cuvette. Each spec-
trum is the average of three acquisitions and was cor-
rected for the buffer contribution. The melting curves
(at 222 nm) were collected from 25

solutions in 20 mM potassium phosphate pH 7, 20/C14 Ci na

4.5 | Preparation of 3-PHP
3-Phosphohydroxypyruvic acid was obtained from the
dimethyl ketal (eNovation Chemicals®), as described by
Ballou and Hesse (1956). The amount of 3-PHP was esti-
mated enzymatically using human PHGDH and the
NADH extinction coefficient (6220 M/C0 1 cm/C0 1). The yield
of the reaction was/C24 85%.
4.6 | Activity assays
The activity assays for the determination of the kinetic
parameters of human PSAT were performed in buffer A
(50 mM HEPES pH 7, 100 mM KCl, 1 mM DTT,
0.170 mM PLP) using a Cary4000 spectrophotometer
(Agilent technologies
®). The assay mixture, without the
enzyme, was incubated in the cuvette holder for 2 min

using an extinction coefficient for NADH of

tion phase. The forward reaction was followed by cou-
pling the production of α-KG with the reaction of
glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH; type II from bovine
liver–MERCK
®; one unit per assay), in the presence of
8 1 n MP S A T ,0 . 1 m MN A D H ,3 2 m MN H4Cl (Basurko
et al., 1999), 3-PHP ranging from 0.011 to 0.11 mM and
L-Glu ranging from 0.4 to 80 mM. The rate depended
linearly on PSAT concentration in the 21–167 nM range
(Figure S3), which corresponds approximately to an ini-
tial velocity between 0.3 and 3μM/s. The reverse reac-
tion was followed by coupling the production of 3-PHP
with 8 mU of human recombinant PHGDH in the pres-
e n c e o f 3 3 7n M P S A T , 0 . 1m M N A D H ,α-KG ranging

The dependence of the initial rate on the concentra-

where v0 is the initial velocity; Vmax is the rate at sub-

Kinetic parameters were also determined by fitting
individual kinetic traces of substrate consumption to an

(L-Glu), andKM(L-OPS) are the Michaelis–Menten constants
for α-KG, 3-PHP, L-Glu, and L-OPS.
The determination of the initial velocity of PSAT at
different pH values was performed in buffer P.
The activity of PSAT with CSA was measured in
buffer A with the addition of 0.1 mM NADH, 0.11 mM
3-PHP, 4–8 units of lactate dehydrogenase from bovine
heart (MERCK®), CSA ranging from 10 to 265 mM and
330 nM PSAT (Furumo & Kirsch,1995).

The IC50 for phosphate was estimated by measuring
the activity of PSAT (reverse reaction to avoid any arti-
facts due to the presence of NH
4Cl in the assay mixture
for the forward assay) at different concentrations of
potassium phosphate, ranging from 0.01 to 290 mM. Ini-
tial velocity at different concentrations of potassium
phosphate was measured in the presence of substrates
concentrations equal to theK
m for both OPS andα-KG
(i.e., 0.03 mM and 0.5 mm, respectively). Data were fitted
to Equation (6).

4.7 | Estimation of the equilibrium
constants
The equilibrium constant for the conversion of L-
Glu/3PHP toα-KG and L-OPS was estimated in buffer A
at 37/C14 C using a protocol adapted from Merrill et al.
(1981) Briefly, 2 mM OPS and 2 mMα-KG were incu-
bated for 3 min at 37/C14 C and the reaction was started by
adding 3μM PSAT. The mixture was sampled over time
and the reaction was stopped with 1% trichloroacetic
acid. The concentrations ofα-KG and 3-PHP at each time
point were estimated enzymatically after neutralization
with potassium hydroxide. Quantification reactions were
performed in buffer A with the additional presence of
either 0.22 mM NADH, 32 mM NH
4Cl, and 0.25 U of
GDH for the determination ofα-KG or 0.22 mM NADH
and 1 mU of PHGDH for the determination of 3-PHP.
The reaction was allowed to proceed until completion
(about 45 min) and the concentrations of α-KG and
3-PHP were calculated from the ΔOD340 nm of NADH

reduction, structure determination,
refinement, and final model analysis
Needle-like crystals were initially obtained under multi-
ple conditions but diffracted poorly (8–11 Å). After opti-
mization, slightly thicker and bigger crystals were
obtained that were unreproducible, very brittle, and sen-
sitive to cryoprotectants. These were grown in 7 days
from hanging drops, mixing 1μL of PSAT with 1μLo f
0.2 M Na
2SO4, 0.1 M Bis Tris Propane, pH 6.5, or 7.5, 20%
PEG 3350. Crystals were dipped in 30% MPD cryoprotec-
tant for a few seconds before freezing. The OPS complex
structure was obtained by soaking crystals for a few sec-
onds in 50 mM OPS in the cryoprotectant solution. Data
were collected at 100 K at the XDR2 beamline of the Elet-
tra synchrotron in Trieste (Lausi et al.,
2015) using a
0.9717 Å wavelength. The datasets were processed with
AutoPROC (Vonrhein et al., 2011) and STARANISO
2.3.77 (Tickle et al.,2018). The structure was solved by
molecular replacement with Phaser (McCoy et al.,2007)
using as search model 3E77 (PDB ID). The initial model
was refined through alternating cycles of manual model
building in COOT (Emsley et al.,
2010; Emsley &
Cowtan, 2004) and automatic refinement using Phenix
(version 1.18.2_3874). Data collection and refinement sta-
tistics are reported in Table S9.
4.9 | Accession codes
Coordinates and structure factors were deposited in the
PDB with accession numbers 8A5V (substrate-free PSAT)
and 8A5W (OPS-bound PSAT).
