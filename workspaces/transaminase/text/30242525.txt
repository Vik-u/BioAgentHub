Abstract 
Despite their key role in numerous natural compounds, β‑amino acids have rarely been studied as substrates for 
microbial degradation. Fermentation of the newly isolated Paraburkholderia strain BS115 and the type strain P . phytofir-
mans PsJN with β‑phenylalanine (β‑PA) as sole nitrogen source revealed (S)‑selective transamination of β‑PA to the 
corresponding β‑keto acid by both strains, accompanied by substantial formation of acetophenone (AP) from spon‑
taneous decarboxylation of the emerging β‑keto acid. While the PsJN culture became stationary after entire (S)‑β‑PA 
consumption, BS115 showed further growth at a considerably slower rate, consuming (R)‑β‑PA without generation of 
AP which points to a different degradation mechanism for this enantiomer. This is the first report on degradation of 
both enantiomers of any β‑amino acid by one single bacterial strain.

Introduction
The catabolism of proteinogenic l-alpha-amino acids 
(l-α-AA) is in-depth understood and part of undergradu-
ates’ biochemical education (Voet and Voet 2011). In con-
trast, bacteria have long been known to be a rich source 
of d-α-aa which are therefore abundant in soil and fer -
mented food (Brückner and Hausch 1989). The bacterial 
synthesis mechanisms of d-α-AA and their incorpora -
tion in non-ribosomal peptides are now well-understood 
(reviewed by Radkov and Moe 2014). However, in some 
cases the enzymes for these reactions are still unknown. 
Furthermore, not only l-α- and d-α-AA are present in 
nature and reactions towards amino acids with amino 
groups in other positions than α-position are possible, 
leading to β-, γ-, ε- and other constitutional isomers of 
amino acids. ε-amino acids have e.g. a special significance 
in the biosynthesis pathway of β-lactams in actinomy -
cetes and are converted by lysine ε-aminotransferases 
(Duan et al. 2016).
By contrast, only minor insight has been gained into 
the degradation of β-amino acids (β-AA). With the 
exception of β-alanine and β-aminoisobutyric acid 
which constitute key intermediates in several metabolic 
pathways, β-AA are not as abundant in nature as their 
α-configured counterparts. β-alanine can be metabo -
lized by mammalia (Nutzenadel and Scriver 1976) 
and is involved in pantothenate metabolism (Spitzer 
et  al. 1988), finally becoming a component of the key 
metabolite coenzyme A (CoA). β-alanine is also linked 
with histidine by carnosine synthase to the dipep -
tide carnosine which is abundant in skeletal muscles 
as well as in the central nervous system of most ver -
tebrates (Drozak et  al. 2010). Using the KEGG-path -
way tool for analyzing the degradation of β-alanine, 
it can be seen that a transaminase reaction is forming

malonate-semialdehyde which is further converted to 
malonate and finally enters the fatty acid biosynthesis 
as malonyl-CoA (Kanehisa et al. 2016).
However, β-AA have been recognized as essential parts 
in a variety of biologically active compounds. Beside the 
incorporation of β-AA in non-ribosomal peptides and 
their polyketide hybrids by several bacteria, it has also 
been shown that plants produce β-AA containing natu
-
ral compounds, with the terpenoid-β-AA hybrid Pacli -
taxel as the most prominent example (better known as 
the anticancer therapeutic Taxol) (Wani et  al. 1971). In 
the last two decades, β-AA also raised interest as building 
blocks for β-peptides, which are able to form protease-
resistant, stable and predictable secondary structures 
and thus promise applications as peptidomimetics (See
-
bach and Gardiner 2008; Steer et al. 2002). Furthermore, 
cyclized and substituted β-AA like β-lactams constitute 
the most common antibiotics and also show additional 
encouraging pharmacological properties; moreover, 
some free β-AA show pharmacological effects such as 
antifungal agent (Ziegelbauer et al. 1998; Magriotis 2001; 
Juaristi and Soloshonok 2005). In addition, aromatic 
β-amino acids might be useful for the creation of arti
-
ficial flavors like tobacco aroma (Tao et  al. 2017). The 
synthesis of β-AA and their incorporation into natural 
compounds has been extensively reviewed by Kudo et al. 
(2014). Microorganisms appear to be routinely affected 
with β-AA. Thus a deeper understanding of degradation 
mechanisms promises (A) an insight into defense mech
-
anisms of microorganisms affected with these natural 
compounds (B) environmental aspects referring to the 
persistence of β-AA in soil and water (C) pharmacokinet
-
ics of these natural compounds when used as a drug, e.g. 
cytostatics containing aromatic β-AA.
The production of chiral β-AA poses a major challenge 
in regard to synthetic efficiency and in regard to the used 
strategy. The solutions include enantioselective synthesis 
by complex organometallic catalysis, but also by a few 
enzymatic asymmetric synthesis methods, which must 
ultimately be more efficient than pure kinetic resolu
-
tion processes (Juaristi and Soloshonok 2005). Therefore 
mainly deracemization synthesis strategies were pre
-
sented on industrial scale as shown by Evonik-Degussa 
(Grayson et al. 2011). In this strategy, a racemic ester is 
first produced which is then cleaved in a further reaction 
by an enantioselective lipase to obtain only one enanti
-
omer as amino acid. The disadvantage is that without 
racemization (and subsequent dynamic kinetic resolu
-
tion) the remaining ester enantiomer is usually produced 
as waste. However, the advantage is that the starting 
racemate can often be produced in large quantities with 
little effort, so that chiral resolution turns out to be eco
-
nomically feasible anyway.
Therefore, chiral β-AA products can be also obtained 
from enantioselective microbial degradation processes. 
In case of a deamination to β-keto acids, the reaction 
equilibrium is shifted by spontaneous decarboxylation of 
the products which will be a major subject of this study. 
For β-phenylalanine (β-PA) as an example for the chiral 
β-AA synthesis, a chemical synthesis from benzaldehyde 
with malonic acid and ammonium acetate to rac -β-PA 
would be a starting point for deracemization, as already 
shown by Grayson et  al. (2011). Afterwards, the prod
-
uct could be deracemized by kinetic resolution using an 
enantioselective transaminase. A fermentation processes 
might be an alternative to the use of isolated enzymes 
(Yun et  al. 2004; Crismaru et  al. 2013; You et  al. 2013). 
In a previous study we performed enrichment cultures 
from soil samples using aromatic β-PA as sole nitrogen 
source (Brucher et al. 2010b). Transamination was found 
to be the predominant initial degradation step in all iso
-
lated bacteria: biotransformation with cell-free extracts 
and fractions thereof was only observed when a suit
-
able amino acceptor was additionally applied (preferably 
α-ketoglutarate or pyruvate) as well as the well-known 
transaminase cofactor pyridoxal phosphate (PLP). The 
fermentative degradation of rac-β-PA by living cells has 
only once been documented by Mano et al. in (2006). The 
(S)-selective ω-TA involved in this degradation has been 
characterized in detail by Hibi et  al. (2012). However, 
the further metabolization of the desaminated (S)-β-PA 
(and thereby created β-keto acid, β-KA) in the degrad
-
ing microorganism remains as uncertain as the fate of 
the (R)-β-AA. Here we report the degradation of race
-
mic β-PA by the newly isolated Paraburkholderia strain 
BS115 and the Paraburkholderia type strain P. phytofir
-
mans PsJN. We document the degradation of both enan -
tiomers by the first strain and only one enantiomer by the 
latter, following product generation and gaining a first 
insight into the responsible enzymatic mechanisms.
Materials and methods
Chemicals
All amino acids and chemicals were purchased from 
Sigma Aldrich (St. Louis, US) and Carl Roth (Karlsruhe, 
Germany) in analytical grade. All enantiopure amino 
acids were purchased from PepTech Corporation (Bed
-
ford, US).
Bacterial strains
Paraburkholderia BS115 was isolated by enrichment 
culture from garden soil spiked with soy peptone due to 
its high content of aromatic amino acids (Brucher et al. 
2010b). The strain was identified by the culture collec
-
tion DSMZ (Deutsche Stammsammlung für Mikroor -
ganismen und Zellkulturen GmbH) as P. phytofirmans. 
Page 3 of 13
Buß et al. AMB Expr  (2018) 8:149 
Cultures of the strain were deposited at the DSMZ desig -
nated as DSM 103130 P. phytofirmans (BS115). P. phyto-
firmans PsJN was also delivered by DSMZ (DSM 17436).
Fermentation process
The sterile minimal medium M1 (pH 7) contained 
100  mM d-glucose and 10 mM of rac -β-PA, 5.8  mM 
 KH2PO4, 4.1  mM  NaHPO4·2  H2O, 1  mM  MgSO4·7 
 H2O, 0.5  mM  CaCl2·2  H2O and 0.01  mM  FeCl2·4  H2O. 
Additionally the vitamins pyridoxal-5-phosphate (PLP) 
and cobalamin were added to the mixture in concen
-
trations of 1  µM and 1  nM, respectively. The vitamins, 
β-phenylalanine and  FeCl
2 were sterile filtrated separately 
while all other compounds were autoclaved. The sterile 
compounds were then mixed. The fermentation process 
was optimized for maximal growth rate in a small scale 
bioreactor system without pH regulation.
The fermentation of PsJN and BS115 was performed 
in a benchtop reactor (vessel volume 2.5  L; Minifors, 
Infors-HT, Switzerland) with a working volume of 1 L in 
minimal medium M1. The system was equipped with a 
pH probe (Mettler-Toledo, USA) and a Pt-100 tempera
-
ture probe. The temperature was set to 30 °C and the stir-
rer speed was adjusted to 120 rpm at the beginning. For 
mixing and disruption of gas bubbles a standard Rushton 
stirrer (diameter 46  mm) was used. The pH-value and 
 pO
2 content were not controlled, but monitored during 
the fermentation. The aeration rate was set to 1  L/min. 
The experiment was conducted in a triplicate. The pre
-
cultures were grown in a 100 mL shake flask in the mini -
mal medium at the same temperature and inoculated 
from a glycerol stock. The precultures were cultivated in 
a rotary shaker (Infors-HT, Switzerland) at 120 rpm. The 
bioreactors were inoculated with the precultures to an 
optical density at  OD
600nm of at least 0.1.
Dry cell mass measurement
10  mL of the cultures were centrifuged at 6000g for at 
least 10 min at 4 °C. The pellets were washed with 
HPH2O 
(high-purity water, type I ISO 3696). After this, the cell 
pellets were dried overnight at 60 °C in a drying oven.
Glucose assay
The concentration of d-glucose was measured by an 
enzymatic glucose-assay from R-Biopharm AG (Darm
-
stadt, Germany). According to the manufacturer’s assay 
protocol volumes were down-scaled to 96-well micro
-
titer plates (scale 1:20). 5  µL of the sample was mixed 
with 100  µL 
HPH2O and 50  µL of solution 1. 10  µL of 
1–10 diluted suspension 2 was pipetted to the mixture. 
The absorption at 340 nm of the incomplete mixture was 
measured in an epoch plate reader system before and 
after suspension 2 was added to the mixture. Also after 5 
and 10 min the absorption was measured. The measure
-
ment was calibrated by a d-glucose dilution series from 
0.01 to 1 g/L.
Enzyme activity assay
Both strains were cultivated for at least 3 days at 120 rpm 
and 30 °C in 100 mL minimal medium in shake flasks, the 
final  OD
600 was 3.4 for BS115 and 3.1 for PsJN. The cells 
were harvested by centrifugation at 8000  rpm in Beck -
man Coulter (Brea, USA) centrifuge (JA-10 rotor) and 
lysed by incubation with 1  mg/mL lysozyme (Fluka) for 
15  min at room temperature. Pellets were resuspended 
in 5  mL 40  mM ice cold sodium phosphate buffer (pH 
7.2) and sonicated for 5 min with 30 s pulsations at 50% 
amplitude. The cell lysate was clarified by centrifugation 
at 50,000g for 30  min at 4  °C (Beckman Coulter). The 
cell free supernatants were used for testing the enzyme 
activity of both strains: 100  µL of lysate were added to 
100  µL of reaction solution. The consumption rate was 
normalized by the protein concentration (standard Brad
-
ford test) of both lysates (Bradford 1976). The activity 
test solution contained 15 mM of rac -β-PA and 15 mM 
α-ketoglutaric acid (amino acceptor). Additionally, 
0.1  mM of the cofactor PLP was added to the solution. 
The solution was buffered by 40 mM sodium phosphate 
and adjusted at 7.2 with HCl. The reaction temperature 
was set to 30 °C and samples were taken at various points. 
The enzymatic activity was defined as 1  U = 1  µmol of 
converted β-PA per min. The samples were diluted with 
preheated sodium phosphate buffer (40 mM, 1  mM 
l-leucin, pH 7.2) and incubated at 99 °C for 5 min to stop 
the reaction. l-leucin was used as internal standard for 
HPLC analysis.
Quantification of β‑PA by HPLC
The samples of the fermentation process were centri -
fuged for at least 5 min at 13,000 rpm in a bench top cen-
trifuge (Eppendorf, Germany) and used for quantification 
of β-PA and AP . The supernatant was used for reversed 
phase HPLC analysis (Agilent 1200 Serie) by automated 
precolumn derivatization with ortho-phtaldialdehyde and 
N-isobutyryl-l-cysteine to obtain diasteromers of β-PA 
for chiral separation (Brucher et al. 2010a). Therefore, a 
C18 column (150 × 4.6 mm HyperClone 5 µm. Phenome
-
nex Inc., Aschaffenburg, Germany) was used. The mobile 
phase was a mixture of 55% methanol and 45% of 40 mM 
sodium phosphate buffer (pH 6.5). The flow rate was set 
to 1 mL/min and the column temperature to 40 °C. The 
diastereomers were monitored by UV-light absorption 
at 337  nm. The injection volume of the samples for the 
derivatization mixture was set to 0.5 µL. The total injec
-
tion volume of the derivatization mixture was 10  µL. 
Calibration was performed using rac -β-PA (0–15  mM). 
Page 4 of 13Buß et al. AMB Expr  (2018) 8:149 
To determine (R)- and (S)-enantiomers we used optically 
pure β-PA standards from Peptech (Burlington, USA).
Quantification of acetophenone (AP) by HPLC
No precolumn derivatization was performed to deter -
mine acetophenone in samples. Samples were centri -
fuged for at least 5  min at 13,000  rpm in a bench top 
centrifuge. The injection volume of AP was 5  µL. AP 
was monitored at 245 nm using a C18 column (Kinetex 
5 µm EVO C18 150 × 4.6 mm). The mobile phase was not 
changed compared to β-PA analysis.
Quantification of d‑glucose by HPLC
For quantification of d-glucose in PsJN samples, HPLC 
was used. This was necessary, because samples showed 
an interaction with the enzymatic assay. Glucose con
-
centration was measured using an HPLC-system with 
RI-detector system (Agilent 1100 series). The protocol 
was adapted from Buchholz et  al. (2014). Briefly, sam
-
ples [S] were precipitated by 4  M  NH3 in combination 
with 1.2 M  MgSO4 in volumetric ratio of 0.87 [S]: 0.039 
 (NH3): 0.087  (MgSO4), incubated for a few minutes at 
RT and centrifuged at 17,000g in benchtop centrifuge. 
The supernatant was mixed 1:1 (v/v) with 0.1  M  H
2SO4 
and was again incubated at RT for at least 20  min and 
centrifuged at 17,000g for 15  min. 10  µL of the super
-
natant were injected on a Rezex ROA-organic acid  H+ 
column (300 × 7.8 mm, Phenomenex). The mobile phase 
consisted of 5  mM  H2SO4 solution with a flow rate of 
0.4  mL/min. The temperature was set to 50  °C for the 
column and 32 °C for RI-detector. For calculation of the 
d-glucose concentration, a calibration curve was meas
-
ured from 0.01 to 0.5 g/L.
Data analysis
The maximal growth rate µ and substrate-consumption 
were fitted using a sigmoidal equation with three varia
-
ble parameters to the optical density/dry-cell mass of the 
cell cultures and to the concentration of β-PA during the 
fermentation with data analysis software Sigma Plot (San 
Jose, USA) adapted to Dörsam et al. (2017). The param
-
eters a and b were defined as variables for the sigmoi -
dal equation fit using Sigma Plot.  x0 can be interpreted 
as half maximum of biomass production or as the half 
amount of the consumed β-PA and is the inflection point 
of the function. The variables are x and f(x). The cultiva
-
tion time was defined as x in hours. The corresponding 
f(x) was defined as optical density, dry cell mass or the 
concentration of β-PA (mM).
f(x) = a
1 + e−x−xo
b
After fitting of the function against the measured val -
ues, the maximal rates were determined by calculat -
ing the slope using numeric differentiation with Excel 
(Microsoft, USA).
Results
Both strains BS115 and PsJN were able to grow in mini -
mal medium containing β-PA as sole nitrogen source 
in 1  L scale experiments. The fermentation process was 
started by inoculation of β-PA induced precultures.
Fermentation of Paraburkholderia
The main fermentation process of BS115 is illustrated 
in Fig.  1a. The lag phase of the culture was observed 
between 0 and 12 h. After this incubation period the cul
-
ture was growing with maximal growth rate (12–21  h) 
until (S)-β-PA was almost completely consumed. After 
the preferred enantiomer was depleted, growth contin
-
ued at a considerably slower rate. The stationary phase 
was reached 48 h after inoculation. The total consumed 
amount of (R)-β-PA was 2.5 mmol after 50 h of fermen
-
tation. In contrast the AP concentration increased with 
progressing fermentation and peaked at 4.5 mmol, when 
(S)-β-PA was almost fully consumed thereby nearly 
matching the consumed concentration of (S)-PA. There
-
after the AP concentration substantially decreased until 
the stationary growth phase was reached (Additional 
file 1: Figure S1).
Growth resulted in a maximal optical density of 7.0, 
resembling a dry cell mass (DCM) concentration of 
1.8 g/L at the end of the fermentation. The oxygen con
-
centration before inoculation was set to 100% and 
dropped during the process to a minimum of 80%. While 
centrifuging fermentation samples for analytical pur
-
poses, the formation of a slime layer was observed when 
(S)-β-PA was fully consumed, which reproducibly hap
-
pened at each fermentation. The extracellular capsule 
built by BS115 was visualized by negative contrasting 
with Chinese ink (Additional file 1: Figure S2).
After 24 h the pH-level dropped from pH 7.0 to pH 6.0, 
then remained constant for 20 h, but decreased in the last 
10 h to a final pH of 3.5 (Additional file  1: Figure S4). The 
remaining concentration of d-glucose inside the reactor 
was 27 ± 1.6  mM and total amount of consumed d-glu
-
cose was 73 mM. The ratio between consumed carbon to 
consumed nitrogen (C:N) was calculated as 14.6 mM per 
1 mM of (S)-β-PA.
We also investigated the fermentation process of PsJN 
to characterize β-PA degradation. Furthermore PsJN was 
used as control strain, to exclude that the degradation of 
(R)-β-PA is only an unspecific effect during the fermenta
-
tion process e.g. by adsorption of the amino acid to bac -
terial cell envelopes or due to other reasons.

The fermentation parameters were maintained 
according to the BS115 fermentation. The degrada -
tion of the (S )-enantiomer was almost complete after 
38  h, which is in total 5  mM of β-PA (Fig.  1). During 
the whole fermentation no degradation of (R )-β-PA 
was observed. The AP concentration increased during 
the process to a maximum of 1.6 mM after 35 h (Addi -
tional file  1: Figure  S1). After 50  h a slow decrease of 
the AP concentration in the medium to 0.8  mM was 
determined. In addition, we also observed only a slight 
capsulation of the microorganism with increasing fer
-
mentation time, which was not observed in shake flask 
experiments. The total amount of consumed (S )-β-PA 
was three times higher than the maximal concentration 
of AP in the medium. The  OD
600nm reached a maximum 
of 3.3 which is half the  OD600 reached in the BS115 fer -
mentation. The oxygen concentration decreased to a 
minimum of 70%. In contrast to BS115, the pH-value 
dropped from neutral (pH 7) to pH 5, instead of pH 3.5. 
The d-glucose concentration could not be determined 
by glucose assay, caused by an inhibition or unknown 
interaction of the enzymatic assay with the supernatant 
of the fermentation medium. Therefore, we determined 
the concentration of d-glucose by HPLC. The remain
-
ing concentration of glucose inside the fermentation 
medium was 21.9  mM ± 2.5  mM after 50  h, which is 
5 mM less than for BS115. The molar ratio of consumed 
carbon to nitrogen source was 15.6 per 1 mM (S )-β-PA. 
The DCM peaked after 50 h of cultivation at the con
-
centration of 0.9 g/L, which is only half as much as for 
BS115.
Within the 2-day fermentation of BS115, the DCM 
value of 2  g/L is significantly higher than with PsJN, 
but the  Y
x/s value of 0.15 is rather low in relation to the 
amount of biomass produced in relation to the amount of 
depleted glucose. Surprisingly a consumption of the (R)-
enantiomer of β-PA was shown for BS115 but the growth 
was limited although neither (R)-β-PA nor glucose was 
fully depleted. The remaining concentration of glucose 
was 27 ± 1.6  mM and the oxygen concentration of 80% 
can be ruled out as limiting factor for further growth. The 
conversion rates of β-PA and the growth rate µ and volu
-
metric growth rate rx were compared in Table 1. The µmax 
was determined for PsJN after 17.9 h of cultivation with

0.14 h−1, which is equate to a doubling time  (td) of 4.95 h. 
In contrast, the strain BS115 reached a µ max of 0.23 h −1 
after 27.0 h of cultivation.
During fermentation BS115 grew 1.6 times faster than 
PsJN on β-PA (Fig. 2). The  Q(s)-PA rate was calculated to be 
0.26 mM/h for BS115 after 14.2 h (Fig. 3). The  Q(s)-PA rate 
of PsJN was slightly lower with 0.21 mM/h after 16.2 h of 
cultivation time. In addition the  q(s)-PA was determined 
for both strains, which is correlated to the biomass con -
centration. On the other hand BS115 had a specific  q(s)-PA 
rate which is slightly lower with 0.74  mmol/g/h com -
pared to PsJN with 0.88 mmol/g/h (Fig. 3).
PsJN produced less biomass but the cells converted (S)-
β-PA more efficiently. PsJN started to convert with maxi-
mal specific consumption rate, whereas BS115 reached 
its maximal consumption rate after 8  h of cultivation 
time. In contrast to (S)-β-PA, the consumption rate of 
(R)-β-PA could not be fitted for BS115, caused by the 
high variances and inconstant decreasing rate between 
25 and 50  h of cultivation. The volumetric production 
rate  Q
AP of AP reached a maximum of 0.07  mM/h for 
PsJN after 10.8 h of fermentation. After several hours the 
AP concentration decreased with a much slower with a 
 Q
AP rate of 0.01 mM/h. Initially, the BS115  QAP rate was 
faster than calculated for PsJN, with 0.34 mM/h.
ω‑Transaminase activity test
The β-PA degrading activity of both strains were tested 
with cell free lysate from BS115 and compared to PsJN 
lysate. The temperature was set to 30  °C according to

molecule was added due to the compatibility towards well 
characterized β-phenylalanine transaminases (Wybenga 
et al. 2012; Crismaru et al. 2013). The final concentration 
of applied protein in the reaction mixture was 0.47 mg/mL 
for PsJN and 0.95 mg/mL for BS115. The concentration of 
rac-β-PA in the lysate-reaction mixture was determined 
at different times, to recognize slow and fast conversions 
as well as long-term effects (Additional file  1: Figure  S3). 
After 24  h both lysates showed only activity for (S )-β-PA 
and a complete conversion of the (S )-enantiomer. The 
transaminase activity at the beginning of the reaction 
was considerably higher for PsJN lysate than for BS115. 
The specific activities of both preparations were calcu
-
lated between samples of 15 s and 1 h and varied between 
35 ± 5  mU/mg for PsJN and 8 ± 4  mU/mg for BS115. 
In total, the amounts of the obtained lysate activity was 
1.25 U and 0.32 U in 100 mL cell culture at an  OD
600 of 3.1.
Characterization of BS115 ω‑TA
The ω-TA activity of BS115 was characterized. The 
activity of the putative enzyme was higher in a slightly 
alkaline TRIS-buffer system at pH 8. In addition to 
α-ketoglutarate the BS115 lysate also showed activity 
towards the amino acceptors pyruvate and oxaloacetate. 
However, for the latter acceptor molecules the activity 
was 50% lower compared to α-ketoglutarate. Moreover, 
derivatives of β-PA were tested as amino donors. The 
transaminase activity was higher towards non-substi
-
tuted β-PA and in contrast relatively low for β-PA with 
a chlorine in para  position at the phenyl-ring. Also 
remarkable is that the enantioselectivity decreased only 
for the strong polar nitro-substituent (Table 2).
By contrast, the putative ω-TA from BS115 showed 
no activity towards rac -β-homophenylalanine, which 
comprises only one additional carbon atom between the 
amino group and phenyl ring. In the case of variation of 
the substituents of the phenyl-ring of β-PA, the enzymes 
showed a wide promiscuity.
Discussion
Degradation of (S)‑β‑PA by BS115 and PsJN
Both Paraburkholderia strains BS115 and PsJN were 
able to grow with (S)-β-PA as sole source of nitrogen. 
The metabolization of the N-source most likely occurs 
via a transaminase reaction in which the amino group 
of (S)-β-PA is transferred to an α-keto acid. Although 
α-ketoglutarate has been shown to be the most suitable 
in vitro amino acceptor, the in vivo application of other 
molecules like pyruvate is also possible.
Deracemization of β-PA by living cells has only once 
been reported so far: The only comparable fermentation 
example from Mano et al. showed that the soil bacterium 
Variovorax sp. JH2 is able to convert (S)-selective 61 mM 
of β-PA within 8 days (Mano et al. 2006). They achieved 
a maximal degradation rate of 0.26  mM/h towards (S)-
β-PA, which is comparable to the uptake rates of PsJN 
and BS115. The approach to utilize living cells for chiral 
resolution of rac-β-PA should be tested in further experi
-
ments at larger scales and at higher concentration lev -
els, to prove whether a microbial process might be able 
to compete with established industrial deracemization 
processes using lipases demonstrated by former Evonik-
Degussa company (Grayson et al. 2011). Yeast cells have 
successfully been used for the chiral resolution of alco
-
hols and more recent examples document the microbial 
resolution e.g. of dl-glyceric acid (Glänzer et  al. 1987; 
Kometani et al. 1995; Sato et al. 2015).
The rapid degradation of the (S)-enantiomer, in con
-
trast to the (R)-enantiomer, resulted in a reduction of the 
pH-value by metabolizing almost half of the d-glucose. 
According to this, the final pH value of 3.5 is most likely 
to be limiting. In addition it could be seen that during 
BS115 fermentation the pH-value stagnated at a constant 
value of 5 for several hours before it dropped to 3.5. A 
total consumption of the (R)-enantiomer might be pos
-
sible, if the fermentation process was pH regulated. The 
fermentation parameters quantified are valuable for using 
the strains as microbial target to investigate metabolic 
pathways of the rac -β-PA metabolization to ultimately 
achieve the microbial synthesis of β-PA, as has already 
been established for α-amino acids (Sanchez et al. 2017). 
In contrast the experiments lead to the assumption, that 
BS115 is able to convert (R)-β-PA by a so far unknown 
mechanism (Fig.  4). The lowering of the pH value indi
-
cates that either an organic acid is formed or a previously 
buffering substance [e.g. β-PA (pI 5.84)] has been con
-
sumed by BS115. β-PA could thus itself act as a buffer at 
pH 5.8, but continuing degradation leads to further acidi
-
fication due to the resulting β-keto acid production.

By‑product analysis
The proposed transamination of (S)-β-PA leads to the 
corresponding β-keto acid 3-oxo-3-phenylpropanoic 
acid. However, this molecule has never been detected 
in medium as it spontaneously decarboxylates to AP as 
has been shown in previous studies (Crismaru et al. 2013; 
Dold et  al. 2016). AP on the other hand was shown to 
emerge in parallel to the degradation of (S)-β-PA, peak
-
ing for both strains after about 30  h when (S)-β-PA is 
depleted (Additional file  1: Figure S1). Progress of AP 
formation rate and (S)-β-PA degradation rate are nearly 
identical for both strains which is strong evidence for the 
proposed transamination mechanism (Fig.  4). In BS115, 
even the molar concentrations of emerging AP and 
metabolized (S)-β-PA are close to identical. So it is most 
likely that after transamination the corresponding β-keto 
acid decarboxylates and the emerging AP is excreted.
After depletion of (S)-β-PA, AP concentration in the 
medium notably decreases. Substantial evaporation of 
the volatile AP can be excluded from control experi
-
ments (data not shown). A reuptake of AP is possible, 
but from the data at hand it cannot be stated whether 
AP serves as additional carbon source or as amino accep
-
tor without further metabolization which would also 
lead to the observed depletion. Rehdorf et  al. showed 
in Pseudomonas putida strain JD1, that a Baeyer–Vil
-
liger monooxygenase converts 4-hydroxy AP to phenyl-
acetate. Finally, phenyl-acetate is further degraded via a 
β-ketoadipate metabolic pathway. At the same time, the 
enzyme is also able to convert AP (Rehdorf et al. 2009). 
Fig. 4 Putative degradation mechanisms of (R)‑β‑PA. In blue: putative degradation mechanisms of (R)‑β‑PA. Since AP no longer emerges when 
(R)‑β‑PA is consumed but rather decreases during fermentation (see again Additional file 1: Figure S1a), the reactions via aminomutase appear to 
be more likely. Bacterial ammonia lyases (dashed arrow) with activity towards β‑PA have not yet been reported. In black: identified degradation 
pathways of (S)‑β‑PA. The degradation of (S)‑β‑PA occurs via transamination and leads to the formation of AP reciprocal to (S)‑β‑PA decline (as 
shown in Additional file 1: Figure S1a)
Page 9 of 13
Buß et al. AMB Expr  (2018) 8:149 
This metabolic pathway releases acetic acid, which 
should lower the pH value of the fermentation medium. 
This is supported by the fact that at the very time when 
acetophenone decreases drastically (after 40 h), also the 
pH value of BS115 fermentation decreases from 6 to 4 
(Additional file 1: Figure S4).
Further experiments with a different Paraburkholderia 
strain demonstrated that AP can be reduced by a car
-
bonyl reductase (Singh et  al. 2009), which might serve 
as an evidence for further metabolization inside the 
cells. It is also known that Burkholderia sp. expresses a 
reductase which is able to reduce 2-aminoacetophenone 
to 2-amino-1-phenylethanol (Yamada-Onodera et  al. 
2007). The same reductase might also be able to convert 
AP . Furthermore PsJN is known to degrade even more 
complex aromatic biomolecules like the plant hormone 
indole-3-acetic acid by a rather complex degradation 
pathway to catechol (Donoso et al. 2017). So a bacterial 
metabolization of AP as a reason for its decrease is most 
likely.
Superior growth of BS115
Although both strains clearly metabolize (S)-β-PA via 
the same mechanism, BS115 reaches a final  OD
600 twice 
as high as that of PsJN under identical growth condi -
tions. According to 16S-rDNA sequencing, both strains 
show > 99% identity, so the basic metabolism might not 
differ too much and maybe only one additional enzyme 
makes up the severe difference in growth. However, it is 
also possible that different enzymes from other microbial 
sources are integrated in BS115 genome via horizontal 
gene transfer, especially when the strain was exposed to 
extraordinary amino sources in soil. Since the PsJN cul
-
tures obviously reach the stationary phase when (S)-β-PA 
is depleted although sufficient amounts of d-glucose are 
still at hand, a growth stop can be explained by the ina
-
bility of this strain to use the (R)-enantiomer as nitrogen 
source; (R)-β-PA remains completely unconsumed dur
-
ing the whole fermentation. A growth inhibition by other 
factors like toxic metabolites is unlikely since the closely 
related strain BS115 very probably faces similar but even 
stronger stress conditions (e.g. ongoing acidification, 
depletion of other nutrients than N-source).
Moreover, BS115 shows a quite similar cell dry mass 
per depleted (S)-β-PA minus depleted (R)-β-PA. In 
total BS115 built 1.82  g of biomass per liter and con
-
sumed 7.72  mM of rac -β-PA, that is a ratio of 4.3  g/
(mM(β-PA)). In contrast PsJN built only 0.82  g/L (ratio 
5.9  g/(mM(β-PA)) and was at the same time more effi
-
cient in using only (S)-PA. So we postulate at least one 
additional enzyme in BS115 which allows the metaboli
-
zation or (R)-β-PA as additional N-source and potentially 
also as additional C-source, leading to a better growth 
and to the formation of considerably more cell dry mass 
from the same medium.
Degradation of (R)‑β‑PA by BS115
Several options of amino acid metabolization are iden -
tified and well investigated (see also “Introduction ” sec -
tion), and most of these also seem conceivable for the 
degradation of (R)-β-PA. Since activity has only been 
observed in growing cells, a cofactor-dependent mecha
-
nism is likely. Moreover, an additional transaminase 
would have been detected under the given conditions, 
and also a side activity of the identified (S)-β-PA can be 
excluded: (R) and (S)-ω-TAs show only low sequence 
identities and can clearly be differentiated by protein fold 
types (Höhne et al. 2010; Buß et al. 2018a). A transamina
-
tion of (R)-β-PA would have led to the formation of AP , 
but on the contrary the concentration of AP decreased. 
Several (R)-selective ω-TAs have been described for the 
ability to convert and synthesize (R)-configurated amines. 
However, activity towards aromatic or bulky β-AAs were 
only observed for (S)-selective ω-TAs (Koszelewski et al. 
2010; Seo et  al. 2012; Dold et  al. 2016) and no (R)-PA 
converting transaminase has been reported until now 
(Mutti et  al. 2011; Mallin et  al. 2014; Jiang et  al. 2015; 
Skalden et al. 2015). Only Mano et al. investigated an (R)-
selective strain, Arthrobacter sp. AKU 638, which is suita
-
ble for chiral resolution to gain the optical pure (S)-β-PA. 
However, this degradation process is very slow and took 
13  days of fermentation and in contrast to BS115 they 
did not recognize any depletion of the (S)-enantiomer at 
the same time (Mano et al. 2006). Oxidative deamination 
has been suggested, but until now, the mechanism for the 
degradation of (R)-β-PA in Arthrobacter sp. AKU 638 is 
uncovered. Only recently it was also shown that the ethyl 
ester of (R)-PA can be converted by a commercial fold 
type IV transaminase (ATA117 11Rd), which however 
has been largely modified and no longer shows a high 
identity to wild-type ω-TA (Buß et al. 2018b). Therefore, 
it seems unlikely that such a transaminase can occur in 
BS115, especially since tests with cell lysate do not indi
-
cate any transaminase reaction.
In fact, the metabolism of (R)-β-PA has only been 
reported for microorganism with assured aminomutases 
or ammonia lyases genes (Szymanski et  al. 2009; Jiang 
et  al. 2015; Weise et  al. 2015). The activity of amino
-
mutases is described as quite low which might explain 
the rather slow degradation of (R)-β-PA using BS115 
(Bartsch et  al. 2013). Also several amino acid oxidases 
exist with high activity towards several amines (Alexeeva 
et  al. 2002; Ghislieri et  al. 2013), but as yet amino acid 
oxidases with activity towards β-PA have not been pub
-
lished. Analogously no wildtype β-amino acid dehydro -
genase is known; the only example of a dehydrogenase 
Page 10 of 13Buß et al. AMB Expr  (2018) 8:149 
with activity towards β-PA is an engineered enzyme from 
the amino acid fermenting bacterium Candidatus cloaca-
monas (Zhang et al. 2015).
However, PA-racemases have been described for the 
racemization between l and d-α-PA in bacteria (Conti 
et  al. 1997) and for plants the Ta xus  (yew) PA amino -
mutase is known to use α-phenylalanine as substrate to 
produce (R)-β-PA (Cox et al. 2009). In contrast, no bac
-
terial β-phenylalanine lyase was reported so far, so it is 
rather unlikely that β-PA is degraded by a lyase; however, 
this possibility is shown in Fig.  4 for completeness. Wu 
et al. showed that a PA mutase from Taxus chinensis can 
be utilized for chiral separation of rac-β-PA. The corre
-
sponding α-PA is then degraded to cinnamic acid using 
an α-PA ammonia lyase from Rhodosporidium toruloides. 
The reported reaction time for chiral resolution was 
quite long with more than 48 h using 2 mM of substrate 
(Wu et  al. 2010). Apart from this also β-tyrosine ami
-
nomutase is known from Oryzae sativa with high enan -
tioselectivity towards (R)-β-PA (Walter et  al. 2016). So 
a slow enzymatic racemization of (R)-PA to (S)-PA and 
further metabolization of the latter by BS115 appears at 
least possible; but no bacterial aminomutase with such an 
activity is known until now.
Hypothetical degradation pathway for (R)‑β‑PA
Recently Csuka et al. (2017) reported that Pseudomonas 
fluorescens R124 encodes three different class I lyase 
like enzymes, namely an ammonia-lyase, an aromatic 
2,3 aminomutase and a histidine ammonia-lyase. The 
authors describe, that under nitrogen limitation, P. fluo
-
rescens is able to integrate new genes by horizontal gene 
transfer to overcome limitations. Therefore BS115 might 
be adapted towards special nitrogen limitations, even 
when the genome is quite similar to PsJN. For this reason 
it might be possible that BS115, in the presence of (S)-
β-PA, expresses an ammonia-lyase or 2,3 aminomutase 
which could convert (R)-β-PA to cinnamic acid. The 
transmutation of an ammonia-lyase into a 2,3 amino
-
mutase is possible by a single mutation and can change 
the functionality of a mutase to a lyase (Bartsch et  al. 
2013). The vice versa functionality change of a lyase to 
a mutase has not yet been reported, but attempts have 
been made to determine the decisive amino acid residues 
using mutation studies of e.g. Attanayake et  al. (2018). 
Bacterial aminomutase with β-PA activity would also be 
rather unexpected, although not unthinkable, consider
-
ing that horizontal gene shifts are possible. In this case, 
any cinnamic acid produced could be largely metabo
-
lized. This pathway has been shown in Pseudomonas 
strains where cinnamic acid is metabolized to o-hydroxy
-
phenylpropionic acid and to 2,3-dihydroxyphenylpropi -
onic acid (Blakley and Simpson 1964). BS115 might be 
able to regenerate NAD(P) + by this way using an NADP 
oxidoreductase. In high concentrations cinnamic can also 
be reduced by NADH using fumarate reductase or by an 
oxygen-sensitive 2-enoate reductase (Hillier et  al. 1979; 
Sun et al. 2016). An oxygen-sensitive enzyme would also 
give an explanation why the activity is hard to detect in 
crude extracts without further protective measures.
This assumption is supported by growth experiments 
on enantiopure (R) and (S)-β-PA as nitrogen sources, as 
BS115 is only able to degrade (R)-β-PA in the presence of 
(S)-β-PA and not when added as sole N-source (Fig.  5). 
The experiments showed that (S)-β-PA was completely 
converted, whereas the (R)-enantiomer as sole nitrogen 
source remained untouched even after a cultivation dura
-
tion of 70  h (Fig.  5a). On the other hand, the (R)-enan -
tiomer was substantially degraded in the presence of 
(S)-β-PA (Fig.  5b). Only 40% of 10  mM (R)-enantiomer 
retained within the cultivation medium after 70 h. Since 
growth continues after complete depletion of (S)-β-PA, 
(R)-β-PA is obviously made accessible as nitrogen source 
by one of the mechanisms depicted in Additional file  1: 
Figure S4. Moreover (R)-β-PA might also serve as addi
-
tional carbon source or as electron acceptor if cinnamic 
acid is produced.
All of the above discussed potential pathways and 
metabolization steps using the addressed different 
enzymes are also summarized in Fig.  4. These results also 
confirm the report from Mano et al., that no activity can 
be detected in cell-free lysate of an Arthrobacter sp. AKU 
638 strain for (R)-β-PA consumption. Furthermore, the 
reported very slow degradation, might hint to a similar 
mechanism using the same enzyme as in BS115.
We characterized the degradation of racemic β-PA by 
a 3  days fermentation of two Paraburkholderia strains 
PsJN and BS115 in a 2.5  L-benchtop fermenter in 1  L 
medium. PsJN exhibited strict (S)-selectivity and there
-
fore can be utilized as whole cell biocatalyst to obtain 
(R)-β-PA in high optical purity by chiral resolution. The 
spontaneous decarboxylation of the emerging β-keto acid 
to acetophenone, for the first time documented over the 
whole degradation process, shifts the equilibrium irre
-
versibly towards the desired direction. However, as a 
process with industrial relevance a high cell density fer
-
mentation has to be developed with medium conditions 
allowing much higher substrate concentrations, which 
is currently limited by the low water solubility of β-PA. 
Therefore an alternative would be to perform a fed batch 
fermentation. After uncovering the degradation path
-
way of (S)- and (R)-β-PA in Paraburkholderia sp., these 
strains might be optimized for the production of β-PA as 
has already been shown for several α-amino acid produc
-
tion strains (Sanchez et al. 2017). The abilities to synthe -
size (R)-configurated aromatic amines and amino acids 
Page 11 of 13
Buß et al. AMB Expr  (2018) 8:149 
by asymmetric synthesis are limited by the availability 
of (R)-selective enzymes; so far, only few plant enzymes 
are known for the synthesis of (R)-β-PA (Ratnayake et al. 
2016; Buß et  al. 2018b). So the investigation of the (R)-
β-PA degradation process in BS115 might not only lead 
to a deeper understanding of the biochemical pathways 
of β-AA but to novel approaches for the chemoenzymatic 
synthesis of this highly relevant substance class.
