Biocatalytic potential of vanillin aminotransferase
from Capsicum chinense
Nora Weber1, Abdelrahman Ismail2, Marie Gorwa-Grauslund1 and Magnus Carlquist1*
Abstract
Background: The conversion of vanillin to vanillylamine is a key step in the biosynthetic route towards
capsaicinoids in pungent cultivars ofCapsicum sp. The reaction has previously been annotated to be catalysed by
PAMT (putative aminotransferase; [GenBank: AAC78480.1, Swiss-Prot: O82521]), however, the enzyme has previously
not been biochemically characterisedin vitro.
Results: The biochemical activity of the transaminase was confirmed by direct measurement of the reaction with
purified recombinant enzyme. The enzyme accepted pyruvate, and oxaloacetate but not 2-oxoglutarate as
co-substrate, which is in accordance with other characterised transaminases from the plant kingdom. The enzyme
was also able to convert (S)-1-phenylethylamine into acetophenone with high stereo-selectivity. Additionally, it was
shown to be active at a broad pH range.
Conclusions: We suggest PAMT to be renamed to VAMT (vanillin aminotransferase, abbreviation used in this study)
as formation of vanillin from vanillylamine could be demonstrated. Furthermore, due to high stereoselectivity and
activity at physiological pH, VAMT is a suitable candidate for biocatalytic transamination in a recombinant
whole-cell system.

Background
Chili pepper fruit (Capsicum sp.) gives rise to a strong
pungent sensation when eaten, due to the presence of
capsaicinoids, with capsaicin (trans-8-methyl-N-vanillyl-6-
nonenamide) as the most known example [1]. Capsaici-
noids have been considered as anti-obesity, antimicrobial
and antineoplastic agents [1,2], and for the prevention of
hypertension [3]. Additionally, capsaicin is a very potent
agonist of the pain receptor TRPV1 [4,5] and is therefore
used as a therapeutic drug in the treatment of peripheral
neuropathy. Since the discovery of capsaicinoids there has
been substantial amount of research dedicated to the un-
derstanding of biosynthetic pathways leading to capsaici-
noids in different cultivars ofCapsicum sp. Although the
biochemical pathways leading to capsaicin are described,
there is still a knowledge-gap with regards to the identity
of some of the involved enzymes (cf. review by Aza-
González et al. [2]).
In brief, capsaicin synthesis inCapsicum sp. is achieved
through combination of two separate pathways, namely:
(i) phenylalanine conversion to vanillylamine; and (ii) val-
ine conversion to 8-methyl-6-nonenyl-CoA acid via the
fatty acid metabolism. The two pathways are connected in
a capsaicinoid synthase-catalysed condensation reaction
between vanillylamine and 8-methyl-6-nonenyl-CoA to
form capsaicin [2]. A key step in the biosynthetic route to
capsaicin is the conversion of vanillin to vanillylamine via
transamination of the aldehyde moiety into the corre-
sponding amine [6] (Figure 1). The responsible enzyme
for transamination of vanillin has previously been ad-
dressed to be putative aminotransferase (PAMT) [Gen-
Bank: AAC78480.1, Swiss-Prot: O82521] [7]. Although
functional studiesin vivoclearly indicate that PAMT is re-
sponsible for the transamination of vanillin inCapsicum
sp. [6,8], the pure enzyme has, to the best of our know-
ledge, not been characterisedin vitro.

In this study, the gene encoding PAMT was functionally
expressed inEscherichia coliand the polyhistidine-tagged
enzyme was purified to homogeneity using affinity chro-
matography and subsequently characterised. It is con-
firmed that PAMT converts vanillylamine to vanillin, and
should therefore from now on be called“vanillin amino-
transferase (VAMT)”. The enzyme can also be used for
the kinetic resolution of racemic 1-phenylethylamine to
(R)-1-phenylethylamine and acetophenone, and thus car-
ries the potential to be applied for biocatalytic transamin-
ation for the preparation of chiral amines.
Results and discussion
Cloning, expression and purification of VAMT
Codon-optimised synthetic C. chinense VAMT gene was
cloned into an E. coli expression vector downstream of
the IPTG-inducible T7 promoter, resulting in plasmid
pNW1 (Table 1). The plasmid was used to transformE.
coli BL21, generating strain TMB2100 (Table 1). At first
the expression of the protein was investigated with in-
duction at optimal temperature forE. coli growth (37°C),
however, no enzyme activity in cell free lysate could be
registered. Possible explanations include the formation
of inclusion bodies or other incorrect folding of the re-
combinant protein as previously observed for other sys-
tems [9]. To solve this problem, a lower temperature
(15°C) for the protein induction-expression step was
chosen, which led to a high expression of the active en-
zyme. The polyhistidine-tagged protein was purified from
cell free lysate using affinity chromatography, and no
contaminating proteins could be detected by SDS-PAGE
analysis of the purified enzyme solution (Figure 2).
Functional validation of vanillin aminotransferase activity
Most known transaminases of both bacterial and plant
origin accept L-alanine as amine donor [10-15]. The
purified enzyme was therefore first evaluated for the
conversion of vanillin to vanillylamine with a high excess
of alanine as amine donor. It was, however, not possible
to detect any formation of vanillylamine. Conversion
was neither observed with the following amine donors:
D-alanine, GABA, glutamine and ornithine. However it
cannot be excluded that some vanillylamine (below the
detection limit of our HPLC analysis) was formed since
transamination of a small amount of vanillin was pre-
viously observed in crude cell extract from pungent
pepper Capsicum annuum and with GABA as amine
donor [6]. However, the Gibbs free energy of the reac-
tion, ΔG0’, as calculated by using the group contribution
method [16], was ΔG0’ = +2.55 kcal/mol when using L-
alanine and other amino acids as amine donor. The re-
action was consequently thermodynamically favouring
the reverse reaction and a high conversion of vanillin
was, even with an excess addition of the amine donor,
not expectable. It has previously been shown for other
transaminases that a (co-) product removal system was
required to reach conversion of aromatic ketones to
amines [12,17,18]. Therefore, the enzyme was instead
evaluated for the conversion of vanillylamine to vanillin
using pyruvate as amine acceptor. In this case, the

formation of vanillin could be detected shortly after the
start of the reaction (the specific activity of the enzyme
was approximately 5 U/mg protein), which indicates that
VAMT indeed is responsible for vanillylamine formation
in C. chinense. Whether this activity can be found in
orthologous plant transaminases and is a general trait,
or if it is a specific natural function of VAMT that has
been evolved over time, is unknown. BlastP search
within the NCBI database (http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/
Blast.cgi) with the amino acid sequence of VAMT identi-
fied γ-aminobutyrate (GABA) transaminases, catalysing
the conversion of GABA to succinate semialdehyde as
the most similar enzymes. The amino acid sequence of
VAMT notably shared 76-83% identity to known plant
GABA transaminases originating fromArabidopsis thali-
ana [10], apple [15] and tomato [11]. None of these en-
zymes have been investigated for the ability to convert
vanillin or vanillylamine. In fact, transamination of vanil-
lin has, to the best of our knowledge, only been reported
for theω-transaminase fromChromobacterium violaceum
DSM 30191 (CV-ωTA) [13]; however, transamination of
numerous aryl substituted aldehydes and ketones have
previously been described forω-transaminases originating
from various soil-living bacteria, for exampleω-TAs from
Aspergillus terreus, Hyphomonas neptunium,and Arthro-
bacter ATA-117 [14,19]. It is likely that there are several
other transaminases unrelated to VAMT that are able to
convert vanillin to vanillylamine.
Potential for biocatalytic transaminations
To evaluate whether VAMT has any potential for biocat-
alytic transamination for the preparation of chiral
amines, kinetic resolution of ( rac)-1-phenylethylamine
(1-PEA) was examined and which enantiomeric selectiv-
ity the enzyme possesses. The kinetic resolution of (rac)-
1-PEA using pyruvate as amine acceptor was initiated by
addition of the enzyme and was allowed to continue for
24 hours. The products were extracted with heptane and
analysed using chiral HPLC. (S)-1-PEA was fully con-
verted into acetophenone, while ( R)-1-PEA remained,
leading to an ee > 99% at 50% conversion of (rac)-1-PEA.
Alike VAMT, most known transaminases that have been
used for the generation of chiral amines areS-selective
[14], with a few exceptions ofR-selective enzymes [20,21].
To investigate which co-substrates were accepted by
VAMT, kinetic resolution with different amine acceptors
was carried out (Figure 3). In addition to pyruvate, it was
shown that oxaloacetate was also accepted as co-substrate
by the enzyme. The enzyme was not able to use 2-
oxoglutarate as amine acceptor, which is in accordance
with other known GABA transaminases of plant origin
[10,11,15]; nor was it able to use succinate or acetone as
amine acceptor. However the aromatic aldehydep-hydro-
xybenzaldehyde displayed some reactivity.
The optimal pH for VAMT activity was investigated by
following the relative conversion of ( S)-1-phenylethyl-
amine to acetophenone at different pH between 6 to 12
(Figure 4). Noteworthy, the enzyme displayed activity
over a broad pH range (pH 6-10), and had the highest
activity at pH 7-8, which is rather unique in comparison
with several other transaminases that have a higher pH
optimum [20,22-27]. The high activity at physiological
pH demonstrates that VAMT is suitable for whole-cell
transamination systems where the reaction takes place
in the cytoplasm of viable and metabolically active cells.
Conclusions
For the first time, the catalytic activity of vanillin trans-
aminase from chili pepper plantCapsicum chinense was
demonstrated with the purified enzymein vitro. The en-
zyme displayed high transaminase activity towards vanil-
lylamine and (S)-1-phenylethylamine with pyruvate or
oxaloacetate as amine acceptor, and the enzyme was

active at a broad pH range. Thus, VAMT can be used for
the preparation of chiral amines, and represents an in-
teresting candidate to be used in whole-cell biocatalysis
with recombinant microorganisms.
Methods
Strains and cultivation conditions
E. coli strains and plasmids used in the study are listed in
Table 1.E. coli strain DH5α was used for subcloning and
transformants were selected on lysogeny broth (LB) media
supplemented with 100 mg/l ampicillin (IBI Shelton Scien-
tific, CT, USA). Strains were kept in 20% v/v glycerol stocks
at -80°C and grown for 1 day on LB plates at 37°C before
use. A single colony was picked and pre-cultured overnight
in LB media and used for subsequent inoculation.
Strain construction
Standard molecular biology techniques were used for all
cloning procedures [28]. Plasmid DNA was prepared with
the GeneJET™ Plasmid Miniprep Kit (Fermentas UAB,
Vilnius, Lithuania). Agarose gel DNA extraction was made
with QIAquick® Gel Extraction Kit (Qiagen GmbH, Hilden,
Germany). Sequencing was performed by MWG-Biotech
AG (Ebersberg, Germany). Restriction endonucleases and
T4 DNA Ligase from Fermentas were used for DNA ma-
nipulation. Transformation ofE. coli was performed with
the calcium chloride [29] method.
The VAMT gene from C. chinense [GenBank:
AAC78480.1, Swiss-Prot: O82521] was constructed syn-
thetically (GenScript, NJ, USA), resulting in plasmid
pUC57 VAMT (Table 1). The plasmid was digested with
restriction enzymes BamHI and PstI, and the resulting
fragment was inserted into pRSETB (Invitrogen, CA,
USA). The resulting plasmid pNW1 was digested with
BamHI, treated with Klenow fragment from Fermentas
and re-ligated with T4 DNA Ligase from Fermentas to
move the gene in frame. Correct orientations and se-
quences of the inserts were verified by restriction analysis
and sequencing. pNW1 was transformed intoE. coliBL21
(DE3) pLys which gave strain TMB2100.
Cell growth
A single microbial colony of TMB2100 from a LB plate
[30] containing 100 mg/l ampicillin was inoculated in
50 ml LB medium containing 100 mg/l ampicillin. Cells
were grown overnight (at least 16 hr) in an incubator at
37°C with shaking at 180 rpm. The preculture was used
to inoculate 250 ml LB medium containing 100 mg/l
ampicillin in a 1 l shake flask with an optical density
(OD
620) of 0.1 and growth was performed at 37°C and
180 rpm. Expression of the transaminase gene VAMT
was induced by addition of isopropyl- β-D-thiogalacto-
side (IPTG) to a final concentration of 1 mM when the
OD
620 of the culture reached 0.6 to 0.8 and incubation
was then continued for 24 hours at 15°C and 180 rpm.
Purification of the transaminase
Cells of recombinant E. coli strain TMB2100 were har-
vested by centrifugation (3200 ×g, 10 min) and washed
once with 25 mL water. The cell pellet was resuspended
in equilibration buffer, according to the manufacturer’s
instructions, and subjected to sonication in a sonicator
(Bandelin electronics, Berlin, Germany). Cell debris was
removed by centrifugation (3200 ×g, 10 min). The clear
lysate supernatant was collected and passed through
a nickel column (HisPur ™ Ni-NTA Purification Kit,
Thermo Scientific, Rockford, IL, USA), according to the
description of the manufacturer. The purified transamin-
ase was collected after elution with buffer, according to
the manufacturer’s instructions. Protein concentration
was determined using the Bradford method with bovine
serum albumin (BSA) as a standard [31]. Purity of the
protein in the eluent was estimated with SDS-PAGE
(Figure 2). The identity of the protein was confirmed by
mass spectrometry at the SWEGENE proteomics plat-
form (Lund, Sweden). The concentration of the purified
transaminase was approximately 0.5 mg/ml.
Enzyme activity assay
Purified VAMT (0.5 ml) was mixed with 4 mM vanillyla-
mine, (rac)-1-phenylethylamine (1-PEA) or vanillin, PLP
(0.1 mM), and one of the following co-substrates (40 mM
for amine acceptors, 100 mM for amine donors): pyruvate,
oxaloacetate, 2-oxoglutarate, succinate,p-hydroxybenzal-
dehyde, acetone, L-alanine, D-alanine, GABA, glutamine
or ornithine. The reaction was performed in 1 ml sodium
phosphate buffer (100 mM, pH 6-7), Tris-HCl buffer
(100 mM, pH 7-9) or CAPS buffer (100 mM, pH 10-12) in
a glass vial. The reaction was started by the addition of the
substrate and it was quenched by the addition of 0.1 ml

1 M HCl. Samples were kept at -20°C until analysis. Thaw-
ing of samples (0.5 ml) was done at room temperature
and 1-PEA and acetophenone (ACP) were extracted with
0.6 ml heptane, after addition of 30μlN a O H( 1 0M ) ,a n d
analyzed by HPLC. The specific activity of the enzyme was
calculated based on the rate of vanillylamine conversion
(1 U = conversion of 1μmol vanillylamine per minute).
Experiments were done at least in duplicates. The enzyme
has a selectivity factor, E > 100 which was calculated ac-
cording to E ¼

ln 1−cðÞ /C3 1þeeðÞ½/C138 ; where c = conversion, ee =
enantiomeric excess).
HPLC analysis
Quantitative analysis of vanillin and vanillylamine were
performed with a 1100 Series HPLC instrument (Agilent
Technologies, Heilbronn, Germany) equipped with a qua-
ternary pump, autosampler, diode array detector (DAD),
fluorescence detector and a vacuum degasser. Chroma-
tographic separation took place in a Zorbax SB-C18
(2.1 mm × 150 mm × 3.5μm) column (Agilent, USA). A
gradient elution method was optimized using two mo-
bile phases, A (0.5% formic acid in water) and B (0.5%
formic acid in methanol). The elution gradient started
with an initial composition of 4% B and increased to
96% B within 5 min. The late composition was kept iso-
cratic for 7 min, followed by returning back to initial
composition in one minute. The method was ended
with a 12 min equilibration step at the same compos-
ition resulting in a 25 min total runtime. Using the
autosampler syringe, 5 μl sample was injected to the
column. The mobile phase flow rate kept constant at
0.2 ml/min while monitoring with DAD at 280 nm
wavelength. Processing the HPLC data was done using
Agilent Chemstation revision B.01.03 software.
(R)- and ( S)-1-phenylethylamine and acetophenone
were determined using a Waters HPLC system (Binary
HPLC pump 1525, UV/Vis detector 2489, Autosampler
2707) equipped with a Daicel ChiralCel OD-H column
(4.6 × 25 mm, 5μm). The mobile phase was 85:15 hept-
ane/isopropanol with 0.1% butylamine and the flow rate
was kept constant at 1 ml/min while monitoring at
210 nm wavelength. Using the autosampler syringe, 5μl
sample was injected to the column. All sample analyses
were performed at room temperature. Retention times:
(R)-1-phenyethylamine: 5.6 min; (S)-1-phenylethylamine:
6.8 min; acetophenone: 4.6 min.
