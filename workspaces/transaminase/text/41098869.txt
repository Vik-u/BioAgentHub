Introduction: The discovery of anti­
cancer drugs from natural plants rep­
resents a large interest around the 
world. Ferulic acid (FA) is a natural 
phenolic acid has antitumor activity. 
Doxorubicin (DOX) is a potent chemo­
therapeutic agent used in the treat­
ment of breast cancer, but its clinical 
uses are limited due to its toxic ef ­
fects. This study aimed to evaluate 
the antitumour effect of FA and its 
nanosuspension (FA­NS) alone and in 
combination with DOX in Ehrlich solid 
tumour (EST)­bearing mice. 
Material and methods: Thirty­five fe­
male mice were divided into 7 groups: 
control, EST, FA, FA­NS, DOX, FA + DOX, 
and FA­NS + DOX. Proliferation, auto­
phagy, apoptosis, angiogenesis, ox­
idative stress, and total antioxidant 
capacity (TAC) were investigated. 
Results: Our results showed that FA 
alone or in combination with DOX de­
creased tumour weight, proliferation, 
and angiogenesis by downregulating 
AKT and vascular endothelial growth 
factor receptor 2 levels, with marked 
elevation in autophagy and apoptosis 
indicated by upregulating Beclin-1, 
LC3-II, and caspase­3 levels. In addi­
tion, reduction of oxidative stress was 
indicated by decreased malondialde­
hyde and elevated TAC levels. Inter ­
estingly, the combination treatment 
mitigates DOX­induced different toxic­
ities through the reduction of high lev­
els of troponin­1, creatine kinase­MB,  
alanine transaminase, aspartate trans­
aminase, urea, and creatinine.
Conclusions : The combination of FA 
with DOX has the ability not only 
to promote the antitumour activity 
of DOX but also to ameliorate the side 
effects of DOX with more significant 
results when the FA was formulated 
by the nanotechnology.
Key words: breast cancer, ferulic acid,

Introduction 
Breast cancer (BC) is one of the most commonly diagnosed cancers in 
the world, with an estimated 2.26 million cases recorded in 2020, and 
the leading cause of cancer mortality in women worldwide [1]. About 685,000 
women died from the disease, corresponding to 16% or 1 in every 6 cancer 
deaths in women [2]. Therefore, the early diagnosis of BC is crucial because 
BC is asymptomatic in the early stages, resulting in late detection of BC, 
which reduces the patient survival and efficacy of treatment options [3]. 
Mammography is needed for early diagnosis of BC because it is an effective 
method in the detection of early-stage breast cancers, reducing mortality 
rates and improving treatment outcomes [4].
The treatment of BC depends on surgical resection of the breast for in-
vasive breast cancers [5], radiation therapy after surgical resection of BC to 
destroy or damage any remaining cancer cells [6], endocrine/hormonal ther-
apy to treat hormone receptor-positive invasive BC [7], and chemotherapy 
before surgery to reduce tumour size and after surgery to treat BC patients 
with a high risk of recurrence [8].
Unfortunately, the administration of chemotherapeutic agents in BC 
treatment results in serious side effects, recurrence, and development 
of multi-drug resistance [9]. Among others, doxorubicin (DOX), also known 
as Adriamycin, is an anthracycline drug that is considered as one of the most 
effective chemotherapeutic drugs in the treatment of BC [10]. It is also used 
in the treatment of solid tumours, ovary, bladder, and lung cancers [11]. 
Doxorubicin exerts its effect by intercalation with DNA preventing topoisom-
erase-II activity leading to DNA damage, and formation of reactive oxygen 
species (ROS) leading to oxidative stress, DNA damage, and membrane 
damage resulting in cell death [12]. Despite its efficacy, it has significant side 
effects such as cardiotoxicity (which is the most significant), nephrotoxicity, 
and hepatotoxicity [13].
In our study, we used the Ehrlich solid tumour (EST) as a tumour model, which 
is widely used in cancer research in animals to investigate the antitumour ac-
tivities of natural and synthetic compounds because Ehrlich ascites carcinoma 
(EAC) cells are undifferentiated, grow rapidly, and are 100% malignant. The solid 
tumour is generated in mice by subcutaneous injection of the EAC cells  [14].
Because of the several limitations of chemotherapeutic medications, it is 
important to identify and use alternative therapies with potent antitumor

activity and lower side effects. Interestingly, Phytochemi-
cals are natural compounds isolated from plants and used 
for the prevention and treatment of various diseases, in-
cluding cancers. The antitumour activity is achieved by 
interfering with the development and progression of can-
cer through modulation of several mechanisms such as 
proliferation, angiogenesis, and apoptosis [15]. Moreover, 
natural products can also mitigate the side effects of che-
motherapy administration [16].
Ferulic acid (FA) is a phenolic compound extracted from 
Ferula foetida, commonly found in the trans-isomeric form 
and abundant in rice, wheat, grains, vegetables, fruits, 
coffee seeds, and nuts [17]. It has many biological activ-
ities such as antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, anticancer, 
antimicrobial, hepatoprotective, and cardioprotective [18]. 
It exerts its anticancer activity by various mechanisms: 
inhibition of cell proliferation by blocking PI3K/AKT path-
way, induction of apoptosis and autophagy by increas-
ing the levels of caspase-3, Beclin-1, and LC3-II biomark-
ers, and suppression of angiogenesis by downregulating 
vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (VEGFR-2) 
expression in cancer cells [19]. Moreover, FA can reduce 
oxidative stress by decreasing malondialdehyde (MDA) 
levels and increasing total antioxidant capacity (TAC) [20]. 
Because FA is poorly water-soluble, its oral bioavailability 
is reduced, limiting its biological activity and clinical appli-
cations. Nanotechnology is one approach used to address 
this issue [21]. Therefore, nanosuspension technology can 
be used not only to increase the solubility but also to im-
prove the bioavailability and efficacy of FA [22].
The present study aimed to evaluate the antitumour 
effect of FA and nanosuspension (FA-NS) alone and in 
combination with DOX on Ehrlich solid tumours to investi-
gate the expected therapeutic synergy of FA and/or FA-NS 
with DOX by the determination of inhibition or  induction 
of PI3K/AKT pathway or proliferation by estimation of AKT, 
autophagy by estimation of Beclin-1 and LC3-II expressions, 
apoptosis by estimation of caspase-3, and angiogenesis by 
estimation of VEGFR-2 levels. Moreover, we aimed to eval-
uate the expected protective effect of FA against different 
toxicities induced by DOX administration through the es-
timation of the levels of TAC and MDA to assess oxidative 
stress, troponin-1 (Tn1) and creatine kinase-MB (CK-MB) to 
assess cardiotoxicity, alanine transaminase (ALT) and aspar-
tate transaminase (AST) to assess hepatotoxicity, urea and 
creatinine to assess nephrotoxicity, histopathological and 
immunohistochemical studies, and to investigate the un-
derlying mechanisms and pathways of FA in breast cancer.
Material and methods
Ethical concerns 
The study was approved by the Animal Care and Ethical 
Committee at the faculty of pharmacy, Damanhour Uni-
versity (Reference no:1021PB24). 
Reagents and chemicals
Ferulic acid 99% (Sigma-Aldrich, catalogue no. 128708-5G). 
Doxorubicin (Hikma Specialized Pharmaceuticals company, 
Batch no. 210117). Solvents used for FA-NS (sodium lauryl 
sulphate, tween 80, polyvinyl alcohol (PVA), and acetone) 
were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich, Dorset, UK. The par -
ent lines of EAC cells were obtained from the Medical Re-
search Institute, Alexandria University, Egypt. All other re-
quired chemicals were supplied in analytical grades from 
suitable commercial sources.
Preparation of ferulic acid­loaded nanosuspension 
Ferulic acid-NSs were prepared by a solvent evaporation 
antisolvent precipitation method using probe sonication 
[23, 24]. Ferulic acid was dissolved in acetone to prepare 
a stock solution of 60 mg/ml. Aqueous PVA solution (0.5% 
w/w) was prepared separately as the antisolvent solution. 
Tween 80 and ionic surfactant (SLS) were investigated as 
co-stabilisers, as illustrated in Table 1. The drug solution 
was added dropwise over one minute into the antisolvent 
stabiliser solution under probe sonication (QS4 system, 
NanoLab, Waltham, MA, USA), which was continued for  
15 min (3 cycles each of 5 min) at an amplitude of 80% 
(of 125 W, 20 KHz) with 10 s pulse on and 5 s pulse off. 
The sonication was performed in an ice bath to maintain 
the temperature of the stabiliser solution at 5 ±3°C. This 
drug dispersion was then allowed to precipitate in nano-
sized form by solvent evaporation at ambient temperature 
conditions under magnetic stirring. The prepared formula-
tions were stored in the fridge at 2–8ºC.
Physicochemical properties of NS­preparation 
Particle size and zeta potential measurement
Nanosuspension preparations were characterised for 
particle size, polydispersity index (PDI), and zeta poten-
tial analysis by dynamic light scattering using a Micro-
trac particle sizer and zeta potential analyser (Microtrac 
Retsch Gmbh, Haan, Germany). The measurements were 
performed at 25°C after proper dilution (1 : 100) with de-
ionised water.

Drug content homogeneity
To evaluate the drug content homogeneity (DCH%) in 
FA-NS, an aliquot of 100 μl of the prepared NS was evap-
orated overnight to dryness [25, 26]. The residue was dis-
solved in acetone and centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 15 min. 
Then, samples were filtered through a 0.20 μm filter and 
analysed spectrophotometrically at 325 nm using a UV 
spectrophotometer T80 UV–Vis 1800 (PG Instruments Ltd., 
UK). The drug content homogeneity percentage was esti-
mated according to the following equation [26, 27]:
DCH% =

Stability of ferulic acid  nano suspension
Ferulic acid nanosuspension were stored at 2–8°C for  
2 months and subjected to stability study by monitoring 
any change in particle size, zeta potential, and DCH%.
Animwlthy and nonpregnant female Swiss albino mice  
(30 gm), were obtained from the Animal Care Unit 
of the Medical Research Institute, Alexandria University, 
Egypt. The mice were housed in polyethylene cages  
(5 per cage) under controlled laboratory conditions (25 
±1°C, constant relative humidity (about 50%), and an 
alternating 12 hour dark/light cycle). Food and water were 
provided ad libitum. All mice were allowed to adapt for 
one week before the beginning of the study. 
Tumour induction
Ehrlich ascites carcinoma cells were injected intraper -
itoneally (i.p) into mice. The ascitic fluid was withdrawn 
after 7–10 days from Ehrlich carcinoma (EC)-bearing mice 
[28]. The ascitic fluid containing EAC cells was suspended 
in sterile normal saline solution, and 0.2 ml of the suspen-
sion containing 2.5 million EAC cells was injected subcu-
taneously (s.c) into the mammary fat pad on the upper 
left ventral side of the mice [29]. Trypan blue dye exclu-
sion technique was used to test the viability of EAC cells. 
All steps of EAC cell aspiration and injection were under 
aseptic conditions to avoid contamination. After 10 days 
of tumour induction, solid tumours appeared, confirmed 
using a caliper, and then the therapeutic protocols were 
started [30].
Experimental design
Thirty-five female Swiss albino mice were divided into 
7 groups, with 5 mice in each group. Group1 (control): nor-
mal or healthy mice were injected (i.p) with normal saline 
(0.1 ml/mouse, day, i.p) for 21 days [31]. Group 2 (EST): 
Ehrlich solid tumour-bearing mice were injected (i.p) with 
normal saline (0.1 ml/mouse, day, i.p) for 21 days [20]. 
Group 3 (FA): EST-bearing mice were treated with oral in-
jection of FA (100 mg/kg/day, p.o) for 21 days [32]. Group 
4 (FA-NS): EST-bearing mice were treated with oral injec-
tion of FA-NS (40 mg/kg/day,p.o) for 21 days [33]. Group 
5 (DOX): EST-bearing mice were treated with i.p injection 
of DOX (2 mg/ kg/day, i.p) for 21 days [34]. Group 6 (FA + 
DOX): EST-bearing mice were treated with a combination 
of oral injection of FA (100 mg/kg/day) and (i.p.) injection 
of DOX (2 mg/kg/day, i.p) for 21 days. Group 7 (FA-NS + 
DOX): EST-bearing mice were treated with a combination 
of oral injection of FA-NS (40 mg/kg/day) and (i.p.) injec-
tion of DOX (2 mg/kg/day, i.p.) for 21 days.
At the end of the experiment, mice were euthanised 
by ether inhalation [35], and blood samples were collect-
ed from the orbital sinus. Blood samples were centrifuged 
at 3000 rpm for 10 minutes. Serum was separated and 
stored at –80
oC until analysis. Solid tumours and organs 
(heart, liver, and kidneys) were removed. Solid tumours 
were weighed, cleaned in normal saline, and then divided 
into 2 parts; the first part was stored at –80
oC for DNA ex-
amination, and the second part was fixed in 10% formalin 
solution to be ready for histopathological and immunohis-
tochemical investigation [36].
Tumour assessment
At the end of the experiment, the weight of the dissec- 
ted solid tumours was determined using a digital scale.
Estimation of AKT, Beclin-1, and LC3-II by 
quantitative real­time polymerase chain reaction 
RNA extraction from solid tumour tissues was per -
formed using RNeasy® Mini Kit (QIAGEN GmbH, QIAGEN 
Strasse 1, 40724 Hilden, GERMANY , Catalogue no. 74104), 
following the manufacturer’s protocols. cDNA was synthe-
sised from extracted RNA using a RevertAid First Strand 
cDNA Synthesis Kit (Thermo Fischer Scientific Inc., USA, 
Catalogue no. K1622), following the manufacturer’s proto-
cols. The resulting cDNA was mixed with AKT, Beclin-1, and 
LC3-II primers (Table 2) using Maxima SYBER Green quan-
titative polymerase chain reaction Master Mix (Thermo 
Fischer Scientific Inc., USA, Catalogue no. K0251), follow-
ing the manufacturer’s protocols. AKT, Beclin-1, and LC3-II 
gene expressions were analysed by quantitative real-time 
polymerase chain reaction. Quantitative real-time poly-
merase chain reaction amplification was performed under 
the following thermal cycling conditions: initial denatur -
ation at 95oC for 10 min, then denaturation at 95oC for 15 s 
repeated for 40 cycles, then annealing with primer at 60oC

for 30 s, then extension at 72 oC for 30 s. All experiments 
were repeated 3 times. Relative gene expression levels 
of Beclin-1, AKT, and LC3-II were compared to β-actin as 
a house-keeping gene. Then the cycle threshold data were 
calculated using the 2−ΔΔCt method [37].
Estimation of caspase­3, vascular endothelial 
growth factor receptor 2, total antioxidant 
capacity, and malondialdehyde 
The level of caspase-3 was measured by using a mouse 
caspase-3 ELISA kit (My BioSource, Inc., USA, Catalogue 
no. MBS733100). The level of vascular endothelial VEG-
FR-2 was measured by using a Mouse VEGFR-2 ELISA kit 
from (Fine Biotech Co., Ltd, Wuhan, China, Catalogue no. 
EM1445). The level of TAC was measured by using a mouse 
TAC ELISA kit (My BioSource, Inc., USA, Catalogue no. 
MBS733680). The level of MDA was measured by using 
a MDA Colorimetric Assay Kit (TBA method) (Elabscience, 
Catalogue no. E-BC-K025-M). Each procedure was per -
formed according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
Estimation of troponin­1  and creatine kinase­MB
The level of Tn1 was measured by using a Mouse Tro-
ponin-1 ELISA kit from (Abcam, China, Catalogue no. 
ab285235), and the level of CK-MB was measured by using 
a Mouse CK-MB ELISA kit from (Novus bio, Catalogue no. 
NBP2-75312), following the manufacturer’s instructions.
Estimation of creatinine and urea
The level of creatinine was measured using the Mouse 
Creatinine kit obtained from (Crestal Chem, Inc., USA, Cata-
logue no. 80350), and the level of urea was measured using 
a colorimetric detection kit (Invitrogen; Thermo Fisher Scien-
tific, Inc., USA, Pub. no. MAN0025406), following the manu-
facturer’s instructions.
Estimation of alanine transaminase and aspartate 
transaminase 
The levels of ALT and AST were measured by using com-
mercial kits according to the method of Bergmeyer et al., 
1980 and Bergmeyer et al., 1976, respectively [38].
Immunohistochemical analysis
The immunohistochemical technique in tumour sec-
tions was investigated according to the method described 
by [39]. Briefly, 4-μm-thick paraffin sections were prepared, 
deparaffinised by xylene, rehydrated in graded alcohols, 
then washed with distilled water. After washing with dis-
tilled water, deactivation of endogenous peroxidase was 
performed using 3% H
2O2 in absolute methanol for 5 min 
at 4°C. After washing with phosphate buffer saline (PBS), 
the nonspecific reaction was blocked with 10% normal 
blocking serum for 60 min at room temperature. Then, 
the primary antibody (polyclonal antibody against VEGFR 
[BioGenex, USA, catalogue no. AR483–5R]) was incubat-
ed at 4°C overnight. After washing with PBS, the sections 
were incubated with biotin-conjugated goat anti-rabbit 
IgG antiserum (Histofine kit, Nichirei Corporation) for  
60 min. Then they were washed in PBS, followed by incu-
bation with streptavidin-peroxidase conjugate (Histofine 
kit, Nichirei Corporation) for 30 min. The streptavidin-bi-
otin complex was visualised with 3, 3′-diaminobenzidine 
tetrahydrochloride (DAB)-H
2O2 solution, pH 7.0, for 3 min. 
Then sections were washed in distilled water, and Mayer’s 
haematoxylin was used as a counterstain. For the quan-
titative histomorphometric analysis, original micrographs 
were captured from the immunostained slides (10 random 
fields from each section, ×100 by a digital camera [Leica 
EC3, Leica, Germany]) connected to a microscope (Leica 
DM500). The percentage areas of the immunostaining re-
action were counted in each of the examined fields by us-
ing ImageJ software (v1.46r, NIH, Bethesda, MD, USA) [40].
Histopathological investigation and scoring system
After anaesthetising by ether inhalation, the animals 
were euthanised by cervical dislocation. Tumours, livers, 
heart, and kidneys were surgically removed and flushed 
with PBS (pH 7.4), fixed in 4% PFA dissolved in PBS, for  
48 hours. The fixed specimens were processed by the con-
ventional paraffin embedding technique including dehy-
dration through ascending grades of ethanol, clearing in  
3 changes of xylene and melted paraffin, and ended by em-
bedding in paraffin wax at 65°C. Four-μm-thick sections were 
stained by haematoxylin and eosin (HE), as previously de-
scribed by Bancroft and Layton [41]. In each excised tumour, 
the semi-quantitative scoring of necrosis was assessed in 
10 random fields (40×). The scoring scale ranged 1–4: Score 
1 – about 10% necrosis was shown in poorly differentiated 
neoplasm; Score 2 – about 25% necrosis was shown in poor-
ly differentiated neoplasm; Score 3 – about 35% necrosis 
was shown in poorly differentiated neoplasm; and Score 4 – 
more than 50% necrosis was shown in poorly differentiated 
neoplasm. The mean value of all scores (10 fields/tumour 
sample) was recorded, analysed, and expressed as the mean 
of the necrosis scale ± S.E. In relation to histopathological 
lesion scores in kidney, heart, and liver, semiquantitative 
scoring of renal and hepatic lesions was calculated accord-
ing to [42]. Briefly, lesions in 10 fields chosen randomly from 
each slide for each rat were obtained and averaged. The le-
sions were scored in a blinded way (score scale: 0 = normal;  
1 ≤ 25%; 2 = 26–50%; 3 = 51–75%; and 4 = 76–100%).
Results
Tumour weight 
As expected, the EST group showed the highest in-
crease in tumour weight (g), whereas all treated groups 
including FA (1.89 ±0.69), FA-NS (1.16 ±0.39), and DOX 
(1.45 ±0.65) showed a significant reduction in tumour 
weight compared to the EST (4.84 ±0.69) group. Further -
more, the combination groups FA + DOX (0.96 ±0.095) and 
FA-NS + DOX (0.66 ±0.16) showed a more significant reduc-
tion in tumour weight compared to the EST (4.84 ±0.69) 
group. Moreover, the FA-NS (1.16 ±0.39) and FA-NS + DOX 
(0.66 ±0.16) groups showed a notable reduction in tumour 
weight compared to the FA (1.89 ±0.69) and FA + DOX 
(0.96 ±0.095) groups (Figure 1).

Enhanced antitumour efficacy of ferulic acid nanoparticles in combination with doxorubicin – a promising strategy for breast cancer 
treatment 
Particle size and zeta potential measurement
Different FA-NSs were prepared from various combina-
tions of PVA, tween 80, and SLS, as illustrated in Table 1. 
Particle size, PDI, and zeta potential values were assessed. 
The obtained particle size distribution and PDI values are 
shown in Figures 2 and 3. Ferulic acid-NS 4 (3 mg/ml, FA) 
showed the smallest monomodal particle size of 155.30 
±3.32 nm, PDI of 0.146 ±0.002, and a negative zeta poten-
tial of –46.90 ±4.26 mV . Upon increasing the drug concen-
tration into 10 mg/ml in FA-NS 5, particle size recorded 
180.65 ±5.40 nm, PDI of 0.153 ±0.004, and a zeta potential 
of –57.50 ±1.97 mV reflecting an insignificant change in 
particle size profile and potentiality to form stable NS.
Drug content homogeneity 
An evaporation filtration method was used to evaluate 
the DCH%. Samples were analysed using spectrophoto-
metric assay. The prepared FA-NS 5 achieved a drug load-
ing of 95.27% ±6.47.
Stability of ferulic acid nano suspension
A 2-month stability study was followed to assess the sta-
bility of FA-NS 5. The selected formulation was tested for 
particle size, PDI, zeta potential values and DCH%. As shown 
in Figure 4, FA-NS 5 maintained its monomodal particle size 
distribution and PDI values without significant difference 
from fresh formulations throughout two months of storage 
at 2–8°C. Besides, FA-NS 5 kept its negative zeta potential 
at –60.30 ±1.74 mV and its DCH% at 92.49% ±5.35. 
At the end of physicochemical properties tests, FA-NS  
5 was selected as the optimum formulation for further 
characterisation due to homogenous particle size distribu-
tion and higher drug loading.

Effect of different treatments on AKT, Beclin-1, 
and LC3-II expression levels  
The AKT expression significantly increased in the EST 
group compared to the control group. On the other hand, all 
the treatment groups, including FA, FA-NS, and DOX, as well 
as the combination groups, showed a significant reduction 
in the AKT expression compared to the EST group. Further-
more, the combination of FA in normal formulation (FA) 
and the nano formula (FA-NS) with DOX showed the most 
significant decrease in AKT expression levels compared to 
the EST group. Interestingly, the nano formula of FA (FA-NS)

levels compared to all other groups (Figure 5A).
Regarding Beclin-1 and LC3-II expressions, EST group 
showed a significant reduction in Beclin-1 but comparable 
in LC3-II as compared to control group, whereas the com-
bination groups FA + DOX and FA-NS + DOX showed a sig-
nificant elevation in Beclin-1 and LC3-II expressions when 
compared to EST group. Furthermore, the nano formula 
of FA (FA-NS) with DOX group showed a significant in-
crease in Beclin-1 expression only when compared to all 
other groups (Figures 5B, C).
Effect of different treatments on caspase­3, 
vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2,  
and malondialdehyde levels
The caspase-3 levels significantly decreased in the EST 
group compared to the control group. These levels signifi-
cantly increased in the FA-NS-treated group compared to 
the FA group and EST group, whereas the combination 
groups FA + DOX and FA-NS + DOX showed a significant el-
evation in caspase-3 levels compared to the EST group and 
other treated groups. Moreover, the nano formula of FA 
(FA-NS) with DOX showed a greater increase in caspase-3 
levels compared to all other groups. This increase made 
a nonsignificant difference in caspase-3 levels between 
the FA-NS + DOX group and the control group (Figure 6A).
On the other hand, the EST group showed a significant 
increase in VEGFR-2 and MDA levels compared to the con-
trol group. All the treatment groups, including FA, FA-NS, 
and DOX, as well as the combination groups, showed

FA + DOX and FA-NS + DOX showed the most significant

group. Furthermore, the nano formula of FA (FA-NS) with 
DOX group showed a significant reduction in MDA levels 
compared to all other groups (Figures 6B, C).
Effect of different treatments of on total antioxidant ca-
pacity, troponin-1, and creatine kinase-MB levels
The total antioxidant capacity levels significantly de-
creased in the EST group compared to the control group, 
whereas the combination groups FA + DOX and FA-NS  
+ DOX showed a significant elevation in TAC levels compared 
to the EST group. Moreover, the combination of the nano for-
mula of FA (FA-NS) with DOX showed the most significant 
increase in TAC levels compared to all other groups. This 
significant elevation made a nonsignificant difference in TAC 
levels between the FA-NS + DOX group and the control group 
(Figure 7A). The troponin-1 and CK-MB levels significantly 
increased in the EST group compared to the control group. 
The DOX-treated group showed the highest increase in Tn1 
and CK-MB levels compared to all other groups. Moreover, 
the combination of FA in the normal formulation (FA) and 
the nano formulation (FA-NS) with DOX showed a significant 
decrease in Tn1 levels compared to the DOX-treated group, 
so the combination treatment can reduce DOX-induced car-
diotoxicity. In addition, the combination groups FA + DOX 
and FA-NS + DOX showed a notable reduction in CK-MB  
levels compared to the DOX-treated group (Figures 7B, C).
Effect of different treatments on alanine 
transaminase and aspartate transaminase levels
The EST group showed the highest increase in ALT 
and AST levels compared to the control and other treat-
ed groups. However, these levels were significantly de-
creased in all treated groups compared to the EST group. 
Additionally, the combination groups FA + DOX and  
FA-NS + DOX showed a reduction in ALT levels compared 
to the DOX-treated group, with a significant reduction 
in the FA-NS + DOX group. Furthermore, AST levels were 
increased in the DOX group compared to other treated 
groups. The combination groups FA + DOX and FA-NS + 
DOX showed a significant reduction in AST levels com-
pared to the DOX-treated group, with a more significant 
reduction in the FA-NS + DOX group, so the combination 
treatment can reduce DOX-induced hepatoxicity (Table 3).
Effect of different treatments on creatinine  
and urea levels
The creatinine and urea levels were significantly in-
creased in the EST group compared to the control group. 
304
contemporary oncology
The doxorubicin-treated group showed the highest in-
crease in creatinine and urea levels compared to the con-
trol, EST , and other treated groups. The combination 
groups FA + DOX and FA-NS + DOX showed a significant 
reduction in creatinine levels compared to the DOX-treat-
ed group, with a more significant reduction in the FA-NS  
+ DOX group. This reduction made a non-significant dif-
ference in creatinine levels compared to the control group. 
Concerning urea levels, the combination of FA with DOX 
showed a significant reduction in urea levels compared to 
the DOX-treated group, so the combination treatment can 
reduce DOX-induced nephrotoxicity (Table 3).
Immunohistochemical findings
The expression of VEGFR-2 was estimated in the excised 
mammary tumour. The Ehrlich solid tumour group showed 
the highest expression of VEGFR-2 (Figure 8A). On the  
other hand, EST mice treated with FA and FA-NS revealed 
lower VEGFR-2 distribution than EST (Figures 8B, C). More-
over, EST mice treated with DOX, FA + DOX and FA-NS + DOX 
exposed the lowest VEGFR-2 distribution among all groups 
(Figures 8D–F). The nonparametric quantitative analysis 
for the area percentage of VEGFR-2 revealed a marked high 
expression in EST-treated mice compared to FA, FA-NS, 
DOX, FA + DOX, and FA-NS + DOX (Figure 8G). 
Histopathological findings
Histopathological examination of solid mammary tu-
mour excised from EST , FA, FA-NS, DOX, FA + DOX, and NS. 
Ferulic acid + DOX-treated (Figures 9A–F) mice showed 
circumscribed nodules of poorly differentiated viable and 
necrotic pleomorphic neoplastic cells. The viable neoplastic 
cells appeared with large hyperchromatic nucleus, prom-
inent nucleolus, anisonucleosis, and bipolar to multipolar 
mitotic division. The semi-quantitative scoring of necro-
sis in each excised tumour exhibited significant elevation 
of necrosis area score in all treated groups compared with 
the EST group (Figure 9G).
The biosafety and biocompatibility of nanohybrids 
were examined in the liver and kidney tissues. No tumour 
cells could be seen in the negative control liver and kid-
neys (Figures 10A, 11A). Pleomorphic, hyperchromatic, 
metastatic tumour cells were seen infiltrating the liver 
tissues of the EST group. Also, Kupffer cell activation was 
noticeable in all treated groups: FA, FA-NS, DOX, FA + DOX, 
and FA-NS + DOX; however, comparable histopathologic

Enhanced antitumour efficacy of ferulic acid nanoparticles in combination with doxorubicin – a promising strategy for breast cancer 
treatment 
characterization of malignant cells was seen with various 
degrees of invasion, particularly for the FA-NS + FA group, 
which showed only a few abnormal mitotic figures of he-
patocytes (Figures 10B–G). The semi-quantitative scoring 
of metastatic tumour in each liver exhibited significant 
reduction of metastatic tumour area score in all treated 
groups compared with the EST group (Figure 10H).
Metastatic tumorous invasion was not found in the kid-
neys of the untreated EST group; nevertheless, the kidneys 
exhibited severe perivascular and periglomerular aggrega-
tions of chronic inflammatory cells, primarily lymphocytes. 
In addition, renal tubular epithelium showed mild degen-
erative and necrotic alterations as well as an atrophied 
glomerulus (Figure 11B). However, animals given FA, FA-NS, 
DOX, FA + DOX and FA-NS + DOX displayed comparable 
histopathologic features with varying degrees of inflam-
matory infiltration, degenerative alterations, and necrotic 
changes (Figures 11C–G). The semi-quantitative scoring 
of lymphocytic infiltration in each kidney exhibited signif-
icant elevation of lymphocytic infiltration area score in all 
treated groups compared with the EST group (Figure 11H).
In the heart, the EST group showed hyalinisation and cyto-
lysis of myofibers, and perivascular infiltration of mononu-
clear chronic inflammatory cells (Figure 12B). However, the FA 
and NS. Ferulic acid groups revealed moderate interfibrillar 
infiltration of pleomorphic mononuclear chronic inflammato-
ry cells with extensive to moderate degeneration of cardiac 
myocytes (Figures 12C, D). The doxorubicin group showed 
myocytolysis and interfibrillar oedema with minimal inter-
fibrillar infiltration of pleomorphic mononuclear chronic 
inflammatory cells’ extensive disruption and degeneration 
of myocardiac bundles and mononuclear inflammatory infil-
tration (Figure 12E). The ferulic acid + DOX group displayed 
moderate disruption and degeneration of myocardiac bun-
dles and some mononuclear inflammatory infiltration (Fig-
ure 12F). The FA-NS + DOX group displayed similar cardiac ar-
chitecture as seen in the negative control group (Figure 12G). 
The semi-quantitative scoring of lymphocytic infiltration and 
myocytolysis in each heart exhibited significant elevation 
of lymphocytic infiltration and myocytolysis area score in all 
treated groups compared with the EST group (Figure 12H).
Discussion
Breast cancer is the most common malignancy in wo-
men and the leading cause of cancer death among women 
in the world. Treatment of BC comprises surgery, radiation, 
and chemotherapy [43]. Doxorubicin is a first-line che-
motherapeutic drug for BC treatment. However, the seri-
ous side effects of DOX limit its clinical use [44]. Natural 
compounds play a great role in the prevention and treat-
ment of BC and can also reduce the side effects related to 
the administration of chemotherapy [45]. Previous studies 
reported that FA has several biological activities including 
antioxidant, anti-inflammatory [46], and anticancer [47].
Nano suspensions are a 2-phase dispersion contain-
ing pure crystalline drug particles dispersed in a suitable 
aqueous medium and stabilised by surfactants. Funda-
mentally, NSs have addressed the challenges of poor sol-
ubility and bioavailability associated with hydrophobic 
compounds [22]. The formation of nanosized particles 
leads to increased surface area, which in turn enhances 
dissolution rates and subsequently improves the drug’s 
bioavailability [48]. As a carrier-free particulate system, 
NS offers significant potential for sustained drug release, 
superior efficacy, reduced toxicity, and lower first-pass me-

Enhanced antitumour efficacy of ferulic acid nanoparticles in combination with doxorubicin – a promising strategy for breast cancer 
treatment 
tabolism [48]. Given these advantages, NSs were selected 
as a promising nanomedicine delivery system to enhance 
the anticancer activity of FA. The formulation of NSs relies 
on the incorporation of surfactants and stabilisers, with 
minimal use of organic solvents. Surfactants are essen-
tial components because they reduce the interfacial ten-
sion through wetting and/or deflocculating mechanisms, 
which is crucial for the formulation of NSs [49]. Stabilising 
agents, including polymers like PVA and polysorbates (also 
known as Tweens or Spans), can improve the wettability 
of drug nanocrystals. These stabilisers create either steric 
hindrance or ionic barriers, which help prevent Ostwald 
ripening and agglomeration of NS particles. Thus, stabi-
lisers are crucial for maintaining the homogeneity of par -
ticle size and the physical stability of NSs [22]. It is worth 
noting that the selected method of preparation, which in-
volves solvent evaporation, antisolvent precipitation, and 
probe sonication, has eliminated the risk of residual sol-
vent hazards in the final NS preparation.
Particle size distribution and PDI are the most import-
ant parameters in the process of nanosuspension optimi-
sation to reflect the drug’s solubility, stability, and phar -
macological activities [22, 50]. In the current study, various 
FA-NS were prepared using different combinations of PVA, 
tween-80, and SLS. The combination of SLS, tween-80, and 
PVA (1 : 0.5 : 0.5) in FA-NS-4 successfully produced a ho-
mogenous NS with the smallest monomodal particle size 
(110.23 ±4.59, PDI 0.198 ±0.004). This can be explained by 
the fact that the combination of polymeric stabiliser (PVA), 
non-ionic surfactant (tween-80), and SLS provides a pro-
tective coating for the surface of the particles, which plays 
a dual role: preventing crystal growth and reducing particle 
size. Both electrostatic and steric mechanisms contributed 
to this effect [48]. Furthermore, increasing the FA concen-
tration 3–10 mg/ml did not significantly increase the parti-
cle size in FA-NS 5, which was therefore selected as the op-
timum formulation with higher drug loading. 
The zeta potential value offers an estimate of the elec-
tric double layer surrounding the charged particles [51, 52]. 
The electric charge that develops on the particle surface 
initiates electrostatic repulsion between the nanoparticles 
hindering their aggregation and precipitation. Therefore, 
zeta potential is one of the most important factors influ-
encing nanocarriers stability, entrapment efficiency and 
interactions with the biological system in vivo [53–55]. It 
is worth mentioning that when electrostatic stabilisation 
is combined with steric stabilisation (using appropriate 
polymers), a zeta potential of 20 mV could be sufficient to 
prevent the aggregation and precipitation of drug particles 
[22, 56]. Consequently, the obtained zeta potential of FA-NS 
was deemed satisfactory.
NSs offer a greater loading capacity compared to poly-
mer- and lipid-based nanocarriers due to their carrier-free 
nature and high mass per volume ratios. Additionally, NSs 
keep drug particles in a favourable nanosized crystalline 
state, which enhances solubility and overcomes delivery 
issues without the need for actual dissolution [48]. As a re-
sult, the prepared FA-NS 5 achieved a high drug loading 
of 95.27% ±6.47, in line with these advantages.
The stability of nano formulations ensures their safety 
and effectiveness. In the context of drug delivery, the sta-
bility of NSs is a crucial factor [22]. The FA-NS 5 maintained 
its particle size distribution and PDI values consistently 
over a 2-month storage period at 2–8°C without a signifi-
cant difference from fresh formulations. It also retained its 
negative zeta potential at –60.30 ±1.74 mV and its DCH% 
at 92.49% ±5.35, indicating long-term stability. This could 
be attributed to the solid dense state of the formulated 
NS that enhanced resistance to oxidation and hydrolysis, 
improving physical stability against settling. The combina-
tion of polymeric, ionic, and neutral stabilisers in the de-
veloped NS minimised self-repulsion of charged surfactant 
molecules, leading to greater surface coverage and closer 
packing, providing synergetic protection [48]. Overall,  
FA-NS 5 shows promise for further in vivo studies.
In our study, we studied the antitumour activity of FA 
alone and in combination with DOX. Also, we investi-
gated the ability of FA to reduce DOX-induced different 
toxicities. Moreover, we compared the effects of FA-NS 
with FA alone and in combination with DOX. According 
to our study, EST-bearing mouse groups treated with FA  
(p < 0.01) showed a significant reduction in tumour weight 
compared to the EST group, reflecting its antitumour ac-
tivity [57]. Also, the DOX-treated group (p < 0.001) demon-
strated a significant reduction in tumour weight compared 
to the EST group confirming its antitumour activity [58]. 
The combination groups (p < 0.001) showed a more sig-
nificant reduction in tumour weight, indicating the ability 
of FA to potentiate the antitumour activity of DOX. Ad-
ditionally, groups treated with FA-NS and FA-NS + DOX 
showed a notable reduction in tumour weight compared 
to the FA and FA + DOX groups, indicating the capacity 
of FA nano formulation to promote the pharmacological 
effects [59]. In our study, we studied the antitumour mech-
anisms of FA, including inhibition of proliferation and an-
giogenesis, induction of autophagy, apoptosis, and reduc-
tion of oxidative stress.
The PI3K/AKT signalling pathway that regulates cell 
growth, proliferation, and survival is considered one 
of the most important pathways that is hyperactivated in 
many types of cancer, so it can be used as a target for anti-
cancer drugs [60]. PI3K/AKT pathway inhibition by FA treat-
ment is mediated by induction of G0/G1 phase arrest and 
cell death through the downregulation of expression of cy-
clin-dependent kinases such as CDK2, CDK4, and CDK6, 
which are cell-cycle-related proteins involved in cell cycle 
progression and hyperactivated in many cancers  [61], or 
by the  upregulation of expression of  tumour suppressor 
proteins, such as p53 and p21, leading to cell proliferation 
inhibition [62]. According to our results, treatment with FA 
(p < 0.001) and FA-NS (P<0.001) significantly decreased 
AKT levels compared to the EST group, with the best im-
pact for the combination treated groups, especially the  
FA-NS + DOX (p < 0.001) group. This was in agreement with 
a previous study that reported that FA inhibited the prolif-
eration of HeLa and Caski human cervical carcinoma cells 
by downregulation of AKT expression levels through block-
ade of the PI3K/AKT pathway [63].

Regarding autophagy, it is a natural degradation mech-
anism for the clearance of damaged intracellular compo-
nents in response to several types of stress such as nutrient 
deficiency and oxidative stress to keep cellular homeostasis 
[64]. Autophagy induction stimulates the autophagy media-
tors such as Beclin-1 and LC3-II. Beclin-1 is needed for pha-
gophore formation and LC3-II for phagophore elongation, 
resulting in the formation of autophagosomes in which 
the cytoplasmic components are engulfed and fused with 
lysosome to form autolysosomes, which become ready for 
degradation leading to tumour suppression [65]. Our re-
sults presented that the levels of Beclin-1 and LC3-II were 
increased in mono-treated groups compared to the EST 
group. Whereas the combination of FA and FA-NS with DOX 
(p < 0.001) showed a significant increase in Beclin-1 and 
LC3-II levels. In agreement with our study, a previous study 
reported that FA can induce autophagy in hepatocellular 
carcinoma cells by increasing the levels of autophagy bio-
markers including Beclin-1 and LC3-II [66].
Apoptosis is a programmed cell death that keeps balance 
between cell growth and cell death. Any defect occurring in 
this balance causes abnormal cell growth, leading to the oc-
currence of cancers [67]. The apoptosis induction is mediat-
ed by the upregulation of apoptotic proteins and downreg-
ulation of anti-apoptotic proteins. Ferulic acid upregulates 
the expression of the tumour suppressor gene p53, which 
activates the pro-apoptotic BAX and downregulates expres-
sion of the antiapoptotic Bcl-2 [68]. Therefore, the elevated 
BAX levels along with activated caspase-3 and decreased 
Bcl-2 levels after FA treatment lead to induction of apop-
tosis and cell death [69].According to our results, FA-NS  
(p < 0.01) alone showed a significant increase in caspase-3 
levels compared to the FA group and EST group, with 
the most significant elevation in the combination groups 
(p < 0.001) compared to the EST group, especially the   
FA-NS + DOX group, which showed a non-significant differ-
ence compared to the control group. Furthermore, the FA-NS 
and FA-NS + DOX groups demonstrated a notable increase 
in caspase-3 levels compared to the FA and FA + DOX groups. 
In agreement with our study, a previous study determined 
that FA can promote apoptosis through caspase-3 upregu-
lation in human prostate cancer cell line [70].
On the other hand, angiogenesis is the process by 
which the malignant cells receive their oxygen and nutri-
ent requirements from the newly created blood vessels to 
survive and proliferate. Vascular endothelial growth factor 
receptor 2 is one of the most important growth factors that 
regulates angiogenesis. Therefore, angiogenesis inhibition 
by downregulation of VEGFR-2 leads to tumour suppres-
sion [71]. Regarding our results, groups treated with FA and 
FA-NS (p < 0.001) significantly decreased VEGFR-2 levels 
compared to the EST group, whereas the most significant 
reduction was seen in the combination groups (p < 0.001). 
Moreover, the FA-NS and FA-NS + DOX groups showed 
a greater reduction in VEGFR-2 levels than the FA and FA + 
DOX groups. These results were further confirmed by im-
munohistochemical expression of VEGFR-2. Furthermore, 
our results were confirmed by a previous study that re-
ported that FA inhibited angiogenesis in the chick embryo 
chorioallantoic membrane model through the downregu-
lation of VEGFR-2 expression [72].
Oxidative stress is an excessive production of ROS. 
The imbalance between ROS and antioxidants leads to 
carcinogenesis [73]. This was confirmed in our study by 
the increase in MDA level in the EST group, which is a bio-
marker of lipid peroxidation [74], whereas the TAC level was 
decreased in the EST group, reflecting the failure in the an-
tioxidant defence mechanism. On the other hand, the ad-
ministration of FA (p < 0.05) and FA-NS (p < 0.01) alone 
and in combination with DOX (p < 0.001) significantly de-
creased MDA levels, with the greatest impact in the FA-NS 
+ DOX group. Total antioxidant capacity levels significantly 
increased in the combination groups (p < 0.001) compared 
to the EST group, with the greatest impact in the FA-NS 
+ DOX group, which showed a non-significant difference 
compared to the control group. Moreover, the FA-NS + DOX 
(p < 0.001) group significantly decreased MDA and signifi-
cantly increased TAC levels compared to FA + DOX, leading 
to a reduction in oxidative stress levels and an elevation 
in the TAC in EST-treated mice to maintain the balance 
between ROS and antioxidants. Our results agreed with 
a previous study that reported that FA decreases oxidative 
stress in formaldehyde-induced hepatotoxicity [75].
Doxorubicin is an effective anticancer drug in various 
types of cancers, but its clinical use is limited because it 
causes different organ toxicities including cardiotoxicity, 
hepatotoxicity, and nephrotoxicity [76]. 
 During DOX therapy, there is an overproduction of ROS 
that made the myocardium under oxidative stress, leading 
to cardiomyopathy [77]. In our study, DOX-induced cardio-
toxicity was indicated by the significant elevation of Tn1 
and CK-MB levels in the DOX (p < 0.001)-treated group 
compared to the control group. The combination of FA and 
FA-NS with DOX (p < 0.001) significantly decreased Tn1 
level and reduced the CK-MB level compared to the DOX 
group. Our results were confirmed by the study that re-
ported that the efficacy of FA and its nano formulation in 
reducing cardiotoxicity in isoproterenol induced myocardi-
al injury in rats by decreasing Tn1 and CK-MB levels [78]. 
Histopathological effects of DOX on the heart, including 
lysis of cardiac myocytes and infiltration of mononuclear 
chronic inflammatory cells, were significantly reversed in 
combination groups compared to the DOX-treated group 
[79]. These results reflect the cardioprotective effect of FA 
against DOX-induced cardiotoxicity.
 The toxic effect of DOX on liver occurs mainly by oxidative 
stress that leads to hepatocytes damage, resulting in leak-
age of liver enzymes such as ALT and AST [80]. In our study, 
the combination of FA-NS with DOX (p < 0.01) significant-
ly reduced the elevated levels of ALT compared to the DOX 
group. Furthermore, the combination groups FA + DOX  
(p < 0.01) and FA-NS + DOX (p < 0.001) significantly decreased 
AST levels compared to the DOX-treated group. These results 
were confirmed by a study that suggested the hepatoprotec-
tive effect of FA against carbon tetrachloride-induced hep-
atotoxicity in rats [81]. Additionally, hepatic tissue showed 
pleomorphic, hyperchromatic, metastatic tumour cells and 
Kupffer cell activation, but these histopathological findings 
313
Enhanced antitumour efficacy of ferulic acid nanoparticles in combination with doxorubicin – a promising strategy for breast cancer 
treatment 
were significantly reduced by the administration of FA and 
FA-NS with DOX compared to the DOX-treated group.
Doxorubicin-induced nephrotoxicity is mainly caused 
by excessive ROS production that induces apoptosis in 
the kidney, leading to increased glomerular capillary per -
meability and glomerular atrophy, elevating the levels 
of urea and creatinine [82]. In our study, the combina-
tion of FA with DOX significantly reduced the high levels 
of urea (p < 0.001) and creatinine (p < 0.01) compared 
to the DOX-treated group, with a more significant reduc-
tion of creatinine levels only in the FA-NS + DOX group  
(p < 0.001) when compared to the DOX group. Our findings 
were confirmed by a previous study that approved the ne-
phroprotective effect of FA in cisplatin-induced nephro-
toxicity in rats [83]. Furthermore, these results were con-
firmed by histopathological investigation of kidney tissue 
that showed significant reduction in inflammatory infiltra-
tion and degenerative alterations.
Although the study emphasises the potential of FA-NS 
in reducing the toxicities of DOX, there are several key 
challenges for the clinical translation of nanosuspensions: 
Scalability and manufacturing: while nanosuspensions 
have shown promising results in preclinical studies, scal-
ing up the production to meet clinical demands poses sig-
nificant challenges. Issues such as maintaining uniform 
particle size distribution and ensuring batch-to-batch con-
sistency are critical for clinical application [84]. 
Stability and shelf-life: strategies to maintain stability, 
such as the use of stabilisers and optimised storage con-
ditions, and the need for extensive stability testing during 
the development phase are critical [85, 86]. 
Pharmacokinetics and biodistribution: The unique 
properties of nanosuspensions can alter the pharmacoki-
netics and biodistribution of their payload. Thus, the im-
portance of conducting detailed pharmacokinetic studies 
to understand these changes and to ensure that the ther-
apeutic benefits are not offset by unintended side effects 
cannot be neglected [84]. 
Regulatory and safety considerations: The translation 
of nanosuspensions into clinical practice requires rigorous 
regulatory approval [87, 88]. 
There is a serious need for comprehensive preclinical 
and clinical studies to meet the safety and efficacy stan-
dards set by regulatory agencies. Additionally, potential 
challenges in obtaining regulatory approval due to the no-
velty of the technology should be addressed.
Conclusions
Our study demonstrated the antitumour activity of FA 
in an EST model. Ferulic acid exerts its antitumour activity 
by inhibition of angiogenesis and proliferation and induc-
tion of autophagy and apoptosis. Interestingly, co-adminis-
tration of FA with DOX potentiated the antitumour activity 
of DOX but also reduced DOX-induced cardiotoxicity, hep-
atotoxicity, and nephrotoxicity; especially FA nanosuspen-
sion showed more significant results.
