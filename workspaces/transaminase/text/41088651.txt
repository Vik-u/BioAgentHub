Abstract 
The aim of this study was to investigate the clinical value of the platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR) in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and 
the effects of Xin’an Jianpi Tongbi Formulation (XAJPF) [containing Xinfeng Capsule (XFC) and Huangqinqingrechubi Capsule 
(HQC)] on the Self-Perception of Patient (SPP) – a multidimensional construct encompassing patient-reported outcomes and 
traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) syndrome evaluations – and laboratory indices in patients with RA. A cohort study design 
was used, and the study data were obtained from RA patients admitted to the Department of Rheumatology of the First Affiliated 
Hospital of Anhui University of Traditional Chinese Medicine from February 2024 to March 2025. General information (gender, 
age, BMI, disease duration, co-morbidities), PLR (platelets/Lymphocyte), laboratory indicators [mean platelet volume (MPV), 
platelet distribution width (PDW), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), rheumatoid factor (RF), hypersensitive C-reactive protein 
(hs-CRP), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate transaminase (AST), serum creatinine (Scr), blood urea nitrogen (BUN)], 
and SPP indicators were collected through the medical record system. The SPP scales included the MOS item short from 
health survey (SF-36), visual analogue scale (VAS), Self-Rating Anxiety scale (SAS), Self-Rating Depression scale (SDS), Chinese 
medicine evidence scores (cold-dampness syndrome [CDS], syndrome of dampness-heat [SDH], syndrome of blood stasis [SBS], 
and syndrome of dampness stagnancy due to spleen deficiency [SDSSD]). Correlation analysis was used to study the correlation 
between PLR and laboratory indicators and SPP indicators. Binary Logistics regression models were used to assess the risk and 
protective factors for SPP changes in RA patients. Mediation analysis was used to investigate the mediating role that PLR acted 
as in the improvement of SPP by XAJPF. Association rule analysis was used to explore the association of PLR reduction with other 
laboratory indices and SPP improvement, as well as the association of XAJPF treatment with improvement in SPP indices and 
laboratory indices in RA patients. Finally, subgroup analyses were used to observe the effects of different exposure levels on SPP 
indicators and laboratory indicators in RA patients. The results of correlation analysis showed a significant negative correlation 
between PLR and BP , VT, SF, and MH, and a significant positive correlation with VAS, Chinese patient-eported activity index with 
rheumatoid arthritis (CPRI-RA), SAS, SDS, SDH, and SDSSD. There were 183 and 185 RA patients in the non-exposed (XAJPF 
Unused) and exposed groups (XAJPF Used), respectively. Compared with pretreatment, the levels of PF, RP , BP , GH, VT, SF, RE 
and MH increased and the levels of VAS, CPRI-RA, SAS, SDS, CDS, SDH, SDSSD and SBS decreased in both groups after 
treatment. The levels of PLR, MPV, PDW, ESR, RF and hs-CRP in laboratory indices were decreased. Liver and kidney function 
parameters remained within the normal range despite transient, statistically significant increases in alanine aminotransferase (ALT) 
and aspartate transaminase (AST). In addition, the improvements in PF, RP , BP , VT, RE, MH, VAS, CPRI-RA, SAS, SDS, CDS, SDH, 
SDSSD, and SBS were significantly greater in the exposed group than in the non-exposed group. Inflammatory markers (hs-CRP , 
ESR, RF, PLR) improved similarly in both groups. Binary logistic regression analysis showed that use of XAJPF was a protective

factor for improvement in GH, VT, SF, RE, and SDSSD, and improvement in PLR was a protective factor for improvement in PF, 
GH, VT, SDS, and SDSSD. In the mediation analysis, PLR and XAJPF played a partial mediating role in improving GH and VT, 
and a complete mediating role in improving SDSSD. Association rule analysis showed that PLR reduction was associated with 
improvement in other laboratory indicators and SPP indicators, and the application of XAJPF was associated with improvement 
in PF, RP , BP , VT, RE, MH, VAS, CPRI-RA, SAS, SDS, CDS, SDH, SDSSD, SBS, PLR, MPV, PDW, ESR, RF, and hs-CRP Highly 
correlated. Subgroup analyses showed that there were 36 and 149 RA patients in the high-exposure and low-exposure groups, 
respectively, and that compared with the pretreatment period, both groups had elevated levels of PF, RP , BP , GH, VT, SF, RE, and 
MH, and increased levels of VAS, CPRI-RA, SAS, SDS, CDS, SDH, SDSSD, SBS, PLR, MPV, PDW, ESR, and RF, hs-CRP were 
reduced. In addition to this, exploratory analysis suggested that VT, MH, CPRI-RA, SDS, and SDH improved more significantly 
in the high-exposure group compared to the low-exposure group after treatment. However, the smaller sample size of the high-
exposure group (n = 36) necessitates cautious interpretation of these findings. PLR in RA patients is correlated with SPP and 
laboratory parameters. XAJPF treatment can significantly improve SPP indicators. Inflammatory markers improved similarly in both 
XAJPF and control groups. XAJPF may improve VT, GH, and SDSSD partly through reducing PLR. Exploratory analysis suggested 
that high-exposure regimens might offer additional benefits for VT, MH, CPRI-RA, SDS, and SDH, warranting further confirmation.

1. Introduction
Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is an autoimmune disease character-
ized by chronic, symmetrical polyarticular synovitis, with a core 
pathological mechanism of joint and systemic inflammatory 
responses caused by abnormal activation of the immune system, 
ultimately leading to irreversible bone erosion and dysfunction.[1] 
Epidemiological data show that the global prevalence of RA is 
about 0.5% to 1%, the incidence rate of women is 2 to 3 times 
higher than that of men, and the high incidence rate is in the age 
group of 40 to 60 years; the incidence rate in Asia has been on 
the rise in recent years.[2] RA carries a heavy burden of disease, 
with patients not only facing persistent pain, joint deformity and 
disability risk, but also often combined with systemic complica-
tions such as cardiovascular disease and osteoporosis, leading to 
a significant decline in quality of life and increased healthcare 
expenditures.[3] According to the Global Burden of Disease Study 
2021, the disability rate of RA is as high as 30–40 per cent, and 
the risk of unemployment for patients is more than 2 times higher 
than that of healthy people.[4] Current Western medical treatment 
is centered on compliance therapy. The combination of nonste-
roidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), glucocorticosteroids, 
disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs and biologics is effective 
in controlling inflammation and delaying disease progression, but 
there are still significant shortcomings: long-term glucocorticoste-
roids are prone to cause osteoporosis and metabolic abnormali-
ties; the biologics are expensive and some patients are resistant to 
them or at increased risk of infection; and about 30% of patients 
do not respond well to the existing treatments. About 30% of 
patients do not respond well to existing treatments and become 
refractory to RA. [5]Against this background, Chinese medicine 
has shown unique potential in the treatment of RA. The principles 
of “holistic view” and “diagnosis and treatment” of traditional 
Chinese medicine (TCM) provide new ideas for individualized 
treatment of RA, which is especially valuable in improving the 
long-term prognosis of patients.
Xin’an Jianpi Tongbi Formulation (XAJPF) includes Xinfeng 
Capsule (XFC) and Huangqinqingrechubi Capsule (HQC). Both 
are Chinese medicinal preparations from the First Affiliated 
Hospital of Anhui University of Traditional Chinese Medicine. 
Chinese medicine classifies RA as “BiZheng”, and believes that 
its onset is closely related to the attack of wind, cold and damp-
ness, and the internal cause of spleen deficiency and dampness, 
as well as the stasis of veins and collaterals. XFC and HQC are 
developed to address this core disease mechanism. XFC (Anhui 
Pharmaceutical Production Number: Z20050062; Patent 
Number: ZL 2013 1 0011369.8), composed of Astragalus mem-
branaceus, Coicis semen, Tripterygium wilfordii, and centipede, 
is mainly used for the spleen deficiency and dampness, and it 
can be taken into account for phlegm and blood stasis paralysis. 
XFC has been incorporated into the guidelines of the Chinese 
Association of Chinese Medicine Rheumatology (Standard 
No.: T/CACM 1042-2017). [6] HQC (Anhui Pharmaceutical 
Production Number: Z20200001; Patent Number: ZL 2011 
1 0095718.X). It is composed of 5 Chinese medicines, namely, 
Scutellaria baicalensis, Gardenia jasminoides, Radix clematidis, 
Semen coix lacryma, and Peach kernel, and is mainly used for 
the more severe dampness-heat, which can be taken into account 
with blood stasis. We have conducted systematic research on the 
preparation process, quality standard, pharmacodynamics, toxi-
cology, metabolomics and clinical efficacy of XAJPF, confirming 
its safe and controllable quality and significant therapeutic effi -
cacy.[7,8] Mechanisms have also been explored through animal 
and cellular experiments, confirming its protective effects on RA 
patients through various pathways.[9–11]
Self-perception of patient (SPP) is a comprehensive subjective 
evaluation system formed by patients based on their physio -
logical, psychological and social functioning status, which has 
attracted a lot of attention in recent years as a key indicator of 
disease outcome assessment. [12] Its core meaning is to quantify 
the difference between the individual’s expectation and actual 
experience of health status, which comprehensively reflects the 
patient’s ability to adapt in the 3 dimensions of physical health, 
psychological health and social adaptation. The greater the dis-
crepancy, the more significant the negative perception of the

patient’s state and the lower the quality of life. In this study, the 
standardized assessment tool recommended by the International 
Consortium for Health Outcome Measurement (ICHOM) was 
used.[13] Including the MOS item short from health survey (SF-
36),[14] visual analogue scale (VAS), [15] self-rating anxiety scale 
(SAS),[16] Self-rating depression scale (SDS).[17] This study added 
the TCM syndrome score, which comprehensively evaluates 
the integrated sum of 4 syndrome characteristics including 
cold-dampness syndrome (CDS), syndrome of dampness-heat 
(SDH), syndrome of blood stasis (SBS), and syndrome of damp-
ness stage due to spleen deficiency (SDSSD). A multidimensional 
SPP comprehensive evaluation system was constructed. This 
improved scheme not only strengthens the correlation of dis -
ease activity of traditional scales, but also dynamically tracks 
the effects of different TCM evidence on the overall state of 
patients, highlighting the advantages of TCM evidence-based 
treatment. There is a deterioration of SPP in RA patients, as 
evidenced by increased anxiety and depression and a significant 
decrease in quality of life, which is significantly correlated with 
serum inflammatory markers.[18,19] This further demonstrates the 
necessity of integrating patients’ subjective feelings with clinical 
studies.
Platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR) is a composite  
inflammation-related biomarker derived from the routine com -
plete blood count. It quantitatively assesses systemic inflam -
mation and immune imbalance by integrating the counts of 
platelets (active contributors to inflammation [20]) and lympho -
cytes (often depleted in chronic inflammatory states[21]). Beyond 
its convenience, low cost, and high stability, PLR offers a unique 
pathophysiological rationale for RA. It reflects the interplay 
between pro-inflammatory drivers and immune dysregulation, 
core features of RA.[22] Importantly, emerging evidence suggests 
PLR not only correlates with conventional disease activity mea-
sures like DAS-28[23] and is elevated in RA patients compared to 
controls,[24] but may also provide prognostic value and detect 
subclinical inflammation even when traditional acute-phase 
reactants are normal. [25] This makes PLR a promising comple -
mentary biomarker for a multidimensional assessment of RA.
Although studies have now begun to explore the value of 
PLR in RA by linking it to clinical indicators. There are also 
various studies using SPP indicators such as SF-36, SAS, and 
SDS to assess the physiological and psychological conditions 
of patients. However, no study has yet linked PLR with labo -
ratory indicators, SPP, and incorporated TCM evidence points 
into traditional SPP indicators to explore their correlation with 
each other. Our study aimed to reveal the potential association 
between clinical indicators and SPP indicators, and, at the same 
time, to observe the effects of XAJPF on the above indicators in 
RA patients.
2. Materials and methods
2.1. Data sources
Clinical data of patients diagnosed with RA were retrieved 
from the electronic medical record system of the Department 
of Rheumatology of the First Affiliated Hospital of Anhui 
University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Anhui Province, 
China, The diagnostic criteria for RA refer to the latest classi -
fication criteria and scoring system proposed by the American 
College of Rheumatology (ACR) and the European League 
Against Rheumatism (EULAR) in 2010. [26] That is, RA is diag -
nosed when at least 1 joint is swollen and painful with synovi -
tis; arthritis caused by other diseases is also excluded, and there 
are typical radiological manifestations of bone destruction. In 
addition, RA can also be diagnosed by scoring 4 components, 
namely, joint involvement, serological indexes, synovitis dura -
tion, and acute temporal reactants, with a total score of 6 points 
or more. Indicators included in the present study included 
general indicators, laboratory indicators, and SPP indicators. 
General indicators included: age, gender, BMI (weight/height 2), 
co-morbidities, duration of disease, and laboratory included: 
PLR, mean platelet volume (MPV), platelet distribution width 
(PDW), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), hs-CRP, rheu -
matoid factor (RF), ALT, AST, blood urea nitrogen, CERA, 
UA. SPP indicators included: PF, RP, BP, GH, VT, SF, RE, MH, 
Chinese patient-eported activity index with rheumatoid arthritis 
(CPRI-RA), VAS, SAS, SDS, CDS, SDH, SDSSD, SBS.
This study was registered with the International 
Traditional Medicine Clinical Trial Registry Platform 
(ITMCTR) on September 20, 2024 (registration number: 
ITMCTR2024000692). The study followed the Declaration of 
Helsinki, was approved by the Ethics Committee of the First 
Affiliated Hospital of Anhui University of Traditional Chinese 
Medicine (Ethics No. 2024AH-92).
2.2. SPP scale filling and score calculation
Structured interviews, including the TCM syndrome assessment, 
were conducted by 2 clinical researchers. Prior to the study, both 
researchers received joint standardized training on the TCM 
syndrome diagnostic criteria based on the Guiding Principles 
for Clinical Research of New Chinese Medicines and relevant 
guidelines.[6,27,28] To ensure consistency, inter-rater reliability 
was assessed on a subset of 30 patients. The Cohen Kappa for 
primary syndrome diagnosis was 0.78, and the intraclass cor -
relation coefficient (ICC) for syndrome total scores was 0.82, 
indicating substantial to excellent agreement. The interviews 
were conducted on the day of admission and discharge, with 
the informed consent of the patient or his/her legal guardian. 
The researcher explained each item of the scale in layman’s 
terms and instructed the participants to select the correspond -
ing option based on their current experience. In order to ensure 
the quality of data collection, the use of technical terms was 
strictly avoided during the assessment process, and life analo -
gies were used to assist understanding (e.g., “The pain level can 
be compared to the classification of daily headache feelings”). 
After completion of the questionnaire, a 2-person simultaneous 
review process was carried out, and outliers and missing items 
were immediately replaced retrospectively. Finally, the results 
of the survey were entered into the data processing system, 
which was pre-programmed to automatically generate various 
scores, avoiding manual calculations that could lead to incorrect 
estimates.
2.3. Specific content of SPP scale
2.3.1. SF-36. The SF-36 contains 36 entries, Includes 8 
dimensions: GH, PF, RE, MH, RP, BP, SF, VT. Total score for the 
8 dimensions is the total score of this table.
2.3.2. VAS. The VAS is a standardized subjective instrument based 
on the principle of visual-to-numerical conversion, using a 10 cm 
horizontal scale anchored at each end by a score of 0 for “no pain” 
and 10 for “severe intolerable pain.” Two standardized procedures 
were used: firstly, subjects were asked to mark the position of the 
vertical line segments on the scale according to their immediate pain 
experience; secondly, the researcher guided the patient to perform 
the quantification through a structured question (e.g., ‘Which level 
of pain does your current pain level most closely correspond to that 
described by the scale?) The patient was guided to quantify his/her 
assessment. Based on the quantitative results, pain intensity was 
classified into 4 clinical thresholds: asymptomatic (0), mild (1–3), 
moderate (4–6) and severe (7–10).
2.3.3. CPRI-RA. CPRI-RA is a Chinese patient-reported 
clinical outcome scale for RA, which contains a total of 11 
items. Each item was scored 0, 1, 2 and 3 points from no 
symptoms to aggravation of symptoms. Total score calculation

item 8 + 1.17x item 9 + 0.19x item 10 + 0.02x item 11.
2.3.4. SAS and SDS. Both the SAS and SDS contain 20 entries, 
each describing 20 states associated with anxiety/depression. 
Of the 20 entries on the SAS scale, 15 entries used negative 
statements on a scale of 1 to 4, and the remaining 5 entries 
used affirmative statements on a scale of 4 to 1. There were 10 
affirmative and 10 negative statements in the SDS. The scale 
total is the sum of the scores of the 20 entries with a cutoff 
value of 50. The degree of anxiety/depression can be classified 
into the following categories based on the score: 50 to 59: mild 
anxiety/mild depression; 60 to 69: moderate anxiety/moderate 
depression; 70 and above: severe anxiety/depression.
2.3.5. Syndrome of TCM scale. The TCM evidence scale 
quantifies and grades TCM symptoms and signs based on 
established diagnostic criteria from Chinese national guidelines, 
transforming subjective TCM evidence into quantifiable 
data.[6,27,28] The scoring criteria for the syndromes (CDS, SDH, 
SDSSD, SBS) used in this study have been applied in previous 
clinical studies of RA.[29–31] In practical application, we assigned 
different weights to the primary and secondary symptoms/signs 
as per the standard criteria, and assessed the syndrome severity by 
calculating the total score. The higher the score, the more severe 
the patient’s symptoms within that specific syndrome pattern.
2.4. Definition of exposure
In this study, we defined the use of XAJPF as the exposed group, 
where the use of XFC only was considered as low exposure, the 
use of both XFC and HQC was considered as high exposure, 
and the nonuse of any of the above groups of pCms was defined 
as non-exposed group.
2.5. Correlation analysis
A nonparametric measure of rank correlation, the Spearman cor-
relation, was employed to study the statistical dependence between 
the rankings of 2 variables. The Spearman correlation coefficient 
between 2 variables is equivalent to the Pearson correlation coef-
ficient between the rank values of those variables, assessing mono-
tonic relationships (whether linear or not). In this study, Spearman 
correlation analysis was used to explore the correlation between 
PLR, immune inflammation indicators and SPP indicators.
2.6. Logistic regression analysis
Logistic regression models were used to predict protective fac -
tors and risk factors for SPP indicators. Models were adjusted for 
age, gender, disease duration, and baseline values of the respec-
tive outcome variable to control for potential confounding. In 
binary logistic regression analyses, a P-value <.05 indicated a 
statistically significant relationship. An odds ratio (OR) > 1 sug-
gests a risk factor, and an OR < 1 suggests a protective factor. 
The specific formula is as follows[32]:

[P0 / (1 − P0)]
Where P1/(1 − P 1) is the ratio of the exposed group and P 0/
(1 − P0) is the ratio of the non-exposed group.
2.7. Mediation analysis
Mediation analysis is a statistical method used to study how 
the independent variable (X) affects the dependent variable (Y) 
through one or more intermediate variables (called mediators, 
M) (Fig. 1). It helps the researcher to understand the underlying 
mechanism or process by which X affects Y. To test whether PLR 
plays a role in XAJPF-mediated SPP outcomes, causal mediator 
analyses were conducted according to the method proposed by 
VanderWeele,[33] adjusting for age, gender, and disease duration.
2.8. Association rule analysis
Association rule analysis was performed using the Apriori algo-
rithm in IBM SPSS Modeler 18.0 software. The minimum Support 
of the association is set to 20%, the minimum Confidence is set 
to 60%, and the Lift is >1. Support and confidence thresholds 
were set based on common practices in clinical association rule 
mining to identify sufficiently frequent and strong rules, while 
lift > 1 indicates associations greater than chance. In the analysis 
of the association rule between PLR and other laboratory indi -
cators and SPP indicators, the improvement of PLR and other 
laboratory indicators and SPP indicators is denoted as T, and 
the non-improvement is denoted as F. In the analysis of the asso-
ciation rule between the use of XAJPF and the improvement of 
laboratory indicators and SPP ind icators, the improvement of 
JQP use or SPP indicators is assigned as T, and the improvement 
of JQP use or SPP indicators is assigned as F. In the correlation 
rule analysis of XAJPF usage and improvement of laboratory 
indicators and SPP indicators, the use of XAJPF and improve -
ment of indicators is recorded as T, and the nonuse of XAJPF 
and non-improvement of indicators is recorded as F. The for -
mula of Apriori algorithm in the correlation rule is as follows[34]:

2.9. Statistical analysis
IBM SPSS statistics 23 software was used for statistical analysis. For 
data description, mean ± standard deviation was used for normal dis-
tribution and quartiles were used for non-normal distribution. Two 
independent sample t test was used to compare the measurement 
data between the 2 groups, and the Kruskal–Wallis nonparametric 
test was used for any group of data that did not conform to the nor-
mal distribution. For intra-group comparison of measurement data, 
paired t test was used for the difference in accordance with normal 
distribution, and Wilcoxon signed average rank test was used for 
the difference in non-normal distribution. Chi-square test was used 
to compare count data. GraphPad Prism 8.0.2 software was used 
for image delineation. P < .05 was considered statistically significant.
3. Results
3.1. Baseline characteristics of RA patients
As shown in Table 1. A total of 368 patients with RA were 
included in this study (median age: 59 years [IQR 52–70]; median 
disease duration 9 years (3–19 years), median BMI 22.3 kg/
m2 (19.9–24.5 kg/m 2). Co-morbidities included hypertension 
(25.3%), osteoporosis (32.4%), cerebral infarction (15.2%), 
osteoarthritis (20.8%), Sjogren syndrome (9.5%), and chronic 
gastritis (11.3%). The SF-36 quality of life assessment revealed 
significant impairment in several domains: PF (35 [25–50]), RP 
(25 [0–50]), BP (41 [31–62]), GH (30 [25–38]), VT (45 [40–
55]), SF (50 [38–75]), RE (33 [33–67]) and MH (52 [40–60]). 
Psychological assessment revealed elevated anxiety [SAS: 51 
(46–55) points] and depression [SDS: 59 (53–64) points], with 
a median pain intensity of 4.25 (VAS: 2.00–5.80) and a median 
CPRI-RA score of 7.23 (4.02–9.99). The main TCM patterns 
were CDS[10.0 (9.0–17.0)], SDH[11.0 (7.0–15.0)], SDSSD[9.0 
(6.0–12.0)] and SBS[5.00 (4.00–7.00)]. Laboratory indices sug-
gested systemic inflammation (ESR: 24 mm/h [11–43]; RF: 99 
IU/mL [34–235]; hs-CRP: 6 mg/L[2–23]), PLR:165 [119–229]; 
MPV: 10.50 (9.89–11.20); PDW:11.70 [10.40–13.33]). These 
findings characterize female RA patients with long-term disease, 
multimorbidity, reduced quality of life, active inflammation and 
a unique TCM evidence pattern.
3.2. Correlation analysis of PLR with SPP and laboratory 
indicators with SPP
Correlation analyses revealed different patterns between clinical 
parameters and SPP, especially with respect to the PLR. Strong 
associations were found between SF-36 and inflammatory 
markers: the BP was strongly correlated with SDH ( R = 0.84), 
CPRI-RA ( R = 0.81) and hs-CRP ( R = 0.54), whereas PF was 
moderately correlated with ESR ( R = 0.58) and RF ( R = 0.55). 
In psychological scales, SAS ( R = 0.78) and SDS ( R = 0.87) 
were significantly correlated with SF impairment, while SDS 
was significantly correlated with CPRI-RA: ( R = 0.70) SDSSD: 
(R = 0.93). TCM evidence showed different correlations: the 
CDS was significantly correlated with inflammatory indicators 
(ESR: R = 0.58; RF: R = 0.41), whereas the SBS correlated more 
strongly with VAS (R = 0.66) than with laboratory parameters. 
Notably, PLR showed a unique pattern of correlation, exhibiting 
weak but recognizable correlations with systemic inflammation 
(ESR: R = 0.30; hs-CRP: R = 0.27) as well as minimal associa -
tions with CPRI-RA ( R = 0.15) or functional outcome (SF-36 
domains: R = 0.06–0.15), whereas there was a strong intrinsic 
associations (MPV-PDW: R = 0.95) (Fig. 2). These results under-
line the potential of PLR as an independent marker of inflam -
mation and highlight the complex interdependence between 
inflammatory status and patient perceptual manifestations, pro-
viding avenues for multidimensional assessment of RA.
3.3. Effects of exposure on experimental indices and SPP 
outcomes
The comparative analysis of treatment outcomes between 
the exposed (n = 185) and non-exposed (n = 183) groups 
revealed significant improvements across multiple domains. In 
the exposed group, all SF-36 subscales demonstrated marked 
posttreatment enhancements (all P1 < .01), with particularly 
notable increases in PF, RP, and BP. Similarly, the non-exposed 
group showed significant within-group improvements in most 
SF-36 subscales, though posttreatment between-group compar-
isons (P3) indicated superior outcomes in the exposed group 
for PF, RP, BP, VT, RE, MH, and VAS (all P3 < .01). However, 
GH: (P3 = .251) and SF (P3 = .537) did not differ significantly 
posttreatment. For instance, the exposed group achieved sig -
nificantly lower posttreatment pain scores (VAS and CPRI-RA, 
P3 < .01). Psychological and TCM syndrome scores were 
significantly improved. The SAS and SDS scores of the expo -
sure group decreased more significantly after treatment than 
before treatment (P < .01), and the CDS, SDH, SDSSD and SBS 
scores decreased more, and all P < .01Laboratory indicators

PLR, hs-CRP, ESR, and RF were improved after exposure and 
non-exposure treatment, but their results were not statistically 
significant. And liver and kidney function parameters remained 
within the normal range before and after treatment, despite 
statistically significant increases in ALT and AST ( Table 2). 
These results suggest that the intervention elicited robust  
within-group improvements in both cohorts, but the exposed 
group achieved significantly greater benefits in physical function, 
pain relief, and psychological outcomes, underscoring a potential  
treatment-specific effect.
3.4. Logistic regression analysis: Protective factors for 
improvement of SPP
Multivariable logistic regression analyses identified key predic -
tors of improvement of SPP. XAJPF intervention use significantly 
increased the likelihood of improvement in GH (aOR = 4.17, 
P < .001), VT (aOR = 6.26, P < .001), SF (aOR = 3.93, 
P < .001), RE (aOR = 3.49, P < .001), and SDS (aOR = 7.31, 
P < .001). PLR improvement independently predicted better PF 
(aOR = 1.59, P = .037), VT (aOR = 2.81, P < .001), and reduced 
SDS (aOR = 2.81, P < .001). Inflammatory markers showed 
domain-specific effects: ESR improvement was associated with 
reduced BP (aOR = 2.42, P = .019) and better SF (aOR = 1.92, 
P = .024), while hs-CRP improvement predicted lower pain 
intensity (VAS: aOR = 3.46, P = .019) and improved SDH 
(aOR = 3.60, P = .002). For CPRI-RA, failure to improve ESR/
hs-CRP substantially reduced improvement likelihood (ESR: 
aOR = 0.12, P < .001; hs-CRP: aOR = 0.28, P = .020). MPV 
and RF showed no significant associations with any outcome 
after adjustment (Fig. 3).
3.5. Mediating factors for XAJPF to improve SPP
As shown in Table 3, mediation analysis showed that XAJPF 
intervention had a significant indirect effect on some indicators 
of SPP through the PLR pathway. For GH, a positive indirect 
effect was observed (GH: ab = 0.12, 95% BootCI [0.07, 0.18], 
*p* < measures). The direct effect was significant, suggesting a 
partial mediating effect. In contrast, VT and SDSSD had sig -
nificant negative indirect effects (VT: ab = −0.13, 95% BootCI 
[-0.22, −0.04], *p* =.009; SDSSD: ab = 0.16, 95% BootCI [0.24, 
0.09], * * (p.001). VT played a partial mediating role through 
the continuous direct effect (c “= −0.47), For SDSSD, the direct 
effect of XAJPF was not statistically significant (c”  = −0.24, 
P = .12), suggesting that the effect of XAJPF on alleviating 
SDSSD may operate primarily through reducing PLR. These 
findings together demonstrate the role of PLR as an important 
regulator, and a complete regulatory role is observed in SDSSD.
3.6. Association rule analysis between PLR and laboratory 
indicators, SPP and the improvement effect of XAJPF
The association rule mining revealed robust linkages between 
reduced PLR and improvements in laboratory parameters, 
symptom scores, and functional outcomes. As can be seen from 
Table 4 and Figure 4, with a consistent support of 61.7%, PLR 
demonstrated strong directional associations (lift > 1) across 
16 clinical variables. Notably, PLR exhibited the highest con -
fidence for alleviating pain severity (VAS: 96.0% confidence, 
lift = 1.01) and reducing disease activity (CPRI-RA: 95.6% con-
fidence, lift = 1.01). Significant correlations were also observed 
with inflammatory markers, including ESR (79.7% confi -
dence, lift = 1.10) and hs-CRP (74.0%confidence, lift = 1.04). 
Concurrently, PLR was associated with enhanced MH (81.1% 
confidence) and PF (80.6% confidence), alongside reductions in 
psychological distress (SAS: 88.5% confidence; SDS:88.5% con-
fidence) (Table 4 and Fig. 4).
Another association rule tapped the degree of association 
between the XAJPF intervention and improvements in lab -
oratory indicators and SPP indicators. High confidence inter -
vals (CONFIDENCE ≥ 90%) were associated with the core 
Figure 2. Correlation analysis between laboratory indicators and outcome indicators of SPP . * P < .05; ** P <.01; *** P <.05; **** P <.05. SPP = self-perception 
of patient.

Liu et al. • Medicine (2025) 104:41 www.md-journal.com
treatment outcomes of pain reduction (VAS: 94.59%), control 
of disease activity (CPRI-RA: 94.59%), and Chinese medi -
cine evidence remission (SDSSD: 94.05%; SDH: 90.81%). 
Psychological improvement showed the same mechanistic 
strength, with reductions in anxiety (SAS: 91.35%) and depres-
sion (SDS: 91.35%) showing the same level of confidence. 
Functional recovery showed moderate but clinically mean -
ingful associations including VT enhancement (VT: 90.27%, 
lift = 1.12), SF improvement (SF: 88.11%, lift = 1.16) and RE 
recovery (RE: 79.46%, lift = 1.20). Systemic inflammatory mod-
ulation was demonstrated by reduced ESR (78.38%), hs-CRP 
suppression (75.68%) and PLR reduction (61.62%). Notably, 
the reduction in autoimmune markers (RF: 61.08%) paralleled 
patient-reported overall health improvement (GH: 61.62%), 
suggesting an overall treatment effect. The above information 
can be found in Table 5 and Figure 5. This suggests that XAJPF 
is a multifactorial intervention in the management of RA target-
ing the inflammatory cascade response, functional recovery and 
psychosomatic balance.
3.7. Improvement in indicators with different exposure 
interventions
In Table 6, stratified analyses of the low-exposure (n = 149) and 
high-exposure (n = 36) interventions revealed different treat -
ment effects in the functional, psychological, and biomarker 
domains. Both groups showed significant improvements in the 
SF-36 subscales (P1 and P2 < .01 for PF, RP, BP, VT, RE, and 
MH) and in TCM symptoms scores (e.g., CDS: low exposure 
Δ = 11.00, P1 < .01). However, posttreatment between-group 
comparisons (P3) showed that the high-exposure group showed 
significant improvements in VT, MH and CPRI-RA were supe -
rior to those in the high-exposure group ( Fig. 6). The high-  
exposure group had greater decreases in SDS, SDH (P3 < .05). 
Notably, inflammatory indices showed comparable decreases 
in both groups (hs-CRP: high-exposure Δ = 14.15 vs low-  
exposure Δ = 12.76, P3 = .058; ESR: P3 = .961), whereas no 
significant changes were observed before and after treatment 
for PLR, MPV, and PDW (P3 > .05). Although the smaller sam-
ple size of the high-dose exposure group may have limited sta -
tistical efficacy, its consistent superiority in multidimensional 
outcomes (especially psychological and functional indicators) 
suggests a dose–response relationship. These findings under -
score the potential benefits of intensive intervention programs, 
while highlighting the need for larger trials to confirm scal -
ability and address nonsignificant between-group differences 
in VAS and SF.
4. Discussion
RA is a chronic autoimmune disease characterized by persistent 
synovial inflammation, progressive joint destruction and systemic 
complications leading to severe disability and reduced quality of 
life.[35] In addition to its pathophysiological manifestations, RA

profoundly affects SPP, e.g., the SF-36 Health Survey captures 
impairment of PF, role limitations due to RP and BP, which are 
strongly correlated with RA disease activity. [36] The CPRI-RA 
is a culturally adapted tool that further quantifies the burden 
of the disease by including symptom severity, functional limita-

health.[37]In addition, the integration of the Chinese medicine 
syndrome score, which incorporates patterns such as “SDSSD” 
and “SBS,” provides complementary insights into disease pro -
gression and treatment response, bridging the gap between bio-
medical and holistic health perspectives.
Cost-effective biomarkers have become valuable tools in 
RA treatment. In active RA, significant increases in PLR lev -
els have been observed in multiple studies,[24,38] the study found 
that Inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1 β, IL-6 and TNF- α 
were released, and thrombopoietin (TPO) and granulocyte  
colony-stimulating factor (granulocyte colony-stimulating fac -
tor) were also released Factors, G-CSF) can cause an increase 
in platelets, while lymphopenia may be related to the inflamma-
tory environment promoting lymphocyte programmed death, 
the inhibition of lymphocyte production, the migration of lym -
phocytes from the blood circulation to the synovial membrane 
of the inflamed joint or other inflammatory sites, and immune 
senescence/exhaustion. At the same time, the increase of PLR 
and joint erosion severity.[25]and patient reports pain. Clinically, 
the reduction in PLR after treatment can predict the treatment 
effect. These findings position PLR as a prognostic marker and a 
potential mediator of inflammation-driven deterioration of SPP, 
highlighting its dual role in objective disease monitoring and 
patient-centered therapy.

Correlation analysis revealed different patterns of associa -
tion between laboratory indicators and SPP, such as BP with 
SDH, CPRI-RA, and hs-CRP, underscoring the interaction 
between subjective pain perception and systemic inflamma -
tion. Psychological assessments further highlighted the impact 
of mental health on social functioning, as SAS and SDS scores 
were significantly associated with impaired social functioning. 
Interestingly, we found that the TCM evidence pattern showed 
different associations: CDS was associated with elevated ESR 
and RF, in line with its traditional features of chronic inflam -
mation. PLR was associated with systemic inflammation (ESR: 
R = 0.30; hs-CRP: R = 0.27), and also correlated with func -
tional outcome (all SF-36 domains: R = 0.06–0.15) or CPRI-RA 
(R = 0.15). These findings highlight the need for multidimen -
sional assessment of RA, combining inflammatory markers, 
psychological status, and TCM evidence-based treatment to 
develop treatment strategies. Comparisons of results between 
the exposed and unexposed groups highlight differential treat -
ment benefits. After treatment, the SPP indexes (except GH and 
SF) and laboratory indexes of the 2 groups were significantly 
improved, but the improvement of the exposure group was 
more obvious, and the difference between the 2 groups was sta-
tistically significant (P3 < .05). Of note, our intervention main -
tained hepatorenal safety and improved the tolerability of the 
intervention. Mediation effect and logistic regression analysis 
showed that XAJPF showed a strong protective effect in mul -
tiple dimensions of SPP, with reduced PLR as a key mediator. 
Although elevated inflammatory markers (PLR, ESR, hs-CRP) 
consistently predicted worse outcomes, the fully mediated effect 
of PLR in SDSSD (SDSSD: ab = −0.16, 95% BootCI [-0.24, 
−0.09], P < .001) underscore its unique mechanistic contribu -
tion to this outcome. Unlike the partial mediation observed in 
other domains, a nonsignificant direct effect (c ‘= −0.24, P = .12) 
suggests that XAJPF alleviates SDSSD only by reducing PLR. 
This specificity underscores the dual utility of PLR: as a prog -
nostic marker of inflammation severity and as a dynamic indi -
cator of treatment response. These findings with previous link of 
PLR and RA disease activity study of consistent,[23] and through 
the quantitative PLR in ending the mediation role of patients 
report to extend the knowledge. Association rule analysis fur -
ther described the multifactorial treatment of XAJPF and found 
that XAJPF correlated well with the improvement of labora -
tory indexes and SPP. Stratified analysis further showed that the 
high-exposure group had better results in VT, MH, CPRI-RA, 
SDS and SDH than other exposure groups, but comparable 
results in the improvement of laboratory indexes. This may be 
related to the small sample size in the high-exposure subgroup 
(n = 36), limiting the statistical power to detect subtle differ -
ences in results. These results highlight the need for larger trials 
to verify the significant effects of XAJPF.
It is noteworthy that while XAJPF significantly improved 
patient-reported outcomes and TCM syndromes, the improve -
ments in laboratory inflammatory markers (PLR, ESR, RF) 
were comparable between the XAJPF and control groups. This 
suggests that the benefits of XAJPF may extend beyond mere 
anti-inflammatory effects, potentially involving modulation of

central perception, psychological distress, and TCM-defined 
pathological states. Furthermore, although statistically signifi -
cant increases in ALT and AST were observed posttreatment, 
values remained within the normal range, suggesting no clinical 
hepatotoxicity and supporting the safety profile of XAJPF. The 
exploratory subgroup analysis suggested potential enhanced 
benefits on VT, MH, and SDH with high-exposure treatment. 
However, the small sample size of the high-exposure subgroup 
(n = 36) limits the statistical power to detect subtle differences, 
and these findings require confirmation in larger, specifically 
designed studies. The mediating role of PLR suggests a poten -
tial link between the formula’s effect on systemic inflammation/
immunity (as reflected by PLR) and the improvement in certain 
patient-perceived outcomes, particularly GH and syndrome of 
dampness stagnancy due to SDSSD. The precise biological path-
ways connecting XAJPF components to PLR modulation war -
rant further investigation.
Combined with TCM theory and clinical observation, we 
found that RA patients often present the characteristics of 
spleen deficiency and dampness excess, dampness and blood 
stasis during hospitalization. Based on this, our team developed 
a Chinese patent medicine compound XAJPF, including XFC 
and HQC, aiming at the above pathological characteristics. 
XFC, consisting of Astragalus membranaceus, Coicis semen, 
Tripterygium wilfordii, and centipede, is mainly used in RA 
patients with spleen deficiency and dampness excess. HQC 
is composed of Scutellaria baicalensis, Gardenia jasminoi -
des, Radix clematidis, Semen coix lacryma, and Peach ker -
nel, which is mainly used in RA patients with damp heat and 
blood stasis. Astragalus membranaceus has been found to have 
anti-inflammatory and immunostimulatory activities. [39] Coicis 
by can improve inflammation and oxidative stress in RA. [40] 
Tripterygium wilfordii can inhibit the growth of RA FLS – and 
inflammation reaction. [41] centipede neutrophils LPS stimula -
tion can inhibit the mice caused by inflammatory cytokine lev -
els.[42] Wogonin, the active ingredient in Scutellaria baicalensis, 
inhibits the migration and invasion of Scutellaria baicalensis

via the LncRNA OIP5-AS1/MiR-410-3p/Wnt7b Signaling

multi-target synergistic effects in the treatment of RA.
This study has the following 3 significant advantages: firstly, 
at the methodological level, it innovatively combines the inter -
national common research methodology with the TCM evidence 
evaluation system, which not only conforms to the norms of 
evidence-based medical research, but also significantly improves 
the scientific connotation of the study through the localized 
improvement, and constructs the evaluation framework with

the characteristics of combining Chinese and Western med -
icines. Secondly, the study design adopts the internationally 
accepted diagnosis and treatment model of combining disease 
and evidence, takes RA as the research object, and strictly 
selects the standardized proprietary Chinese medicine prepara -
tions that have been approved by the Anhui Provincial Drug 
Administration and the invention patents, and has strict quality 
control standards. Thirdly, the whole process of the study fol -
lows the international standards for clinical research in Chinese 
medicine and is registered through the International Traditional 
Medicine Clinical Trial Registry Platform and strictly fulfills the 
ethical review procedures for biomedical research, which fully 
guarantees the standardization and ethical compliance of the 
study. At the same time, there are some shortcomings in our 
study. For example, our study was only a single-center study, 
and the number of cases was not large enough, which needs to 
be further strengthened, with the exception of further feedback 
on the dosage, duration and adverse effects of the nosocomial 
agents used in this study.
5. Conclusion
In conclusion, the present study demonstrated the presence of 
SPP deterioration in RA patients. XAJPF significantly improved 
multidimensional SPP compared to controls, while its effects on 
laboratory inflammatory markers were comparable between 
groups. Reduction in PLR mediated part of the improvement 
in certain SPP domains. These findings highlight the clinical 
value of assessing SPP and PLR in RA management and pro -
vide support for the use of XAJPF to enhance patient-perceived 
outcomes. The role of PLR as a mediator and the mechanisms 
underlying XAJPF’s effects require further investigation.
