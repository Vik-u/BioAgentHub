are universal steps in actinobacterial polyketide
alkaloid biosynthesis†

Actinobacteria produce a variety of polyketide alkaloids with unusual structures. Recently, it was shown that
a type I modular polyketide synthase (PKS) is involved in the assembly of coelimycin P1, a polyketide alkaloid
produced byStreptomyces coelicolorM145. However, the mechanisms for converting the product of the
PKS to coelimycin P1 remain to be elucidated. Here we show that the C-terminal thioester reductase (TR)
domain of the PKS and anu-transaminase are responsible for release of the polyketide chain as an aldehyde
and its subsequent reductive amination. Bioinformatics analyses identiﬁed numerous gene clusters in
actinobacterial genomes that encode modular PKSs with a C-terminal TR domain and a homolog of the
u-transaminase. These are predicted to direct the biosynthesis of both known and novel polyketide
alkaloids, suggesting that reductive chain release and transamination constitutes a conserved mechanism
for the biosynthesis of such metabolites.
Introduction
An astonishing array of structurally-diverse polyketide metab-
olites with numerous applications in medicine, animal health
and agriculture are produced by actinobacteria.
1 Remarkable
molecular machines known as type I modular polyketide syn-
thases (PKSs) are responsible for the biosynthesis of the over-
whelming majority of these natural products.
2 Modular PKSs
employ several distinct strategies for the creation of structural
diversity, including the utilization of a variety of starter and
extender units for assembly of the polyketide chain,
3 diverse
mechanisms for release of the fully-assembled chain from the
PKS,
4 and a wide range of on- and post-PKS tailoring reactions.
Among these, the mechanism of chain release is arguably of
prime importance in dening which structural class a metabo-
lite belongs to. Thus, in macrolide biosynthesis chain release
proceeds via macrolactonization,
4 whereas in ansamycin
biosynthesis the chain is released via macrolactamization;4
polyether biosynthesis employs hydrolytic chain release; 4
(spiro)tetronates are assembled by condensation of the poly-
ketide chain with a glyceryl thioester;5 and chain release in
prodiginine biosynthesis proceeds via nucleophilic attack of
an amino acid a-carbanion equivalent (see ESI† for further
details).6
Incorporation experiments with isotope-labeled precursors
have shown that several mono-, di-, tri- and tetracyclic alkaloids
produced by actinobacteria, including latumcidin 1 (also
known as abikoviromycin),
7 nigrifactin 2,8 pyrindicin 3,9 cycli-
zidine 4,10 and streptazolin5 (ref. 11) (Fig. 1) are derived from
polyketide precursors. Several other actinobacterial alkaloids,
such as streptazone E 6,
12 4-hydroxy(2-penta-1,3-dienyl)-
piperidine 7,13 and indolizomycin 8 (ref. 14) can similarly be
hypothesized to have a polyketide origin. In 2012, we reported
the identication of the unusual alkaloid coelimycin P1 9
(Fig. 1) as the metabolic product of a cryptic polyketide (cpk)
biosynthetic gene cluster inStreptomyces coelicolorM145.

provided the rst biochemical insights into the molecular
mechanisms underlying actinobacterial polyketide alkaloid
biosynthesis.
The cpkA, cpkB and cpkC genes within the coelimycin
biosynthetic gene cluster encode a hexamodular PKS, which is
proposed on the basis of the predicted specicities of its cata-
lytic domains to assemble thioester10 (Fig. 2).
15 This interme-
diate is thought to be released from the PKS by NAD(P)H-
mediated reduction to the corresponding aldehyde 11, cata-
lyzed by the thioester reductase (TR) domain at the C-terminus
of CpkC.
15 Reductive amination of aldehyde11, catalyzed by the
putative u-transaminase encoded bycpkG, is proposed to give
amine 12 (or its (Z)-D-3,4 isomer, depending on the timing of
D-2,3 isomerization).15 Elaboration of 12 to 9 is believed to
proceed via a series of oxidations, a cyclodehydration and bis-
epoxide trapping by N-acetyl-L-cysteine, as illuminated by
incorporation of labelled precursors.15
Results and discussion
To experimentally investigate the role played by the CpkC TR
domain in coelimycin 9 biosynthesis, it was overproduced in
E. coli as an N-terminal His6 fusion protein and puried to
homogeneity using nickel aﬃnity chromatography. UHPLC-ESI-
Q-TOF-MS analysis conrmed that the puried protein had the
expected molecular weight (see ESI†). The catalytic activity of
the CpkC TR domain was investigated using octanoyl-CoA13 as
a mimic of the proposed natural substrate 10. NADH and
NADPH consumption was examined by monitoring the
decrease in absorbance at 340 nm. A substantial decrease in
absorbance with time was observed when NADH was used,
whereas no decrease in absorbance was observed for NADPH
(Fig. 3), showing that octanoyl-CoA is reduced by the former but
not the latter. No NADH consumption was observed in control
reactions from which the enzyme was omitted (Fig. 3).
In the absence of CpkG, which is proposed to intercept the
octanal 14 formed by reduction of octanoyl-CoA13 via trans-
amination, CpkC-TR could catalyze further reduction of14 to 1-
octanol 15 (Scheme 1). Thus, the reaction mixture containing
CpkC-TR, octanoyl-CoA13 and NADH was extracted with chlo-
roform and derivatized with N,O-bis-(trimethylsilyl)acetamide
(BSA) to convert any alcohols present to the corresponding tri-
methylsilyl (TMS) ether derivatives. GC-MS analysis of the
derivatized extract identied an analyte, absent from a control
reaction containing the boiled enzyme, withm/z ¼ 187.2. This
corresponds to the fragment ion of trimethylsilyl-1-octanol16
resulting from neutral loss of a methyl group and was found to

have the same retention time as them/z ¼ 187.2 ion resulting
from GC-MS analysis of BSA-derivatised 1-octanol (Fig. 4). An
analogous experiment in which octanal14 was used in place of
octanoyl-CoA 13 gave a similar result (see ESI†). Taken together,
the data show that CpkC-TR catalyzes the NADH-mediated
reduction of octanoyl-CoA 13 to octanal 14, which is further
reduced to 1-octanol 15 in the absence of a suitable trans-
aminase to trap the transient aldehyde intermediate.
We next turned our attention to CpkG which shows sequence
similarity to pyridoxal-5
0-phosphate (PLP)-dependent u-trans-
aminases. CpkG was overproduced inE. coli and puried as
described for CpkC-TR. UHPLC-ESI-Q-TOF-MS analysis
conrmed that the puried protein had the molecular weight
expected for apo-CpkG and gel ltration chromatography
showed that it is a homodimer (see ESI†). To investigate the
ability of PLP to bind to CpkG, the UV-vis absorbance spectrum
of the enzyme puried in the presence of the cofactor was
compared to that of PLP alone. At pH 8, a characteristicl
max
shi from 410 nm to 418 nm was observed, indicating that PLP
forms an aldimine with CpkG (see ESI†).16 We initially investi-
gated whether holo-CpkG is able to catalyze the conversion of
amines 17–21 to the corresponding aldehydes/ketones, along
with concomitant conversion of either pyruvate22 or a-keto-
glutarate 23 to alanine 24 or glutamic acid 25, respectively
(Scheme 2). A spectrophotometric assay that detects the
production of amino acidsvia formation of a copper(
II) complex
was used.17 All of the amines tested were found to stimulate
conversion of the twoa-keto acids to the corresponding amino
acids, demonstrating that CpkG has broad substrate tolerance
(see ESI†). The highest level of activity was observed for octyl-
amine 21 using pyruvate22 as the co-substrate, indicating that
CpkG prefers medium chain alkylamines, consistent with its
proposed role in coelimycin biosynthesis. The production of
octanal 15 in this reaction was conrmed by derivatization with
D-cysteine and LC-MS comparison with an authentic standard of
the resulting thiazolidine (see ESI†).18
The stereochemical outcome of the CpkG-catalyzed reaction
of octylamine 21 with pyruvate 22 was investigated by deriva-
tizing the alanine24 produced with Marfey's reagent.19 LC-MS
comparisons with Marfey's derivatives of L- and D-alanine
revealed that onlyL-alanine is formed (see ESI†), suggesting that
CpkG has preference forL-amino acid substrates.
Having established that octylamine21 and pyruvate 22 are
good substrates for CpkG in the reverse of the proposed
biosynthetic reaction, we investigated reductive amination of
octanal 14 using alanine24 as an amino donor. The pyruvate22
produced was detected using a coupled assay with lactate
dehydrogenase and NADH (see ESI †)
20 and octylamine 21
formation was con rmed by LC-MS comparisons with an
authentic standard (Fig. 5). Despite the exclusive production of
L-alanine in the reverse reaction (see above), CpkG was found to
accept both L- and D-alanine as amino donors in the forward
reaction.
Taken together, our data strongly support the key proposed
roles played by CpkC-TR and CpkG in diverting the product of
a modular PKS into alkaloid metabolism. We thus reasoned
that homologous enzymes are likely to be ubiquitous in bacte-
rial polyketide alkaloid biosynthesis. To investigate this
hypothesis, we searched the GenBank database for gene clus-
ters containing genes encoding a type I modular PKS with a TR
domain and a CpkG homolog within 35 kb of each other (see
ESI† for details). Functional annotation of the sequences ob-
tained using antiSMASH resulted in the identication of 22

actinobacterial gene clusters (in addition to the coelimycin
cluster) that are hypothesized to direct the biosynthesis of pol-
yketide alkaloids (see ESI†).
21 The module and domain organi-
zation of the PKSs encoded by these gene clusters were used to
predict the structures of the polyketide chains they assemble
(assuming a co-linear relationship between the number of
modules and the number of precursors utilized for chain
assembly). Two of the gene clusters are highly similar to thecpk
cluster in S. coelicolor and are predicted to assemble identical
polyketide chains to CpkABC.
15 It thus seems likely that these
clusters direct the biosynthesis of coelimycin P19 or a closely
related metabolite. Four other clusters produce a polyketide
chain that corresponds to the carbon skeletons of nigrifactin2
and streptazone E6. These clusters contain a very similar set of
genes to those in a gene cluster recently reported to direct the
biosynthesis of streptazone E 6 in Streptomyces sp.
MSC090213JE08.
22 Similarly, one of the clusters assembles
a polyketide chain corresponding to the carbon skeleton of
cyclizidine 4 and this cluster is essentially identical to a cluster
that was recently shown to direct cyclizidine biosynthesis in
Streptomyces sp. NCIB11649.
23 The polyketide chains assembled
by two of the other clusters correspond to the carbon skeleton of
pyrindicin 3 and two further clusters are proposed to direct the
production of latumcidin1, streptazolin 5, or a closely related
derivative, based on the structure of the carbon chains assem-
bled by the PKSs and the presence of genes encoding homologs
of the cyclases recently reported to be responsible for formation
of the C4–C8 bond in streptazone E biosynthesis (Fig. 6).
22 The
polyketide chains produced by the PKSs encoded by the
remaining nine clusters do not correspond to the carbon skel-
etons of any known metabolites. We hypothesize that these
clusters direct the biosynthesis of novel polyketide alkaloids.
Numerous nonribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS)
assembly lines have been reported to employ a TR domain for
reductive chain release and, in one case, the initially formed
aldehyde has been shown to be interceptedvia transamination
to form the corresponding amine.
4,24–26 TR-catalysed reductive
chain release has also been proposed to occur in several fungal
PKS systems, although direct biochemical evidence for this is
currently lacking.
27–31 In contrast, relatively few bacterial
modular PKSs have been reported, prior to this work, to contain
a TR domain and to the best of our knowledge CpkC-TR is the
rst of these to be biochemically characterized. In common
with a TR (Zmn14) that we recently showed to be responsible for
chain release from a polyunsaturated fatty acid synthase-like
assembly line in the biosynthesis of the zeamine antibiotics,
32
CpkC-TR has a strict preference for NADH. This contrasts with
most other TR domains, which are able to utilize NADPH. The
three residues that interact with the phosphate group of NADPH
in the TR domain from the myxalamid NRPS are completely
conserved in CpkC-TR and Zmn14.
26 Thus the structural basis
for the cofactor preference of CpkC-TR and Zmn14 is unclear.
Conclusions
In conclusion, we have shown that reductive chain release and
transamination are the key steps in the conversion of a modular
PKS product to the unusual alkaloid coelimycin P19. Moreover,
a further 22 gene clusters in actinobacteria that are known or
predicted to direct the biosynthesis of diverse polyketide alka-
loids have been identied. All of these encode a TR-terminated
modular PKS and a CpkG homolog, suggesting a common
enzymatic logic for actinobacterial polyketide alkaloid
biosynthesis.

hypothesized to direct the biosynthesis of latumcidin1, streptazolin5 or a structurally-related metabolite.
