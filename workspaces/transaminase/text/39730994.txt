Abstract 
Background Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) has developed as a leading public wellness challenge 
as a result of changes in dietary patterns. Unfortunately, there is still a lack of effective pharmacotherapy methods 
for NAFLD. Wang’s empirical formula (WSF) has demonstrated considerable clinical efficacy in treating metabolic 
disorders for years. Nevertheless, the protective effect of WSF against NAFLD and its underlying mechanism remains 
poorly understood.
Methods The NAFLD model was established using a 17-week high-sucrose and high-fat (HSHF) diet with 32 ICR 
mice. In assessing the therapeutic efficacy of WSF on NAFLD, we detected changes in body weight, viscera weight, 
biomarkers of glycolipid metabolism in serum and liver, transaminase levels and histopathology of liver with H&E 
and Oil Red O staining after oral administration. The chemical components in WSF were extensively identified 
and gathered utilizing the HPLC-Q-TOF/MS system, database mining from HMDB, MassBank, and TCMSP databases, 
alongside literature searches from CNKI, Wanfang and VIP databases. The forecast of network pharmacology approach 
was then utilized to investigate the probable mechanisms by which WSF improves NAFLD based on the performance 
of prospective target identification and pathway enrichment analysis. Besides, molecular docking was also conducted 
for the verification of combination activities between active components of WSF and core proteins related to NAFLD. 
In final, validation experiments of obtained pathways were conducted through ELISA, immunohistochemistry (IHC), 
and western blot (WB) analysis.
Results Pharmacodynamic outcomes indicated that WSF intervention effectively mitigated obesity, fat accumula-
tion in organs, lipid metabolism disorders, abnormal transaminase levels and liver pathology injury in NAFLD mice

(P < 0.05, 0.01). A total of 72 existent ingredients of WSF were acquired by HPLC-Q-TOF/MS and database, and 254 
common targets (11.6% in total targets) of NAFLD and WSF were identified. Network pharmacology revealed that WSF 
presses NAFLD via modulating TNF, IL6, AKT1, IL1B, PTGS2 (COX2), and other targets, and the probable pathways were 
primarily inflammatory signaling pathways, as confirmed by molecular docking. Molecular biology experiments fur-
ther conformed that WSF could decrease levels of inflammatory factors like IL-1β, IL-6 and TNF-α (P < 0.01) and expres-
sion of TLR4, NF-κB and COX-2 (P < 0.05, 0.01) in the liver.
Conclusion WSF treatment effectively protects against lipid metabolism disorders and liver inflammation injury 
in HSHF diet-induced NAFLD mice, and its molecular mechanism might be via suppressing the TLR4/NF-κB/COX-2 
inflammatory pathway to reduce the release of inflammatory cytokines in the liver.

Introduction
Due to alterations in dietary patterns, nonalcoholic fatty 
liver disease (NAFLD) caused by overnutrition and meta-
bolic disorders has become a common chronic liver dis -
ease globally (Younossi et al. 2018). NAFLD is appraised 
to afflict approximately 25% of the world population with 
a gradual upward trend (Younossi et al. 2019). The total 
adult NAFLD prevalence have been reported as high as 
29.81% in China, and it is predicated that there will be 
314.58 million NAFLD patients in 2030 if without effec -
tive control (Li et al. 2019a , b; Zhou et al. 2019). NAFLD 
is typically divided into two subtypes: nonalcoholic fatty 
liver (NAFL, with mild symptoms) and nonalcoholic ste -
atohepatitis (NASH, with steatosis of hepatocytes, aggra -
vated inflammatory reaction, and irreversible hepatocyte 
damage like ballooning transformation)  (Loomba et  al. 
2021). Progression from NAFLD can lead to liver fibrosis, 
cirrhosis and even liver cancer at a later stage, causing a 
tremendous burden on human health. Therefore, a pen -
etrative study on the pathophysiology and management 
of NAFLD has important practical significance.
At present, there is still a lack of effective pharmaco -
therapy methods for NAFLD  (Tilg et  al. 2023). Instead, 
it is recommended to change unhealthy lifestyle like 
improving dietary structure and lifestyle modifications 
such as exercise to mitigate the progression of NAFLD 
firstly (Houttu et al. 2021; Xiong et al. 2021). The main -
stay of drug treatments for NAFLD lies in the inhibition 
of lipid accumulation and protection of liver damage 
(include hepatic fibrosis). However, some drugs suffer 
from incomplete therapeutic efficacy or adverse reac -
tions during clinical use, for instance statins might cause 
elevations of hepatic aminotransferase levels, high risks 
of new-onset diabetes, myopathy and even myalgias or 
rhabdomyolysis (Dong et al. 2014). Therefore, search for 
safer and more effective drugs for NAFLD treatment is 
imperative.
Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) is recognized for 
its unique action modes of multi-target and multi-chan -
nel, and there is plenty of testimony that TCM plays a 
significant role in NAFLD prevention and treatment (Shi 
et  al. 2020; Chen et  al. 2021a , b). Wang’s empirical for -
mula (WSF) was a clinical empirical formula developed 
for the remedy of metabolic diseases by Prof. Wang 
Kun-Gen, the first national famous doctor of TCM and 
national academic leader of “spleen and stomach dis -
ease of TCM”  (Shen et  al. 2018). WSF is derived from 
the classic traditional formula Er-Chen Decoction, and is 
composed of Gynostemmae Herba (Jiaogulan), Astragali 
Radix (Huangqi), Crataegi Fructus (Shanzha), Salviae 
Miltiorrhizae Radix et Rhizoma (Danshen), and Poria 
(Fuling), etc. Meanwhile, WSF has the impact of “invigor-
ating the spleen and benefiting the stomach, clearing heat 
and promoting diuresis” , which is congruent with the 
TCM’s therapy theory for NAFLD. Despite WSF demon -
strates a certain therapeutic efficacy in treating NAFLD, 
the underlying mechanism of its action remains elusive.
At present, the pathogenesis and development process 
of NAFLD are quite complex and without comprehen -
sive explanation. The “two-hit” hypothesis initially pro -
posed in 1998 is considered as the classic pathogenesis 
of NAFLD  (Day and James 1998). The first hit mainly 
included factors like the sedentary lifestyle and poor 
nutritional habits, resulting in excessive intrahepatic fat 
accumulation (triglyceride in main) and insulin resist -
ance. The second hit was characterized by the overpro -
duction of lipid-induced reactive oxidative metabolites, 
which in turn led to the cytokines-mediated inflamma -
tion, hepatic cell apoptosis, necrosis, fibrosis and cirrho -
sis in final  (Berardo et  al. 2020). With the deepening of 
research, the “two-hit” hypothesis gradually evolved into 
the “multiple-hit” hypothesis for a precise explanation 
of the etiology and pathogenesis behind NAFLD. The 
core idea of this theory suggested that multiple hits like 
nutritional factors, insulin resistance, lipotoxicity, inflam-
matory cascades, gut microbiota could play a role at the 
same time, and each factor contributed to the further 
progression of the disease (Buzzetti et al. 2016; Wu et al. 
2022).
The TLR4/NF-κB-dependent release of inflammatory 
cytokines (such as TNF-α, IL-6 and IL-1β) is regarded 
as one of important mechanisms of NAFLD  (Bessone 
et al. 2019). Existing studies have proved that inhibiting 
this pathway can improve lipid metabolism disorders 
in NAFLD mice and alleviate the inflammatory state of 
the liver  (Chen et  al. 2024; Deng et  al. 2024), proving 
that inhibition of the TLR4/NF-κB signaling pathway is 
a potential therapeutic approach for NAFLD. COX-2 is 
highly expressed in inflamed tissues and it can produce 
inflammatory cytokines prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) from 
arachidonic acid  (Yagami et  al. 2016). Moreover, TLR4/
NF-κB signaling also regulates the activation of the 
COX2/PGE2 axis in liver fibrosis, indicating that COX2 
also plays a role in the inflammatory regulation of liver 
diseases (Chen et al. 2021a, b; Yang et al. 2020).
Network pharmacology employs high-throughput 
omics data analysis, network database retrieval and com -
puter simulation to uncover the network relationship of 
herb-gene-target-disease interaction. Through delineat -
ing these intricate networks, it can predict the evaluate 
medicine efficacy and exact mechanisms of medicine 
action in disease treatment of TCM.  (Shi et  al. 2023; Li 
et  al. 2022; Zheng et  al. 2024). Based on this theoreti -
cal method, Wu et  al. verified the mechanism of Qutan 
Huoxue decoction on NASH via inhibiting the SOCS1/
TLR4/NF-κB inflammatory pathway with network

pharmacology and in vitro experiments (Wu et al. 2023). 
Widespread application of HPLC-Q-TOF/MS has been 
employed in the structural determination of unknown 
chemicals in complicated mixtures via retention time, 
molecular mass and fragment information, which is 
effective in identifying probable active substances in 
TCM (Zhou et al. 2021; Jin et al. 2023). In addition, the 
integration of HPLC-Q-TOF/MS with network phar -
macology has also greatly promoted the credibility of 
research conclusions (Zhi et al. 2023; Wang et al. 2022).
Molecular docking represents a pivotal structure-
guided technique that facilitates the meticulous examina-
tion of the intricate binding interactions between protein 
targets and potential small-molecule ligands (Kaur et al. 
2019). It was integrated synergistically within phar -
macological investigations of TCM alongside network 
pharmacology, wherein their computationally derived 
predictions undergo experimental validation as a means 
to substantiate their findings  (Liu et  al. 2022; Bai et  al. 
2023; Jiao et  al. 2021). The comprehensive advantage of 
network pharmacology combined with molecular dock -
ing is that it provides concepts for the investigation of 
complex TCM, which is progressively being used in the 
study of NAFLD pathogenesis and treatment (Ren et al. 
2022).
Therefore, we firstly detected the therapeutic effects 
of WSF against NAFLD by evaluating the biochemical 
indices and histopathology in a high-sucrose and high-
fat (HSHF) diet mice. Moreover, HPLC-Q-TOF/MS, bio -
informatics in conjugation with molecular docking were 
applied to plumb the probable mechanism of WSF for 
the therapy of NAFLD in this research. Finally, we further 
validated the predicted pathway by immunohistochem -
istry, ELISA and western blot using liver tissue from the 
efficacy experiment in  vivo. This study would offer per -
suasive evidence for the clinical promotion of WSF later.

protein free rapid blocking buffer were got from Beyo -
time Biotechnology Reagent Co., Ltd. (Shanghai, China). 
The antibodies of COX2, IL-6 and secondary antibodies 
were purchased from Proteintech Group Inc. (Wuhan, 
China). The antibodies for TLR4, NF-κB and β-actin were 
acquired from Beijing Biosynthesis Biotechnology Co., 
Ltd. (Beijing, China), Hangzhou DiagBio Biotechnol -
ogy Co., Ltd. (Hangzhou, China), and Wuhan Servicebio 
Technology Co., Ltd. (Wuhan, China), respectively. The 
enhanced chemiluminescent assay kit was attained from 
Nature Biosciences Ltd. (Hangzhou, China). The catalog 
numbers of utilized regents are included in supplemen -
tary file.
Drug preparation
WSF was prepared by the Traditional Chinese Medi -
cine Health Products Institute of Zhejiang University of 
Technology, and was then condensed to concentration of 
2.853 g/mL in crude herb amounts. It was then refriger -
ated in 4 ℃ for later use.
Animal experiment
ICR mice (male, n = 32) were purchased from Labora -
tory Animal Center of Zhejiang Academy of Medical Sci -
ences (SYXK(Zhe)2019–002, Hangzhou, China). All the 
animals were reared in standardized environmental con -
ditions characterized by a 12-h light–dark photoperiod 
with unrestricted access to water and food. The animal 
procedures were meticulously conducted in strict adher -
ence to the Zhejiang University of Technology’s Guide -
lines for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals.
Our group previously established that the ideal con -
centration of WSF for treating rats with glucose and 
lipid metabolic disorders is 14.26  g/kg (detailed data 
is in supplementary file). And for this study, the dosage 
for NAFLD mice was determined to be 28.53 g/kg based 
on the specific surface area method for animal dose 
conversion.
Considering the optimal dosage was determined and 
the principle of reduction in animal experiments, we 
used a single dosage in this study. After adaptive feed -
ing for 1 week, a total of 32 ICR mice were randomly 
assigned into four groups according to their body 
weight with the random number method: the normal 
group (NC), the model group (MC), PPC administra -
tion group (PPC) and WSF administration group (WS), 
each consisting of 8 mice. The NC mice was fed with 
standard diet, while mice in the MC, PPC and WS 
group were all received a high-sucrose and high-fat

Chen et al. Molecular Medicine          (2024) 30:278 
 
(HSHF) diet over a period of 17  weeks. The PPC and 
WS mice were daily administered PPC or WSF at 
a dose of 273.6 mg/kg or 28.53  g/kg (i.g.) adjusted to 
the volume of 1 ml/100 g in accordance with the body 
weight, respectively. The HSHF diet, consisting of 10% 
lard, 10% egg yolk powder, 5% sucrose, 2% cholesterol, 
0.5% sodium cholate was derived from Trophic Animal 
Feed High-Tech Co.,Ltd. (Nantong, China).
Upon conclusion of the experiment, mice were sub -
jected to an overnight fasting before blood was drawn 
from the ocular venous plexus. Obtained blood samples 
were centrifuged for 10 min twice at 3600 rpm to attain 
serum for biochemical analysis. The mice were subse -
quently anesthetized (isoflurane inhalation) with remov -
ing their liver as quickly as possible. Part of liver was 
put in 4% paraformaldehyde tissue fixation solution for 
hepatic pathology and immunohistochemistry analysis, 
part of liver was put in ethanol absolute for liver homoge-
nate and remaining parts were preserved at − 80 °C.
Moreover, we conducted a separate 28-day oral toxicity 
experiment (detailed data are provided in the supplemen-
tary file), which demonstrated that administration at 12 
times the human clinical dose did not exhibit significant 
toxic effects on the liver or glucose and lipid metabolism 
in normal mice.
Histological staining
The Hematoxylin–eosin (H&E) and Oil Red O staining 
procedures were conducted consistent with the methods 
detailed in prior literature (Lei et al. 2019). H&E staining 
were undergone on 4 μm paraffin-embedded tissue slices 
and liver pathology scores for NAFLD were decided 
in line with NAFLD activity score (NAS) nominated by 
American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases as 
Table 1 described (Kleiner et al. 2005). The specific pro -
cedures of tissue dehydration and the H&E staining are 
described in the supplementary file.
Oil Red O staining serves as a reliable method for both 
the identification of lipid accumulation and the semi-
quantitative assessment of hepatic steatosis. In brief, liver 
tissue specimens were first dehydrated in a 30% sucrose 
solution prior to being embedded in OCT as well as 
sliced into 10 μm-thick frozen sections. The 0.5% Oil Red 
O solution was subsequently stained on the obtained cry-
osections, followed by hematoxylin counterstaining on 
the nuclei. All H&E and Oil Red O stains were captured 
under the biological microscope (BX43, Olympus, Japan) 
and subjected to semi-analysis using the Image J software 
(version 1.54f). The code used for Oil Red O analysis are 
included in supplementary file.
Measurement of biomarkers in serum and liver
Serum blood glucose (GLU), transaminase (AST and 
ALT), and lipid levels (TC, TG, and HDL-c) were deter -
mined with the respective assay reagents on the auto -
mated biochemical analyzer (HITACHI-7020, Japan). The 
level of serum LDL-c was further calculated by Friedwald 
formula (Molavi et al. 2020).
To measure the concentrations of TC and TG in the 
liver, liver organs (circa 100  mg) were put into ethanol 
absolute (9 times in volume), homogenized for a 10% 
(w/v) homogenate solution and centrifuged at 2500 rpm 
for 10  min twice later for the acquisition of superna -
tant. After mixing the 2.5 μL tissue extract solution with 
250  μL working solution and allowing it to stand for 
10 min at 37  ℃, we measured the absorbance at a wave -
length of 500 nm (TC) or 510 nm (TG), respectively. The 
specific concentrations of TC and TG were calculated 
through the standard curve.
Qualitative identification of components in WSF
Sample preparation
The WSF powder was obtained using the vacuum freeze 
dryer (−  55  ℃, 20  Pa). Then, 3.0  g WSF powder was 
extracted ultrasonically (40 kHz, 300 W, likewise below) 
for 60  min with 30  mL methanol (chromatographic 
purity, likewise below) and the resultant solution was 
evaporated in an 85  ℃ water bath until dryness. Another 
3  mL methanol was used to redissolve the residue with 
ultrasound for 30 min. Finally, 1.0 mL supernatant fluid 
underwent filtration via a 0.22  μm organic phase filter

HPLC‑Q‑TOF/MS conditions
The HPLC-Q-TOF/MS system was composed of a 
1290 Infinity II liquid chromatography and a 6545XT 
AdvanceBio Quadruple Time-of-Flight mass spectrom -
etry (Agilent Technologies, USA).
The chromatographic conditions were as follows: (1) 
Column: Welch Ultimate LP-C18 (4.6 × 250  mm, 5  μm); 
(2) Injection volume: 10  μL; (3) Column temperature:

The operating conditions of mass spectrometry were 
set as follows: (1) Ion source: Agilent jet stream electro -
spray ionization source (AJS-ESI); (2) Gas flow rate: 8 L/
min; (3) Gas temperature: 300 ℃; (4) Sheath gas tempera-
ture: 350 ℃; (5) Nebulizer gas pressure: 35 psi; (6) Sheath 
gas flow rate: 11 L/min; (7) Capillary voltage: 3100 V; (8) 
Fragmentor voltage: 175  V; (9) Nozzle Voltage: 1000 V. 
Scanning with a range of m/z 50–3200 was utilized for 
sample mass spectrometry signal acquisition in positive 
and negative ion modes, respectively. All of the collected 
data were processed utilizing the Agilent MassHunter 
workstation software (version B.08.00).
Bioinformatics analysis
Prediction of prospective WSF targets associated to NAFLD
The components of herbs in WSF were also collected 
with the TCMSP database (https:// old. tcmsp-e. com/ 
tcmsp. php, version 2.3), while the bioactive ingredients 
of Shanzha were identified by a supplemented literature 
search due to the lack in the TCMSP database  (Cheng 
et  al. 2023). The chemical components obtained from 
HPLC-Q-TOF/MS and database mining were sifted with 
a criterion of oral bioavailability (OB ≥ 30%) and drug-
like properties (DL ≥ 0.18) as well as further screened 
through the Swiss ADME (http:// www. swiss adme. ch/ 
index. php) platform with a score of “High” for gastro -
intestinal absorption and at least two “Yes” for drug like 
properties. The filtered ingredients were later transmit -
ted to the Swiss Target Prediction platform (http:// www. 
swiss targe tpred iction. ch) for protein target search with 
their canonical SMILES attained from PubChem data -
base ( https:// pubch em. ncbi. nlm. nih. gov). The targets 
with a credibility value of 0 were deleted.
GeneCards (https:// www. genec ards. org, version 5.22.0 
Build 1354), DisGENET (https:// www. disge net. org, ver -
sion 24.3) and OMIM database (https:// www. omim. org) 
were applied to obtain the NAFLD-relevant protein tar -
gets, and the keywords were set as “non-alcoholic fatty 
liver disease” . Targets from GeneCards database that not 
exceeding the median relevance scores were eliminated, 
and duplicate entries were consolidated to derive the 
set of NAFLD-related targets. Finally, the herbs-active 
components-targets network was constructed and visual-
ized via Cytoscape 3.7.1 software after standardization of 
names with Uniprot database (https:// www. unipr  ot. org, 
release 2024_05).
“Network analyzer” function in Cytoscape 3.7.1 was 
conducted to evaluate the overall situation of the net -
work with topological parameters encompassing degree, 
average shortest path length (ASPL), betweenness cen -
trality (BNC) and closeness centrality (CNC).
Coincident targets identification and protein–protein 
interaction (PPI) network analysis
The intersectional analysis of Venny 2.1.0 (https:// bioin 
fogp. cnb. csic. es/ tools/ venny/ index. html) was utilized to 
collect the coincident targets shared between biologically 
active constitutes of WSF and NAFLD-associated tar -
gets which were regarded as prospective targets of WSF 
to ameliorate NAFLD. The STRING database (https:// 
string- db. org, version 12.0) was employed to build the 
PPI networks with constraints of a medium confidence 
threshold of 0.400 and homo sapiens. Subsequently, the 
resulting data was submitted to Cytoscape 3.7.1 for visu -
alization purposes. Core targets were further discerned 
through the topological analysis of the CentiScaPe 2.2 
plug-in in terms of parameters like betweenness, close -
ness and degree.
Gene ontology (GO) function and Kyoto encyclopedia 
of genes and genomes (KEGG) enrichment analysis
The intersecting targets derived above were uploaded 
into DAVID database (https:// david. ncifc rf. gov, v2024q2) 
for KEGG and GO enrichment analysis, encompassing 
biological process (BP), cellular component (CC) and 
molecular function (MF) analysis. In the KEGG analysis, 
pathways with less than 0.05 P-values and their accordant 
enriched targets were selectively retained to identify cru -
cial pathways and pivotal targets related to the impact of 
WSF on NAFLD. Finally, Weishengxin (http:// www. bioin 
forma tics. com. cn) was utilized for visualization purposes 
of the top 20 BP and KEGG pathway results according to 
gene counts or ratios in bubble and bar graphs.
Molecular docking
The bioactive components with degree values ≥ 10 in 
the “active components-target-pathway” network were 
regarded as ligands in subsequent molecular docking 
analysis. The 2D structure of aforesaid components were 
Page 7 of 24
Chen et al. Molecular Medicine          (2024) 30:278 
 
obtained from the PubChem database (https:// pubch em. 
ncbi. nlm. nih. gov), while the 3D structures with mini -
mum energy were drawn through Chem3D software. 
The protein structure database Protein Data Bank data -
base ( http:// www. rcsb. org) was utilized to retrieve the 
structural details about the core targets in inflammation 
related pathways with restrictions of homo sapiens, X-ray 
diffraction, refinement resolution ≤ 2.5 Å. The water 
molecules and original ligand structures in the selected 
proteins were removed, as well as hydrogen atoms were 
added by PyMoL software. Subsequently, molecular 
docking explorations were conducted to evaluate the 
optimal semi-flexible binding modes with retained rotat -
able bonds of the biochemicals by using the AutoDock 
Vina with Vina default force field and scoring func -
tion (Trott and Olson 2010).
In an effort to improve the precision of molecular dock-
ing predictions, we conducted additional flexible docking 
simulations. Building upon the minimum binding energy 
conformation derived from a semi-flexible docking pro -
tocol, we designated amino acid residues within a 5 Å 
sphere centered on the ligand as flexible, permitting free 
rotation of their side chains. AutoDock Vina was then 
re-employed for docking, and conformations exhibiting 
intramolecular hydrogen bonds were discarded.
To determine the final ranking, we calculate the sum of 
the rankings of the lowest binding energies of a certain 
molecule to all proteins firstly, and then sort the numeri -
cal values of the ranking sums of all molecules in ascend -
ing order. Ultimately, the hydrogen bond linkage with 
protein residues of the top two optimal biomolecules 
with the minimum binding energy ranking were visual -
ized by PyMoL software.
Immunohistochemistry (IHC) analysis of related proteins 
in the liver
The expression and localization of Toll-like receptor 4 
(TLR4), nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB), cyclooxyge -
nase 2 (COX-2) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) in the liver were 
determined by IHC analysis. The procedures for IHC 
staining were comparable to we described previously (Li 
et al. 2019a, b). In brief, the tissue slices were subjected 
to procedural deparaffinization, antigen retrieval with 
citrate buffer liquid (pH 6.0), incubation with appropriate 
primary antibodies (1:200 dilution) and HRP-conjugated 
secondary antibodies in turn, respectively. Subsequently, 
the positive expression signals were visualized under 
the optical microscope via DAB staining in yellow color, 
while the nuclei underwent counterstaining with hema -
toxylin. The protein expression data were subjected to 
semi-quantitative analysis through the computation 
of integrated optical density (IOD) values within the 
positively stained areas of microphotographs with the 
Image-Pro Plus software (version 6.0). The catalog and 
lot numbers of utilized antibodies are included in supple-
mentary file.
ELISA determination of inflammation factors in the liver
The liver tissues were precisely weighed with the subse -
quent addition of an equivalent volume of saline solu -
tion at a 1:10 (w/v) ratio and thorough mixing. Then, 
the supernatants schemed for the following trails were 
subjected to homogenization and centrifugation at 
12,000 rpm from the resultant mixtures above at 4 °C for 
10 min. In final, the mouse ELISA kits of tumor necrosis 
factor α (TNF-α) and interleukin-1β (IL-1β) were utilized 
for their concentration determination in the liver as per 
the provided instructions.
Western blot (WB) analysis of related proteins in the liver
In short, precisely weighted liver tissue was lysed in the 
RIPA buffer containing protease inhibitor and EDTA 
(100:1:1, v/v/v) at 4  ℃ with subsequent homogenate cen -
trifugation for 10 min to get supernatants at 12,000 rpm 
for further WB analysis, prior to the concentration’s 
detection of total protein via the BCA assay kit. After 
being degenerated with loading buffer at 95  ℃, protein 
samples were isolated via 10% SDS-PAGE under condi -
tions of 80  V for 30  min, followed by 120  V for 90  min 
and subsequently electrotransferred onto a nitrocellulose 
membrane in ice (200 mA with TLR4: 90 min, NF-κB and 
COX2: 60  min, β-actin: 40  min). Membranes were then 
blocked at room temperature with protein-free rapid 
blocking buffer for 20  min, followed by overnight incu -
bation with respective primary antibodies (TLR4 1:1000, 
NF-κB 1:1000, COX-2 1:750, dilution) at 4  ℃. β-actin 
(1:1000, dilution) was served as the loading control. After 
a 1-h incubation with paired HRP-conjugated second -
ary antibodies, the protein bands were visualized via an 
enhanced chemiluminescent detection system (Chemi -
Scope 6000, CLINX, China). The semi-quantification of 
gauging protein expressions was standardized against 
β-actin densitometry conducted with ImageJ software 
(version 1.53K).
Statistical analysis
All data were presented as the average values ± standard 
deviation (SD). Statistical analyses entailed one-way anal-
ysis of variance (ANOVA), supplemented with Tukey’s 
honest significant difference (HSD) test for intergroup 
comparisons. A statistical significance threshold was 
set at P ≤ 0.05. All analyses of statistics were performed 
through an updated version of SPSS software. Diagram 
visualization was implemented by GraphPad Prims.

Results
WSF attenuated body weight and visceral fat accumulation
Animal experiment procedures are show in Fig.  1A. 
The body weight of the MC mice increased significantly 
since modeling since the 5th weeks compared with the 
NC group (P < 0.05) (Fig.  1B). And after modeling for 
17  weeks, the weight gain, liver mass, and epididymal 
adipose (EA) mass of the MC mice also increased sig -
nificantly (P < 0.01) (Fig.  1C–E). PPC, a key component 
of essential phospholipids renowned for its efficacy in 
treating NAFLD, is instrumental in preserving hepatic 
cell membrane fluidity and functionality (Lu et al. 2022). 
Compared to the MC group, the body weight of the 
PPC and WS mice decreased significantly, starting from 
the 5th and 7th weeks of PPC and WSF administration 
(P < 0.01), respectively (Fig. 1B). Besides, the weight gain, 
EA mass and its index of the PPC and WS mice decreased 
(P < 0.01), while PPC has no obvious effect on EA index 
(Fig. 1C–G). These results indicated that WSF treatment 
could reverse abnormal weight gain and visceral fat accu-
mulation caused by the HSHF diet.
WSF improved liver function and pathological lesions
After modeling for 17 weeks of the HSHF diet, the serum 
levels of AST and ALT in the MC mice increased signifi -
cantly compared with the NC group (P < 0.01) (Fig.  2B, 
C). The H&E and Oil Red O staining demonstrated an 
increase of inflammatory foci (indicated by arrowheads), 
extensive hepatocyte ballooning lesions, and aberrant 
lipid accumulation in the liver of NAFLD mice (Fig.  2A, 
E). Besides, the NAS score of the MC mice also increased 
significantly (P < 0.01) (Fig.  2D), demonstrating that the 
normal physiological structure of the liver was severely 
damaged. Compared with the MC group, PPC and WSF 
could lessened the levels of serum AST and ALT signifi -
cantly (P < 0.01) (Fig.  2B, C). Meanwhile, the inflamma -
tory cell infiltration was reduced and other pathological 
changes of the liver were reversed as attested by H&E and 
Oil Red O staining (Fig.  2A). In addition, the NAS score 
and Oil Red O area ratio decreased in various degrees 
(P < 0.05, 0.01) (Fig.  2D, E). Collectively, these results 
showing that WSF improved liver function and attenu -
ated pathological lesions of inflammatory and steatosis.
WSF ameliorated lipid metabolism
In divergence from the NC group, the levels of serum 
TC, TG, LDL-c as well as liver TC, TG in the MC mice 
increased significantly (P < 0.01) (Fig.  3A, B, D-F), while 
serum HDL-c levels decreased obviously (P < 0.01) 
(Fig.  3C) after modeling for 17  weeks, suggesting that 
there might be abnormal lipid metabolism in HSHF diet-
induced NAFLD mice. Compared with the MC group, 
PPC and WSF treatment could suppress the increase 
of serum TG and liver TG and the  decrease of serum 
HDL-c in various degrees (P < 0.05, 0.01), but had no 
effect on serum TC and LDL-c (Fig.  3A–F). Moreover,

we observed that after 17 weeks of modeling, there was 
a trend towards elevated serum GLU levels in MC mice 
(without significant difference), whereas administration 
of PPC and WSF could normalize the serum GLU levels. 
These results suggested that WSF could ameliorated and 
lipid metabolism disorder induced by NAFLD through 
regulating the serum levels of TG and HDL-c and TG 
accumulation in the liver.
Identification of phytochemical components in WSF
The Agilent HPLC-Q-TOF/MS system was exploited to 
evaluate phytochemical components of WSF, and total 
ion chromatogram profiles were acquired via full scan 
under both positive and negative electrospray ionization 
modes (Fig.  4). In comparison with the HMDB, Mass -
Bank, TCMSP databases and data from related litera -
ture searched from CNKI, Wanfang and VIP databases, 
39 potential compounds were tentatively recognized in 
accordance with their retention time (RT), molecular 
formulas, differences in theoretical and observed quasi-
molecular ion mass (m/z), errors in ppm, scores of Agi -
lent Masshunter and MS/MS fragment ion circumstances 
in total. Wherein, 7 kinds of mutual compounds were 
identified simultaneously in positive and negative modes. 
The majority of the detected components were attributed 
to flavonoids (including flavone glycosides), alkaloids, 
phenylpropanoids (including coumarins and lignans) and 
phenolic acids. The specific information of components 
identified tentatively in WSF was listed in Table 2.
Bioinformatics‑based analysis
Acquisition of WSF component targets and NAFLD disease 
targets
A total of 72 chemical components from WSF were 
acquired from the HPLC-Q-TOF/MS results, TCMSP 
database and literature search after Swiss ADME plat -
form screening. Subsequently, 878 protein targets for the 
72 active ingredients present in WSF were identified by

with significance markers of *P < 0.05 and **P < 0.01
Page 10 of 24Chen et al. Molecular Medicine          (2024) 30:278 
using the Swiss Target Prediction platform after remov -
ing repetitive targets with their canonical SMILES. After 
deduplication, a total of 1573 unique NAFLD-related 
targets were compiled from a combination of the Gen -
eCards, DisGENET and OMIM databases, which were 
used as disease targets of NAFLD for later analysis. The 
Venny 2.1.0 website was further subjected to coincide 
targets associated with the WSF with the NAFLD dis -
ease-related targets, yielding 254 shared targets in total 
as prospective therapeutic targets for the NAFLD treat -
ment by the WSF (Fig. 5A).
Construction of the herbs‑active components‑targets 
network map
Cytoscape 3.7.1 was utilized to construct an interaction 
map of the herbs-active components-targets network, 
consisting of 338 nodes and 2037 edges (Fig.  5B). The 
nodes in the network were distinguished by size, which 
had a positive correlation with the degree values. The 
map was further subjected to additional topological anal -
ysis across “Network analyzer” tool. Topological results 
implied that the centralization of the network is 0.135 
and the heterogeneity is 1.033, while the average CNC is 
0.35, showing that some nodes in the network were more 
concentrated and contributive than others. The average 
degree of the network is 12.05, and there are 63 com -
ponent nodes and 55 target nodes above this value. The 
gypentonoside A_qt node has the highest degree value 
with connections to 56 targets, and the target CYP19A1 
is connected to 46 components of WSF. It is indicated 
that bioactive components could interact with singu -
lar or multiple targets, while various components might 
also share common targets. Collectively, these insights 
propose a multi-component and multi-target mode of 
action for WSF in eliciting complex pathophysiological 
alterations pertinent to NAFLD therapy. Details of com -
ponents in WSF that ranked within the top 10 based on 
their degree values were listed in Table 3.
Construction of the PPI network map
To further investigate the therapeutic mechanisms of 
WSF on NAFLD, PPI analysis of the coincident targets 
was implemented with the STRING database. The origi -
nal PPI network comprised 253 nodes interconnected by 
4943 edges with a degree value of 39.075 on average and 
a clustering coefficient of 0.547 on average, which charac-
terized the intricate protein interaction collectively. Uti -
lizing the CentiScaPe 2.2 plugin for topological analysis, 
the processed PPI network was subsequently visualized 
through Cytoscape 3.7.1 software (Fig.  5C), employing 
stringent selection criteria of degree > 39.075, between -
ness centrality > 251.65, and closeness centrality > 0.002 to 
discern top 50 key genes. The brighter color and larger 
size of circles were positive correlation with the degree

values, while the thicker width and brighter color of 
edges were positive correlation with the combined score. 
In final, a total of 50 core targets with 873 edges were 
screened out, and TNF (162), IL6 (157), AKT1 (157), 
IL1B (142), and PPARG (136) were the top 5 targets 
according to their degree values, and PTGS2 also has a 
relatively high degree value of 109, which were all consid-
ered as the key anti-NAFLD targets of WSF.
GO and KEGG analysis
GO analysis of the coincident targets mutual to WSF 
and NAFLD was conducted via the DAVID database. 
The outcomes of GO analysis disclosed that BP-related 
alterations were primarily in linkage with 882 functional 
annotations, comprising positive regulation of transcrip -
tion from RNA polymerase II promoter, signal transduc -
tion, protein phosphorylation, inflammatory response 
(rank 10), and the response to lipopolysaccharide (LPS, 
rank 13), etc. (Fig.  6A). Wherein, LPS constitutes a pri -
mary composition of the outer membrane in Gram-neg -
ative bacterial cell walls and could participate in NAFLD 
inflammatory progression via activation of the gut-liver 
axis LPS/TLR4/NF-κB pathway (Han et al. 2022). Besides, 
alterations related to CC primarily encompassed 97 func-
tional annotations, with a substantial focus on locations 
of the cytosol, cytoplasm and plasma membrane etc.

And the majority of alterations related to MF were pre -
dominantly characterized by 208 functional annotations, 
encompassing protein binding, identical protein binding 
and ATP binding, etc. The CC and MF outcomes of GO 
analysis were not visualized in this article.
The coincident targets between WSF and NAFLD were 
also submitted to the DAVID database for an in-depth 
analysis of the KEGG, and the 156 related pathways were 
screened with a criterion of P < 0.01. The enrichment 
bar chart of the top 20 key pathways was drawn accord -
ing to gene counts using Weishengxin website (Fig.  6B). 
Wherein, we found that pathways in cancer, metabolic 
pathways and lipid and atherosclerosis have the top 3 
largest gene counts.
In accordance with PPI analysis results, we discovered 
that core proteins like TNF, IL6, IL1B and PTGS2 (COX2) 
were canonical pro-inflammatory cytokines. Moreover, 
the BP results also revealed the potential of WSF to ame -
liorate NAFLD by modulating inflammatory responses. 
Therefore, we conducted an in-depth exploration of 
the KEGG analysis results and found that inflamma -
tion related pathways like TNF, IL-17, Toll-like receptor 
and NF-kappa B signaling pathway were also involved 
in enrichment pathways with gene counts ≥ 15 (Fig. 6C). 
These selected 4 pathways (in brown gray) involved 41 
related targets (in blue) and 67 chemical components (in 
green) with 112 nodes and 408 edges (Fig.  6D). In con -
clusion, the combination results of KEGG and PPI anal -
ysis indicated that WSF might act on NAFLD through 
proteins in inflammation related pathways above, which 
would be validated with further experiments later.
Molecular docking
For the further affinity verification, molecular dock -
ing was carried out of the core proteins in inflammation 
related pathways (TLR4, NF-κB, COX-2, IL-1β, IL-6, and 
TNF-α) with 13 active components of degree values ≥ 10 
in the “active components-target-pathway” network. The 
respective minimum binding energies between various 
active components with their CAS numbers and proteins 
with their PDB IDs were listed in Table  4. Furthermore, 
a heat map was constructed according to the mini -
mum binding energy for intuitive visualization purpose 
(Fig.  7A). The stability of the ligand-receptor binding 
was inversely proportional to the binding energy, which 
indicated that a more stable interaction resulted in lower 
binding energy. It is considered to have a good affinity 
between ligands and receptors if the binding energy is 
below − 5.0 kcal/mol (Jiang et al. 2022).
Our results implied that all the minimum binding ener-
gies were no more than -5.0 kcal/mol with a value of 
−  7.17 kcal/mol on average, which indicated that most 
of the selected chemical components of WSF were con -
jugated tightly with pivotal proteins in inflammation 
related pathways. These data further proved that WSF 
might exert pharmacological effects against NAFLD 
by mediating the activities of inflammatory related 
proteins of the TLR4/NF-κB/COX-2 pathway at the

JGL5 (gypenoside XXXVI), JGL8 (gypenoside XXVIII), 
FL1 (16α-hydroxydehydrotrametenolic acid), JGL9 
(gypentonoside·A) and JGL6 (gypenoside XXXV) have 
lower minimum binding energies to almost all core tar -
gets, indicating that they might be the core components 
of WSF in NAFLD therapy. Representative simulation 
figures of core protein-active component docking pat -
terns were drawn by PyMoL software with links between 
certain binding residue positions and hydrogen bonds 
(Fig. 7B–D).
Effects of WSF on the critical protein expressions 
and inflammatory factor levels in the liver
To further validate the anti-NAFLD effect of WSF across 
the inflammatory TLR4/NF-κB/COX-2 pathway in diet-
induced mice, IHC (Fig.  8A), WB (Fig.  9A) and ELISA 
analyses of pivotal proteins and inflammation factors in 
the liver were performed. Compared to the NC group, 
the HSHF diet would induce an increase in levels of 
TLR4, NF-κB and COX-2 expression in NAFLD mice 
livers (P < 0.05, 0.01) (Fig.  8B–D, Fig.  9B) and promote 
the release of inflammation factors like IL-1β, IL-6 and 
TNF-α (P < 0.05, 0.01) (Fig. 8E–G). In contrast, interven -
tion with WSF for 17 weeks could result in the diminu -
tion expression of TLR4, NF-κB and COX-2 (P < 0.05, 
0.01) (Fig.  8B–D, Fig.  9B) with reversed pro-inflamma -
tory cytokine levels in the liver (P < 0.01) (Fig.  8E–G). 
These findings highlighted that WSF treatment indeed 
attenuated the NAFLD and inflammation in the liver 
across the TLR4/NF-κB/COX-2 pathway, consistent with 
the results obtained above by the bioinformatics and 
molecular docking.
Discussion
NAFLD refers to a clinical syndrome pathologically 
characterized by inordinate intracellular lipid deposi -
tion in the liver due to factors other than alcohol and 
other well-defined hepatocyte-damaging elements, with 
a spectrum of diseases including NAFL, NASH, hepatic 
fibrosis, cirrhosis, or even hepatocellular carcinoma 
(HCC)  (Chalasani et  al. 2018). Nowadays, the NAFLD 
incidence of the population in Asian countries is around 
27.4%, with a continuous upward and younger trend (Fan 
et al. 2017; Anderson et al. 2015). NAFLD in children is 
characterized by rapid progression, 25.0%-50.0% have

developed NASH among confirmed cases of NAFLD in 
children, and 10.0%-25.0% have developed liver fibrosis 
as reported (Goyal and Schwimmer 2016). However, cur -
rent used drugs mainly focused on weight loss, metabo -
lism regulation, antioxidation and liver protection, and 
long-term application might induce increased risk of 
cancer, hemorrhagic stroke and symptomatic heart fail -
ure (Hsu et al. 2016). Therefore, there is still a lack of effi-
cacious hepatoprotective medicine with few side effects, 
which seriously lowers the life quality of NAFLD patients 
of all ages.
TCM formulas often contain a variety of herbs with a 
myriad of active ingredients that could holistically mod -
ulate the intricate pathogenic network of NAFLD, as 
proven by long-term safe medication practices (Sun et al. 
2021). In TCM theories, NAFLD was supposed to be a 
syndrome of deficient in origin and excessive in super -
ficiality. Additionally, spleen deficiency was considered 
as Ben (primary aspect), while pathogenic factors like 
blood stasis and phlegm-dampness were Biao (second -
ary aspects)  (Zhang et  al. 2010). Synopsis of the Golden 
Chamber noted that “treating liver by nourishing spleen” , 
indicating that if the transportation function of spleen 
was normal, qi and blood would be harmonized, and 
liver diseases could be cured as soon as possible  (Wei 
et  al. 2015). WSF was developed under the guidance of 
Prof. Wang Kun-Gen with the efficacity of “invigorating 
the spleen and benefiting the stomach, clearing heat and 
promoting diuresis” , which fits in with the above TCM 
theories of NAFLD treatment. Years of clinical experi -
ence have also proved that WSF performs well in man -
aging metabolic diseases like hyperlipidemia and severe 
fatty liver  (Shen et  al. 2018). In summary, WSF has the 
potency for NAFLD prevention and treatment, but its 
modes of action need further systematic investigation. 
Therefore, we detect the pharmacological effects and 
relevant molecular pathways of WSF on NAFLD in this 
study.
According to expert consensus, dietary disorders (i.e., 
overeating of fat and sweets), more leisure with less 
labor, emotional disorders, physical weakness from pro -
longed illness and insufficient endowment were con -
sidered as the primary causes of NAFLD (Zhang and Li 
2017). Epidemiology statistics also revealed that exces -
sive sugar and lipid intake, which could increase the 
metabolic burden of the liver, were major risk factors

for NAFLD  (Romero-Gómez et  al. 2017). An increase 
in insulin resistance degree and hepatic fat storage is 
positively correlated with changes in plasma saturated 
fatty acids  (Rosqvist et  al. 2014). Moreover, excessive 
intake of sugar-sweetened beverages also has a positive 
correlation with fatty liver incidence and serum ALT 
levels  (Ma et  al. 2015). Therefore, the development of 
NAFLD models predominantly relies on dietary inter -
ventions with high-fat and high-sugar regimens to emu -
late the detrimental effects of an unhealthy human diet, 
except for drug-induced liver damage or unique strains of 
animals (Fang et al. 2022). In this study, we found that the 
HSHF diet would induce typical symptoms of NAFLD 
similar to those in humans like obesity, lipid deposition 
in organs, increased transaminase levels, lipid metabo -
lism disorder, hepatocellular degeneration and hepatic 
inflammatory cell infiltration, as reported in other stud -
ies (Chen et al. 2017; Porras et al. 2017).
In this study, we revealed a noteworthy therapeutic 
impact of WSF across multiple dimensions on NAFLD 
treatment. Obesity ranks as a primary risk factor in the 
development of NAFLD. Meta-analysis results illustrated

that 69.99% of individuals in the overweight category 
(BMI ≥ 25.0  kg/m2) exhibited NAFLD prevalence, and 
in the obese population (BMI ≥ 30.0 kg/m2), it increased 
further to 75.27% (Quek et al. 2023). We found that WSF 
decreased the body weight significantly of model mice 
from 7 weeks after administration compared to the MC 
group, and the weight gain of 17  weeks also decreased 
with significance. Additionally, liver and epididymis adi -
pose mass weight declined significantly in the model 
mice, implying less lipid deposition in organs. Clinically, 
the disease progression of NAFLD is positively correlated 
with the serum levels of AST and ALT  (Chinese Soci -
ety of Endocrinology et  al. 2018). It was identified that 
WSF had salient hepatoprotective effects due to reduced 
serum levels of AST and ALT in our study. Despite its 
inherent constraints, liver biopsy continues to be the gold 
standard for the course of NAFLD diagnosis and progno -
sis (Wang and Malhi 2018). H&E and Oil Red O staining 
results demonstrated that WSF could reverse pathologi -
cal syndromes like steatosis, ballooning degeneration and 
inflammatory cell aggregation of hepatocytes caused by 
the HSHF diet. Meanwhile, NAS score reduction fur -
ther proved the protective effects of WSF on hepatocyte 
lesions.
In 2020, an international panel advocated rechristen -
ing NAFLD as metabolic associated fatty liver disease 
(MAFLD) in an effort to underscore the metabolic under-
pinnings of the NAFLD pathogenesis course (Eslam et al. 
2020). Our results showed that WSF could improve 
lipid metabolism by significantly modulating the serum 
and liver levels of TG and HDL-c, but it had no obvious 
effects on TC and LDL-c. Researches have indicated that 
excessive intake of bile salts not only causes an increase 
in intestinal absorption of cholesterol but also reduces 
the excretion of cholesterol by inhibiting the conver -
sion to bile acids, leading to excessive accumulation of 
cholesterol in the plasma and liver of the organism (Song 
et al. 2015; Xiao et al. 2023; Tilg et al. 2022). LDL is the 
primary carrier of cholesterol in plasma, transport -
ing cholesterol from the liver to peripheral tissues, and 
accumulation of cholesterol-enriched LDL is a hallmark 
of hypercholesterolemia  (Islam et  al. 2022). Moreover, 
clinical research data have also demonstrated that high 
hepatic and plasma cholesterol accompanied high lev -
els of LDL-c with were seen in obeticholic acid admin -
istration patients  (Neuschwander-Tetri et  al. 2015). Our 
experimental observations revealed that neither the posi -
tive drug nor the WSF manifested substantial reductions 
in serum or liver TC levels and serum LDL-c levels. This 
lack of significant reduction implies that the cholesterol 
and sodium cholate-supplemented diet has elicited an 
extremely severe perturbation in the organism’s choles -
terol metabolism. In conclusion, these results denoted 
that WSF could exert its anti-NAFLD efficacy mainly by 
ameliorating lipid metabolism partially and recovering 
liver inflammation and steatosis injury.
Furthermore, WSF exhibits a significant dose-depend -
ent regulatory effect on glucose and lipid metabolism 
in rats with metabolic disorders, akin to the manifesta -
tions observed in NAFLD mice. However, the precise 
dose-dependent relationship of WSF in NAFLD models 
remains to be definitively established, due to variations 
in experimental animal strains and dietary compositions. 
Concurrently, WSF does not demonstrate significant 
toxic effects in normal mice at a dosage 12 times that of 
the human clinical dose. The observed significant differ -
ences in body weight may be attributed to the relatively 
higher initial body weight of the WS mice or poten -
tially due to WSF enhancing their metabolic efficiency. 
The underlying mechanism warrants further investiga -
tion, particularly focusing on the activities of enzymes 
involved in glycolipid metabolism.

Network pharmacology has emerged as a potent strat -
egy for holistically discerning the therapeutic targets of 
drugs in relation to diseases, owing to its capability of 
synthesizing colossal datasets to conduct virtual screen -
ings grounded in both TCM ingredients and correlated 
symptoms (Zhong et al. 2023; Zhang et al. 2023). In the 
study combined with HPLC-Q-TOF/MS and network 
pharmacology, we attained 72 active components and 
254 intersection target proteins. Sequentially, we further 
obtained NAFLD-related hub genes including TNF, IL6, 
AKT1, IL1B, PPARG and PTGS2, which played impor -
tant roles in NAFLD abnormal metabolic pathways, 
corresponding to the degree values of the PPI interac -
tion network. We have noticed that TNF-α, IL-6, IL-1β 
and PTGS2 (COX2) are all inflammatory factors, as well 
as inflammation is also supposed to be an important 
driver of NAFLD and the progression to NASH  (Rohm 
et al. 2022; Luo and Lin 2021). Thus, we further gauged 
the gene counts and confidence levels of inflammation 
related pathways. The KEGG analysis showed that all 
the gene counts of TNF, IL − 17, Toll-like receptor and 
NF − kappa B signaling pathway were all greater than 15 
with P values less than 0.01, indicating the key role of 
these pathways of WSF on NAFLD treatment. Therefore, 
inflammatory related TLR4 and  NF − κB were also con -
sidered as the pivotal target proteins of WSF to alleviate 
NAFLD.
The outcomes from molecular docking analyses 
revealed that crucial components in WSF demonstrated 
high binding activities with pivotal targets comprised in 
inflammation related pathways (including TLR4, NF-κB, 
COX-2, IL-1β, IL-6 and TNF-α), with all minimum bind -
ing energies recorded at less than -5.0  kcal/mol  (Tong 
et al. 2021; Zhou et al. 2022). This further confirmed the 
critical role of inflammatory pathways acquired from 
network pharmacology, particularly the TLR4/NF-κB/
COX-2 pathway, in the molecular mechanism of WSF 
on NAFLD treatment. Furthermore, we found that the 
majority of active components with both lower binding 
energies to proteins and higher degree values in the net -
work belonged to the saponins of Gynostemmae Herba. 
Our prior researches have similarly demonstrated that 
gypenosides could ameliorate hepatic inflammation in 
high-fat diet induced NAFLD rats by attenuating the 
LPS/TLR4/MyD88/NF-κB signaling pathway (Shen et al. 
2020, 2022). Moreover, gypenosides could modulate 
associated enzyme functions involved in cholesterol pro -
duction, fatty acid synthesis, transportation and degrada -
tion to improve lipid disorder in NAFLD as well  (Zhou 
et al. 2023; Cheng et al. 2024). Those above implied that 
gypenosides could be the core bioactive ingredients of 
WSF, which need in-depth study later. In conclusion, 
WSF might exert pharmacological effects against NAFLD 
by mediating activities of inflammatory related proteins 
of TLR4/NF-κB/COX-2 pathway, which would be veri -
fied in the subsequent experiments.
The hepatic inflammation response is a crucial feature 
of NAFLD, and the canonical TLR4/NF-κB inflamma -
tory pathway has been identified as a critical contributor 
in the advancement of NAFLD (Tang et al. 2023). In nor -
mative hepatocytic contexts devoid of stimulatory cues, 
NF-κB complexes with its cytoplasmic inactivator, the 
inhibitor of NF-κB (IκB), to form a suppressive ensem -
ble that curtails the transcriptional activation potential 
of NF-κB (Wei et al. 2022). Upon stimulation of hepato -
cytes, TLR4 engages with the downstream adaptor pro -
tein of myeloid differentiation factor 88 (MyD88) and 
initiates a signaling cascade that subsequently activates 
the IκB kinase (IKK). This activation further prompts 
the phosphorylation and degradation of the IκB protein, 
leading to a dissociation of the NF-κB/IκB protein com -
plex, which is crucial for the transcriptional regulation 
of inflammatory responses (Feng et al. 2020). Moreover, 
NF-κB activation leads to the production of pro-inflam -
matory cytokines comprising IL-1β, IL-6 and TNF-α, 
which are prominently implicated in the progression of 
NAFLD (Liu et al. 2019; Lv et al. 2023).
Experimental evidence has illustrated the impair -
ment of linoleic and arachidonic acid metabolism in the 
liver of NAFLD mice induced by the high fat diet with 
a significant upregulation of hepatic TLR4 expression, 
leading to a substantial accumulation of inflammatory 
cytokines  (Qin et  al. 2023). Linoleic acid is categorized 
as an n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids, whose downstream 
metabolite is arachidonic acid in  vivo, and holds a sig -
nificant role in mediating inflammatory processes (Burns 
et al. 2018). COX-2 is a formidable enzyme that facilitates 
the conversion of arachidonic acid into prostaglandins 
and instigates inflammation subsequent to activation by a 
myriad of inflammatory stimuli encompassing cytokines 
and bacteria (Hu et al. 2020). It has been manifested that 
excessive linoleic acid intake could result in liver steato -
sis, inflammation injury and fibrotic response with higher 
levels of hepatic TG and free fatty acids (FFAs) (Graham 
et  al. 2023). Moreover, it would also promote NF-кB 
translocation and COX-2 activation, and induce produc -
tion of proinflammatory cytokines like IL-1β, IL-6 and 
TNF-α by the release of arachidonic acid derived com -
pounds (Marchix et al. 2015).
Our results revealed a marked decrease in the expres -
sion levels of TLR4, NF-κB and COX-2 in the liver tissue 
by WSF intervention compared with the NAFLD mice. 
As integrators of the inflammatory pathway in NAFLD, 
inactivation of NF-κB and COX-2 could lead to less 
secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines like IL-1β, IL-6 
and TNF-α (Huang et al. 2019; Cheng et al. 2013), which 
Page 21 of 24
Chen et al. Molecular Medicine          (2024) 30:278 
 
was consistent with the ELISA results in this study. Com-
bined with the previous results of HPLC-Q-TOF/MS, 
bioinformatics and molecular docking, we supposed that 
WSF treatment could ameliorate hepatic lipid disorder 
and inflammation injury in NAFLD through regulation of 
the TLR4/NF-κB/COX-2 signaling pathway.
Conclusions
This study indicated that WSF could be used to alleviate 
NAFLD caused by the HSHF diet via improving fat accu -
mulation, lipid metabolism, liver function and pathologi -
cal damage. Moreover, a new insight was provided into 
the mechanisms through the TLR4/NF-κB/COX-2 path -
way combined with HPLC-Q-TOF/MS, bioinformatics, 
molecular docking and validation results. In addition, 
these results offer a pharmacological foundation for fur -
ther product development and clinical implementation of 
WSF.
