ABSTRACT
The Opuntia genus exhibits several mechanisms that support liver function. Due to its richness in phenolic compounds, 
our study highlights the hepatoprotective potential of Opuntia ficus-  indica  cladode juice in mitigating nickel-  induced liver 
injury. The polyphenol content was determined using spectrophotometric analysis and HPLC-  MS. Experimental hepato -
toxicity was induced by intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of NiSO 4. To assess the hepatoprotective effects of cladode juice, var -
ious analyses were performed to evaluate its impact on enzymatic activity, serum biomarkers, oxidative stress markers, and 
liver tissue structure. Quantification of phenolic compounds confirmed the presence of total polyphenols and flavonoids. 
Chromatographic analysis identified p-  coumaric acid, piscidic acid, isorhamnetin-  3- O- neohesperoside, and ellagic acid as the 
major phenolic constituents. Cladode juice exhibited a hepatoprotective effect in rats intoxicated with nickel sulfate (NiSO 4), 
as evidenced by the modulation of plasma hepatic biomarkers, restoration of oxidative stress marker levels, and a marked 
reduction in hepatic lesions observed through histological analysis. Molecular docking studies of the four identified polyphe -
nolic compounds with alanine transaminase revealed a higher binding affinity for ellagic acid, followed by p-  coumaric acid. 
These beneficial effects are attributed to the plant's diverse bioactive compounds, highlighting their potential to mitigate 
oxidative damage and support liver function.

1   |   Introduction
Heavy metal pollution is a global problem that threatens human 
and animal health and also the environment. Human activities, 
including industry, agriculture, and transport, release heavy met-
als into the air, water, and soil (Brown and Margolis 2012). Unlike 
heavy metals, there are light metals such as nickel (Ni), which can 
become toxic if present at high levels (Iyaka 2011). The 24th most 
prevalent element in the crust of the planet is nickel (Ni), account-
ing for 3% of its composition, second only to iron, oxygen, magne-
sium, and silicon. Nickel metals and their alloys are widely used 
in the food industry, particularly as catalysts and pigments, in 
chemical and metallurgical applications. Nickel is recognized as 
a valuable micronutrient for specific plant species (Liu et al. 2011) 
and a crucial trace element for the human body (Cao et al. 2016); 
nonetheless, excessive concentrations can have adverse effects. 
The exposure to high levels of nickel has been associated with the 
development of cancer and various health complications such as 
fatigue, headaches, dermatitis, vertigo, cardiovascular issues, and 
respiratory disorders (Pasha et al. 2010). Commercially important 
nickel salts include nickel chloride, nickel sulphate, nickel nitrate, 
nickel carbonate, nickel hydroxide, nickel acetate, and nickel 
oxide (Cempel and Nikel 2006). Nickel is a metal that can accumu-
late in the body, particularly in the bones, liver, and kidneys. This 
bioaccumulation can have negative health consequences, based 
on the dosage and duration of contact. Nickel is an immunotoxic 
and carcinogenic agent that can damage the immune system and 
cause disease (Genchi et al. 2020). However, excessive consump-
tion may lead to oxidative stress, resulting in an overproduction 
of harmful free radicals. This can damage cellular structures and 
impair liver function, potentially resulting in severe liver toxicity 
(Meng et al. 2018).
The liver is the organ most sensitive to nickel toxicity, whether of 
environmental or occupational origin. Because nickel disrupts 
the metabolism of ascorbate- cholesterol and changes the activity 
of various enzymes, it can cause significant damage to the liver 
and kidneys (Derbal et al. 2022). The production of reactive oxy-
gen species (ROS) and a rise in lipid peroxidation (LPO) at the cel-
lular level are two negative consequences of nickel's action in the 
body. Nickel accumulation is responsible for increased produc -
tion of ROS and increased LPO (Guo et al. 2019). The exposure to 
nickel has been correlated with alterations in the functionality of 
various antioxidant enzymes, which encompass catalase (CAT), 
reduced glutathione (GSH), glutathione peroxidase (GPX), and 
glutathione S- transferase (GST). These enzymes assume a crit -
ical function in the detoxification of reactive oxygen species 
(ROS) and the safeguarding of cellular integrity against damage 
(Sidhu et al. 2004). Moreover, oxidative stress, a condition arising 
from a lack of balance in the middle of antioxidant defenses and 
reactive oxygen species, is implicated throughout the initiation 
and development of liver damage (Li et al.  2015). Due to its sig -
nificant role in liver injury, antioxidants have been thoroughly 
investigated for their possible help in treating and preventing 
liver disorders, both acute and chronic (Adak 2018). For this rea-
son, numerous studies have demonstrated the positive effects of 
antioxidants, especially in the prevention and treatment of liver 
injury. Aggressive antioxidant therapy is thought to enhance 
liver injury outcomes. Furthermore, using synthetic medications 
to treat liver illness may not be effective or may result in major 
side effects (Touiss et al. 2021).
The hepatoprotective potential pertains to the ability of specific 
compounds to mitigate hepatic injury, safeguarding this vital 
organ engaged in numerous biochemical pathways. Multiple in-
vestigations have substantiated the efficacy of various agents in 
preserving liver integrity (Sharukh et al. 2023 ).
The genus Opuntia provides a variety of mechanisms and bene -
fits for liver function. Antioxidant action is a notable mechanism 
exhibited by several species within this genus (Chen et al. 2021). 
The liver-  protective properties of cactus cladodes, particularly 
those from Opuntia atropes  and Opuntia ficus indica, are linked 
to their abundant phytochemical profile, including flavonoids 
and dietary fibers, which exhibit notable antioxidative potential. 
Investigations indicate that cactus cladode extracts can mitigate 
hepatic damage induced by toxins such as lithium carbonate and 
high- fat diets, leading to reductions in hepatic lipid and triacyl -
glycerol content by up to 73.1% in models used in experiments 
(Ben Saad et al.  2016; Duarte- Medina et al. 2024). Opuntia ficus 
indica (OFI), a cactus of the Cactaceae family, has fruits and 
cladodes that are rich in essential nutrients, including minerals, 
vitamins, and antioxidants. Traditional medicine uses it to treat 
illnesses through these health benefits. The researchers have 
confirmed their efficiency in the treatment of multiple diseases 
thanks to these anti-  ulcerogenic, antioxidant, anti-  cancer, and 
hepatoprotective properties (Brahmi et al.  2011). Cladode juice's 
phenolic components, namely certain flavonoids and proantho -
cyanidins, along with beta-  carotene (provitamin A), vitamins C 
and E, and glutathione, have been linked to a reduction in blood 
glucose and cholesterol levels when consumed regularly (Hfaiedh 
et al.  2008). Furthermore, recent studies have substantiated the 
elevated concentration of some substances that are bioactive in 
cladodes, including phenolic compounds, phytosterols, betalains, 
carotenoids, and essential fatty acids, particularly linoleic and 
palmitic acids. This biochemical composition underscores their 
potential therapeutic and nutritional significance (Razzak, Aouji, 
Sabri, et al. 2024). Additionally, their rich nutritional profile, en-
compassing polysaccharides, vitamins, and minerals, further 
highlights their value in health and disease prevention (Razzak, 
Aouji, Zirari, et al. 2024).
Advanced computer-  assisted drug discovery technologies 
have advanced to allow the detection of drugs derived from 
phytochemical compounds present in various medicinal 
plants. In computer science, predictive models are essential for 
directing the methodological selection of technical and med -
ical research. Additionally, they have been applied to the in 
silico prediction of toxicological, pharmacokinetic, and phar -
macological performance (Loza-  Mejía et al.  2018). Currently, 
molecular docking represents an efficient and economical ap -
proach for the development and evaluation of pharmaceutical 
products. By using this technique, information on how phar -
maceuticals interact with receptors is generated, which can be 
used to predict how drug candidates would align with their 
target protein (Lee and Kim  2019). In addition, this method 
promotes systematic exploration by positioning a molecule 
non- covalently on the docking site of a target macromolecule, 
which leads to a specific association with the active sites of 
each ligand (Bharathi et al. 2014 ).
The main objective of this study was to evaluate the hepatoprotec-
tive capacity of phenolic compounds in cladode juice in laboratory 
3 of 17
animals. Using a rat model of NiSO 4- induced acute liver injury, 
we investigated the therapeutic properties of cladode juice extract 
from Opuntia ficus indica (OFI) and explored the mechanisms un-
derlying its hepatoprotective efficacy. A molecular docking study 
involving alanine aminotransferase was also carried out to deepen 
the understanding of the mode of action of these molecules.
2   |   Materials and Methods
2.1   |   Cladodes Juice Preparation
Mature cladodes of the Opuntia ficus indica species were harvested 
in the commune of Oulad Boubker (Morocco). After the spines had 
been cleaned, the cladodes were cut into small pieces and mixed 
with a volume of distilled water (50%) using a Moulinex. The juice 
obtained was then filtered to remove the hard fibers and homoge-
nized using a high- speed blender (CAT Unidrive 1000 D).
2.2   |   Analysis of Phenolic Compounds
2.2.1   |   Determination of Total Phenolic Content (TPC)
The Folin–Ciocalteu method, as described by Singleton 
et al. (1999), was used to determine the phenolic compound con-
tent in cladode extracts. Specifically, 0.5 mL of the sample ex -
tract was mixed with 2.5 mL of Folin–Ciocalteu reagent, which 
had been previously diluted tenfold with distilled water. Upon 
interaction with phenolic compounds, this reagent produces a 
blue coloration, the intensity of which is directly proportional to 
the phenolic concentration. After an 8-  min incubation period, 
2 mL of a 7.5% sodium bicarbonate solution was added, followed 
by a 15-  min incubation in the absence of light. The absorbance 
was then measured at 765 nm, and the total phenolic content 
was quantified. Micrograms of gallic acid per milliliter of juice 
(mg GAE mL−1) were used to express the results. Three dupli -
cates of the experiment were conducted.
2.2.2   |   Determination of Total Flavonoid Content (TFC)
The total flavonoid content of cladodes was determined by colo -
rimetric analysis following the protocol described by Djeridane 
et al. (2006). A reaction mixture consisting of 1 mL of extract and 
1 mL of a 2% methanolic solution of aluminum chloride (AlCl 3) 
was incubated for 15 min at room temperature. The absorbance 
was then measured using a spectrophotometer set at 430 nm. The 
reference blank for this analysis consisted of methanol combined 
with AlCl3. Flavonoid concentrations in the extracts were deter-
mined using a quercetin calibration curve, and the findings were 
reported as mg QE mL−1, or quercetin equivalent per milliliter 
of juice.
2.2.3   |   Identification of Polyphenols by HPLC-  MS
Polyphenol Separation: A C18 column (5 μm, 250 × 4.6 mm) kept 
at 30°C was used to examine the material. Detection of UV/DAD 
was done between 200 and 600 nm. Phase A and Phase B mo -
bile phases are 0.1% formic acid in water and 0.1% formic acid in 
acetonitrile, respectively. The injection volume was 10 μL, and the 
applied flow rate was 0.8 mL/min. 0–5 min at 15% A; 5–20 min at 
15%–25% A; 20–30 min at 25%–35% A; 30–40 min at 35%–50% A; 
40–50 min at 80% A; and 50–55 min at 15%. A was the gradient elu-
tion schedules. The following crucial characteristics were present 
in the system, which had a heated electrospray ionization (ESI) 
source and ran in either negative or positive ESI mode (±4.0 kV) 
(Shang et al. 2022).
– The flow rate of auxiliary gas is measured at 10 arbitrary 
units (arb) (Shang et  al. 2022 ); the flow rate of sheath 
gas is quantified at 35 arb.
– The temperature of the capillary is maintained at 325°C; 
the temperature of the auxiliary gas heater is set at 350°C.
– The collision energies employed in a stepped and normal -
ized fashion are quantified at 20, 40, and 60 eV (eV).
– The analytical procedure is conducted in full-  scan mass 
spectrometry mode with a resolution of 70,000 full width at 
half maximum (FWHM).
– The scanning range is established from m/z 10,0 to 100,000.
2.3   |   Animals
Twenty female albino Wistar rats with an initial weight of 
205 ± 22 g were bred at the Faculty of Science, Ibn Tofail 
University, Kenitra 14000, Morocco. The rats were maintained 
on a 12-  h light/12-  h dark cycle and at a room temperature of 
21°C ± 2°C. Access to water and food was free throughout the 
study. All experimental procedures were conducted following 
approval by the Institutional Ethics Committee for the Care and 
Use of Laboratory Animals at the Faculty of Sciences, ensuring 
full compliance with established animal welfare regulations.
2.4   |   Experimental Procedure
Rats were divided into four groups consisting of five animals 
in each group and treated for 40 days as follows: Control group: 
normal control rats, receiving distilled water (10 mL kg−1) daily 
for 30 days and injected with physiological saline (0.9% NaCl) at 
a dose of 4 mL kg−1 on days 31 to 40. Ni group: intoxicated control 
rats receiving distilled water (10 mL kg−1) daily for 30 days and 
injected with NiSO 4 at a dose of 4 mL kg−1 on days 31 to 40. CJ 
group: rats receiving cladode juice (10 mL kg−1) daily for 30 days 
and injected with physiological saline (0.9% NaCl) at a dose of 
4 mL kg−1 on days 31 to 40. CJ + NiSO4 group: rats receiving cla -
dode juice (10 mL kg−1) daily for 30 days and injected with NiSO4 
at a dose of 4 mL kg−1 on days 31 to 40. The study by Hfaiedh 
et al. (2008) was used as the basis for the nickel dose and experi-
mental protocol in this study, with some modifications.
2.5   |   Serum Collection and Tissue Homogenate 
Preparation
Before each administration, the rats' body weight is recorded. 
After 24 h following the last NiSO 4 injection, the rats are anes -
thetized with Pentobarbital. Heparin- containing tubes are filled 
4 of 17
 Food Science & Nutrition, 2025
with blood drawn from the abdominal aorta. After centrifuging 
the samples for 10 min at 3000 rpm, the plasma is extracted and 
kept at −20°C for serum marker tests. After the liver is taken out, 
it is cleaned with physiological saline (NaCl, 0.9%), weighed, and 
1 g of liver tissue is mixed with 5 mL of PBS (pH 7.4) in a Potter 
tube at 0 degrees Celsius (on ice). After that, the homogenate is 
centrifuged for 15 min at 14,500 rpm. The supernatant is stored 
at −20°C for oxidative stress assays. The remaining liver tissue is 
fixed in 10% formalin for histological analysis.
The following formula was used to calculate the liver index (Su 
et al. 2014):
2.6   |   Analytical Methods
2.6.1   |   Serum Marker Assays
All Serum marker enzyme experiments aspartate transami -
nase (AST), alanine transaminase (ALT), alkaline phospha -
tase (ALP), gamma glutamyl transferase (GGT), glucose, total 
protein, total and direct bilirubin (TB and DB) were conducted 
in triplicate for each specimen using the ROCHE COBAS 
INTEGRA 400 Plus autoanalyzer with the utilization of com -
mercially available reagent kits.
2.6.2   |   Estimate of Lipid Peroxidation (MDA)
By quantifying the production of malondialdehyde (MDA) in 
liver extracts, the level of lipid peroxidation (LPO) was indirectly 
assessed (Mihara and Uchiyama  1978). The concentration was 
expressed as nanomoles MDA/mg protein by measuring the ab -
sorbance of the complex formed at 535 nm.
2.6.3   |   Estimation of Glutathione Reduction (GSH)
Hepatic glutathione (GSH) was measured by a colorimetric 
method known as the Ellman method. This method is based on 
the fact that glutathione reacts with 5,5′-  dithio- bis(2- nitrobenz
oate) (DTNB) to form a yellow complex. The amount of GSH is 
proportional to the intensity of the yellow color (Ellman  1959). 
Expressed as nmol GSH/mg protein, it is the total GSH content 
of the sample.
2.6.4   |   Glutathione Peroxidase Activity (GSH-  Px)
Glutathione peroxidase activity (GSH- Px) was measured accord-
ing to the method of Flohé and Günzler (1984). GSH- Px activity 
was expressed as μmol GSH/min/mg protein.
2.6.5   |   Catalase Activity (CAT)
The breakdown of hydrogen peroxide (H 2O2) to water (H 2O) 
and oxygen (O 2) in the presence of the catalase enzyme at a 
wavelength of 240 nm was used to measure catalase activity. 
According to Aebi  ( 1984), enzyme activity was measured as 
μmol H2O2 consumed/min/mg protein.
2.6.6   |   Superoxide Dismutase Activity (SOD)
The inhibition of the reduction of nitro blue tetrazolium (NBT) 
is the principle of superoxide dismutase activity. Activity ex -
pressed in units/mg protein (Misra and Fridovich 1977 ).
2.7   |   Histopathological Study
The histopathological study was conducted at the Department 
of Pathological Anatomy, Mohammed VI University Hospital, 
Oujda. Organs harvested post-  mortem were weighed and pre -
served in a 10% formalin solution. Longitudinal sections were 
prepared using the paraffin embedding technique. Paraffin 
blocks were sectioned into 4–5 μm thick slices using a micro -
tome (Leica RM2235) and stained with hematoxylin and eosin 
according to standard histological procedures. Microscopic ob -
servations and image capture were performed using a light mi -
croscope (Leica Microsystems) equipped with a camera (Leica 
DMD108) (Hewitson and Darby 2010).
2.8   |   Molecular Docking
As shown by the HPLC-  MS analysis, four molecules are pres -
ent in the cladode of Opuntia ficus indica juice. The four li -
gands, namely ellagic acid, p-  coumaric acid, isorhamnetin 
3- o- neohesperoside, and piscidic acid, were extracted from the 
PubChem database, while the biomacromolecule Alanine ami -
notransferase (PDB ID: 3IHJ) was obtained in PDB format. The 
ligands have been formatted as PDB files to simplify molecular 
research via PYMOL. In addition, Discovery Studio was used 
to prepare the proteins extracted from the PDB base. The ac -
tive site of the enzyme was used to anchor the ligand structures 
thanks to AutoDockTools. The analysis of interactions between 
the active site residues of the enzyme and ligand molecules was 
conducted using Discovery Studio software, including a 2D in -
teraction study (Zirari et al. 2025 ).
2.9   |   Statistical Analysis
Data are expressed as mean ± SEM. Statistical significance be -
tween groups was assessed using one-  way analysis of variance 
(ANOVA), followed by Tukey's post hoc test with a 95% confi -
dence interval ( p < 0.05), using SPSS software (version 27; IBM 
Corp., Armonk, NY, USA).
3   |   Results
3.1   |   Total Phenolic Concentration (TPC) and Total 
Flavonoid Concentration (TFC)
The assessment of bioactive constituents in Opuntia ficus indica  
cladode juice (CJ) extracted with different solvents was carried out 
using a colorimetric assay. The primary objective was to quantify 
Liver index(%) = (liver weight∕body weight) × 100 %.
5 of 17
phenolic compounds, as these organic molecules are largely re -
sponsible for the biological activities of the extract and contribute 
to mitigating oxidative damage induced by free radicals, which are 
implicated in various human pathologies. Phenolic compounds, 
abundantly distributed in the plant kingdom, exhibit noteworthy 
pharmacological properties (Kumari et al. 2017).
The findings from the quantification of total polyphenols and 
flavonoids revealed that all the cladode juices analyzed con -
tained varying levels of these bioactive compounds.
The assessment of TPC using the Folin–Ciocalteu assay indicated 
that the average concentration in cladode juice, expressed in mil-
ligrams of gallic acid equivalent per milliliter, was 0.389 ± 0.04 mg 
GAE mL−1 (Table  1). This concentration reflects a significant 
presence of phenolic constituents, known for their potential in -
volvement in various biochemical and protective mechanisms. In 
comparison with previous studies, Boutakiout et al. (2018) reported 
that the total polyphenol content in cladode juice could range 
from approximately 455.65 to 542.70 μg GAE mL−1. Similarly, 
Chahdoura et al. (2024) documented a polyphenol concentration 
of 58.13 mg GAE g−1 of extract, while Moussaoui (2020) recorded 
a total polyphenol content of 63.54 mg GAE g−1 dry matter. These 
reported values were higher than those obtained in the present 
study. It is important to emphasize that total polyphenol concen-
trations are influenced by various factors, including the harvesting 
location, different developmental stages of the plant, and its age 
(Santiago- Saenz et al. 2018).
Similarly, the quantification of TFC demonstrated that the mean 
content in the juice, expressed as milligrams of quercetin equiv -
alent per milliliter, was 0.187 ± 0.05 mg QE mL−1. The observed 
flavonoid levels underscore the presence of these secondary me-
tabolites, which are recognized for their diverse bioactive proper-
ties, particularly in modulating oxidative stress and contributing 
to cellular defense systems. In comparison with other studies, 
Chahdoura et  al.  (2024) reported that the total flavonoid con -
tent in cladodes reached 28.89 mg QE g−1 of extract. Similarly, 
Lahmidi et  al.  (2023) documented values ranging from 3.77 to 
7.55 mg QE 100−1 mL of cladode puree, while Moussaoui  ( 2020) 
recorded a total flavonoid concentration of 18.07 mg QE g−1 dry 
matter. Flavonoid levels fluctuate during cladode maturation, 
peaking at 1 year of growth before gradually declining (Lahmidi 
et  al. 2023). Flavonoids, a class of phenolic compounds with ex -
ceptional antioxidant potential, are regarded as essential dietary 
components. They are widely recognized for their potent free 
radical- scavenging properties (Kumari et  al.  2017), cardiopro -
tective effects (Li et al.  2013), anti- inflammatory and hepatopro-
tective activities (Chen et al. 2014), as well as their antimicrobial 
action (Biharee et al. 2020). Despite their promising bioactivities, 
flavonoids exhibit limited bioavailability, which restricts their effi-
cient utilization by the human body (Wang et al. 2018).
3.2   |   HPLC- MS Characterization of Phenolic 
Compounds
The phenolic constituents of cladode juice were elucidated 
through the comparative analysis of their retention durations 
and mass spectrometry spectra against established data. Figure 1 
presents the identification results of the various peaks observed 
in the HPLC-  MS chromatogram. Based on the obtained data, 
four bioactive molecules were identified in the cladode juice: p-  
coumaric acid at 4.25 min, piscidic acid at 5.48 min, isorhamnetin- 
3- O- neohesperoside at 18.95 min, and ellagic acid at 605 min.
p- Coumaric acid, a phenolic compound belonging to the hy -
droxycinnamic acid family (Poleto et al.  2024), exhibits high 
antioxidant activity and plays a crucial role in mitigating 
diseases associated with oxidative stress. Studies have high -
lighted its ability to reduce oxidative stress (Chen et al.  2024). 
Research conducted on mice revealed that p-  coumaric acid 
protects the liver from damage induced by potassium bromate 
by alleviating oxidative stress and inflammation (Nivetha 
et al. 2024 ).
Piscidic acid, a bioactive compound derived from the cladodes 
of OFI, exhibits significant pharmacological properties, partic -
ularly in cholesterol regulation and potential anticancer effects 
(Ressaissi et  al.  2017). This compound demonstrated the abil -
ity to inhibit the formation of new blood and lymphatic vessels. 
Additionally, its antioxidant capacity, comparable to that of car -
nosic acid, enhances its protective effects on the body (Shibata 
et al. 2016).
Isorhamnetin- 3- O- neohesperoside is a flavonoid glycoside with 
significant pharmacological properties, particularly in terms of 
antioxidant and anticancer activities (Du et al.  2016). It is dis -
tinguished by its strong antioxidant capacity. This flavonoid 
also plays a protective role against genetic damage induced by 
aflatoxin B1 and nifuroxazide (Bouhlel et al.  2010). Moreover, 
isorhamnetin itself has demonstrated notable anticancer and 
antifungal potential (Unver 2024 ; Li et al. 2022).
Administration of isorhamnetin has been shown to reduce 
lipid accumulation and triglyceride levels, decrease both serum 
and hepatic lipids, and improve liver lesions (La et  al.  2024). 
Additionally, Yang et al. ( 2024) observed that isorhamnetin re -
duces markers of liver damage and oxidative stress, including 
superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT).
Ellagic acid is a potent polyphenol found in fruits and vegeta -
bles, widely recognized for its antioxidant properties and ability 
to neutralize free radicals (Alfei and Zuccari  2024). However, its 
bioavailability is limited due to poor water solubility and rapid 
metabolism (Alfei and Zuccari 2025). It combats aging by reduc-
ing oxidative stress, inflammation, and mitochondrial dysfunc -
tion. Additionally, it can be metabolized into urolithin, which 
enhances its bioactivity (Sun 2024 ).

The daily oral administration of CJ at a dosage of 10 mL kg−1 body 
weight for 30 days did not induce any discernible toxic effects in 
rats. Throughout the study, no mortality or significant clinical ab-
normalities were found in the group that received treatment, and 
the animals exhibited normal body weight progression, compa -
rable to that of the control group. Assessments of body mass and 
hepatic indices revealed no signs of toxicity linked to CJ adminis-
tration, further supporting the extract's safety profile.
Conversely, NiSO4 injections led to a significant reduction in body 
weight and an increase in the hepatic index, highlighting its hepa-
totoxic effects. However, oral administration of CJ markedly miti-
gated these alterations. Intraperitoneal injection of NiSO4 resulted 
in a pronounced decrease in weight gain (p < 0.001) and a significant 
rise in the hepatic index (p < 0.01) compared to the control group.  
These variations indicate liver toxicity and metabolic disturbances.
However, daily administration of CJ for 30 days enhanced growth 
performance. Treatment with the cladode extract significantly re-
duced the hepatic index (p < 0.05) and improved body weight gain 
(p < 0.001) compared to the NiSO4 group, suggesting a protective 
effect of cladodes against NiSO4- induced toxicity.
The tolerance of CJ, with no signs of toxicity or clinical symp -
toms, reinforces its potential as a natural hepatoprotective agent. 
Moreover, the improvement in body weight may reflect not only 
protection against muscle mass loss but also stimulation of ana -
bolic processes, suggesting that CJ could aid in restoring normal 
metabolic functions disrupted by toxins such as NiSO 4.
Several studies have demonstrated that the relative liver weight 
is a sensitive marker of hepatotoxicity in experimental models 
of liver injury induced by toxins such as nickel sulfate (NiSO 4) 
(Adeyemi and Orekoya  2014; Faoziyat et  al. 2014). In line with 
this, multiple authors have reported that nickel accumulation 
in the liver is associated with an increase in the hepatic index 
(Bouhalit and Kechrid  2018; Derbal et  al.  2022), further sup -
porting the link between NiSO 4 exposure and liver dysfunction. 
While NiSO 4 exhibits hepatotoxic effects, the cladodes of OFI  
have shown hepatoprotective properties in other toxicity models. 
Their mode of action, primarily through oxidative stress reduc -
tion, suggests a potential to mitigate nickel- induced liver damage 
(Brahmi et al. 2011; Makeen et al. 2019). Phenolic compounds in 
plants are widely recognized for their health benefits, primarily 
due to their antioxidant properties. Their hydroxyl groups and ar-
omatic structure enable them to neutralize free radicals (Villaño 
et  al. 2007). These effects result from the synergistic action of 
flavonoids, particularly quercetin, known as the most potent free 
radical scavenger (Stintzing and Carle 2005; Hfaiedh et al. 2008).
3.4   |   Effect on Enzymatic Biomarkers (ALT, AST, 
ALP, and GGT)
Table 3 illustrates the effect of Opuntia ficus indica cladode juice 
on the enzymatic activities of alanine aminotransferase (ALT), 
aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), 
and gamma- glutamyl transferase (GGT).
3.4.1   |   Hepatocytolysis (ALT, AST)
The findings demonstrated that nickel exposure (Ni group) elic -
ited a highly significant increase ( p < 0.001) in serum alanine 
FIGURE 1    |    Chromatogram of polyphenols in Opuntia ficus indica  cladode juice.

aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) 
activities, both well-  established biomarkers of hepatocellular 
injury. These elevations indicate nickel-  induced hepatic impair-
ment. Administration of cladode juice significantly attenuated 
(p < 0.01) these ALT and AST elevations, highlighting its hepa -
toprotective potential.
The pronounced increase in transaminases (ALT, AST) in the 
Ni group suggests impaired hepatic function, corroborating 
findings from previous studies (Lee et al.  2007; Yang et al. 2011; 
Kuriakose et al. 2017).
Compared to the Ni group, cladode juice administration signifi -
cantly mitigated these elevations ( p < 0.01 for ALT and AST) in 
the JC + Ni group, indicating a beneficial effect on hepatic func -
tion. Moreover, cladode juice treatment in the JC group did not 
induce significant changes in the enzymatic markers assessed, 
suggesting that its protective effects are specific to nickel- 
induced toxicity.
For the diagnosis and ongoing management of liver disorders, the 
measurement of Hepatocytolysis markers like ALT and AST is es-
sential (Bishnoi et al. 2024). Hepatic dysfunction can be accurately 
detected biochemically by elevated serum levels of AST and ALT, 
which are caused by damaged hepatocytes releasing more of these 
enzymes (Sharma and Shukla 2011; Kharchoufa et al. 2020).
3.4.2   |   Cholestasis (ALP, GGT)
However, alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and gamma-  glutamyl 
transferase (GGT) activities, which are associated with choles -
tatic processes and bile duct dysfunction, were also significantly 
elevated in the Ni group ( p < 0.001). Such increases are com -
monly associated with obstruction or damage to the biliary tract, 
leading to impaired bile flow and accumulation of bile acids in 
the liver (Lee et al. 2007; Yang et al. 2011; Kuriakose et al. 2017).
In the JC + Ni group, the addition of cladode juice significantly 
reduced these increases (p < 0.001 for ALP and p < 0.01 for GGT) 
compared to the Nickel (Ni) group, suggesting a beneficial im -
pact on liver function.
Furthermore, the administration of cladode juice in the JC group 
did not elicit noteworthy alterations in the evaluated cholestasis 
biomarkers, indicating that its protective properties are particu -
larly tailored to counteract nickel- induced toxicity.
The potent antioxidant activity of Opuntia ficus indica cladodes, 
attributed to their high content of bioactive phytochemicals such 
as polyphenols and flavonoids, may underlie their hepatopro -
tective properties (Slimane et  al.  2024). These compounds en -
hance liver function and confer protection against hepatic injury 
through their antioxidative and anti- inflammatory mechanisms 
(Abbas et al. 2022).
Moreover, GGT levels fluctuate depending on the nature of liver 
disorders, with their elevation being a highly sensitive marker of 
hepatic impairment and a valuable tool in clinical investigations 
(Xing et al. 2022).
3.5   |   Effect on Plasma Direct Bilirubin (DB) 
and Total Bilirubin (TB) Levels
To evaluate the NiSO 4 intoxication as well as the potential pro -
tective effect of the juice of Opuntia ficus indica cladodes (CJ), 
total (TB), direct (DB), and indirect bilirubin (IB = TB–DB) were 
measured. The results are indicated in Table 4 .
Exposure to NiSO 4 resulted in a highly significant increase 
in total bilirubin levels (3.67 ± 0.13 mg/L; p  < 0.001) and di -
rect bilirubin levels (0.89 ± 0.14 mg/L; p < 0.001) compared 
to the control group (1.03 ± 0.01 mg/L and 0.53 ± 0.03 mg/L, 
respectively). The calculation of indirect bilirubin showed a

clear increase (2.78 ± 0.27 mg/L against 0.50 ± 0.04 mg/L in 
the controls), suggesting a mixed liver injury which is charac -
teristically described as “hepatocellular jaundice”. This type 
of jaundice occurs when the mechanisms of conjugation and 
bile excretion of bilirubin are both incapacitated, as in cases 
of toxic hepatitis.
The combined treatment with cladodes juice and NiSO 4 
(CJ + Ni) made it possible to significantly reduce the lev -
els of total bilirubin (2.49 ± 0.13 mg/L; p < 0.05), direct bil -
irubin (0.62 ± 0.03 mg/L; p < 0.05), and indirect bilirubin 
(1.87 ± 0.16 mg/L), thus showing an improvement in liver 
function. The decrease in these levels indicates an improve -
ment in liver damage and incomplete but recovering hepato -
biliary function.
Moreover, the administration of cladode juice alone, without 
NiSO4 exposure, did not lead to significant changes in total, 
direct, and indirect bilirubin concentrations compared to the 
healthy control group. The differences observed between the 
groups did not reach statistical significance ( p < 0.05). This 
indicates that, in the absence of toxic stress induced by met -
als such as nickel, cladode juice does not appear to notably 
affect bilirubin levels and, therefore, does not disrupt its nor -
mal metabolism. These findings suggest that cladode juice has 
neither hepatotoxic effects nor an impact on bilirubin metab -
olism in healthy subjects, further supporting its safety when 
consumed alone.
The administration of NiSO 4 in rats leads to an elevation in 
serum bilirubin levels, indicating liver injury (Bouhalit and 
Kechrid  2018). Similarly, direct bilirubin levels have been pos -
itively correlated with the severity of hepatic dysfunction and 
other conditions related to oxidative stress (Song et al. 2022 ).
Furthermore, Okaiyeto et al. (2018) reported that elevated serum 
bilirubin levels are indicative of increased erythrocyte degrada -
tion. Additionally, an increase in blood bilirubin levels may re -
sult from enhanced tissue destruction or bile duct obstruction 
(Sabiu et al. 2015).
The therapeutic properties of OFI  cladodes in improving liver 
function highlight their potential as a natural remedy for sup -
porting liver health and preventing the progression of metabolic 
disorders and diabetes-  related complications (Jain et al.  2023). 
Their hepatoprotective effects are attributed to their anti- 
inflammatory and antioxidant properties. Several studies have 
confirmed their ability to reduce cytokines associated with 
liver damage, thereby helping to mitigate hepatic injury (Abbas 
et al. 2022; Mannaa and Abdel- Wahhab 2016).
3.6   |   Effect on Plasma Total Protein 
and Glucose Levels
The plasma concentrations of total proteins and glucose in 
treated and untreated animals are presented in Table 5 .
Nickel sulfate (NiSO 4) exposure induced a significant decline 
in plasma total protein concentrations ( p < 0.001) while mark-
edly elevating blood glucose levels ( p < 0.001) compared to the 
healthy control group. However, cladode juice administration 
over 30 days exerted a notable protective effect against these 
biochemical disturbances. This supplementation mitigated 
the reduction in total protein levels ( p < 0.05) and effectively 
restrained the rise in plasma glucose concentrations ( p < 0.05) 
observed in the JC + Ni group.
Furthermore, cladode juice administration alone (JC group) re -
sulted in a non- significant decrease in glucose concentration and 
a non- significant increase in total protein concentration compared 
to the normal control group. The variations observed between 
these two groups did not reach statistical significance ( p < 0.05), 
indicating the absence of a measurable effect of cladode juice on 
these parameters under normal conditions.
Additionally, in the absence of toxic stress, particularly that 
induced by nickel exposure, cladode juice does not disrupt the 
normal metabolism of these substances. These findings further 
support the notion that cladodes do not exert adverse metabolic 
effects under non-  toxic conditions and exhibit beneficial mod -
ulatory properties, helping to maintain the balance of plasma 
parameters disrupted by NiSO 4 exposure. This highlights their 
safety when consumed under physiological conditions.
Studies have demonstrated that the consumption of OFI cladodes 
leads to a significant reduction in blood glucose levels in rats as 
well as in healthy individuals following a glucose tolerance test 
(Butterweck et al. 2010; Proeyen et al. 2012). Research by Avila- 
Nava et al. ( 2014) highlighted a significant increase in plasma 
antioxidant capacity after the intake of OFI  extracts, which are 
rich in phenolic compounds. These findings suggest a promising 
potential for mitigating oxidative stress and inflammation.
Dahdouh et  al.  (2014) reported that exposure to NiSO 4 leads 
to a significant reduction in serum total protein and albumin

levels, indicating liver dysfunction and impaired protein synthe-
sis. Similarly, it has been associated with an increase in blood 
glucose concentrations, suggesting disruptions in glucose me -
tabolism and a potential risk of insulin resistance (Bouhalit and 
Kechrid 2018).
3.7   |   Effect on MDA and SOD Activity in 
NiSO4- Intoxicated Rats
The impact of the effect of OFI cladode juice on lipid peroxida -
tion and SOD activity in treated experimental animals is pre -
sented in Figure 2 .
Intraperitoneal administration of nickel sulfate (NiSO 4) in 
rats triggered pronounced oxidative stress, as evidenced by a 
significant elevation in hepatic malondialdehyde (MDA) lev -
els ( p < 0.001), indicating heightened lipid peroxidation and 
membrane damage driven by reactive oxygen species (ROS). 
Concurrently, a marked decline in superoxide dismutase (SOD) 
activity (p < 0.001) was observed, suggesting an inhibitory effect 
of NiSO4 on this critical antioxidant enzyme.
Daily administration of OFI cladode juice for 30 days in 
NiSO4- exposed rats led to a significant reduction in MDA lev -
els ( p < 0.001), reflecting an attenuation of lipid peroxidation 
due to the antioxidant properties of its bioactive compounds. 
Furthermore, pre-  exposure supplementation conferred notable 
protection against oxidative stress, as evidenced by a significant 
increase in SOD activity ( p < 0.05) in treated animals. These 
findings indicate that cladode juice, enriched with antioxidant 
and anti-  inflammatory agents, exerts a prophylactic effect by 
preserving cellular redox homeostasis under nickel-  induced ox-
idative insult.
Moreover, the administration of cladode juice alone in healthy 
rats led to a slight reduction in hepatic MDA levels, though this 
decrease did not reach statistical significance ( p < 0.05), sug-
gesting a mild antioxidant effect in the absence of exogenous 
oxidative stress. Similarly, no significant alteration in SOD ac -
tivity was detected, indicating that cladode juice functions as an 
adaptive modulator, enhancing enzymatic response only under 
oxidative challenge, such as that induced by NiSO 4 exposure.
The observed benefits of cladode juice, though more pronounced 
under induced oxidative stress, may also contribute to maintain-
ing hepatic redox balance in healthy individuals. Preliminary 
findings suggest that cladodes could enhance baseline antioxi -
dant status by moderately reducing spontaneous lipid peroxida -
tion (Besné-  Eseverri et al.  2023). These effects may stem from 
the high concentration of phytochemicals such as flavonoids 
and polyphenols, known for their ability to scavenge reactive 
oxygen species (ROS) and prevent lipid membrane damage 
(Zeghbib et al. 2022; Ahmedah 2023).
3.8   |   Effect on GSH, GSH- Px and Catalase in 
NiSO4- Intoxicated Rats
The impact of the juice effect of OFI cladodes on the levels of 
reduced glutathione (GSH), glutathione peroxidase (GSH- Px), 
and catalase (CAT) activity in treated experimental animals is 
shown in Figure 3 .
Intraperitoneal injection of nickel sulfate (NiSO 4) resulted in a 
highly significant decrease ( p < 0.001) in reduced glutathione 
(GSH), glutathione peroxidase (GSH- Px), and catalase (CAT) lev-
els in exposed rats compared to the healthy control group. This 
reduction indicates significant oxidative stress, accompanied by

an increase in reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, leading 
to redox imbalances and increased cellular damage. The decline 
in GSH reflects an impairment of the primary antioxidant defense 
system, while the decrease in GSH- Px and CAT further compro-
mises the hepatic cells' ability to neutralize peroxides and mitigate 
NiSO4- induced oxidative stress. However, the preventive admin-
istration of OFI cladode juice for 30 days prior to NiSO4 exposure 
exerted a notable protective effect by alleviating oxidative stress. 
Compared to untreated intoxicated rats, those receiving cladode 
juice exhibited significantly higher GSH, GSH- Px, and CAT levels 
(p < 0.01 to p < 0.001), indicating a beneficial modulation of antiox-
idant defense mechanisms. The increase in CAT levels facilitated 
the decomposition of hydrogen peroxide (H 2O2) into water and 
oxygen, thereby reducing its toxic accumulation in hepatic cells. 
These findings suggest that the bioactive compounds present in 
OFI cladodes enhance the body's antioxidant system and mitigate 
the deleterious effects of NiSO 4- induced oxidative stress, high -
lighting their protective potential against oxidative agents.
The exclusive administration of OFI  cladode juice to rats, in 
the absence of NiSO 4 exposure, showed no signs of intoxica -
tion or notable physiological alterations compared to healthy 
control rats. Statistical analysis of reduced glutathione (GSH) 
levels revealed no significant difference ( p > 0.05) between the 
group receiving cladode juice alone and the control group, sug -
gesting the absence of toxic effects under normal physiological 
conditions. Similarly, although an increase in glutathione per -
oxidase (GSH- Px) levels was observed in treated rats compared 
to controls, this elevation did not reach statistical significance 
(p < 0.05), indicating that cladode juice does not exert any harm-
ful effects on cellular antioxidant systems. Conversely, in rats 
exposed to NiSO 4, prior administration of cladode juice helped 
preserve GSH levels and mitigate oxidative stress, suggesting 
a potential protective role by enhancing intrinsic antioxidant 
defenses. Regarding catalase (CAT) activity, a slight but non- 
significant decrease ( p < 0.05) was observed in rats receiving 
cladode juice alone, without indicating any disruption of endog-
enous antioxidant defense mechanisms. These findings confirm 
the safety of OFI cladode juice and support its potential as a nat-
ural, risk- free supplement capable of modulating oxidative stress 
induced by toxic agents such as nickel sulfate.
The cladodes of OFI contain bioactive compounds, such as poly-
phenols and flavonoids, which play a key role in modulating anti-
oxidant activity and reducing oxidative damage (Ďuračková 2010; 
Voronkova et al. 2018). Their consumption can stimulate glutathi-
one peroxidase (GSH- Px) activity, thereby strengthening cellular 
antioxidant defenses and helping to mitigate oxidative stress re -
sulting from an imbalance between free radicals and antioxidants. 
According to Chekkal et al. (2019), young cactus cladodes exert a 
protective effect against oxidative stress induced by an unbalanced 
diet, as evidenced by increased GSH- Px activity and reduced lipid 
peroxidation. Furthermore, the antioxidant properties of OFI cla-
dodes contribute to the preservation of catalase activity in hepatic 
cells, which is essential for counteracting peroxide accumulation 
(Rocchetti et  al. 2018). Additionally, their anti- inflammatory ef-
fects support liver function by minimizing inflammation, a factor 
that can compromise catalase activity (Caroline et al. 2024).

3.9   |   Histological Study
Figure 4 illustrates the effect of cladode juice on the histological 
alterations in the liver of rats intoxicated with NiSO 4.
Histological examination of liver sections reveals marked differ -
ences between control rats, NiSO 4- exposed rats, and those pre -
treated with cladode juice (CJ). These observations provide deeper 
insights into the potential hepatoprotective effects of CJ against 
oxidative and inflammatory stress induced by nickel exposure, as 
well as the cellular responses and defense mechanisms involved.
In control rats (Figure  4A), liver sections exhibit hepatic paren -
chyma with structurally normal characteristics. Hepatocyte 
trabeculae are regularly aligned, featuring rounded nuclei and 
showing no signs of lobular necrosis, indicative of hepatic in -
tegrity (blue arrow). The portal spaces contain well-  organized 
portal structures embedded in connective tissue, with a few 
scattered lymphocytes (red arrow), likely ensuring minimal 
immune surveillance without triggering an inflammatory re -
sponse. A mild sinusoidal dilation is observed (yellow arrow), 
which may be attributed to volumetric overload following in -
creased water intake. These findings confirm the absence of 
cellular disturbances or functional impairments, providing a 
morphological reference for the liver under normal physiologi -
cal conditions.
Administration of cladode juice (Figure  4B) in the absence of 
NiSO4 exposure did not induce any significant alterations in 
the hepatic parenchyma, suggesting that cladode juice does 
not interfere with hepatic homeostasis under non-  stressed 
conditions. Hepatocyte trabeculae remain structurally intact 
(blue arrow), with no signs of dilation or necrosis, and the 
portal spaces retain their normal architecture without notable 
inflammation (red arrow). These findings confirm that cla -
dode juice does not exert hepatotoxic effects on its own but 
may possess protective and anti-  inflammatory properties in 
the presence of hepatic injury.
FIGURE 4    |    Effect of OFI cladode juice on liver histological alterations in NiSO4- intoxicated rats. Histological sections of liver tissue (stained with 
hematoxylin–eosin) were examined in the normal control group (A), the group treated with cladode juice (B), the group exposed to nickel sulfate 
(NiSO4) (C), and the group receiving cladode juice + NiSO 4 (D). Observed features include normal sinusoidal dilation (yellow arrow), a portal struc -
ture (red arrow), hepatocytic trabeculae (blue arrow), portal inflammation (gray arrow), and interface hepatitis (green arrow).

In rats exposed to NiSO 4, histological examination reveals pro -
nounced hepatic alterations (Figure  4C). Hepatocyte trabec -
ulae exhibit focal sinusoidal dilation, indicative of impaired 
microcirculation, a phenomenon commonly associated with ox -
idative stress. This dilation may result from fluid overload due to 
a nickel- induced metabolic imbalance, leading to the accumu -
lation of reactive oxygen species in the liver. The portal spaces 
exhibit dense and chronic inflammatory infiltration (gray 
arrow), consisting predominantly of lymphocytes with a few 
polymorphonuclear neutrophils, contributing to mild to mod -
erate interface hepatitis (green arrow). The pro-  inflammatory 
properties of nickel within the hepatic parenchyma likely ac -
count for this portal inflammation and associated interface 
hepatitis. High-  magnification imaging highlights the severity 
of the portal inflammatory infiltrate, predominantly composed 
of lymphocytes and scattered polymorphonuclear cells (gray 
arrow), nearly obstructing all portal structures, with only a sin -
gle remaining portal arteriole (red arrow).

Rats pretreated for 30 days with cladode juice before NiSO 4 ex-
posure exhibit significant protection against nickel-  induced 
toxicity (Figure  4D). Although mild sinusoidal dilation persists, 
indicating some degree of microvascular stress, inflammatory 
infiltration around the portal structures is markedly reduced. 
The portal space (red arrow) contains only a few scattered lym -
phocytes within the connective tissue (blue arrow), with no 
significant inflammatory density, suggesting a mitigation of 
the excessive immune response triggered by nickel exposure. 
Additionally, interface hepatitis is completely resolved, with a 
preserved hepatocyte limiting plate, indicating restoration of 
hepatocyte membrane integrity and reestablishment of normal 
trabecular organization.
The observed protective effects can be attributed to the antioxi -
dant and anti- inflammatory properties of cladode juice, which is 
rich in bioactive compounds. Previous studies on liver histology 
have documented nickel- induced alterations, such as sinusoidal 
dilation, vacuolization, and hepatocytes exhibiting deformed 
nuclei (Rao et  al.  2009; Fatmi et  al.  2018). Furthermore, ox -
idative stress plays a crucial role in hepatic dysfunction and 
contributes to the progression of chronic liver diseases (Li 
et al. 2015). Given their significant involvement in liver failure, 
antioxidants have been extensively investigated for their poten -
tial in preventing and managing both acute and chronic hepatic 
disorders (Adak  2018). Consequently, numerous studies have 
demonstrated the beneficial effects of antioxidants, particularly 
in the prophylaxis and treatment of liver injuries. The prevailing 
hypothesis suggests that intensive antioxidant intervention may 
enhance recovery outcomes in cases of hepatic damage (Touiss 
et al. 2021).
3.10   |   Docking Molecular
To achieve our goal, we tested four bioactive compounds against 
alanine aminotransferase. Molecular docking analysis of these 
compounds revealed that all of them exhibited highly negative 
binding energy values. The molecular docking results for the 
four identified molecules with the target protein are presented 
in Table 6 and Figure 5.
The table shows that p-  coumaric acid with a binding energy of 
−6.35 Kcal/mol has a stronger interaction than ellagic acid with 
−5.74 Kcal/mol. Thus, Isorhamnetin 3-  o- neohesperoside with 
an Ic of 9.36 mM is less effective than p- coumaric acid with an Ic 
of 22.27 μM. Due to its high binding affinity and low inhibitory 
concentration, p-  coumaric acid appears to be the most promis -
ing candidate for therapeutic applications.
The results of the molecular docking study showed that the 
Ellagic acid compound had five hydrogen bond interactions 
with the protein residues Val A:306, Tyr A:106, Asp A:304, and 
Phe A:313. In addition, the compound p-  coumaric acid exhib -
ited an interaction at a hydrogen bond with the protein residue 
Arg A:494, as well as two pi-  alkyl bonds with the protein res -
idues Val A:507 and Met A:495. The Piscidic acid exhibited a 
four- hydrogen bond interaction with the protein residues Ser 
A:304, Asn A:271, Tyr A:440, and Arg A:494. Isorhamnetin3-  o- 
neohesperoside had four hydrogen bonds with the protein resi -
dues Tyr A:216, Leu A:218, Tyr A:62, and Val A:64.
After analyzing the molecular docking results of the four 
compounds, we found that they successfully interacted with 
and correlated to the binding sites of the selected protein. 
This strong interaction suggests that these compounds have 
a high affinity for the target protein, potentially influencing 
its biological activity. Given their binding properties, it can be 
inferred that these compounds may exhibit significant antiox -
idant activity, which could contribute to their potential thera -
peutic benefits.
It is widely known that bioactive compounds that contain a phe-
nolic ring and a hydroxyl group have superior antioxidant activity 
(Pripdeevech et al. 2025). Nevertheless, the results of this molec-
ular anchoring research suggest opportunities for the use of cla -
dodes juice as effective antioxidants by reducing oxidative stress.
4   |   Conclusion
This study highlights the hepatoprotective properties of the 
polyphenols found in Opuntia ficus indica cladode juice. 
Analyses revealed a significant level of phenolic compounds, 
particularly polyphenols and flavonoids, that contribute to the 
protective effect on liver function. Assessment of hepatic en -
zymatic biomarkers and oxidative stress provided significant 
results, supporting both the safety of the cladode juice and its 
potential as a protective agent against NiSO4- induced liver dam-
age. Furthermore, histopathological examinations revealed dis -
tinct differences between groups, confirming the protective role 
of the juice against nickel-  induced hepatic lesions. Molecular 
docking analysis of the four polyphenolic compounds present in 
the juice demonstrated their interaction with and alignment to 
the binding sites of target protein, suggesting that these com -
pounds possess notable antioxidant properties.
