Summary
Transaminases (TAs) are promising biocatalysts for
chiral amine synthesis; however, only few ther-
mophilic TAs have been described to date. In this
work, a genome mining approach was taken to seek
novel TAs from nine thermophilic microorganisms.
TA sequences were identiﬁed from their respective
genome sequences and their Pfam were predicted
conﬁrming that TAs class I–II are the most abundant
(50%), followed by class III (26%), V (16%), IV (8%)
and VI (1%). The percentage of open reading frames
(ORFs) that are TAs ranges from 0.689% inThermo-
coccus litoralis to 0.424% inSulfolobus solfataricus.
A total of 94 putative TAs were successfully cloned
and expressed into E. coli, showing mostly good
expression levels when using a chemical chaperone
media containing D-sorbitol. Kinetic and end-point
colorimetric assays with different amino donors–ac-
ceptors conﬁrmed TAs activity allowing for initial
exploration of the substrate scope. Stereoselective
and non-stereoselective serine-TAs were selected for
the synthesis of hydroxypyruvate (HPA). Low HPA
reaction yields were observed with four non-
stereoselective serine-TAs, whilst two stereoselec-
tive serine-TAs showed signi ﬁcantly higher yields.
Coupling serine-TA reactions to a transketolase to
yield L-erythrulose (Ery) substantially increased ser-
ine conversion into HPA. Combining both stereose-
lective serine-TAs and transketolase using the
inexpensive racemic D/L-serine led to high Ery yield
(82%). Thermal characterization of stereoselective
serine-TAs conﬁrmed they have excellent thermosta-
bility up to 60/C176 C and high optimum temperatures.
Introduction
Transaminases (TAs, EC 2.6.1.X) are a widely dis-
tributed group of enzymes that play an important role in
cell metabolism speciﬁcally in the nitrogen recycling and
ﬁxation from internal and exogenous amino acids. TAs
are pyridoxal-5 0-phosphate (PLP)-dependent enzymes
whose ping – pong mechanism reaction is very well
understood (Ward and Wohlgemuth, 2010). TAs catalyse
the transfer of an amine group from an amine donor to
an amine acceptor (ketone or aldehyde) yielding the cor-
responding ketone or aldehyde and a new chiral amine
compound, respectively, where the cofactor PLP is fully
regenerated at the end of the reaction (Eliot and Kirsch,
2004).
Based upon protein sequence homology analyses,
TAs have been divided into six protein families (Pfam)o r
classes (Mehta and Hale, 1993; Hwang et al., 2005;
Steffen-Munsberg et al., 2015) as follows: I – II (Pfam
00155, e.g. AspTA and aromatic TAs); III or also called
x-TAs (Pfam 00202, e.g. amine TAs and ornithine TA),
which have broad substrate speciﬁcities being useful for
the synthesis of chiral amines and unnatural amino acids
(Kelly et al., 2018); IV (Pfam 01063, e.g. branched-chain
TAs and D-amino acid TAs); V (Pfam 00266, e.g. PSer
TA) and VI (Pfam 01041) also known as sugar TAs,
mostly involved in the amino sugar synthesis occurring
in cells producing secondary metabolites (Nedal and
Zotchev, 2004). The sequence similarities between TAs
appear to be closely related with their functional speci-
ﬁcity, and in spite of the TAs varied amino donor speci-
ﬁcity, the common amino acceptor within cells is either
a-ketoglutarate or pyruvate (Mehta et al., 1993); this is
particularly interesting as these two compounds can be
used for initial TAs activity screening and substrate
scope studies.
TAs from all classes have been utilized in the synthe-
sis of ﬁne chemicals and pharmaceuticals (Savileet al.,
2010; Kelly et al., 2020), particularly for the sustainable
production or chiral amine compounds such as a-, b-
and x-amino acids, unnatural amino acids and primary
amines (aliphatic, aromatic and aminoalcohols) (C/C19arde-
nas-Fern/C19andez et al., 2012a,b; Rudat and Brucher,

2012; Guo and Berglund, 2017). It is estimated that 40%
of pharmaceuticals contain a chiral amine component in
their structure, however, their chemical synthesis is still
challenging (Ghislieri and Turner, 2014). The main
advantages of TAs application compared with chemical
synthesis are their excellent regio- and stereoselectivity
as well as acting under mild reaction conditions avoiding
the utilization of often toxic catalysts and solvents. Sev-
eral review papers have been published summarizing
the great potential of TAs and their current applications
at industrial scale, as well as highlighting the importance
to keep searching for novel TAs with better features than
the existing ones (Kohls and Steffen-Munsberg, 2014;
Guo and Berglund, 2017; Kellyet al., 2020).
Thermostable enzymes possess high optimum temper-
atures and show extended activity half-lives at high tem-
peratures, being more robust and stable in such
conditions and able to retain their activity in the pres-
ence of protein denaturing organic solvents, which are
often needed for solubilizing hydrophobic substrates
compared with their mesophilic counterparts (Atalah
et al., 2019). Performing biocatalytic processes at high
temperatures allows increasing substrate and product
solubility as well as minimizing the risk of microbial con-
tamination (Littlechild et al., 2007; Mehta et al., 2016).
For all these reasons, thermostable enzymes are highly
desirable as biocatalysts. Currently, a few thermostable
enzymes are used in combination with conventional
chemical synthesis for the production of pure drugs of
interest to pharmaceutical and agrochemical companies
(Littlechild, 2015).
Thermophilic microorganisms, including bacteria and
archaea that live in natural high-temperature environ-
ments, are an important source of thermostable enzymes
(Vieille and Zeikus, 2001; Littlechild, 2015). Nowadays,
most of the TAs described are from mesophilic origin,
isolated mainly from single strains and more recently
from metagenomes (Baud et al., 2017; Leipold et al.,
2019). Only very few thermostable TAs have been
reported to date with different applications (Chenet al.,
2016; Mathew et al., 2016; Ferrandi et al., 2017; Bawn
et al., 2018; M/C19arquez and Atalah, 2019); however, ther-
mostable TAs are not currently commercially available
(Atalah et al., 2019). The discovery of novel thermophilic
TAs remains rather under-explored despite the increas-
ing demand for these enzyme classes. The advantage
of using thermostable TAs in chiral amine synthesis
relies on their better compatibility with industrial require-
ments (as explained above) allowing the achievement of
higher reaction throughputs, increased productivity and
the lowering of process costs.
The objectives of this work were to clone novel puta-
tive TAs from thermophilic strains using a genome min-
ing approach, to establish a methodology for quick
enzyme expression and recovery and to con ﬁrm TAs
activity via activity assays with natural amino donors– ac-
ceptors. In addition, we aim to demonstrate the applica-
bility on this enzyme discovery process in the synthesis
of hydroxypyruvate (an important chemical intermediate
for biologically active chiral aminocyclitols) catalysed by
stereoselective and non-stereoselective thermostable
serine-TAs.
Results and discussion
Discovery and phylogeny of TAs from thermophiles
Only a few thermostable TAs have been reported to date
in spite of their high demand in industrial processes for
the synthesis of chiral amines used, for example, in the
production of active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs).
Several approaches are taken for novel enzyme discov-
ery including activity-guided (using media enriched with
a desired substrate) genome mining through protein
sequence homology from databases, motif-based analy-
ses and metagenomics; each strategy having their own
beneﬁts and drawbacks.
In this work, TAs from nine extremophilic microorganism
from our own collection were sought by mining for TAs in
their genome sequences using their translated genomes
in the NCBI or UniProtKB protein database. Thisin silico
approach of using enzyme name ( ‘transaminase’ or
‘aminotransferase’) searches in a thermophiles’ genomes
improves the chances to reveal functional thermostable
TAs. Two of the selected strains (T. litoralis and S. solfa-
taricus) are from the Archaeal kingdom;T. aquaticus, D.
geothermalis, D. radiodurans and T. maritima are gram-
negative bacteria, whilst T. fusca , S. viridis
and G.
stearothermophilus are gram-positive ones.
In total 157 putative TA sequences were retrieved and
then subjected to PHMMER analysis in order to predict
and conﬁrm their Pfam annotation. Eighty-four per cent
of the TA sequences found in the database were con-
ﬁrmed to belong to the TAs superfamily, whilst the rest
were wrongly annotated being associated with other
PLP-dependent enzyme families.
The percentage of open reading frames (ORFs) for
these TAs was T. litoralis 0.689%, S. solfataricus
0.424%, T. aquaticus 0.633%, T. fusca 0.620%, D.
geothermalis 0.495%, D. radiodurans 0.588%, G.
stearothermophilus 0.483%, S. viridis 0.446% and T.
maritima 0.487%.
Distribution of TAs class per microorganism is
depicted in Fig. 1. On average TAs class I– II are the
most abundant one (50%), followed by type III (26%), V
(16%) and VI (1%). Only 8% of the TAs are class IV,
and interestingly, this type of TAs were not found in the
archaea strains. Only two TAs class VI were found and
these were both in the S. viridis strain, which was

expected as this type of TAs are more commonly found
in actinomycetes which are producers of secondary
metabolites such as antibiotics or amino sugars. This
was not the case of T. fusca which is also an actino-
mycete but it has a relatively small genome for the acti-
nobacteria and has only one secondary metabolite gene
cluster (Dimise and Widboom, 2008).
From the 132 identiﬁed TAs, 18 were previously pub-
lished (Bommer, 2007; Bommer and Ward, 2013;
Villegas-Torres et al., 2015; Bawn et al., 2018), and
therefore discarded from this study. TAs class VI were
also not considered in this work. The rest were ampliﬁed
by PCR and then cloned using our in-house one-pot
restriction-ligation reaction method with Type IIS endonu-
cleases and modiﬁed pET28/29a+ plasmids (Dobrijevic
et al., 2020). Positive clones were then con ﬁrmed by
sequencing. A total of 94 putative TAs were selected to
build our TAs panel in a 96-well plate format and pQR
numbers (the Ward group plasmid identiﬁer) were con-
secutively assigned from pQR2501 to pQR2594 (See
protein IDs in Table S1). Overall, this efﬁcient targeted
approach allowed identifying and cloning putative TAs
from thermophiles with 84% success rate.
The 94 selected TAs from thermophiles and CV2025
[one of the most characterized and widely utilizedx-TAs
with proven applicability in the synthesis of chiral amines
(Kaulmann et al., 2007)] were subjected to multiple protein
sequence alignment and a phylogenetic tree was built as
shown in Fig. 2. TAs were easily grouped into four clades
corresponding to each TA class (I– II to V). pQR2574 is
annotated as a TA class I– II but it seems to be more evo-
lutionary related to TAs class V forming a sub-clade
together with pQR2517 and 2550. Likewise, although
pQR2555 was predicted to belong to TAs class IV, it might
be more closely associated with TAs class III.
Lysine residue (Lys288 in CV2025) in the active site is
highly conserved among most PLP-dependent enzymes,
whose ϵ-amine forms a Schiff’s base linkage with the C4-
aldehyde group of PLP, playing an important role in the
biocatalytic reaction (Steffen-Munsberget al., 2015). The
multiple sequence analysis revealed that 84% of the
TAs showed a conserved Lys288 in their structures
except for pQR2549 (class I – II), pQR2550 (class V),
TAs class IV and the sub-clade TA class V (pQR2594,
2518, 2505, 2582 and 2593); however, the latter have a
conserved Lys two positions forward. In addition,
Asp259 in CV2025 (responsible for the stabilization of
the proton from the nitrogen of PLP pyridine ring by
hydrogen bond coordination) is also highly conserved in
91% of our TAs, apart from the TAs class IV and
pQR2549 (Supporting Information).
Highly conserved amino acid residues (apart from Lys
and Asp in the active site) are found in most of our TAs
class I– II (based on pQR2502 sequence): Gly84, Phe/

TAs class III are the most studied ones due to their
wide variety of substrate acceptance and with an exten-
sive application in industry (Kellyet al., 2018). An intra-
protein sequence alignment of TAs class III in our panel
(Supporting Information) showed low homology (23 –
30%) related to CV2025. Likewise, 14 amino acid resi-
dues are highly conserved including key amino acid resi-
dues in the active site associated with the PLP biding
site (Humble et al., 2012; Henr/C19ıquez and Card/C19os-Elena,

Arg267, Lys288, Thr321 and Arg374 (except pQR2511);
in addition, Pro426 was also highly conserved. This
shows the potential that these TAs might possess with
improved features in terms of thermostability and sub-
strate scope.
From the protein sequence point of view, TAs class IV
seem to distinguish themselves the most from the other
TAs. Only four amino acids are highly conserved (based
on pQR2590 sequence, TA further studied here): Arg54,
Glu181, Asn186 and Leu205; whilst their Lys288 equiva-
lent is either Cys (for sub-clade pQR2516, 2554, 2555
and 2579) or Thr (for sub-clade pQR2504, 2529, 2590
and 2591), being presumably an indicative of substrate
speciﬁcity, not further studied here.
Regarding the 15 TAs class V, they have a low homol-
ogy between 12% and 38% to each other (except
pQR2519 and 2566 with 69% homology) andﬁve amino
acids are highly conserved (based on pQR2519, TAs fur-
ther studied here): Gly152, Asp172, Asp188 and Lys196
and Arg346.
A further intra- and inter-protein sequence analysis
would be necessary to better understand TAs phylogeny;
however, this is outside the scope of this study.
In addition, the average molecular weight of selected
TAs is 42 kDa ranging between 17 (pQR2549) and
57 kDa (pQR2593), 88% of them have a molecular weight
between 35 and 48 kDa. See Supporting Information for
more details regarding some of the selected TAs features
including protein accession numbers.
Expression and activity proﬁle of TAs from thermophiles
Enzyme expression and recovery of all 94 TAs at a time
in a 96-deep-well plate format was initially performed
with LB media, then cells were lysed in a water bath
sonicator, allowing the recovery of active TAs in one go,
avoiding the addition of chemical lysis buffers that might
lead to enzyme inactivation and false negatives during
activity screening. Low or poor expression was observed
in the soluble fraction for some following SDS-PAGE,
which can be as a result of low cell density at the end of
cultivation, the expression host used (associated with
codon bias or inclusion body formation) and/or cultivation
conditions (Rosano and Ceccarelli, 2014). Different
strategies to improve protein expression including the
use of enriched media (e.g. Terriﬁc broth) and chemical
chaperones are suggested prior to changing expression
host or synthesizing codon-optimized genes that can be
more laborious and expensive, especially when working
with a large number of enzymes. Addition of chemical
chaperones such as amino acids, sugars (e.g.
D-sorbitol)
or chaotropes in the cultivation medium have proven to
be beneﬁcial to produce recombinant enzymes in their
soluble form as they inhibit or diminish the formation of
inclusion bodies or protein aggregates when using
E. coli for protein expression (Prasad and Khadatare,
2011; Yang and Zhang, 2013). A combination of different
cultivation conditions using enriched cultivation media
with D-sorbitol as chemical chaperone as well as by low-
ering the temperature after induction was tested. Based
upon SDS-PAGE analysis of the clear lysates only (Sup-
porting Information), we concluded that the best cultiva-
tion conditions were as follows: Terriﬁc broth, D-sorbitol
0.5 M, PLP 0.2 mM and phosphate buffer 0.1 M pH 7
and 20°C post-induction. There was an improvement on
the TAs expression in most of the cases based on the
SDS-PAGE analysis. In the chemical chaperon media,
59% of TAs were well expressed and 17% showed low
expression level, whilst 24% exhibited poor or not appar-
ent expression (Table 1).
Then, in order to verify TA activity, initial qualitative
high-throughput screening assays with a series of amino
donors substrates and either pyruvate or KG as amino
acceptors were tested. As shown in Table 1, 80% of
TAs showed at least 1 type of activity; from these, 32
were able to accept more than two substrates, eight TAs
accepted four substrates and two TAs (pQR2516 and
2576 in panel positions C2 and G4, TAs class IV and III,
respectively) accepted ﬁve out of the seven substrates
tested. TAs class III are probably the most interesting
ones from the application point of view; herein, 44% of
the TAs class III showed some sort of activity, these
being the only ones able to accept 2-(4-nitrophenyl)
ethan-1-amine, an speciﬁc substrate forx-TA activity. In
addition, 16 TAs that were not apparently expressed
showed activity, which can be interpreted as TAs with
high speciﬁc activity; whilst 12 well-expressed enzymes
showed no activity probably due to the lack of appropri-
ate substrates.
Novel serine-TAs from thermophiles for HPA synthesis
Hydroxypyruvate is an expensive but vital substrate for
C-C bond forming enzymes such as transketolases
when used in biocatalysis, being a chemical intermediate
for the synthesis of monosaccharides and aminocyclitols.
Many strategies have been studied for itsin-situ produc-
tion in cascade reactions focusing on enzymatic meth-
ods using either TAs (Villegas-Torres et al ., 2015;
Lorilli/C18ere et al., 2017; Bawnet al., 2018) or
D-amino acid
oxidases (L’enfant et al., 2019) with either L-serine orD-
serine as precursors where the TA removes the amine
moiety to make hydroxypyruvatein situ. Despite the pro-
gress achieved regarding the HPA enzymatic synthesis,
the price of pure
L-serine or D-serine remains high.
Hence, we aimedﬁrst to seek non-stereoselective serine
TAs, as the racemic mixtureL/D-serine is on average up
to eight times cheaper than the pure stereoisomers.

Thermostable transaminases for biocatalysis 309
Based upon Abs600nm for the WST-1 assay of our TAs
from thermophiles panel, 18 and 17 TAs were able to
accept either
L-o r D-serine, respectively; from these
ones, eight TAs accepted both isomers almost equally
(based on
L- and D-serine Abs600nm ratio) considered
then as non-stereoselective serine-TAs. TAs pQR2502
(T. maritima), pQR2526 (T. aquaticus), pQR2577 and
2581 (both fromD. radiodurans) (Table 2) were selected
for the synthesis of HPA from L/D-serine (Fig. 3). The
two chosen had the least cross reactivity to the other
amino acid besides
L-alanine which is almost always an
activity with transaminases and one that may be desired
in using pyruvate as the acceptor in some cascades. All
bioconversion reactions were carried out at 40 /C176 Ct o
avoid HPA degradation, as this compound is unstable at
temperature above 50/C176 C (Lorilli/C18ere et al., 2017) and if it
is desired that the HPA build up as the end-product, it
needs to be under conditions where it is stable. How-
ever, if the HPA is removed using a second enzyme
such as a transketolase (TK), then the coupled cascade
of TA and TK can be carried out at high temperatures of
70 or 80 °C because the HPA generated is immedi-
ately used by the TK. HPA concentration was deter-
mined by HPLC analysis. As shown in Table 2, non-
stereoselective serine-TA activity was con ﬁrmed when
testing both serine isomers separately, showing in all the
cases relatively low HPA yields. When bioconversion

reaction yields were even lower than the yields showed
for the single isomer, probably due to a substrate inhibi-
tion.
The transamination reaction is reversible and suffers
from unfavourable reaction equilibrium that hamper bio-
conversion to achieve high yields. The equilibrium can
be shifted towards product formation by adding an
excess of amine donor or removing the productin situ
by coupling it to other enzymatic step (Tufvessonet al.,
2011). Non-stereoselective serine-TA reactions were
then coupled to a hyperthermophilic transketolase from
Thermotoga maritima (TK
tmar) reaction that catalyses the
C-C bond formation between HPA and glycoaldehyde to
yield Ery (Fig. 3) with almost 100% conversion (C/C19arde-
nas-Fern/C19andez et al., 2021). No HPA was detected in
these reactions as it was immediately used by the TK
tmar
for Ery formation. A signiﬁcant improvement on transami-
nation reaction was observed (Table 2). However,
reactions yields are still low to be considered for further
applications at this initial stage.
A second strategy to produce HPA from L/D-serine
was taken by combining two stereoselective serine-TAs,
one selective for L- and one selective for D-serine. The
WST-1 screening assay showed that TA pQR2519 (TA
class V, T. fusca) and pQR2590 (TA class IV, G.
stearothermophilus) accepted solely L- and D-serine
respectively. Then, their substrate selectivity was con-
ﬁrmed by HPLC reaching HPA yields of 14.2% and
33.8% after 24 h reaction, respectively; similar conver-
sion levels have been reported previously by using
mesophilic and thermophilic serine-TAs (Villegas-Torres
et al., 2015; Bawnet al., 2018). A potential enzyme inhi-
bition by the isomer counterpart was observed as the
HPA yields decreased by 2.4- and 1.8-fold, when using
serine racemic mixture. However, when the single TA
reactions were coupled to TK and in presence of both

isomers, the HPA yields rose back to 69.3% and 76.9%.
Then, both stereoselective serine-TAs were mixed in bio-
conversion reaction with the racemic L/D-serine, achiev-
ing 26.1% HPA yield. The L/D-serine conversion was
signiﬁcantly increased by 3.2-fold when coupling the TK
reaction reaching 82.3% Ery yield. An optimized cascade
reaction with a L-serine-TA from D. geothermalis
(Dgeo_0713) and a TK from E. coli was reported with
almost 100% Ery yield but using threefold
L-serine
excess compared with pyruvate and glycoaldehyde
(Villegas-Torres and Ward, 2018).
Thermal characterization of TAs pQR2519 and pQR2590
Stereoselective serine-TAs pQR2519 and pQR2590
were selected for their partial characterization based on
their good reaction yield performance for the bioconver-
sion of L-o r D-serine into HPA (section 3.3) in order to
conﬁrm they were thermophilic enzymes. The TAs
pQR2519 and pQR2590 optimum temperatures were 70
and 60°C respectively. TA pQR2590 showed a much
higher speciﬁc activity towards its respective serine iso-
mer than TA pQR2519 by two orders of magnitude
(Fig. 4A). Similar speci ﬁc activity values (around
3.5 µmol mg
-1 min-1) to TA pQR2590, for the same reac-
tion and similar reaction conditions, were reported for
two thermophilic L-serine-TAs fromD. geothermalis and
G. stearothermophilus(Bawn et al., 2018).
The application of thermophilic enzymes is not only
limited to biocatalytic reactions at high temperature (e.g.
> 60/C176 C) but they can also be used at moderate high
temperatures (e.g. 40 or 50°C as in this work) showing
extended half-lives (Fig. 4B) compared with their meso-
philic counterparts whose half-lives can be only of a few
minutes or hours when working at such temperatures, as
it has been already shown for mesophilic TAs fromV.
ﬂuvialis (Deepankumar et al ., 2014) , Rhizobium sp .
(Tang et al., 2020) andB. altitudinis (Xie et al., 2020). In
this study, both enzymes showed to be thermostable
keeping around the 80% of their initial activity after 24 h
incubation at 50 and 60°C. Both serine-TAs were fully
deactivated at 70°C after 1 and 6 h for pQR2590 and
pQR2519 respectively (Fig. 4B).
A particular attention is put on the thermophilic TA
pQR2590, which showed a poor expression (Fig. 2) but
a high speciﬁc activity. Based upon sequence homology
analysis, pQR2590 belongs to TA class IV (branched-
chain amino acid transaminase) and sub-classiﬁed as a
D-amino acid transaminase (D-AAT, EC 2.6.1.21). D-
AATs are key enzymes in the synthesis of D-amino
acids constituent of the cell wall in gram-positive bacteria
(Kobayashi, 2019). D-AAT are highly speciﬁc towards D-
amino acids, which is in agreement with our results as
TA pQR2590 only accepted D-Ser and D-Ala (from race-
mic mixture). Therefore, TA pQR2590 has a great poten-
tial for the synthesis of unnatural D-amino acids which
have a wide application in pharmaceutical, food and cos-
metic sectors (Gao and Ma, 2015).
Conclusions
This work shows a quick and reliable methodology for
the discovery, cloning, expression and screening of a
high number of TAs from thermophiles. Although low

expression was observed in some cases, activity was
still detected during screening, suggesting high speciﬁc
activity. In such cases, codon optimization is recom-
mended for selected enzymes in order to improve
expression levels for further applications.
Both strategies taken in this study for the synthesis of
HPA from the inexpensive racemic
L/D-serine catalysed
by thermophilic TAs are promising. However, further
improvement of non-stereoselective serine-TAs by
enzyme rational design and directed evolution would be
needed in order to improve reaction yields and avoid
substrate inhibition issues. The best enzymatic reaction
performance was found when combining two stereose-
lective serine-TAs of opposite enantioselectivity, a trans-
ketolase and racemic
L/D-serine as starting material. This
multienzimatic one-pot cascade reaction led to a signiﬁ-
cant increase in serine conversion. Co-expression of
both stereoselective serine-TAs would contribute to
reducing the process cost for these enzymes production.
Experimental procedures
Chemicals, strains and plasmids
All chemicals were purchased from Merck KGaA (Sigma-
Aldrich, Poole, Dorset, UK), and molecular biology
reagents were from New England BioLabs, unless other-
wise stated. Thermophilic strains used in this study were
as follows:Thermococcus litoralis, Sulfolobus solfataricus,
Thermus aquaticus(these three from our own collection),
Thermobiﬁda fusca DSM 43792, Deinococcus geother-
malis DSM 11300,Deinococcus radioduransDSM 20539,
Geobacillus stearothermophilus DSM 13240, S accha-
romonospora viridis DSM 43017 and Thermotoga mar-
itima DSM 3109. In house-modiﬁed plasmids pET-28a+
and pET-29a+ with SapIo r BsaI restriction sites, respec-
tively, both plasmids includeSacB and KanR genes for
positive selection (Dobrijevicet al., 2020).
Transaminase (TA) genes mining and cloning
Putative TA protein and gene sequences were identiﬁed
from the respective thermophilic microorganisms from
NCBI and UniProtKB databases following an annotation
search strategy using ‘transaminase’ or ‘aminotrans-
ferase’ as keywords. TAs Pfam were then predicted with
PHMMER and TA family class was assigned. Multiple
sequence alignment and phylogenetic analysis of
selected TAs were carried out using Clustal Omega and
Jalview 2.11.1.3. The phylogenetic tree was formatted
using the iTOL server (itol.embl.de/index.shtml). PCR pri-
mers for the identiﬁed TAs were designed with a Tm
between 70 and 73/C176 C and adding overhangs homologous
to the modi ﬁed pET vectors for SapI (F: 5 ’-AAA
GCTCTTCGATG-3’ and R: 5 ’-AAAGCTCTTCGGTG-3’)
and BsaI (F: 5’-AAAGGTCTCTTATG-3’ and R: 5’-AAA
GGTCTCGGGTG-3’). TAs genes were ampliﬁed using
Phusion
/C226 High-Fidelity PCR Master Mix with GC Buffer,
100 ng of genomic DNA or alternatively 2µl of strain glyc-
erol stock, primers concentration 0.5µM and DMSO 5%
in 50 µl reaction. Two-step PCRs were carried out as fol-
low: initial denaturation, 98 /C176 C for 3 min; 30 cycles of
denaturation at 98/C176 C for 10 s; annealing– extension at
72/C176 C for 30 s andﬁnal extension, 72/C176 C for 10 min. Ampli-
cons were conﬁrmed in agarose gel electrophoresis (1%
in TBE buffer) and PCR products were then recovered
from the gel following Monarch
/C226 DNA Gel Extraction Kit
protocol. TAs cloning was then performed with a one-pot
restriction– ligation reaction method with either SapI or
BsaI and the modiﬁed pET28a+ and pET29a+ vectors,
respectively (Dobrijevicet al., 2020), and transformed into
chemically competent E. coli NovaBlue and grown over-
night at 37/C176 C in LB agar with kanamycin 50lgm l/C01 and
sucrose 10%. Colonies were picked and then grown over-
night in 10 ml of LB broth with kanamycin 50lgm l
/C01 at
37/C176 C and 250 rpm, and plasmids were extracted using
QIAprep Spin Miniprep kit (Qiagen) and sent for sequenc-
ing (Euroﬁns Genomics) to conﬁrm gene sequences. Pos-
itive plasmid constructs were then transformed into an
expression host either E. coli BL21 (DE3) or E. coli
Rosetta 2 (DE3) (Supporting Information). All recombinant
TAs have a C-terminal His
6Tag.
Enzymes expression and cell lysis
Ninety-four TAs were selected and put in a 96-well plate
format (position from A1 to H10) including thex-TA from
Chromobacterium violaceum (CV2025) as positive
control (H11) and E. coli BL21 (DE3) with empty
pET29a+ as negative control (H12). TAs were initially
expressed in a 96-deep-well plate with 1 ml of LB broth
per well with kanamycin 50 lgm l
/C01 at 37 /C176 C and
1200 rpm in Thermomixer
TM
C (Eppendorf UK Limited,
Arlington Business Park, Stevenage, UK), grown until
OD
600nm ~ 0.6 and then induced with isopropyl b-D-1-
thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) 0.1 mMﬁnal concentration
and further incubated at 25 /C176 C for 15 h. In order to
enhance enzyme expression, chemical chaperone media
(1 ml per well) were used containing: Terriﬁc broth, D-
sorbitol (0.5 or 0.4 M), sodium phosphate buffer (100 or
50 mM) pH 7, PLP 0.2 mM and kanamycin 50lgm l
/C01
at 37/C176 C and 1200 rpm; IPTG induction (0.5 mM ﬁnal
concentration) was done at OD600nm ~ 1.5 and tempera-
ture was then reduced (25 or 20/C176 C) for 15 h. TA plate
was then centrifuged (4500 rpm at 4°C for 30 min) and
cell pellets were re-suspended in 0.2 ml of 50 mM TRIS-
HCl buffer pH 7 containing PLP 0.2 mM. Cells were dis-
rupted by partially submerging the TA plate in a water
bath sonicator (Bransonic 2800 CPX2800H-E, Branson)

at maximum power for 20 min at 10/C176 C, and the plate
was rotated clockwise every 5 min. Then, the TA plate
was centrifuged as above. The clari ﬁed lysates were
recovered in a fresh 96-well plate and kept at 4°C for
enzymatic activity screening and protein quantiﬁcation.
Enzyme expression was con ﬁrmed with SDS-PAGE
analysis with Novex
/C226 TBE 10% gels (Invitrogen, Wal-
tham, MA, USA) and NuPAGE
TM
MOPS-SDS running
buffer (Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc, Waltham, MA, USA).
Activity screening assay
End-point colorimetric assays were performed for differ-
ent substrates. First, alanine-TA activity was assay with
200 mM D/L-alanine and 2 mMa-ketoglutarate (KG) as
amino donor and acceptor, respectively, followed by the
addition of 2,4-dinitrophenyl hydrazine (1 mM in 1 M
HCl) after overnight incubation, resulting in a red
colouration for active enzymes (Y. Sheludko and F.
Wolf-Dieter, personal communication, 2019). Second,
L-
and D-serine TA assay was performed following the
method reported by Bommer and Ward (2016), using
10 mM
L-o r D-serine (amine donor) and 10 mM pyru-
vate, incubated overnight and followed by the addition of
0.1 mg ml
-1 WST-1 (BioVision) as reducing agent lead-
ing to a blue colour formation with Abs600nm higher than
0.05 for positive reactions. Third,xTA activity was con-
ﬁrmed with 10 mM pyruvate and 25 mM 2-(4-
nitrophenyl)ethan-1-amine as amino donor, the reaction
was incubated overnight and positive reactions led to a
formation of an orange-red coloration (Baud et al .,
2015). All these end-point assay reactions were carried
out in 96-well plates with 20 µl of clariﬁed lysate and
180 µl of substrate reagent mixture containing 0.2 mM
PLP in 50 mM TRIS-HCl buffer pH 7, and incubated at
50°C.
Enzymatic kinetic assays for
L-leucine, L-phenylalanine
and L-aspartate TAs as amino donors were performed
following Walton et al .’s (2013) spectrophotometric
method with KG as amine acceptor. Reaction mixture
per well consists of 20µl of clariﬁed lysate and 180µlo f
freshly prepared reagent mix (5 mM amino acid,
1 mM KG, 5 U ml
-1 glutamate dehydrogenase from
bovine liver and 0.5 mM NAD+ in 50 mM TRIS– HCl buf-
fer pH 7). Reactions were carried out at 40/C176 C, increased
absorbance due to NADH formation was monitored at
340 nm every 1.5 min per well for up to 2 h in a plate
reader (CLARIOstar Plus, BMG Labtech). Positive reac-
tions were considered whenD Abs min
-1 of sample was
1.5-fold greater thanD Abs min-1 of the negative control
(position H12).
Final protein concentration for both end-point colori-
metric and kinetic assays ranged from 0.05 to
5.4 mg ml
-1.
Synthesis of hydroxypyruvate (HPA) andL-erythrulose
(Ery)
TA-catalysed HPA synthesis was carried out with pure
non-stereoselective serine-TA pQR2502, pQR2526,
pQR2577 and pQR2581 (plate positions A2, C2, G5
and G9, respectively); and pure stereoselective L-
serine-TA pQR2519 (plate position B7) andD-serine-TA
pQR2590 (plate position H6). The reaction mixture con-
tent was 10 mM of either
L-, D- or racemic L/D-serine,
10 mM pyruvate, 0.2 mM PLP and 0.3 mg ml-1 TA in
50 mM TRIS-HCl buffer pH 7. In order to increase ser-
ine conversion, TA reaction was coupled to a pure
transketolase from Thermotoga maritima (TK
tmar)t o
yield Ery. Cascade reaction condition was as above
with the addition of 10 mM glycoaldehyde, 0.25 mg ml
-1
TKtmar, 9 mM MgCl2 and 2.4 mM thiamine diphosphate.
All reactions were carried out at 40/C176 C and 500 rpm in
ThermomixerTM C.
Thermal characterization of stereoselective serine-TAs
Optimum temperature of pure stereoselective serine-TAs
was determined by measuring the initial reaction rates
(for up to 15 min) of the HPA synthesis reaction (see
Section 2.5) with 1 mg ml
-1 of TA pQR2519 and
0.1 mg ml-1 of TA pQR2590, in 50 mM TRIS-HCl buffer
pH 7 with PLP 0.2 mM and incubated from 40 to 80/C176 C
with 10/C176 C intervals in a Thermomixer
TM
C. Serine-TAs
thermostability was evaluated by incubating 10 and
0.5 mg ml
-1 of TA-B7 and TA-H6, respectively, at 50, 60
and 70°C in 50mM TRIS-HCl buffer pH 7 with PLP
0.2 mM for up to 24 h. Samples were taken periodically
for enzyme activity analysis calculating initial reaction
rates in the HPA synthesis reaction at 60°C.
Analytical methods and general procedures
Selected serine-TAs were puriﬁed by IMAC methodology
with 1 or 5 ml Ni-NTA agarose columns (Qiagen). Clari-
ﬁed lysate was prepared and the columns were equili-
brated with 10 mM imidazole, the washing step was with
50 mM imidazole and enzyme elution with 0.5 M imida-
zole, all imidazole solutions were prepared in 50 mM
TRIS-HCl buffer with 0.3 M NaCl adjusted to pH 7. All
fractions were collected and kept for subsequent protein
quantiﬁcation and SDS-PAGE analysis.
Hydroxypyruvate and Ery were analysed by HPLC
(Villegas-Torres et al ., 2015) with a Ultimate 3000 +
HPLC (Thermo Fisher Scienti ﬁc) ﬁtted with a Aminex
HPX-87H column (Bio-Rad Laboratories Ltd., Watford,
UK) and TFA 0.1% at 0.6 ml min
-1 for 20 min (see chro-
matogram in Supporting Information). Retention times
were 8.5 and 11.7 min respectively. All quantitative

the external standard method.
Protein quanti ﬁcation was carried with Quick Start
