Summary
Zandelisib, a selective, potent PI3K δ inhibitor, demonstrated favourable outcomes 
in patients with relapsed or refractory follicular lymphoma in a global phase 
II study. This phase II study evaluated the efficacy and safety of zandelisib for 
relapsed or refractory follicular lymphoma or marginal zone lymphoma. Sixty-  one 
patients received zandelisib orally at 60 mg daily continuously in the first two 28- 
day cycles, followed by intermittent dosing on Days 1–7 following each cycle until 
progressive disease or unacceptable toxicity. Objective and complete response rates 
were 75.4% (95% confidence interval [CI], 62.7%–85.5%) and 24.6% (95% CI, 14.5%–
37.3%) respectively. Median time to response was 58 days; 70.5% (43/61) of patients 
achieved their first response by Week 8. At least one Grade ≥ 3 treatment- emergent 
adverse event (TEAE) occurred in 55.7% of patients: transaminase elevation (8.2%); 
cutaneous reactions (3.3%); and diarrhoea, enterocolitis and lung infection (1.6% 
each), defined as adverse events of special interest. The discontinuation rate due 
to any TEAE was 14.8%. No zandelisib-  related death occurred. Zandelisib showed 
favourable efficacy and tolerability in Japanese patients with relapsed or refractory

ZANDELISIB FOR RELAPSED/REFRACTORY INDOLENT NHL
INTRODUCTION
Follicular lymphoma (FL) and marginal zone lymphoma 
(MZL) are the two most common types of indolent B-  cell 
non- Hodgkin lymphoma (iB-  NHL).1 Both are heteroge -
neous and incurable and are treated based on the patient's 
condition through several relapses, leading to a decline in 
response and survival rates over time. 2–6 Recently, novel 
treatment options (e.g. anti-  CD19 CAR- T therapy, EZH2 
inhibitor and bispecific antibodies) have been approved for 
relapsed or refractory (r/r) FL/MZL.7 However, most patients 
with FL/MZL relapse even when treated with these, so new 
treatment options for r/r FL/MZL are needed.
Phosphatidylinositol 3-  kinase (PI3K) is a lipid kinase 
with a catalytic subunit that has four different isoforms (α, 
β, γ and δ) and is involved in the mobilisation and activation 
of multiple intracellular enzymes that regulate cell prolifer -
ation, survival and motility. In particular, PI3Kδ is highly 
expressed in lymphocytes and plays an essential role in ma -
lignant B-  cell function, so PI3Kδ has been considered a po -
tential target molecule for these tumours. 8–10
Although several PI3Kδ inhibitors have demonstrated 
clinically meaningful efficacy for FL, chronic lymphocytic 
and small lymphocytic leukaemia, these agents have been 
associated with several on-  target class-  specific adverse ef -
fects, including infectious and autoimmune toxicities such 
as colitis, pneumonitis and rash,11 in which regulatory T- cell 
(Treg) dysregulation due to continuous PI3Kδ inhibition 
may be involved. 12 As a consequence, the approvals of all 
drugs in this class have now been withdrawn for FL/MZL 
indications.11
Zandelisib (ME-  401) is a selective oral inhibitor of PI3Kδ 
that has been investigated for the treatment of FL or chronic 
lymphocytic leukaemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma in a 
phase Ib dose- escalation study (NCT02914938) at three doses 
(60, 120 and 180 mg once daily) using continuous schedule 
(CS) or intermittent dosing (ID). 13 No dose-  limiting tox -
icities occurred, and the maximum tolerated dose was not 
reached. The recommended phase II dose was 60 mg based 
on the safety and pharmacokinetic profile and comparable 
objective response rate (ORR) at the three doses evaluated. 
The ORR was comparable between the two dosing sched -
ule groups, and most patients in each group responded after 
the first two cycles. The safety profile was better in the ID 
group, with incidences of Grade ≥ 3 treatment- emergent ad-
verse events (TEAEs) and treatment discontinuation rates 
of 76% and 16% in the CS group and 44% and 10% in the 
ID group respectively. Such a treatment break in ID dosing 
is expected to contribute to Treg recovery. These findings 
led to the investigation of zandelisib monotherapy with ID 
for patients with r/r FL/MZL in the global phase II study, 
TIDAL (NCT03768505).14
A phase I study (ME-  401- K01, NCT03985189) was con -
ducted to confirm the safety, tolerability and optimal clini -
cal dose of zandelisib in Japanese patients with r/r iB- NHL.15 
Nine Japanese patients with r/r FL/MZL received zandel -
isib on CS (45 and 60 mg) until progression or intolerabil -
ity. Overall, the efficacy and safety profile of zandelisib in 
Japanese patients was consistent with that in the previous 
phase Ib study. In particular, eight of nine patients achieved 
a response after the first two cycles of administration, with -
out dose-  limiting toxicities. Based on these results, it was 
considered that the administration of zandelisib 60 mg 
daily for the first two cycles, followed by ID from the third 
cycle onwards, would achieve positive efficacy while miti -
gating toxicity. Therefore, the present study (NCT04533581) 
evaluated the efficacy and safety of zandelisib 60 mg ID in 
Japanese patients with r/r FL/MZL.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study design
This phase II multicentre, open-  label, single- arm study was 
conducted from 17 September 2020 to 2 May 2022 at 30 facil-
ities across Japan. This study adhered to the principles of the 
Declaration of Helsinki and followed the Pharmaceuticals 
and Medical Devices Law, the Good Clinical Practice 
Ministerial Ordinance and its partial amendments. The 
Institutional Review Board of each institution approved the 
study protocol and study documents. Before screening, pa -
tients provided written informed consent to participate.
Study population
Patients ≥20 years of age with histologically confirmed FL 
(grade 1–3a), MZL (splenic, nodal and extranodal) or indo -
lent B- NHL not otherwise specified, according to the World 
Health Organization classification, 16 and with ≥2 lines 
of therapy, including anti-  CD20 antibody and alkylating 
agents, were included. For detailed inclusion and exclusion 
criteria, see the Supplementary Methods .

Intervention
Each treatment cycle lasted 28 days (Day 1–Day 28) with 
zandelisib administered (60-  mg capsules orally) once daily 
on a CS during the first two cycles. Cycles 3+ were admin -
istered per ID (60- mg capsules orally once daily for the first 
7 days, then rest for the following 21 days) (Figure S1).
Study drug administration was continued until disease 
progression or intolerability. Safety was managed with dose 
interruption, but an absence from medication for >8 consec-
utive weeks led to discontinuation.
If a patient experienced PD during ID, based on the 
Lugano Classification lymphoma response criteria 17 modi -
fied for proper evaluation using computed tomography or 
positron emission tomography/computed tomography, they 
could be switched back to CS to recapture disease control. 
If PD was observed again, the patient was discontinued. 
Additional methods, including details of Pneumocystis ji -
rovecii pneumonia prophylaxis, appear in the Supplementary 
Methods.
Study end- points
The primary end-  point was the best overall response, de -
fined as the percentage of patients achieving complete 
response (CR) or partial response (PR). The tumour assess -
ment was performed by the Independent Response Review 
Committee (IRRC: Calyx, Relias, NC). Best overall response 
assessment was based on the modified Lugano criteria.17 The 
secondary efficacy end-  points included the duration of re -
sponse (DOR), progression- free survival (PFS), CR rate and 
time to treatment failure.
Safety was evaluated based on adverse events (AEs); 
changes in laboratory values, vital signs and electrocardi -
ography parameters; percentages of AEs of special interest 
(AESI), that is, cutaneous reactions, mucositis, diarrhoea/
colitis, transaminase elevation, non-  infectious pneumoni -
tis, lung infection/pneumonia, cardiomyopathy; and time 
to the first occurrence of AESI expression. AESI were de -
fined based on a past report and prior global phase II study, 
TIDAL (NCT03768505).11,14 Other end- points are detailed in 
the Supplementary Methods.
Statistical analysis
Given the small size of the MZL patient population, the 
number of patients needed was estimated by considering 
FL patients after ≥2 lines of therapy as the main patient 
population. Forty-  nine patients were required under the 
assumption of a threshold response rate of 40%, to an ex -
pected response rate of 60% with one-  sided significance 
level of 2.5% and a power of ≥80%. The sample size was 
then increased to 60 patients to consider for drop-  outs and 
to collect additional safety information. The analysis pop -
ulations were the safety, full, pharmacodynamics and im -
mune analysis sets (see Supplementary Methods for more 
details).
RESULTS
Patient characteristics
Of the 73 screened patients, 12 were excluded, and 61 were 
enrolled. Of these, 19 discontinued the study ( Figure 1). At 
the data cut-  off date, 42 patients (68.9%) remained in the 
study.
Patients ( N = 61) had a median age of 70.0 years (range: 
46–80), 38 (62.3%) were aged >65 years, 36 (59.0%) were male 
and 54 (88.5%) had an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group 
Performance Status of 0 ( Table  1). The histopathological 
diagnosis was FL in 57 (93.4%) patients, and MZL in four

(6.6%), 46 (75.4%) had Ann Arbor stage III–IV disease and 
16 (26.2%) had a tumour bulk ≥5 cm. Patients had received 
a median of 3 (range: 2–9) prior lines of therapies, and 30 
(49.2%) were refractory to the last treatment received. All 
patients had received treatment with anti-  CD20 antibody 
and alkylating agents. A total of 29 (47.5%) patients had 
progression of disease within 24 months of initiating first- 
line chemoimmunotherapy (POD24).
Study endpoints
Efficacy—Primary and secondary end- points
Based on the IRRC review, the ORR was 75.4% (95% confi -
dence interval [CI]: 62.7%–85.5%), and the CR rate was 24.6% 
(95% CI, 14.5%–37.3%) in the full analysis set ( Table 2). The 
ORR was consistent across all subgroups regardless of prior 
treatment and poor prognostic factors, including patients 
with POD24 (65.2%), ≥3 prior lines of therapy (72.2%) and 
refractory disease (70.0%) (Figure 2).
All patients except one had tumour size reductions with 
zandelisib, and 50 patients showed ≥50% reduction from 
baseline (Figure 3).
The median time to response was 58.0 (95% CI: 57.0–71.0) 
days, and 43 patients (70.5%) achieved their first response by 
Week 8. Eight patients (13.1%) obtained CR by Week 8, and 
13 (21.3%) obtained CR by Week 24. The median follow-  up 
duration was 9.5 (95% CI: 8.0–11.1) months, and the median 
DOR and PFS were not reached (Table 2).
Of the 10 patients who switched back to CS from ID, dis -
ease control was achieved in eight patients (80.0%), includ -
ing one CR (10.0%) and four PRs (40.0%). The response was 
not evaluable in two patients.
Figure S2 shows the time course of zandelisib treatment 
for individual patients. Of the 60 patients followed up for 
at least 6 months, 45 (75.0%) who responded to zandelisib 
treatment continued the study treatment for ≥6 months.
Safety
At the data cut-  off date, the median (range) duration of ex -
posure in the safety analysis set ( N = 61) was 7.8 (0.3–15.0)

months. TEAEs occurring in ≥10% of patients are listed in 
Table 3. Any- grade TEAEs occurred in 59 (96.7%) patients, 
Grade ≥ 3 TEAEs occurred in 34 (55.7%) patients, and these 
were assessed as related to drug treatment in 28 (45.9%). The 
most common TEAE, with ≥10% of patients, was neutrophil 
count decreased (42.6%), followed by diarrhoea (36.1%) and 
white blood cell count decreased and aspartate aminotrans -
ferase increased (14.8% each).
In total, 43 (70.5%) patients experienced AESI. The in -
cidence of diarrhoea/colitis was 39.3% (Grade ≥ 3 in 3.3%). 
Transaminase elevation and cutaneous reaction were ob -
served in 29.5% (Grade ≥ 3 in 8.2%) and 26.2% (Grade ≥ 3 in 
3.3%) respectively. Mucositis occurred in 11.5% of patients; 
no Grade ≥ 3 events were observed. Pulmonary infection/
pneumonia occurred in 6.6% (Grade ≥ 3 in 1.6%). There were 
no cases of non-  infectious pneumonitis or cardiomyopathy. 
Most AESI occurred in the first two cycles, and the expres -
sion of AESI reached a plateau after the end of Cycle 3, which 
was the transition to ID ( Figure 4).
During this study, 19 patients discontinued treatment. 
The main reasons for discontinuation were AE in nine pa -
tients (14.8%), including three patients with AESI (two he -
patic function abnormal and one erythema multiforme). 
Five patients discontinued because of PD, and three patients 
because of symptomatic deterioration. One patient inter -
rupted the study treatment for >8 weeks. One event of sud -
den death occurred during the study but was not considered 
to be related to the treatment. A decision was made by the

In the present study, Grade ≥ 3 events occurred in six pa -
tients (9.8%), including two patients that discontinued due to 
gastroenteritis and cytomegalovirus enteritis. The cytomeg -
alovirus event was treated with antiviral drugs. There were 
no deaths related to viral infection.
Three of the 10 patients who switched back to CS experi -
enced AESI (two with diarrhoea/colitis and one with cuta -
neous reaction). Two patients discontinued treatment after 
switching back because of symptomatic deterioration, not 
because of AEs.
Exploratory and other endpoints
The proportions of Treg cells expressing Foxp3/CD25 in 
CD4+ lymphocytes decreased from Cycle 1 to Cycle 3 and 
then tended to recover after Day 15 of Cycle 3 ( Figure S3A). 
Within the population of lymphocytes, proportions of B 
cells, T cells (CD3+CD8+ and CD3+CD4+) and NK cells 
(CD16+CD56+) did not change throughout the treatment 
period (Figure S3B–E).
Chemokine (C- X- C motif) ligand 13 levels were reduced 
from baseline by zandelisib administration throughout the 
study (Figure S4A,B).
DISCUSSION
This phase II trial evaluated the efficacy and safety of zan -
delisib 60 mg monotherapy with ID in Japanese patients 
with r/r FL/MZL, showing favourable efficacy and toler -
able safety profiles. This suggests that this unique dosing 
schedule could be promising for managing safety while 
maintaining efficacy. Zandelisib showed favourable anti -
tumour activity, with an ORR of 75.4% and a CR rate of 
24.6%. All patients, except one, had a reduction in tumour 
size. The median DOR and PFS were not reached with a 
median follow-  up of 9.5 months. High ORRs were main -
tained even in patients with a poor prognostic feature, 
such as those who had received >2 lines of prior therapy 
(72.2%), those with bulky disease (≥5 cm) (62.5%), those 
with tumours refractory to their last therapy (70.0%) and 
those with POD24 (65.2%). The safety profile was toler -
able, with low discontinuation rates due to AEs (14.8%) 
and low Grade ≥ 3 AESI rates during ID. Zandelisib with 
ID was also evaluated in the global phase II study TIDAL, 
in which 121 patients with r/r FL demonstrated an ORR of 
72.7%, CR rate of 38.0% and discontinuation rate due to 
TEAEs of 17.4%, 14 which is consistent with the results of 
the present study.

While there is a limitation in making cross-  trial com -
parisons, the ORR of zandelisib in this study was 75.4%, 
compared with other PI3K inhibitors yielding ORRs of 
around 50%–60% each (e.g. idelalisib at 56.8%, 18 copanlisib 
at 59.2%,19 duvelisib at 47.3% 20 and umbralisib at 47.1% 21). 
Zandelisib has a different molecular structure to other PI3K 
inhibitors, resulting in higher isotype selectivity for PI3Kδ 
and longer residence in tumours (≥5 h),22 which may explain 
its favourable efficacy. Most patients (70.5%) treated with 
zandelisib had their first response by Week 8. The propor -
tion of patients who achieved CR increased from 13.1% at 
Week 8 to 21.3% at Week 24, indicating that ID did not re -
duce activity but led to a durable remission. This trend is 
also suggested by the DOR and PFS results, although these 
are immature.
The PI3K pathway plays a vital role in cancer biology, 
and PI3Kδ inhibitors have produced clinical benefits for 
iB- NHL patients. 23–25  However, this drug class has lim -
itations related to fatal and/or serious infections and 
immune-  mediated toxicity, which were defined as AESI 
in this study. 11 The follow-  up durations and target dis -
eases differed in each study, but Grade 5 AEs occurred 
in 4%–6% of patients with iB-  NHL receiving idelalisib, 
copanlisib or duvelisib. 18–20 In a study investigating ide -
lalisib, which is the representative of PI3Kδ inhibitors, di -
arrhoea and/or colitis occurred in 16.0%, hepatotoxicity in 
20.8% and infection in 22.4% of cases. 18 To mitigate these 
risks, based on previous findings, the ID method and in -
fection management were implemented in this study and 
yielded positive outcomes.
Immune- mediated toxicity has been considered to 
be related to Treg suppression. 12 A novel ID administra -
tion method was used in a phase Ib study (ME-  401- 002, 
NCT02914938), which showed similar efficacy with fewer 
safety concerns compared to CS dosing. Most patients in the 
ID and CS groups obtained an objective response after the 
first two cycles. Based on these data, this unique and novel 
dosing scheme, starting from CS and then changing to ID, 
was selected for a phase II study.14
In this study, zandelisib was administered by CS dosing 
and then ID. The discontinuation rate due to any AEs was 
low at 14.8%, and a Grade 5 AE occurred in only one patient 
(sudden death) despite this trial being conducted during 
the COVID- 19 pandemic. The patient who experienced the 
Grade 5 AE completed 56 days of CS and interrupted treat -
ment on Day 57 because of AEs. The patient died on Day 106. 
The investigator judged that there was no causal relationship 
with treatment because the death occurred 50 days after 
the last dose, and the patient was recovering from the AEs 
that led to the dose interruption before the death occurred. 
The incidence of Grade ≥ 3 AESI, such as diarrhoea/coli -
tis (3.3%) and transaminase elevation (8.2%), was also low. 
Notably, the occurrence of AESI reached a plateau after the 
third cycle, which is after the transition to ID. Treg levels de-
creased during the first two cycles with daily administration 
but tended to recover at Day 15 of Cycle 3, after ID started. 
Intermittent administration may have contributed to the 
suppression of immune-  mediated toxicity. In recent years, 
various ID schedules have been used to evaluate PI3K inhib-
itors, such as once daily for 8 weeks and then once weekly 
for parsaclisib. 26 Although a direct comparison is difficult, 
the discontinuation rate in this study was lower (14.8% for 
zandelisib and 29.0% for parsaclisib 26), which suggests that 
optimal ID dosing differs depending on the PI3K inhibitor.
Although there was concern about a decrease in efficacy 
due to a reduction in dosing intensity after switching to ID, 
this study suggests that the loss of efficacy after the transi -
tion to ID was limited. Continuous reduction of chemokine 
(C- X- C motif) ligand 13, a cytokine produced by PI3K sig -
nalling from tumours, was observed, suggesting that PI3Kδ 
inhibition in the tumour continues to occur with ID with 
zandelisib. These results support that ID is both effective 
and safe and that ID does not reduce efficacy and leads to 
durable remission.
For idelalisib treatment, the European Medicines 
Agency has issued comprehensive recommendations for 
measures to minimise risk of serious infections, includ -
ing prophylaxis for Pneumocystis jirovecii  pneumonia. 27,28 
In this study, several recommendations for prophylaxis 
of infection were implemented in the protocol, including 
prophylaxis for P. jirovecii  pneumonia, granulocyte-  colony 
stimulating factor prophylaxis for neutropenia and moni -
toring cytomegalovirus and hepatitis B virus. The manage -
ment of AEs by dose interruption or changing the dosing 
schedule to ID was also recommended. In the present 
study, there were two discontinuations caused by infectious 
events and no deaths related to infections. This shows that, 
with effective management, the occurrence of infections 
can be minimised, which is an important aspect for the 
PI3Kδ inhibitor class of drugs.
This study had several limitations. One was the short 
follow- up time, with a longer follow-  up time needed to esti -
mate the DOR, PFS and long-  term safety profiles of zandel -
isib. Additionally, the number of patients who switched back 
from ID to CS dosing was small; thus, efficacy and safety 
of this strategy remains unclear. Finally, this study was a 
single- arm study without any comparators.
In conclusion, zandelisib showed a high efficacy in 
Japanese patients with r/r iB- NHL. The safety profile of zan -
delisib ID was manageable, with a relatively low number of 
AE- related discontinuations and low rates of AESI and in -
fections. These results indicate that zandelisib could yield a 
favourable benefit–risk profile for this population.
