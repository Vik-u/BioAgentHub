ABSTRACT Glycopeptide, polymyxin, and aminoglycoside antibiotics are among the 
most commonly used agents to treat drug-resistant bacterial infections ; however, their 
clinical use is hindered by nephrotoxicity. We previously reported that zileuton has the 
potential to attenuate antibiotic-associated nephrotoxicity in an animal model. Here, we 
further report the development of a parenteral formulation and exploration of dosing 
strategies for zileuton. The solubility, stability, and multi-dose safety of two zileuton 
formulations were evaluated. Zileuton serum and renal tissue pharmacokinetics were 
evaluated after a single dose and compared to steady state after 10 days. Different 
dosing strategies of zileuton to attenuate vancomycin-, polymyxin B-, and amikacin-
associated nephrotoxicity were evaluated in rats over 10 days. Two formulations (1 
and 10 mg/mL) showed good multi-dose safety, with no significant changes in serum 
creatinine, alanine transaminase, or body weight observed following doses of 12 mg/kg 
daily for 10 days. Zileuton was well-distributed into renal tissue, and serum exposure was 
comparable to humans after a typical dose (600–2,400 mg). No drug accumulation at 
steady state was observed. Zileuton was found to reduce nephrotoxicity associated with 
vancomycin, polymyxin B, and amikacin in a dose-dependent manner. With the same 
daily dose, dose fractionation resulted in similar renal protection compared to once-daily 
dosing. These preliminary studies support that zileuton has the potential to be used as 
a parenteral adjuvant to attenuate antibiotic-associated nephrotoxicity. This would allow 
the optimal use of glycopeptides, polymyxins, and aminoglycosides to treat difficult 
infections. Further studies are warranted to repurpose zileuton as a nephroprotectant.

T
he global threat of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is rapidly growing, increasing the 
burden of bacterial infections on human health and healthcare systems. In 2024, 
the CDC reported that infections caused by the seven most threatening hospital-onset 
pathogens, including carbapenem-resistant Enterobacterales and methicillin-resistant 
Staphylococcus aureus  (MRSA), had increased by a combined 20% since 2019 ( 1). The 
dearth of safe, effective antibiotics for treating infections caused by these pathogens 
is growing, and new drug development by the pharmaceutical industry is not likely to 
provide viable options in time. Therefore, finding novel approaches to reduce the health 
and economic burden of infections caused by multidrug-resistant (MDR) bacteria is an 
urgent priority.
Resistance to first-line antibiotics, such as carbapenems, is widespread and has 
rendered them ineffective treatment options. For example, a retrospective study of 
gram-negative bacteria collected from hospitals from 2021 to 2022 found that carba­
penem resistance rates among Acinetobacter baumannii , Klebsiella pneumoniae , and 
Pseudomonas aeruginosa  were 93%, 59%, and 42%, respectively ( 2). Glycopeptides, 
aminoglycosides, and polymyxins are three classes of antibiotics that have generally

maintained in vitro  activity against drug -resistant bacteria. A recent retrospective study 
of almost 1,000 clinical bacterial isolates found that 98.8% of gram-positive bacteria 
were susceptible to vancomycin (a glycopeptide), and 93.7% of gram-negative bacteria 
were susceptible to amikacin (an aminoglycoside) ( 3). Unfortunately, the clinical usage 
of these antibiotics is hindered by dose-limiting nephrotoxicity. For example, a study of 
94 patients receiving vancomycin for MRSA infections found that 43% developed renal 
toxicity during the course of their treatment ( 4). Aminoglycosides and polymyxins are 
associated with renal toxicity rates of 58% and 60%, respectively ( 5, 6). Attenuation of 
nephrotoxicity would allow the optimal clinical use of these antibiotics to treat difficult 
infections and provide timely solutions to the AMR crisis.
Zileuton is an FDA-approved anti-inflammatory drug used for the treatment of 
chronic asthma by inhibiting the synthesis of pro-inflammatory molecules known as 
leukotrienes. Zileuton has been demonstrated by other investigators to have renal 
protective effects against various nephrotoxins (such as cisplatin) in preclinical models 
(7–9). We previously reported a pilot study demonstrating that zileuton had the potential 
to reduce kidney injury in an animal model ( 10). However, zileuton is water-insoluble 
(0.14 mg/mL) and is classified as biopharmaceutical classification system class II drug (11, 
12). Zileuton is only available as tablets for oral administration, which is not reliable for 
the critically ill patient population who would benefit from its renal protective effects. 
Therefore, in this study, we developed a parenteral formulation of zileuton and explored 
optimal dosing strategies to attenuate glycopeptide-, aminoglycoside-, and polymyxin-
associated kidney injury in a rat model.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Chemicals and reagents
Zileuton powder (United States Pharmacopeia [USP]) was obtained from Supelco 
(Bellefonte, PA, USA). Piccolo comprehensive metabolic panels were purchased from 
Abaxis (Union City, CA, USA). Vancomycin hydrochloride (USP) was obtained from Slate 
Run Pharmaceuticals (Columbus, OH, USA). Amikacin sulfate (USP) was obtained from 
Sagent Pharmaceuticals (Schaumburg, IL, USA). Polymyxin B (USP) was purchased from 
AuroMedics Pharma (East Windsor, NJ, USA). Polyethylene glycol 400 (PEG-400) was 
purchased from Spectrum Chemical (New Brunswick, NJ, USA). Liquid chromatography-
mass spectrometry (LC/MS)-grade water and acetonitrile were obtained from Supelco 
(Bellefonte, PA, USA).
Zileuton assays and preparation of samples for quantification
A high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) method was developed and 
validated for in vitro  stability studies, since the formulation composition was not 
preferred for liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) analysis. 
No interference of the formulation excipients was observed compared to pure drug 
solution. Briefly, formulation samples were diluted 100× or 1,000× in HPLC-grade water 
with 15 mg/L phenacetin as internal standard. Absorption at 230 nm was used for 
quantification. Mobile phase A was water +0.1% formic acid , and mobile phase B was 
acetonitrile +0.1% formic acid. A Kinetex EVO C18 column (100 × 2.1 mm internal 
diameter, 5 µm) with column oven temperature of 30°C and injection volume of 10 
µL was used. Chromatographic separation was achieved with a flow rate of 0.3 mL/min 
and constant 30% mobile phase B. The linear range of the assay was 0.125–15 mg/L 
(the lower limit of quantification [LLOQ] = 0.0625 mg/L). The r 2 of all calibration curves 
was >0.98. The intraday precision and accuracy for high, middle, and low concentration 
quality control standards were determined using six replicates of each concentration 
measured on the same day. The interday precision and accuracy were determined across 
three separate days. Intra- and inter-day precision and accuracy were acceptable (CV% 
and %error <10%).

In contrast, a previously reported LC-MS/MS method used for quantification of 
zileuton in serum was modified for renal tissue ( 10). Serum samples were prepared as 
previously described ( 10). A modified method was used for the preparation of kidney 
homogenate samples. Briefly, working solutions of zileuton in 2 × concentration dilutions 
(0.625–160 mg/L) were prepared in 40% methanol from a 10 mg/mL stock solution 
stored at −20°C. The internal standard working solution (20 mg/L) was prepared in 
methanol from a stock solution stored at −80°C. 25 µL of kidney homogenate was 
combined with 5 µL of zileuton working solution and 10 µL of internal standard solution. 
Cold acetonitrile (0.5 mL) was added, the mixture was vortexed for 0.5 minutes, and 
then centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 15 minutes. The supernatant was recovered, dried 
under a stream of air, and stored at −80°C until analysis. Standards and samples were 
reconstituted in 1 mL of water and centrifuged again at 15,000 × g for 15 minutes. 
The linear range of the assay was 0.125–32 mg/L. The LLOQ was 0.0625 mg/L. Each 
calibration curve was calculated using a 1/x weighting of the linear regression. Intra- 
and inter-day precision and accuracy were acceptable (CV% and error% < 10%). The 
extraction recovery was good (>80%) and the matrix effect was not significant (< ±10%).
Solubility and stability studies
Zileuton equilibrium solubility was determined by shaking solvents with excess zileuton 
for 24 hours at 25°C followed by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 10 minutes. The 
supernatant was collected, diluted in methanol, and the zileuton concentration was 
measured using UV spectroscopy (absorbance at 230 nm). Zileuton stability in ethanol 
(10 mg/mL) and two proprietary formulations (1 and 10 mg/mL, US patent application: 
PCT/US2023/072771) was determined using the HPLC method. Briefly, zileuton was 
dissolved and stored at various temperatures ( −80, 4, 22, 37°C) for select time periods 
(1 day, 1 week, 1 month). At each time point, the concentration was measured in 
triplicate by dilution in water + IS and quantification by HPLC.
Animals
Sprague Dawley male (325–350 g) and female (225–250 g) rats were purchased from 
Envigo (Indianapolis, IN, USA). All protocols were approved by the Institutional Animal 
Care and Use Committee of the University of Houston.
Multi-dose safety experiments
To evaluate the safety of multiple doses of the zileuton formulations, rats were adminis­
tered 12 mg/kg zileuton as a single daily dose for 10 days (N = 6 for 1 mg/mL formulation 
and N = 3 for 10 mg/mL formulation). Blood samples (0.2 mL) were collected from the 
tail tip and assayed for alanine transaminase (ALT) and serum creatinine levels (sCr) to 
assess hepatotoxicity and nephrotoxicity, respectively. Body weight was also measured 
longitudinally on selected days.
Hemolysis assay
The hemolytic potential of the zileuton formulations was evaluated using a previously 
reported method with slight modification ( 13). Briefly, 0.45 mL of whole rat blood 
containing K2 EDTA (Innovative Research, IGRTSDWBK2E) was combined with 0.05 mL 
of the formulations, 10% Triton X-100 (positive control), or saline (negative control) and 
incubated at 37°C for 1 hour. Percent hemolysis was then determined spectrophotomet­
rically as previously described (13).
Zileuton pharmacokinetic studies
Three male and three female rats were administered zileuton (a single dose of 4 or 
12 mg/kg) intraperitoneally , and serial blood samples (90 µL each) were taken over 12 
hours from the tail tip. The blood samples were allowed to clot at room temperature

and centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 minutes. The serum was then collected and stored 
at −20°C until analysis. Following quantification, serum concentrations at various time 
points were averaged, and the mean concentration was used for analysis.
To evaluate renal tissue pharmacokinetics, selected animals were euthanized at 
various time points. Both kidneys were then collected, weighed, homogenized in 5 mL of 
water, and stored at −20°C until analysis. Renal tissue concentrations were averaged and 
co-modeled with serum concentrations using a three-compartment model in ADAPT5 
software. Serum area under curve (AUC) was compared to human AUC observed 
following a typical dose (19.2 mg*h/L for a 600 mg dose) and correlated to the human 
equivalent dose (HED), assuming dose linearity (14).
To evaluate dose accumulation, three male and three female rats were adminis­
tered zileuton (12 mg/kg/day) intraperitoneally for 10 days. On the 10th day, serial 
blood samples were collected as described above. The serum concentrations were 
then averaged and compared to the serum concentration profile achieved with a 
single dose.
Animal model of nephrotoxicity
Experimental details of the animal model using amikacin and polymyxin B were 
previously described (10). Similarly, animals were administered vancomycin (200 mg/kg) 
intraperitoneally once daily over 10 days. To explore the optimal zileuton dosing 
strategy, both dose escalation and fractionation designs were undertaken. Nephrotox­
icity endpoint was defined as doubling of sCr concentration from baseline, which is 
equivalent to the “injury” category using the Risk, Injury, Failure, Loss, and End-stage 
kidney disease (RIFLE) criteria and could be thought of as moderate extent kidney 
injury. The onset of nephrotoxicity in different treatment cohorts was compared using 
a time-to-event (e.g., Kaplan-Meier) analysis and log -rank test. P values ≤ 0.05 were 
considered significant.
RESULTS
Zileuton solubility and stability
Zileuton equilibrium solubility in the 1 and 10 mg/mL formulations was determined 
to be 1.68 and 12.9 mg/mL, respectively , and solubility in ethanol was approximately 
30 mg/mL.
The long-term stability ( ≥90% remaining) of zileuton stored at −20°C as a 10 mg/mL 
solution in ethanol was found to be >12 months. The stability of zileuton following 
dilution with the cosolvent system was determined at −80, 4, 22, 37°C ( Table 1). At room 
temperature (22°C), zileuton was stable in the 1 and 10 mg/mL formulations for 16 hours 
and 4 weeks, respectively. Additionally, no physical instability (e.g., precipitation) was 
observed during storage at any temperature.
Multi-dose safety of zileuton in the parenteral formulation
Compared to baseline, there were no significant changes in serum ALT (hepatocellular 
toxicity marker), sCr (renal function marker), or body weight observed over 10 days ( Fig. 
1). Additionally, there was no gross irritation of the injection site observed.

Hemolytic potential
The 1 and 10 mg/mL zileuton formulations were found to result in 2% and 16% 
hemolysis, respectively. Generally, hemolysis values of <10% are considered non-hemo­
lytic, while those exceeding 25% are considered hemolytic (13).
Zileuton pharmacokinetics
Zileuton serum and renal tissue concentrations were measured up to 12 hours following 
4 and 12 mg/kg single doses with the 1 mg/mL formulation. Serum and tissue concen­
trations were reasonably well characterized (r 2 ≥0.99 for all profiles) ( Fig. 2 ), and the 
best-fit pharmacokinetic parameters were determined ( Table 2). The AUC of renal tissue 
was similar to the serum AUC at both doses. AUC and maximum concentration (Cmax) 
increased approximately proportionally between the two doses. Tmax was 1 and 1.5 
hours for 4 and 12 mg/kg doses, respectively.

To assess dose accumulation, zileuton (12 mg/kg) was given once daily with the 
1 mg/mL formulation for 10 days. Compared to the first dose, no considerable increase in 
systemic exposure was observed on the 10th day (Fig. 3).
Attenuation of vancomycin-associated kidney injury
When given vancomycin (200 mg/kg/day) alone, 60% of animals developed nephrotox­
icity by day 10. Zileuton significantly delayed the onset of nephrotoxicity ( P < 0.01) 
(Fig. 4A ). The percentage of animals developing nephrotoxicity was reduced from 
60% to ≤10%. Additionally, the onset of nephrotoxicity was not significantly different 
between sexes (P > 0.05) (data not shown).

Attenuation of amikacin-associated kidney injury
Administration of amikacin (300 mg/kg/day) alone resulted in 90% of animals develop­
ing nephrotoxicity by day 10. Compared to amikacin alone, the onset of nephrotoxicity 
was significantly delayed by zileuton in a dose-dependent manner (P < 0.05). There was a 
trend of delaying the onset of nephrotoxicity with 1 mg/kg daily of zileuton ( P = 0.06) 
(Fig. 4B ). Zileuton reduced the percentage of animals developing nephrotoxicity from 
90% to 30% (4 mg/kg every 24 h) and 10% (2 mg/kg every 12 h).

Attenuation of polymyxin B-associated kidney injury
When given polymyxin B (20 mg/kg/day) alone, 100% of animals developed nephro­
toxicity by day 6. The onset of nephrotoxicity was significantly delayed by zileuton 
(10 mg/kg every 24 hours and 5 mg/kg every 12 hours) ( P < 0.05). The number of animals 
developing nephrotoxicity by day 10 was reduced from 100% to 30%. There was no 
significant difference in nephrotoxicity with zileuton 4 mg/kg every 24 h ( P > 0.05) ( Fig. 
4C). Additionally, the onset of nephrotoxicity was not significantly different between 
sexes (P > 0.05) (data not shown).

DISCUSSION
The dearth of safe, effective antibiotics available for treating resistant bacterial infections 
is growing, presenting a major threat to human health. Attenuation of nephrotoxicity 
associated with glycopeptide, aminoglycoside, and polymyxin antibiotics would allow 
their optimal use to treat MDR infections. This would be a significant accomplishment for 
combatting the AMR crisis.
Adjuvant antioxidant/anti-inflammatory compounds have shown promise in reducing 
antibiotic-associated nephrotoxicity in preclinical models ( 15, 16). Zileuton, an FDA-
approved agent, was previously shown to attenuate cisplatin-associated nephrotoxicity 
and renal ischemic-reperfusion injury in rodents ( 7, 17). Zileuton inhibits the leukotriene-
producing enzyme, 5-lipoxygenase, thereby reducing the inflammatory response ( 14, 
18). An overexuberant inflammatory response following drug-induced nephrotoxicity 
has been suggested to exacerbate renal injury ( 19–21). In this way, zileuton may be 
able to reduce renal injury. Additionally, zileuton has been shown to have antioxidant 
and anti-apoptotic properties that may contribute to attenuation of antibiotic-associated 
nephrotoxicity (7, 22, 23).
Zileuton is water-insoluble, which is deemed to be a major hindrance to its translation 
to the clinic. In previous studies, zileuton was delivered orally or parenterally using 
dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) as a vehicle. Oral drug delivery is not reliable for the critically 
ill patient population that may benefit from the renal protective effects of zileuton , and 
DMSO is not a suitable solvent for parenteral use in humans. Therefore, we developed 
a proprietary cosolvent formulation for zileuton, where it is first dissolved in ethanol 
and can be stored at −20°C long term. This stock ethanol solution is then diluted with 
an aqueous cosolvent mixture suitable for parenteral administration shortly prior to 
dosing. In humans, we envision this zileuton formulation will be delivered by intermittent 
intravenous infusions. Zileuton was delivered intraperitoneally to rats in this study as a 
proof of concept, which would also mimic the pharmacokinetic profiles after intermittent 
intravenous infusions. The zileuton formulations showed good multi-dose tolerability 
when administered by intraperitoneal injection, and minimal hemolysis (<20%) in vitro 
supporting the safety of intravenous dosing in future studies.
We analyzed the serum and renal tissue pharmacokinetics of zileuton following 
intraperitoneal administration of zileuton (4 and 12 mg/kg) using the 1 mg/mL 
formulation. A proportional increase in Cmax and AUC was observed between the doses 
in rats, suggestive of linear pharmacokinetics. Notably, drug exposure observed in renal 
tissue was similar to that in the serum. Using the serum AUC, we calculated HEDs. A 
600 mg oral dose of zileuton in humans results in an AUC of 19.2 mg*h/L ( 14). Assuming 
dose linearity and similar bioavailability (between intraperitoneal administration in rats 
vs oral administration in humans), 4 and 12 mg/kg intraperitoneal doses in rats correlate 
to 880 and 3,000 mg oral doses in humans, respectively. The maximum approved daily 
dose of zileuton in humans is 2400 mg. Therefore, zileuton systemic exposures observed 
in rats were comparable to those after typical doses in humans.
Based on previous pharmacokinetic studies and our unpublished data, the doses 
of antibiotics chosen for our studies are comparable to human doses, assuming dose 
linearity ( 24, 25). A significant reduction in vancomycin-associated nephrotoxicity was 
observed at a zileuton dose as low as 1 mg/kg (200 mg in humans). Amikacin required 
a zileuton dose of 4 mg/kg (900 mg in humans) to delay nephrotoxicity. Reduction in 
polymyxin B-associated nephrotoxicity required a zileuton dose of 10 mg/kg (2,500 mg 
in humans). Polymyxin B is significantly more nephrotoxic than amikacin and vancomy­
cin. We reason that this may explain why a higher dose of zileuton is required. Zileuton 
dose fractionation (i.e., 12 hour dosing instead of 24 hour dosing) generally resulted in 
similar renal protection overall (P > 0.05). This would imply that zileuton renal protection 
is not predominantly dependent on Cmax and could also allow more flexibility with the
dosing schedule in a clinical setting.
Limitations of our study include the use of only one biomarker of kidney injury (i.e., 
sCr) and only one antibiotic in each class. The inclusion of other biomarkers and/or 
Full-Length Text Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy

glomerular filtration rate studies could increase confidence in our findings and are being 
incorporated into future experiments. As we removed animals from the study once they 
developed nephrotoxicity, we were not able to perform a quantitative comparison of sCr 
over time. Additionally, we do not have pharmacokinetic data on the antibiotics when 
they are co-administered with zileuton. Finally, we do not yet have safety or pharmacoki­
netic data when zileuton is administered intravenously to support translation to humans 
and calculate the bioavailability of intraperitoneal delivery. Future directions include 
histopathological analysis to confirm reduced renal injury, pharmacokinetic analysis 
when zileuton is co-administered with antibiotics, pharmacokinetic/safety analysis of 
intravenous zileuton, and ascertaining the mechanism(s) of zileuton renal protection.
Conclusions
These preliminary development studies support that zileuton has the potential to 
be used as a parenteral adjuvant to attenuate glycopeptide-, aminoglycoside-, and 
polymyxin-associated nephrotoxicity. This would allow the optimal use of these 
antibiotics to treat difficult infections and make a significant contribution to combating
the AMR crisis. Further experiments are warranted to repurpose zileuton as a renal 
protective drug.
