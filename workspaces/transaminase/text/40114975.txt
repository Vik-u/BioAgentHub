We undertook a point-of-care test for hepatitis B core-related 
antigen in adults with hepatitis B virus in Kilifi, Kenya. A 
positive test identified all individuals with a hepatitis B viral 
load >200 000 IU/mL and who were hepatitis B e antigen 
positive. It also correlated with a higher alanine 
aminotransferase (ALT) level (P = .03), raised aspartate 
transaminase-to-platelet ratio index (APRI) (P < .001), and 
higher elastography scores (P = .03).

The 2024 Global Hepatitis Report highlights significant morbid-
ity and mortality due to chronic hepatitis B virus infection 
(CHB), with the number of people dying from CHB rising 
from 820 000 in 2019 to 1.1 million in 2022, disproportionately 
affecting populations in the World Health Organization African 
Region (WHO-AFRO) [
1].
One of the most significant barriers to HBV elimination in 
this region is that only 0.2% of people with HBV (PWHB) are 
on treatment [1
], and tests for risk stratification are often 
inaccessible and unaffordable. New 2024 WHO HBV 
management guidelines simplify assessment, but still recommend 
alanine aminotransferase (ALT) measurement or aspartate trans-
aminase (AST)-to-platelet ratio index (APRI) calculation [ 2], 
along with HBV viral load (VL) measurement to determine 
long-term treatment eligibility. HBV VL measurement and/or 
hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg) assessment are also recommended 
to determine eligibility for peri-partum antiviral prophylaxis [3].
Point-of-care tests (POCTs) offfer an attractive alternative to 
these laboratory assays, allowing real-time feedback, potentially 
improving retention in clinical care and viral suppression rates 
[4]. Currently, liver stiffness measurement using elastography is 
the only validated POCT for assessing liver health for PWHB; 
however, the hardware is prohibitively expensive. Current 
POCTs for HBeAg have poor sensitivity [5, 6], and HBV VL 
measurements require a laboratory platform like Gene Xpert 
(Cepheid Inc., Sunnyvale, CA, USA).
Hepatitis B core-related antigen (HBcrAg) correlates with 
peripheral HBV DNA and HBeAg status in untreated individ -
uals [7] and could be an alternative to HBV VL quantification 
in low-resource settings [8]. HBcrAg has previously only been 
available as a chemiluminescent assay (CLEIA). A new HBcrAg 
POCT performed well in The Gambia as a surrogate for HBV 
VL, with a positive test being 91.4% sensitive and 86.3% specific 
for detecting HBV VL >200 
000 IU/mL [9]. Using the labora-
tory HBcrAg CLEIA as a reference, the limit of detection of 
the HBcrAg POCT was around 4.3 logU/mL. The POCT has 
not yet been assessed elsewhere in the general adult population 
with CHB in WHO-AFRO countries, and performance has not 
been evaluated against ALT or liver fibrosis. We set out to eval
-
uate the HBcrAg POCT in PWHB in Kilifi, Kenya, considering 
(i) the ease of testing; (ii) its relationship with ALT, HBeAg sta-
tus, HBV VL, and elastography; and (iii) its contribution to de-
termining treatment eligibility.
METHODS
PWHB were recruited through the STRIKE-HBV study at 
KEMRI-Wellcome Trust Research Programme (KWTRP), which 
identified 102 nonpregnant adults from Kilifi County, Kenya, as 
previously described [10]. Positive HBsAg POCT results were 
confirmed with an enzyme-linked immunoassay (ELISA; Murex 
HBsAg 3, Diasorin). The cohort was 60% female, median age (in-
terquartile range [IQR]) 37 (28–49) years, and 2 people were 
known to have HIV infection. Testing for hepatitis C virus infec
-
tion was not done due to low prevalence [11] and lack of treatment 
availability. Testing for hepatitis D virus was not available.
Transient elastography was undertaken to assess liver health 
at recruitment (FibroScan; Echosens, Paris, France), and blood 
samples were drawn and transported to the research laboratory 
within 2–3 hours of collection, spun to separate serum, and fro -
zen in aliquots at −80°C. Routine laboratory markers were 
measured in a validated diagnostic clinical laboratory at 
KWTRP, including ALT, AST (Ilab Aries), and platelets (AcT 
5diff CP, Beckman Coulter) for APRI score calculation.
HBeAg was tested at the KWTRP research laboratory using 
CLEIA (Ig Biotechnology, CA, USA), HBV VL was tested at 
Oxford University Hospitals, UK, using the Abbott Alinity m 
HBV Assay (IL, USA). The HBcrAg POCT (ESPLINE [RUO], 
Fujirebio, Japan) was shipped from Kumamoto University, 
Japan, stored at room temperature, and undertaken retrospec -
tively on 50-µL defrosted serum in the KWTRP laboratories as 
per the manufacturer’s instructions [ 9 ]; no specific training was 
required. The testing was performed in 3 batches by clinical and 
laboratory staff blinded to patient details including HBV VL 
and HBeAg status. Positive and negative controls were provid -
ed and undertaken once before each batch testing.
Liver health thresholds and treatment eligibility criteria were 
taken from the 2024 WHO HBV guidelines [ 2 ] as follows: 
elastography score >7.0 kPa = significant fibrosis;  >12.5 kPa  
= cirrhosis; APRI >0.5 = significant fibrosis;  >1.0 = cirrhosis. 
Those with the following were defined as treatment eligible: 
(i) elastography score >7 kPa; OR (ii) APRI score >0.5; OR 
(iii) HBV DNA >2000 IU/mL AND ALT > upper limit of 
normal (ULN; 19 IU/L for women, 30 IU/L for men), OR HIV 
coinfected. In the untreated population, we first investigated 
whether ALT alone could identify those who were treatment 
eligible, then evaluated the contribution of the HBcrAg 
POCT. We calculated sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive 
value, and negative predictive value for how well these tests 
identify those eligible for treatment based on WHO guidelines 
( Supplementary Figure 1 ). We chose to use WHO guidelines 
as these have been recently updated and include specific 
recognition of service delivery in resource-limited settings, 
and will thus infrom practice in Kenya and elsewhere in the 
WHO African region. Statistical analysis was done using R, 
version 4.2.0.
RESULTS
HBcrAg POCT was positive in 14/102 PWHB (14%)—with a 
positivity rate of 4/61 (7%) in women and 10/41 (24%) in men 
(P = .01). Those with a positive POCT were younger (median 
age, 28 years compared with 38 years with a negative POCT; 
P = .03). There was no difference in current antiviral treatment 
status between those testing POCT positive or negative 
( Table 1 ). Laboratory personnel reported that the POCT was 
easy to perform. The test turnaround time was ∼40 minutes.
Analysis in the Untreated Population
At cohort entry, 75 PWHB were untreated ( Table 1 ), and 27 
were on nucleoside analogue (NA) therapy ( Supplementary 
Table 1 ). Among the 75 individuals not receiving treatment 
(42 female and 33 male), none was HIV coinfected. The median 
age (IQR) was 40 (27–49) years; 11/75 individuals (15%) had a 
positive HBcrAg POCT. This group had a significantly higher 
median HBV DNA level than those with a negative POCT 
(6.05 log
10 
IU/mL vs 2.7 log
10 
IU/mL, respectively; P < .001) 
( Table 1 ). To identify those with HBV DNA >200 000 IU/ 
mL, HBcrAg POCT had a sensitivity of 100% (7/7) 
( Supplementary Figure 2A ) and a specificity of 94% (64/68). 
All those who had HBV DNA >200 000 IU/mL also tested 
HBeAg positive ( Table 1 ), and all those HBeAg positive were 
also HBcrAg POCT positive ( Supplementary Figure 2B ).
Comparison With Liver Health Markers
A positive HBcrAg POCT was significantly associated with a 
higher median ALT than a negative test (58 IU/L vs 26 IU/L; 
P = .006) ( Table 1 ). Those with a positive POCT also had high -
er median APRI scores (0.57 vs 0.29; P = .003) and were more 
likely to meet APRI criteria for significant fibrosis or cirrhosis 
(8/11 [73%] vs 6/63 [10%], respectively; P < .001) ( Table 1;
Supplementary Figure 2C ). Individuals with a positive 
HBcrAg POCT were more likely to meet elastography criteria 
for significant fibrosis or cirrhosis than those with a negative 
POCT (3/11 [27%] vs 6/64 [9%] with a negative test; P = .03) 
( Supplementary Figure 2D ), but there was no significant differ -
ence in median elastography score between those with a posi -
tive or negative HBcrAg POCT ( Table 1 ).
Review of Treatment Criteria
In this currently untreated group, 27/75 (36%) people met treat -
ment criteria as defined by the WHO guidelines ( Supplementary 
table 2 ). The sensitivity of abnormal ALT alone for identifying 
treatment eligibility was 85% (23/27), compared with 33% (9/ 
27) for a positive HBcrAg POCT alone. Defining treatment eli -
gibility as either an abnormal ALT OR a positive HBcrAg 
POCT increased the sensitivity to 89% (24/27), identifying 1 ex -
tra person as treatment eligible compared with either test alone 
( Supplementary Table 2 and Supplementary Figure 3 ). The extra 
individual identified had a high HBV VL of 6.1 log
10 
IU/mL and 
a FibroScan score of 10.1 kPa, suggesting some existing liver fi -
brosis, a risk of progressive chronic liver disease, and a potential 
transmission risk. The improved sensitivity was to the detriment 
of specificity, but as per 2024 WHO guidelines, overtreating is 
preferential to missing those who need treatment [ 2 ].
The positive predictive value (PPV) of the HBcrAg POCT 
alone for treatment eligibility was 82%, but the negative pre -
dictive value (NPV) was only 28%. Defining treatment eligibil -
ity as either a positive HBcrAg POCT OR an abnormal ALT 
reduced the PPV to 47% but improved the NPV to 88%, indi -
cating an 88% certainty that the individual did not meet treat -
ment criteria if both tests were normal ( Supplementary 
Table 2 ).

DISCUSSION
This is the first report directly comparing the HBcrAg POCT with 
ALT, markers of liver fibrosis, and HBeAg status. Here, a positive 
HBcrAg POCT was strongly associated with liver inflammation 
by ALT and with fibrosis/cirrhosis by both FibroScan and 
APRI scores. However, as expected, the HBcrAg POCT alone 
had a lower sensitivity for identifying those meeting WHO treat
-
ment criteria than ALT alone (33% vs 85%). Addition of the 
POCT to ALT did identify 1 extra person as treatment eligible, 
and the combination of tests improved the sensitivity of either 
test alone; however, further assessment is needed to see if this 
benefit translates to larger populations. Although the NPV of 
both tests combined was 88%, using this approach to make treat
-
ment decisions would still miss 12% of people at risk of liver dis-
ease progression in this population.
In this cohort, a positive HBcrAg POCT was 100% sensitive at 
identifying a sample that was laboratory positive for HBeAg, per-
forming much better than currently available HBeAg POCTs, 
which have sensitivities ranging from 30% to 62% [5, 6]. In this 
study, a positive HBcrAg POCT was 100% sensitive at identifying 
those with HBV VL >
200 000 IU/mL, which is higher than re-
ported from the Gambia [9]. This POCT is therefore of potential

clinical utility in identifying individuals eligible for perinatal an -
tiviral prophylaxis. This is the first time this POCT has been eval -
uated in East Africa, where circulating HBV genotypes differ 
from those in West Africa.
This HBcrAg POCT is quick and could be undertaken 
without specific training. It has a relatively low production 
cost (<$5 per test) compared with HBV VL, which varies in 
price across WHO-AFRO up to $62/test [ 1 ], and HBeAg, which 
can be up to $40/test for the laboratory ELISA [ 12 , 13 ], assum -
ing these tests are actually available. ALT is relatively low cost 
(<$10) and available in much of WHO-AFRO, so it continues 
to be a good method of liver health assessment in the absence of 
other tests. Further implementation research is needed to de -
termine whether inclusion of the HBcrAg POCT alongside 
ALT could enhance linkage to care and improve decentraliza -
tion of clinical assessment and how its impact and cost- 
effectiveness varies by setting.
The number of PWHB included in this study was small, from 
a specific geographical region, and did not include children/ad -
olescents or pregnant women. We did not have access to a 
HBeAg POCT or gold standard method of assessing liver dis -
ease such as cross-sectional imaging or liver biopsy.
CONCLUSIONS
HBcrAg POCT correlates strongly with several liver disease 
markers in PWHB. However, it does not perform better than 
ALT at identifying those with abnormal elastography or 
APRI scores, so it should be used as an adjunct rather than a 
standalone. It could provide a low-cost alternative to some oth -
erwise unavailable, unaffordable diagnostics; further evaluation 
is required in different settings.
