in metabolically engineered baker’s yeast 
improves transaminase-oxidoreductase coupled 
asymmetric whole-cell bioconversion

Abstract 
Background: Saccharomyces cerevisiae can be engineered to perform a multitude of different chemical reactions 
that are not programmed in its original genetic code. It has a large potential to function as whole-cell biocatalyst for 
one-pot multistep synthesis of various organic molecules, and it may thus serve as a powerful alternative or comple-
ment to traditional organic synthetic routes for new chemical entities (NCEs). However, although the selectivity in 
many cases is high, the catalytic activity is often low which results in low space-time-yields. In the case for NADH-
dependent heterologous reductive reactions, a possible constraint is the availability of cytosolic NADH, which may be 
limited due to competition with native oxidative enzymes that act to maintain redox homeostasis. In this study, the 
effect of increasing the availability of cytosolic NADH on the catalytic activity of engineered yeast for transamination-
reduction coupled asymmetric one-pot conversion was investigated.
Results: A series of active whole-cell biocatalysts were constructed by over-expressing the (S)-selective 
ω-transaminase (VAMT) from Capsicum chinense together with the NADH-dependent (S)-selective alcohol dehydro-
genase (SADH) originating from Rhodococcus erythropolis in strains with or without deletion of glycerol-3-phosphate 
dehydrogenases 1 and 2 (GPD1 and GPD2). The yeast strains were evaluated as catalysts for simultaneous: (a) kinetic 
resolution of the racemic mixture to (R)-1-phenylethylamine, and (b) reduction of the produced acetophenone to 
(S)-1-phenylethanol. For the gpd1Δgpd2Δ strain, cell metabolism was effectively used for the supply of both amine 
acceptors and the co-factor pyridoxal-5′-phosphate (PLP) for the ω-transaminase, as well as for regenerating NADH 
for the reduction. In contrast, there was nearly no formation of (S)-1-phenylethanol when using the control strain with 
intact GPDs and over-expressing the VAMT-SADH coupling. It was found that a gpd1Δgpd2Δ strain over-expressing 
SADH had a 3-fold higher reduction rate and a 3-fold lower glucose requirement than the strain with intact GPDs over-
expressing SADH.
Conclusions: Overall the results demonstrate that the deletion of the GPD1 and GPD2 genes significantly increases 
activity of the whole-cell biocatalyst, and at the same time reduces the co-substrate demand in a process configura-
tion where only yeast and sugar is added to drive the reactions, i.e. without addition of external co-factors or pros-
thetic groups.

Background
Chiral amines and chiral alcohols are important func -
tional moieties in many bioactive compounds and they 
are essential for completing total synthesis of vari -
ous drugs [1]. There is thus a need for economically 
and environmentally sustainable methods for their 
preparation. Chiral amines and alcohols can be gen
-
erated enzymatically from ketones by the action of 
ω-transaminases (ω-TAs) [2, 3] and ketone reductases 
(KREDs) [4], respectively. ω-TAs require the prosthetic 
group pyridoxal-5′-phosphate (PLP) for functionality 
and also a sufficient supply of amine acceptor or amine 
donor molecules depending on the mode of operation, 
i.e. kinetic resolution of racemic amines or direct amina
-
tion of ketones. In most described biocatalytic transami -
nations, the required enzymes, PLP and amine acceptors/
donors have been directly added to the reaction mixture 
[5]. Similarly, asymmetric reduction of ketones to chi
-
ral alcohols by KREDs require addition of the cofactor 
NADH or NADPH and a system for hydride recycling, 
e.g. by the action of formate dehydrogenase or glucose 
dehydrogenase.
Coupled transamination and reduction reactions can 
be used for conversion of alcohols to amines or for the 
reverse reaction, i.e. amines to alcohols, and are useful 
tools in the organic synthetic toolbox for functional mod
-
ification and synthesis of new chemical entities (NCEs). 
The coupled two-step reactions can be catalysed in one-
pot by living microbial cells that co-express the required 
enzymes and use cell metabolism for (re-)generation of 
co-factors, prosthetic groups, and essential co-substrates. 
Other strongholds of using microbial cells as catalysts 
include high selectivity, renewable origin and a simpli
-
fied upstream processing, as well as operation under rela-
tively mild and environmentally benign conditions [6]. In 
line with this, one-pot conversion of 1,10-decanediol to 
1,10-diaminedecane was recently achieved in engineered 
Escherichia coli strains co-expressing alcohol dehydro
-
genase, transaminase, and alanine dehydrogenase [7]. 
Baker’s yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae was previously 
engineered for kinetic resolution of racemic 1-pheny
-
lethylamine to (R)-1-phenylethylamine and simultaneous 
reduction of the formed acetophenone to (R)-1-pheny
-
lethanol [8]. The reactions were catalysed in  vivo by a 
recombinant ω-TA from Capsicum chinense co-expressed 
with a recombinant NADPH-dependent alcohol dehy
-
drogenase from Lactobacillus kefir. Both PLP and amine 
acceptors (for example pyruvate) for the ω-TA [9], as well 
as NADPH for the oxidoreductase [8] was previously 
shown to be possible to provide from cell metabolism. 
However, the engineered yeast biocatalysts suffered from 
low specific activity which leads to high loadings of yeast 
and sugar in order to reach high conversions.
A possible limiting factor for KRED-based reaction 
cascades is the availability of intracellular NAD(P)H [10, 
11]. To increase the availability of NADPH, a number 
of in vivo systems in which the cellular carbon metabo
-
lism is used to fuel the oxidation-reduction cycle have 
been developed [12, 13]. For example, metabolically 
engineered S. cerevisiae with increased flux through the 
pentose-phosphate pathway resulting in an increased 
availability of NADPH for recombinant oxidoreductases 
have been described [14]. The NADPH platform was suc
-
cessfully used with different NADPH-dependent KREDs 
for preparative-scale production of chiral alcohols via 
whole-cell bioconversion of prochiral ketones [10, 15] or 
from the racemic mixtures [11, 16]. Other recent exam
-
ples of engineered whole-cell systems in which the native 
cell metabolism was re-wired for an increased availabil
-
ity of NADPH is the cyclised pentose-phosphate path -
way system in Corynebacterium glutamicum [17] and the 
elevated activity of transhydrogenase and NAD
+ kinase 
in E. coli [18].
With regards to NADH in baker’s yeast, the NADH 
formed in the glycolysis during fermentative or respire-
fermentative mode of metabolism is oxidized by alcohol 
dehydrogenases (ADHs) that catalyse the reduction of 
acetaldehyde to ethanol. Under oxygen-limited condi
-
tions, the additional cytosolic NADH formed from ana -
bolic reactions such as during amino acid biosynthesis is 
oxidized by glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GPD) 
isoenzymes 1 and 2, which catalyse the reduction of dihy
-
droxyacetone phosphate (DHAP) to glycerol-3-phos -
phate [19, 20]. Thus, to fully exploit the cellular capacity 
to regenerate NADH required for whole-cell biocata -
lytic reactions, there may be a need to deactivate native 
NADH oxidating enzymes. It has previously been dem
-
onstrated that the limited capacity to oxidize NADH in 
gpd1Δgpd2Δ strain can be exploited to achieve higher 
formation of xylitol [21, 22] and butanol [23].
In this study, the suitability of gpd1Δgpd2Δ yeast to 
function as platform host for whole-cell biocatalytic 
transaminase-reductase coupled reactions was evalu
-
ated. For this purpose, the use of gpd1Δgpd2Δ yeast for 
simultaneous preparation of chiral (R)-1-phenylethyl -
amine and chiral (S)-1-phenylethanol from the racemic 
amine (Additional file  1: Figure S1) was compared to 
strains with intact GPD. (R)-1-phenylethylamine and (S)-
1-phenylethanol are important synthons for production 
of various bioactive molecules, and their preparation by 
whole-cell biocatalysis offers an attractive alternative to 
chemical synthesis [8]. Herein, the whole-cell biocata
-
lytic activity, NADH regeneration rate, glucose demand, 
and general physiological response of the engineered 
gpd1Δgpd2Δ yeast also over-expressing a recombinant 
ω-TA and a KRED are discussed.

Construction of whole‑cell biocatalysts 
with over‑expressed VAMT and SADH
Native S. cerevisiae does not possess any background 
transaminase activity for (S)- or (R)-1-phenyethylamine 
[9], and only a very limited activity for the reduction 
of acetophenone to (S)-1-phenylethanol by endog
-
enous oxidoreductases [8]. A series of active S. cerevi -
siae whole-cell biocatalysts were therefore constructed 
by over-expressing synthetic codon-optimized genes 
encoding an (S)-selective ω-TA from C. chinense (vanil
-
lin aminotransferase, VAMT) [24] coupled to a NADH-
dependent (S)-selective alcohol dehydrogenase (SADH) 
from Rhodococcus erythropolis [25]. VAMT and SADH 
were chosen based on their substrate specificity and that 
they have previously been shown to have excellent enan
-
tio-selectivity; VAMT for the conversion of (S)-1-phe -
nylethylamine to acetophenone [24] and SADH for the 
conversion of acetophenone to (S)-1-phenylethanol [25]. 
In the case of VAMT, it has also previously been shown 
to be active in S. cerevisiae for the reaction under investi
-
gation herein [8, 9].
The codon-optimized synthetic gene coding for SADH 
was cloned into a yeast integrative plasmid (YIp) either 
alone or in combination with the codon-optimized syn
-
thetic gene encoding VAMT. SADH and VAMT  were 
cloned downstream of the PGK1 and TDH3 promot -
ers, respectively, which are known to be constitutive 
and highly expressed [26]. The YIp-constructs with only 
SADH (YIpOB7-SADH) or with both SADH and VAMT  
(YIpOB7-SADH-VAMT) were transformed in S. cer
-
evisiae CEN.PK background strains (TMB4132 and 
TMB4133) with intact or deleted GPD1 and GPD2 genes, 
resulting in four different active whole-cell biocatalysts 
(TMB4160–TMB4163) (Table 1). Two additional strains 
(TMB4140 and TMB4144) with the empty plasmids were 
also used as negative controls to determine background 
activity of endogenous enzymes.
Evaluation of the effect of GPD deletion on acetophenone 
reduction by strains expressing SADH
The effect of deleting the GPD1,2 genes on the bioreduc -
tion step was first evaluated in strains over-expressing 
only SADH (TMB4160 and TMB4161). Cells were grown 
in aerobic batch mode in shake flasks and harvested in 
early stationary phase. The cell biomass was subsequently 
used for whole-cell bioconversion of acetophenone to 
(S)-1-phenylethanol in small-scale glass vials sealed with 
rubber stoppers to ensure fermentative metabolism. 
The reaction solution was based on a defined mineral 
medium with an excess of glucose (50  g/l) to allow for 
cell growth and thus generation of NADH from anabolic 
reactions. Sealing of the reaction vessels led to a fast con
-
sumption of the initially available oxygen which conse -
quently resulted in an oxygen-limited environment and 
thus a strong need for NADH oxidation via the glycerol 
biosynthesis pathway.
The conversion of acetophenone to (S)-1-phenyletha
-
nol was approximately 2-fold higher for the gpd1Δgpd2Δ 
strain over-expressing SADH (TMB4161) as compared 
to the control strain with intact GPD-genes (TMB4160) 
(Fig. 1a). The same trends were observed when compar
-
ing the whole-cell bioreduction of acetophenone cata -
lysed by strains over-expressing both VAMT  and SADH 
TMB4162-63 (3-fold higher activity in the gpd1Δgpd2Δ 
strain) (Fig. 1b, Table 2).

After 6  h of whole-cell bioconversion of acetophe -
none, the concentration of (S)-1-phenylethanol was 
approximately 5.7 mM and 2.8 mM for the gpd1Δgpd2Δ 
(TMB4163) and control (TMB4162) strains, respectively. 
The enantiomeric excess (ee ) of the produced alcohol 
was >99 % for all SADH over-expression strains, indicat
-
ing limited competing activity from endogenous KREDs 
with opposite selectivity. This was also demonstrated 
by an neglectable conversion of acetophenone with the 
negative control strain (TMB4132) lacking SADH (data 
not shown), which is in accordance with a previously 
performed study [8]. The substantially higher reductase 
activity in cell extracts of strains over-expressing SADH as 
compared to the background activity of native reductases 
(for example YMR226c, [27]) was confirmed by enzyme 
activity measurements (Table  2). It is noteworthy that 
although the activity in cell extract was more than 2-fold 
higher for the control strain (TMB4160) as compared to 
the gpd1Δgpd2Δ strain (TMB4161), the rate of reaction 
with the metabolically active whole-cell biocatalysts dis
-
played the reversed order of activity, i.e. the conversion 
with whole-cells was 2-fold higher for the gpd1Δgpd2Δ 
strain. This indicated that the higher catalytic activity 
in the gpd1Δgpd2Δ strain did not result from a higher 
Sadhp level, but was indeed ascribed to a higher avail
-
ability of NADH for the reaction in that strain. Addition -
ally, a similar effect was observed when VAMT  gene was 
present for TMB4162 (VAMT and SADH) and TMB4163 
(VAMT and SADH, gpd1Δgpd2Δ), i.e. the double dele
-
tion strain displayed 3-fold higher reductase activity than 
the control strain (Fig.  2). However, in addition to the 
increased availability of NADH in the gpd1Δgpd2Δ strain 
(TMB4163), a 2-fold higher specific reductase activity in 
cell extract was also measured (Table 2).
Whole‑cell bioconversion of racemic 1‑phenylethylamine 
to (S)‑1‑phenylethanol in strains over‑expressing SADH 
and VAMT
The effect of deleting GPD1,2 on the two-step conversion 
of (S)-1-phenylethylamine enantiomer of the racemic 
amine into acetophenone and then further to (S)-1-phe
-
nylethanol (Additional file  1: Figure S1) was evaluated. 
Whole-cell bioconversions of 5  mM racemic 1-pheny -
lethylamine were performed under similar conditions as 
described above, e.g. in defined mineral medium, anoxic 
conditions, and with an excess (50 g/l) of glucose. Thus, 
under the applied process conditions, glucose was the 
sole co-substrate to supply NADH for carbonyl reduc
-
tion, as well as to supply amine acceptor (for example 
pyruvate), and the essential prosthetic group PLP for the 
transamination reaction [9].
The resolution of the racemate to (R)-1-PEA was very 
low for the yeast strain with intact GPD-genes as cata
-
lyst (TMB4162) (Fig.  2a), and only a limited conversion 
of the racemate was obtained (4  % conversion and 4  % 
ee of (R)-1-PEA after 24  h). This is in agreement with 
the 5  % conversion that was observed earlier in a simi
-
lar background strain only carrying the VAMT and where 
the reaction configurations was with growing cells [8]. 
The ee was however significantly higher than when using 
control yeast strains as catalyst, since without the expres

summary, this demonstrates that the over-expressed 
recombinant transaminase was active, although to a 
relatively low degree. The stereo-selectivity was how
-
ever high and no conversion of the R-enantiomer was 
detected in any of the experiments made throughout this 
study, which is in agreement with a previously performed 
characterization of the enzyme [24]. The low conver
-
sion of the amine resulted in formation of acetophenone 
below the limit of detection and a concentration of (S)-
1-phenylethanol below 0.1  mM for the control strain 
(Fig. 2b). This low reaction rate might have been caused 
by product inhibition of the enzyme, however the ace
-
tophenone concentrations obtained were well below the 
concentration where acetophenone has previously been 
shown to inhibit VAMT (5 mM) [8]. The low conversion 
was therefore more likely explained by a low VAMT level 
and/or limitation in available PLP , since this has been 
shown previously to influence whole-cell biocatalytic 
transamination activity [9].
For the gpd1Δgpd2Δ strain (TMB4163), the specific 
whole-cell transamination activity was 3-fold higher 
as compared to the strain with intact GPD (TMB4162), 
resulting in a more efficient kinetic resolution (18 % con
-
version and 22 % ee  after 48 h), and a final concentration 
of (S)-1-phenylethanol of approximately 1 mM (Fig.  2a–
b). The two strains contained the same number of gene 
copies as determined with qPCR (data not shown). 
Hence, the difference in activity may therefore not be due 
to different levels of the recombinant transaminase but 
rather to a more efficient reduction step.
Glucose assimilation and regeneration of NADH 
during reaction progress
In accordance with previous studies [21, 28] the rate 
of sugar consumption differed significantly between 
the gpd1Δgpd2Δ strain and the control strain (Fig.  3a; 
Table  3). The gpd1Δgpd2Δ strain consumed glucose 
at a 3-fold lower rate than the control strain (29  mM/h 
vs. 74 mM/h). At the same time the reduction of aceto
-
phenone to phenylethanol (Fig.  1) occurred at a higher 
rate in that strain (Table  2), leading to a higher co-sub -
strate yield for the reduction as compared to the control 
(Y
P/S = 0.05 vs 0.01 mmol chiral alcohol produced/mmol 
glucose consumed, respectively). The rate of NADH gen -
erated from glucose through glycolysis and regenerated 
via ethanol, glycerol, and 1-phenylethanol production 
was estimated from their specific production and con
-
sumption rates (Table  2). Most of the NADH produced 
in glycolysis was oxidized by yeast native alcohol dehy -
drogenase resulting in a significant ethanol production 
for both strains (Fig.  3a and Table  3). Nevertheless, the 
ethanol concentration for the gpd1Δgpd2Δ strain was 
significantly lower than for the control, which may have 
implications for potentially adverse synergistic effect 
with toxic substrates/products.
Cell growth rate during whole-cell conversion of ace
-
tophenone was approximately 2-fold higher for the wild 
type strain than the double deletion strains (Fig.  3b, 
Table  3). Furthermore, growth arrested after approxi
-

type strain coincided with glucose depletion. For the

or deleted (TMB4163) (open symbols) glycerol-3-phosphate dehy-

50 g/l glucose, in a defined mineral medium buffered to pH 7. S. 
cerevisiae was grown in aerobic batch mode in stirred tank reactors 
with defined media with glucose as carbon and energy source and 
harvested by centrifugation in early stationary phase. Mean values 
and standard deviations are calculated from two different whole-cell 
bioconversions

gpd1Δgpd2Δ strain there was still  >30  g/l of glucose 
left in the solution and the arrest in growth was instead 
related to lack of oxygen in the bioreactor. This was in 
accordance to previous studies where it has been shown 
that the capacity to proliferate depends on the capac
-
ity to oxidize NADH [20, 22]. Nevertheless, growth was 
not sustained but there was still a significant degree of 
glucose consumption (Fig.  3a) and thus a significant 
NADH regeneration throughout the course of reaction 
(24–48 h).
In fact, the presence of acetophenone or racemic 
1-phenylethylamine did not influence growth rate or 
glucose consumption rate during the reactions for any 
of the strains. With this follows that the substrates were 
not added at an inhibitory concentration. Furthermore, 
it also demonstrates that the increased NADH oxida
-
tion caused by the SADH-catalysed reduction of aceto -
phenone was insufficient to compensate for the lack of 
NADH oxidation by GPD1 and GPD2 and thereby insuf
-
ficient to restore the poor growth of gpd1Δgpd2Δ strain 
under oxygen-limited conditions.
Discussion
By enhancing the availability of cytosolic NADH through 
deletion of GPD-catalysed NADH reoxidation, the effi
-
ciency of whole-cell reduction of acetophenone, and 
two-step conversion of racemic 1-phenylethylamine to 
(R)-1-phenylethylamine and (S)-1-phenylethanol was 
significantly increased. This demonstrates that the cyto

solic NADH generated from anabolic reactions under 
anaerobic conditions was made available for the SADH-
catalysed reduction. Conversion of glucose to ethanol is 
redox neutral as the 2 mol of NADH generated per mole 
of glucose in the Embden-Meyerhof-Parnas pathway 
are oxidized by branching of pyruvate to ethanol, with a 
theoretical yield of 2 mol ethanol per glucose. Thus, any 
additional NADH formed during biosynthesis cannot 
be oxidized by ADH1 that is the main enzyme respon
-
sible for regeneration of NAD + by conversion of acet -
aldehyde to ethanol. Instead, the NADH formed during 
biosynthesis is oxidized by GPD1- and GPD2-catalysed 
reduction of DHAP to glycerol-3-phosphate. Conse
-
quently, removal of the glycerol pathway decreases the 
native NADH oxidation capacity, which then leads to a 
highly reducing intracellular environment which could 
successfully be diverted in favour of the recombinant 
NADH—dependent oxidoreductase resulting in signifi
-
cantly higher conversion of acetophenone to (S)-1-phe -
nylethanol. Under these conditions it has previously been 
shown that the limited capacity for NADH oxidation in 
the gpd1Δgpd2Δ strain results in an inability to prolif
-
erate under oxygen-limited conditions [20]. However, it 
has also previously been shown that over-expression of a 
recombinant xylose reductase and addition of xylose as 
external electron acceptor could provide gpd1Δgpd2Δ 
yeast with the ability to overcome the hurdle, resulting 
in improved growth and product formation, i.e. xylitol 
[21, 22]. An improvement in cell proliferation for the 
gpd1Δgpd2Δ strain during the parallel reaction system 
under study herein was not observed, thus indicating that

Fig. 3 Glucose consumption, metabolite formation, and cell density 
during conversion of acetophenone to (S)-1-phenylethanol with 
cells over-expressing both SADH and VAMT. Reactions were catalysed 
using recombinant S. cerevisiae strains over-expressing SADH from R. 
erythropolis and VAMT from C. chinense, and having native (TMB4162) 
(filled symbols) or deleted (TMB4163) (open symbols) glycerol-3-phos-
phate dehydrogenase (GPD) activity. Symbols a: glucose (diamonds), 
ethanol (squares) and glycerol (circles); b cell concentration measured 
as optical density at 620 nm (OD
620) (triangles). Reaction conditions 
were as follows: 5 g (dw)/l recombinant S. cerevisiae, 5 mM racemic 
1-phenylethylamine, 50 g/l glucose, in a defined mineral medium 
buffered to pH 7. S. cerevisiae was grown in aerobic batch mode in 
stirred tank reactors with defined media with glucose as carbon and 
energy source and harvested by centrifugation in early stationary 
phase. Mean values and standard deviations are calculated from two 
different whole-cell bioconversions

was insufficient to sustain growth. With this follows that 
there may still be an over-capacity of available NADH in 
the system, and that an even higher reduction rate might 
be achievable by further elevation of SADH activity.
The lower formation of biomass under reaction 
conditions may facilitate down-stream processing, 
as this previously have been shown to correlate to 
reduced extraction yields [11]. It is well known that the 
gpd1Δgpd2Δ strain cannot grow under anaerobic con
-
ditions and exhibits hampered growth in aerobic shake 
flask cultivations—traits attributed to deficiency in the 
strains NADH oxidizing capacity [20]. This has been con
-
sidered a limiting factor for the exploitation of the strain 
for biocatalytic purposes. However, recent findings indi
-
ciate that the aerobic growth limitatation can be over -
come by applying high aereration rates [28]. This allows 
for an efficient cultivation of the biocatalyst and thus 
opens further exploitation of the strain.
When only considering the reduction of acetophe
-
none to (S)-1-phenylethanol, the co-substrate yield (Y P/S, 
moles product/moles glucose) for the gpd1Δgpd2Δ 
strains over-expressing SADH (TMB4161 and TMB4163) 
was significantly higher than for the control with intact 
GPD activity (TMB4160 and TMB4162). This was a con
-
sequence of reduced glucose consumption combined 
with increased availability of NADH and higher carbonyl 
reductase activity. The yield (Y
P/S  =  0.05  mmol/mmol) 
was however lower than a previously developed NADPH-
accumulating yeast platform system (Y
P/S = 0.32 mmol/
mmol), in which glucose metabolism was engineered to 
improve the efficiency of the NADPH-dependent enan
-
tio-selective reduction of a bicyclic diketone [14]. Sev -
eral advantages follow with the decreased glucose flux, 
e.g. it results in the mentioned lower demand for glucose 
for the reaction, as well as lower by-product formation. 
In particular, less ethanol that can be inhibitory to yeast 
metabolism, and may contribute synergistically to an 
increased toxicity of reactants or products, is formed.

at a significantly higher rate than racemic 1-phenyleth

ylamine was converted to (S)-1-phenylethanol when 
using either the wild type or the double deletion strains. 
In addition, no acetophenone was detected at any time

ground, suggesting that it was consumed as quickly as 
it was formed. Although the increased NADH availabil
-
ity improved the rate of the SADH-catalysed reaction, 
together the results demonstrate that the rate-limiting 
step of the two-step conversion of racemic 1-phenyleth
-
ylamine to (S)-1-phenylethanol was the initial transami -
nation reaction in the cascade reaction. This observation 
has been reported previously for a similar system based 
on the same ω-TA but instead coupled to a NADPH-
dependent oxidoreductase from L. kefir [8]. It is likely 
that the reaction cascade can be improved further by 
elevating the specific whole-cell transamination activity 
by for example increasing the intracellular VAMT con
-
centration, which have been shown previously to give a 
positive effect [29]. It has also been shown that addition 
of the co-factor PLP of the transamination to the reac
-
tion solution can improve the reaction [9]. On the other 
hand, the capacity for PLP-dependent reactions in yeast 
was previously calculated to be 1.3  mM/gdw/l, which is 
significantly higher than the maximum rate of transami
-
nation reaction achieved in the present study [9].
Conclusions
In the present study it is demonstrated that by decreas -
ing competition from native NADH-specific oxidative 
enzymes it was possible to increase the activity of the 
whole-cell biocatalyst for NADH-dependent transam
-
inase-reductase coupled synthesis and at the same time 
reduce the requirement for glucose to supply intracellu
-
lar co-substrates and co-factors. The improvement was 
shown to be valid both for the NADH-dependent one-
step conversion of acetophenone to (S)-1-phenylethanol 
Table 3 Initial growth rates, rates of  substrate consumption, metabolite formation and  calculated NADH balance dur-
ing whole-cell reduction of acetophenone to (S)-1-phenylethanol
Rates were calculated for the first 4 h of reaction. NADH balance was calculated from the following assumptions: (i) under anaerobic conditions 2 mol of NADH are 
theoretically generated per mole glucose consumed. The value is in reality higher since NADH is also generated in anabolic reactions; (ii) 1 mol of NADH is oxidized 
per mole of ethanol, glycerol or (S)-1-phenylethanol being produced. During the initial phase of reaction there was also a low amount of oxygen in the bioreactor 
which also functioned as electron acceptor in respiration. Mean values and standard deviations are calculated from two different whole-cell bioconversions

Methods
Chemicals
Acetophenone, racemic 1-phenylethylamine (1-PEA), 
and the pure enantiomers (R)-1-PEA and (S)-1-PEA, all 
with a purity of  ≥98.0  %, were purchased from Merck 
(Hohenbrunn, Germany). (R)-1-phenylethanol and (S)-
1-phenylethanol were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich 
(Steinheim, Germany), both with a purity of ≥98.0 %, and 
all other chemicals were from VWR (Leuven, Belgium).
Strains and plasmids
S. cerevisiae strains and plasmids used in this study are 
listed in Table  1. Escherichia coli NEB 5α (New England 
BioLabs, Ipswich, MA, USA) was used for subcloning. 
All strains were stored in 20 % glycerol at −80 °C. Yeast 
strains were grown on solid YNB media (6.7  g/l yeast 
nitrogen base without amino acids, 20  g/l glucose and 
20 g/l agar) before they were inoculated in the preculture 
as described below.
Molecular biology methods
Plasmid DNA was prepared using the GeneJET Plas -
mid Miniprep Kit (Thermo Scientific, USA). Restric -
tion enzymes and T4 DNA ligase were obtained from 
the same manufacturer. The QIAquick gel extraction kit 
(QIagen, Hilden, Germany) was used for DNA extrac
-
tions from agarose. Nucleotides were purchased from 
Eurofins (Germany). Genetic constructs were checked 
by sequencing (Eurofins, Germany). Genomic DNA was 
extracted with a bead-beater (Biospecs Products, Bartles
-
ville, OK, USA) and phenol/chloroform [30]. PCR was 
performed with DreamTaq Polymerase (Thermo Scien
-
tific, Germany).
Plasmid construction
Genes encoding VAMT  [Genbank: AAC78480.1, Uni -
prot: O82521] [24] and SADH [Genbank: AY161280.1, 
Uniprot: Q6YBW1] [25] were codon-optimized for S. cer
-
evisiae and ordered from GenScript (New Jersey, USA). 
The VAMT containing sequence was digested with XbaI, 
the SADH containing fragment was digested with BglII, 
and the digested fragments were ligated separately or 
together with YIpOB7 [31] that had been digested with 
the same restrictions enzymes resulting in plasmids 
YIpOB7- SADH and YIpOB7-SADH-VAMT (Table  1). 
Correct orientation of the inserts and sequences were 
verified by restriction analysis and sequencing.
Transformation
S. cerevisiae transformations were performed using the 
lithium acetate method [32], and transformants were 
selected on defined medium without amino acids or base. 
E. coli transformations were performed according to the 
Inoue method [33], and selected on Lysogeny Broth (LB) 
plates [30] with 50  μg/ml ampicillin (IBI Shelton Scien
-
tific, Shelton, CT, USA).
Construction of yeast strains
Plasmids YIpOB7-SADH and YIpOB7-SADH-VAMT 
were digested with ApaI and both transformed sepa
-
rately into TMB4132 and TMB4133 yielding the 
strains TMB4160 (control, YIpOB7-SADH), TMB4161 
(gpd1Δgpd2Δ, YIpOB7-SADH), TMB4162 (control, 
YIpOB7-SADH-VAMT) and TMB4163 (gpd1Δgpd2Δ, 
YIpOB7-SADH-VAMT).
Quantitative PCR (qPCR)
qPCR was performed with a LightCycler Nano (Roche, 
Switzerland) to determine relative copy number of 
the heterologous genes in the constructed strains as 
described previously [8]. The primers were designed to 
amplify a region of VAMT  gene [8]. Genomic DNA was 
extracted from TMB4160, TMB4161, TMB4162, and 
TMB4163 using the Yeast DNA Extraction Kit (Thermo
-
scientific, Germany) and the DNA concentrations were 
measured with Biodrop (Biodrop, Cambridge UK). ExTaq 
HS polymerase (TaKaRa Bio, Japan) was used in the reac
-
tion with DNA-binding dye Eva Green (Biotium, USA).
Enzymatic assay
Cell extract was prepared with Yeast Protein Extrac -
tion Reagent (Thermo Scientific, Pierce, Rockford, USA) 
according to the instructions provided by the manufac
-
turer. The total protein concentration in cell extracts 
was determined using the Bradford method [34] with 
bovine serum albumin (BSA) as standard. SADH activity 
measurements were performed as described previously 
[35]. The activity is based on measuring the oxidation 
of NADH at 340  nm with an Ultrospec 2100 pro spec
-
trophotometer (GE Healthcare Life Sciences, Sweden). 
The data were collected with the software program 
SWIFTII (Amersham Biosciences, Sweden). Cell extracts 
were diluted until the decrease in absorbance was lin
-
ear for 5 min, at which point the activity could be calcu -
lated from the slope. One unit of activity corresponds to 
1 µmol NADH consumed per minute at 25 °C. The assay 
Page 10 of 11Knudsen et al. Microb Cell Fact  (2016) 15:37 
contained sodium phosphate buffer (50 mM, pH 7), ace -
tophenone (10  mM), NADH (0.2  mM), and cell extract 
(1-30 mg/l total protein).
Analyses
Growth was followed by measuring the optical density 
at 620  nm (OD
620) using a spectrophotometer (Ultro -
spec 2100 pro, GE Healthcare Life Sciences, Sweden). 
Glucose, glycerol, ethanol, and acetate were quantified, 
as described previously [36], with a high pressure liq
-
uid chromatography (HPLC) instrument (Waters, Mil -
ford, USA) equipped with an Aminex HPX-87H column 
(Bio-Rad, Richmond, CA, USA) and a RID-10A refrac
-
tive index detector (Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan). The mobile 
phase was 5  mM H
2SO4 and the temperature and flow 
rate were kept constant at 45 °C and 0.6 ml/min, respec -
tively. (R)-1-phenylethylamine, (S)-1-phenylethylamine, 
(R)-1-phenylethanol, (S)-1-phenylethanol, and aceto
-
phenone were quantified as described earlier [8], with a 
HPLC system (Waters, Milford, USA) equipped with a 
Daicel Chiralcel OD-H column (4.6 × 25 mm, 5 μm) and 
a UV/Vis detector 2489. The mobile phase consisted of 
85:15 heptane/propan-2-ol with 0.1 % n-butylamine, the 
flow rate was 1  ml/min and samples were analysed at 
room temperature.
Batch cultivation
Cells were pre-cultured overnight in 10 ml defined min -
eral medium supplemented with 2  % glucose [37], in 
50-ml Falcon tubes which were placed in a rotary shak
-
ing incubator (Innova 43, Germany) set to 180  rpm 
and 30  °C. To produce yeast biomass of TMB4140 and 
TMB4141, cells from the pre-culture were inoculated 
at an OD
620 of approximately 0.1 to a baffled shake flask 
with 50 ml of the same media, and incubated in a shake 
incubator set to 180  rpm and 30  °C. To produce yeast 
biomass of TMB4162 and TMB4163, cells from the 
pre-culture were inoculated at a start OD
620 of approxi -
mately 0.25 for the double deletion strain and OD 620 of 
approximately 0.04 for the wild type strain, in a 1-L Mul -
tifors bioreactor (Infors, Switzerland) containing 500 ml 
defined mineral medium (2  % glucose). Cultivations in 
the Multifors bioreactors were performed at a tempera
-
ture of 30 °C, a pH of 5.5, a stirring of 800 rpm and with 
150 ml/min aeration. Cells were harvested by centrifuga
-
tion (5000 g for 5 min) in the early stationary phase, and 
subsequently used for the whole-cell bioconversions.
Whole‑cell bioconversion
Cells were transferred to sealed glass vials containing 
either 15 or 50  ml defined mineral medium with 50  g/l 
glucose at an initial OD
620 of 10. Ergosterol (0.42 g/l) and 
Tween-80 (0.01  g/l) were added to the vials in order to 
facilitate anaerobic growth [38] and thus generation of 
NADH from anabolic reactions. Whole-cell biocon
-
versions were semi-anaerobic and took place in a 30  °C 
water bath with magnetic stirring. Sampling was made 
aseptically with a syringe and a needle pierced through 
a rubber stopper, which also contained an outlet for 
CO
2 produced during glucose assimilation. The reac -
tions were started by addition of the substrate, which 
were either 7.5  mM acetophenone or 5  mM racemic 
1-phenylethylamine.
