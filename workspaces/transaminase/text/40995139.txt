Abstract. Vaccines can stimulate an immune response. 
However, whether the use of chemotherapy drugs affects the 
body's production of antibodies after vaccination remains to 
be studied. This study reports the case of a 49‑year‑old female 
patient who first visited Chifeng City Hospital (Chifeng, 
China) in January 2021 who was likely naturally infected 
with hepatitis B virus (HBV) during administration of 
vincristine, doxorubicin and prednisone because the patient 
was diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukemia, recovered 
spontaneously and developed high levels of anti‑hepatitis B 
surface antibodies (anti‑HBs). Due to routine testing for hepa‑
titis B during treatment, the test in February 2022 revealed 
that the hepatitis B antigen (HBsAg) level was 0.19 (positive). 
Subsequently, a peripheral blood hepatitis B virus nucleic acid 
test was performed and the results did not show amplifica ‑
tion. In March 2022, the HBsAg quantitative result was 12.8 
(positive). The following day, consolidation chemotherapy 
was performed with the cisplatin, oxaliplatin, doxorubicin, 
etoposide and tegafur regimen and vincristine treatment was 
administered in March 2022. In August 2022, the HBsAg 
quantitative result of the patient was <0.05 (negative) and 
the anti‑HB content was 982  IU/l; 2 days later methotrexate 
combined with pegaspargase treatment was administered. 
Overall, the present study showed that chemotherapy did not 
affect the production of anti‑HBs in the patient.
Introduction
Immunization via vaccination not only prevents the spread of 
infectious diseases in children and adults, but also provides 
lifelong protection against certain diseases (1). However, 
whether the use of chemotherapeutic drugs reduces vaccine 
efficacy remains unclear.
Chemotherapeutic drugs kill hematopoietic cells in the 
bone marrow, which can cause side‑effects such as neutro ‑
penia, erythropenia and thrombocytopenia. Due to changes 
in the immune system, patients with cancer are at a higher 
risk of becoming infected with pathogens than the general 
population, and infections in these patients often lead to 
excessive morbidity and mortality rates (2). This increased 
risk may be related to a variety of causes, including cancer, 
chemotherapy and poor nutrition. Although traditional 
chemotherapy has long been recognized as an effective 
anticancer treatment, its potentially severe side‑effects are 
also widely recognized, including the marked impairment of 
immune function (3). In patients treated with platinum‑based 
drugs, such as epirubicin, doxorubicin, paclitaxel and 
cyclophosphamide chemotherapeutic regimens, the absolute 
numbers of B‑cell subsets significantly decrease between 
2 and 12 weeks of treatment (4). By contrast, treatment with 
methotrexate at various doses for 6 weeks has been shown to 
result in a decrease in B‑cell numbers (5). 
B‑cells play a key role in adaptive immune responses. 
These cells are activated in the germinal centers of secondary 
lymphoid organs to form long‑lived memory B‑cells, which 
differentiate into plasma cells following antigen stimulation 
and produce high‑affinity antibodies. The ‘Clinical Practice 
Guidelines for Vaccination of Immunocompromised Hosts’

issued by the Infectious Diseases Society of America considers 
that live attenuated vaccines should be administered at least 
4 weeks prior to the start of any immunosuppressive treat ‑
ment (6). In the case that radiotherapy or chemotherapy are 
performed, vaccination should be terminated due to concerns 
that live vaccines may cause infection (7). The present study 
reports the case of a patient who was likely naturally infected 
with hepatitis B virus (HBV) during chemotherapy, who recov‑
ered spontaneously and developed high levels of anti‑hepatitis 
Bs (anti‑HBs).
Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), the disease that 
the patient was originally treated for, is a malignant disease 
that originates from B‑ or T‑lymphocytes that proliferate 
abnormally in the bone marrow. ALL can also invade tissues 
outside the bone marrow (such as meninges, lymph nodes and 
peripheral blood) (8). The treatment of ALL usually includes 
four stages: i) Induction therapy; ii) consolidation therapy; 
iii) enhancement therapy; and iv)  targeted therapy to prevent 
the relapse of central nervous system leukemia (9). During 
treatment, patients receive different chemotherapeutic drugs, 
such as vincristine, cytarabine, mercaptopurine, doxorubicin, 
methotrexate, cyclophosphamide and L‑asparaginase (10).
Case report
The patient in the present study was a 49‑year‑old woman as 
of 2024. The vaccination history of the patient was unknown, 
and the patient began to feel weak in January 2021, accompa‑
nied by subcostal and lumbar pain, but did not pay attention 
to it. The patient received treatment at the Chifeng Municipal 
Hospital (Chifeng, China). The patient is a woman who was 
admitted to the hospital for examination in March 2021 and 
was 46 years old at the time. A peripheral blood examina ‑
tion in March, 2021, revealed the following: i) A total white 
blood cell (WBC) count of 56.84x10
9/l (reference interval: 
4‑10x109/l); ii) a lymphocyte ratio (L%) of 87.7% (reference 
interval: 20‑40%) and a neutrophil ratio (N%) of 6.95% (refer‑
ence interval: 50‑70%); iii) a total red blood cell (RBC) count 
of 2.47x10
12/l (reference interval: 3.5‑5.0x1012/l) and a hemo ‑
globin (Hb) level of 75 g/l (reference interval: 110‑150 g/l); 
and iv) a platelet (PLT) count of 20x10
9/l (reference interval: 
100‑300x109/l). Blood test results revealed that primitive cells 
accounted for 84% of the cells (reference interval: 0%). The 
morphological description was that a large number of primitive 
cells were observed, mature RBCs were of different sizes, no 
nucleated RBCs or RBC inclusion bodies were observed and 
the PLTs were relatively few. The bone marrow morphology 
report was grade 1‑2 myeloproliferation, mainly the abnormal 
proliferation of lymphoid system cells, mature RBCs of 
different sizes and primitive lymphocytes of the lymphocyte 
system accounting for 95%. The primitive lymphocytes in the 
bone marrow smear are of different sizes, with more nuclear 
chromatin, visible nucleoli, less serous fluid, blue color, no 
granules, larger nuclei, and darker cytoplasm (Fig. 1A and B). 
Primitive lymphocytes were also found in the peripheral 
blood (Fig. 1C and D). The diagnosis of ALL was made. 
Immunophenotyping revealed that immature cells accounted 
for 91.6% of all cells expressing CD19, CD38, CD43, CD58, 
Figure 1. Numerous primitive lymphocytes appear in the bone marrow and peripheral blood. Bone marrow smears from the patient in (A) 10x and (B) 40x

CD79a and HLA‑DR (human leukocyte antigen DR α chain 
precursor); some cells expressed CD123, CD81, CD24, CD15, 
glial antigen 2 and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase; 
there was no expression of CD45, CD5, CD10, CD7, CD56, 
CD117, CD34, CD33, CD65, CD13, CD66c, CD22, CD20, 
c/m
κ and c/m λ. The IKAROS family zinc finger 1 mutation 
status was positive.
In March 2021, the patient received 1.4 mg/m 2 of vincris‑
tine, 40 mg/m 2 of doxorubicin and 1.4 mg/m 2 of prednisone 
based on the body surface area (m 2). The aforementioned 
medication is called VDP chemotherapy regimen. Bone 
marrow morphology analysis suggested that the patient 
achieved morphological remission after 15 days of VDP 
chemotherapy regimen. The day after the first administration 
of VDP , the test result of HBsAg was <0.05 IU/ml (nega ‑
tive). One intramuscular injection of 3,750 IU pegaspargase 
was given in April 2021. A further 13 days later, the patient 
received methotrexate (MTX) chemotherapy at a dose of 
1 g/m2 (body surface area), with a total dose of 1.6 g. After 
24 h, the MTX concentration in the blood was 0.086 µmol/l. In 
May 2021, the quantitative result of HBsAg was <0.05 IU/ml 
(negative). A cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin and metho ‑
trexate (CAM) chemotherapy program was administered in 
June 2021. In July 2021, the patient was treated once with 
daunorubicin (total dose 30 mg) and cytarabine (total dose 
7.2 mg). Subsequently, 10 days later, the quantitative result 
of HBsAg was <0.05 IU/ml (negative). Subsequently, 18 days 
later, chemotherapy with 1.4 mg/m
2 vinblastine, 40 mg/m 2 
daunorubicin, 800  mg/m 2 cyclophosphamide and 40  mg/m 2 
dexamethasone (VDCD) was administered. In August 2021, 
a single intramuscular injection of high‑dose MTX (total 
dose 2.1 g) and 3,750 IU of pegaspargase was administered. 
In September 2021, the quantitative result of HBsAg was 
<0.05 IU/ml (negative). In October 2021, to create condi ‑
tions for donor stem cell implantation, the patient received 
0.8  mg/kg busulfan and 60  mg/kg cyclophosphamide 
(BUCY) regimen for pre‑autologous hematopoietic stem 
cell transplantation conditioning. Hematopoietic stem cells

followed by a peripheral blood HBV nucleic acid test; the results 
revealed that no amplification occurred. In March 2022, the 
HBsAg quantitative result was 12.8 IU/ml (positive); however, 
the cisplatin, oxaliplatin, doxorubicin, etoposide and tegafur 
regimen consolidation chemotherapy was still administered 
the following day. In April 2022, the alanine aminotransferase 
(ALT) (reference interval: <35 U/l) levels began to increase 
slightly, with a test result of 41 IU/l, and the GGT level was 
104 IU/l. In April 2022, the possibility of hepatitis B virus 
infection began to be considered due to a notable increase in 
transaminase levels [ALT, 1,334  IU/l; aspartate aminotrans‑
ferase (AST), 1,334 IU/l; and GGT, 198 IU/l] (Table I). The 
patient developed jaundice and received hepatoprotective 
treatment with 100‑200 mg magnesium isoglycyrrhizinate and 
1.8‑2.4 g glutathione daily for 3 weeks. Ursodeoxycholic acid 
and adenosine blue butane sulfonate (the dosage and duration 
of treatment are unknown) were used for treatment simultane‑
ously, and gradual improvements were observed.

treatment regimen treatmentwas continued in July 2022. In 
August 2022, in order to observe whether the patient had liver 
damage, liver function‑related biomarkers were tested, and the 
results were as follows: ALT, 13.8 IU/l; AST, 17.7 IU/l; GGT, 
67 IU/l. Quantitative analysis of blood samples with hepatitis B 
infection indicators on the second day showed that the HBsAg 
level had decreased to <0.05 (negative) and the anti‑HBs 
content was 982 IU/l (Table II). The first day of chemotherapy 
in March 2021, was considered as hospitalization day  0, and 
some of the collected clinical test data were counted by day 
to observe the results more intuitively. On day 347, HbSAg 
was first found to be positive and became negative on day 524. 
The anti‑HBs level significantly increased on day 524 (Fig. 2A 
and Table SI). The activities of ALT and AST in peripheral 
serum can reflect the degree of liver damage, which peaked on 
day 405 and then gradually decreased (Fig. 2B and Table SII). 
The other two indicators of liver function, ALP and GGT, 
reached their highest levels on day 405 (Fig. 2C and Table SII). 
Peripheral blood indices (WBC, N%, L%, Mo%, RBC, Hb and 
PLT) revealed irregular ‘wave‑like’ changes (Fig. 2D and E; 
Table SIII). The disease occurrence timeline is presented in 
Table III.
Discussion
The present study reports the case of an adult patient with ALL 
who may have been infected with HBV during chemotherapy. 
The patient subsequently produced corresponding antibodies 
and successfully achieved clinical self‑recovery.
The average incubation period of HBV infection is 60‑90 
days (11). Infants, children <5 years of age and immunosup ‑
pressed adults usually have no obvious clinical symptoms in 
the case of infection with HBV . In adults with normal immune 
function, ~95% of infections will be rapidly cleared by the 
immune system of the body following viral infection (12). 
Immunosuppressed patients (such as those undergoing hemo ‑
dialysis and those infected with human immunodeficiency 
virus) may develop chronic infection from acute infection. 
Currently, there is no specific treatment available to completely 
eliminate HBV from the body (13). HBsAg positivity indi ‑
cates HBV infection. In the case of an acute HBV infection, 
anti‑HBc (IgM and IgG subtypes) in peripheral blood can be 
detected 1‑2 weeks later than HBsAg (14). After a healthy 
adult is infected with HBV , HBsAg usually disappears within 
3‑4 months and anti‑HBs appear. The presence of anti‑HBs 
usually indicates immunity to HBV infection (15). Occult 
HBV infection refers to patients who test negative for HBsAg 
in their peripheral blood, but there is replication‑competent 
viral DNA in their liver and HBV DNA is undetectable in 
Table III. Timeline.

their serum, which poses a challenge to the study of HBV (16). 
In the present study, the use of chemotherapy did not affect 
the production of anti‑HBs, although there was no evidence 
of an occult HBV infection. No information on the disease 
history of HBV in family members was obtained from medical 
records of the patient.
B‑cells are generally known to produce secretory anti ‑
bodies during HBV infection and are a key component of 
the adaptive immune response of the body (17). It is gener ‑
ally believed that the use of chemotherapeutic drugs to treat 
tumors will have the side‑effect of suppressing bone marrow 
hematopoiesis, leading to a decrease in the number of immune 
cells, such as B‑lymphocytes and a decrease in the ability 
of B‑lymphocytes to respond to immune responses, such as 
against viruses (18). Notably, there is limited scientific knowl‑
edge available as to whether chemotherapeutic drugs will 
affect the function of lymphoid tissue and cell subsets, and 
whether they will have long‑term effects on the cellular and 
humoral immune responses of the body. The main drugs used 
in patients with ALL in the maintenance phase are 6‑mercap ‑
topurine and MTX, which can reduce the risk of relapse; 
however, they also have potentially severe toxic effects, 
with bone marrow suppression being the most common 
side‑effect (19). Therefore, it can be taken for granted that 
chemotherapeutic drugs have significant adverse effects on 
the immune system.
It has long been recognized that chemotherapeutic agents 
can treat immune diseases. For example, the inactive chemo ‑
therapeutic agent, cyclophosphamide, undergoes complex 
metabolism in the liver to produce cytotoxic metabolites (20). 
Decades ago, the immunomodulatory effects of cyclophospha‑
mide were discovered in animal models, and its mechanism 
of action is through the reduction of cell numbers (21). In 
addition, chemotherapeutic agents can deplete cells known 
as regulatory T‑lymphocytes (Tregs), thereby promoting 
local antitumor immune responses. There has been renewed 
interest in the use of cyclophosphamide to deplete human 
Tregs (22). As Tregs have low levels of intracellular ATP and 
glutathione, they are considered to be more susceptible to the 
toxic effects of cyclophosphamide than other T‑cells (23). 
When high‑dose corticosteroids are combined with cyclo ‑
phosphamide to treat severely active lupus nephritis, it can 
preferentially eliminate naive B cells  (24). Notably, cyclo ‑
phosphamide has no significant effect on class‑switched 
memory B cells, as these cells are normally dormant and do 
not proliferate  (25). Additionally, chemotherapeutic drugs, 
including cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, methotrexate, 
mitomycin C, paclitaxel and vincristine, can improve the 
function of antigen‑presenting cells and increase the anti ‑
tumor effect of immune cells at low doses (26). Paclitaxel 
can also directly affect the maturation of dendritic cells (27). 
Paclitaxel displays lipopolysaccharide‑mimicking activity 
in mice, activates TLR4, and enhances DC activation and 
cytokine biosynthesis  (28).
The majority of vaccination strategies for patients with 
cancer involve vaccines for influenza, pneumococcal infec ‑
tion, hepatitis B or recurrent herpes zoster. Experience 
suggests that patients with cancer, or immunocompromised or 
immunosuppressed patients may require a greater number of 
vaccine doses and more vaccinations than immunocompetent 
individuals (29). A previous study of a recombinant herpes 
zoster vaccine in patients with cancer demonstrated that the 
overall immune response differed when the first dose of the 
vaccine was administered prior to chemotherapy compared 
with when the first dose was administered during chemo ‑
therapy (30). However, another study on a recombinant 
subunit herpes zoster vaccine found that only 15% of patients 
with hematological malignancies had a detectable serological 
response (31). 
Patients with cancer are more likely to have an immune 
response following vaccination for coronavirus disease‑19 
than non‑cancer patients. As previously demonstrated, 
after the third dose of the vaccine in patients with solid 
tumors, the proportion of patients with neutralization to the 
Omicron variant increased from 47.8 to 88.9% (32). It has 
also been found that after two doses of the mRNA vaccine 
in patients with non‑small cell lung cancer, the neutraliza ‑
tion response to the Omicron variant was 79‑fold lower 
than that of individuals without cancer (33). Neutralizing 
antibodies are rarely detected in patients with hematolog ‑
ical malignancies after two doses of the Omicron vaccine; 
however, neutralizing antibodies are detected in ~50% of 
patients after the third dose (34). Therefore, limited knowl ‑
edge is available as regards the impact of chemotherapy 
on the immune system of patients with cancer, particularly 
with regards to vaccination strategies in the context of 
chemotherapy.
The present study revealed that a patient accidentally 
infected with HBV continued to produce protective antibodies 
against HBV despite taking chemotherapy drugs to reduce the 
number of lymphocytes in their blood, ultimately achieving 
clinical cure. This phenomenon highlights the complexity 
of the human immune system. Further understanding of the 
immune system is needed to potentially produce effective 
strategies to enhance antibody production in patients with 
HBV after vaccination.
