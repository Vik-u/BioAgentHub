Abstract: This research examined the efficacy of substituting commercial fish meal (CFM)
with Pterygoplichthys pardalismeal (PPM) inHoplobatrachus chinensisdiets, with and without
Euphorbia hirtaextract (EHE) supplementation. The study utilized six dietary treatments: a con-
trol diet (0% PPM, no EHE) and five experimental diets with varying PPM levels (0%+, 25%+,
50%+, 75%+, and 100%+), each fortified with 300 mg/kg EHE. The experiment spanned 90 days.
The analysis revealed that PPM exhibited superior amino acid profiles compared to CFM,
both in quality and quantity , while CFM demonstrated higher fatty acid content. The growth
metrics showed a significant decline only in the group receiving 100% PPM replacement with
EHE supplementation. Most organosomatic indices remained consistent across the treatments,
with the exception of intraperitoneal fat, which decreased in all EHE-supplemented groups.
Blood parameters, including white blood cells, red blood cells, and hematocrit, along with
serum proteins (total protein, globulin, and albumin), displayed an upward trend in all EHE-
supplemented groups. The 50%+ and 75%+ PPM replacement groups exhibited significantly
elevated serum glucose levels (p < 0.05). Liver enzymes (alanine transaminase and aspartate
transaminase) showed no significant variations among the treatments. The results indicate
that PPM can serve as an effective replacement for up to 75% of CFM inH. chinensis feed,
without compromising their growth performance. Moreover, supplementing with EHE helps to
enhance essential biochemical indices in the body , without adversely affecting liver function.
This investigation offers valuable perspectives on the development of sustainable aquaculture
feed and the potential application of invasive fish species in aquatic animal nutrition.

1. Introduction
The suckermouth armored catfish, belonging to the genus Pterygoplichthys and the
family Loricariidae, has become a highly invasive non-indigenous species in Asia [ 1,2]
and Southeast Asia [3], particularly in Thailand [4]. Originally introduced into the region
for ornamental purposes and as a way to clean aquaria, Pterygoplichthys pardalis was
subsequently released into natural waterbodies such as rivers and streams, where it bred
expeditiously [5,6]. The factors contributing to the rapid propagation of this fish species
include its high tolerance to poor water quality, low susceptibility to diseases, rapid
reproduction rate, and, importantly, its lack of popularity as a food source among the
local population. The rapid proliferation of P . pardalishas had detrimental consequences
for native fish species due to several impacts. Firstly, they compete intensely for food
and habitat resources due to their ability to consume diverse organic materials, often
resulting in reduced food availability for indigenous species. Secondly, their burrowing
activities lead to habitat degradation, causing erosion and destabilizing environments
that are crucial for native species’ reproduction and shelter. Thirdly, their aggressive
behavior and prolific reproduction facilitate the displacement of native species, thereby
diminishing the biodiversity and altering aquatic community structures. Lastly, they pose
a health threat by potentially introducing parasites and diseases that the native fauna
are ill equipped to resist. This alien species also destroys spawning areas, especially
those where demersal eggs are deposited [ 7]. According to a report by Thalathiah and
Palanisamy, the native Cyprinidae have also been negatively affected by the presence of
these invasive catfish [8]. This predation behavior not only impacts native fish populations
but also positions P . pardalisas a potential vector for non-native parasites [9,10]. Moreover,
the report by Lai et al. revealed that Pterygoplichthys spp. can be found in brackish water
systems. This may be one reason that this species can reproduce rapidly [11].
Fish meal is a well-known ingredient used in aquaculture feed to provide essential
nutrients to farmed fish and shrimp. Many species of farmed fish, including Nile tilapia
and catfish, as well as frogs and other domestic animals, rely on fish meal for their protein
requirements [12–14]. The availability and price of fish meal depend on many factors,
such as the abundance of fish, environmental regulations, and the global demand for
aquaculture and animal feed. Sustainability concerns stemming from issues like overfishing
and the need for environmentally responsible practices have prompted a significant shift
in the aquaculture and animal feed industries. This transformation is characterized by
a growing emphasis on utilizing alternative protein sources that are both eco-friendly
and economically viable, such as plant-based proteins [15] and insects [16], to reduce the
reliance on fish meal. Indeed, recognizing that P . pardalisis not generally consumed directly
by humans, some studies have explored alternative approaches, including producing post-
harvest and value-added products like fish biscuits. One approach to effectively reduce
the P . pardalispopulations in natural waters and fishponds is converting P . pardalisinto
fish meal for commercial fish farming, which could be a win–win solution, benefiting
both the control of invasive species and the aquaculture industry while also promoting
environmental sustainability [13,17].
The Chinese bullfrog (Hoplobatrachus chinensis Osbeck, 1765) was previously classified
as Hoplobatrachus rugulosus, a change that was implemented for specific taxonomic reasons.
The updated classification of chinensis was reflected in the “Amphibian Species of the
World 6.2”, an authoritative online reference [18]. This species plays a significant role in the
overall biodiversity of East and Southeast Asia, including regions such as China, Taiwan,
Vietnam, Thailand, Laos, and other neighboring areas. In 2022, Thailand recorded the sub-
stantial production of this frog species, totaling 1810 tons, with significant economic value
of THB 125,313,000 (USD 3.9 million), according to data from the Fisheries Development
Life 2025, 15, 115 3 of 20
Policy and Planning Division [19]. Currently, there is a growing trend among farmers to
raise Chinese bullfrogs in higher densities, which has led to increased stress among the
frogs, resulting in a slower growth rate and instances of cannibalism due to insufficient food
resources [20]. Farmers sometimes resort to antibiotics to treat various diseases in frogs,
but this practice can give rise to unintended consequences, including the accumulation of
chemical additives in the frogs. Additionally, many pathogens may develop resistance to
antibiotics over time, further complicating the management of this frog species’ health [21].
Nowadays, the use of herbal extracts as dietary supplements in aquatic animal farming
or culture is a topic of interest in scientific research and aquaculture practices for several
reasons, such as their antibacterial and antifungal properties, immunostimulatory effects,
stress reduction, improved growth performance, reduced reliance on chemicals, and consumer
preferences, as well as research and innovation [22–25]. Thailand has a variety of herbs that
can be used in aquatic animals. One of them is garden spurge (Euphorbia hirtaL.). This plant
is a member of the Euphorbiaceae family , with its natural habitat in Southeast Asia. Garden
spurge is gaining attention as a promising candidate for pharmaceutical applications and
is extensively employed as a traditional herbal remedy in tropical regions. The plant has
yielded various bioactive compounds, including flavonoids, terpenoids, phenols, essential
oils, and numerous constituents that have been successfully extracted and identified [26,27].
The positive effects of this plant have been reported; the incorporation of EHE into the diets
of common carp (Cyprinus carpioLinnaeus, 1758) infected withAeromonas hydrophilaresulted
in significant improvements in their red blood cell counts (RBC), white blood cell counts
(WBC), and hemoglobin levels, as well as increased antibody levels, enhanced lysozyme
activity , and improved phagocytic activity [28]. In addition, Panase et al. demonstrated that
the administration of 300 mg/kg ofE. hirta leaf extract had a positive impact on the growth
performance of hybrid catfish (Clarias macrocephalus× C. gariepinus), i.e., the average daily
gain (ADG), specific growth rate (SGR), feed efficiency (FE), feed conversion ratio (FCR),
protein efficiency ratio (PER), and survival rate (SR), as well as organosomatic indices, i.e., the
hepatosomatic index (HSI), intraperitoneal fat (IF), and viscerosomatic index. The dose did
not affect the hematological parameters compared to the control and higher-dose groups [27].
In light of the information outlined above, including the economic significance of
H. chinensis farming, the challenges associated with costly fish meal, the distribution of
P . pardalisin natural water sources, and the potential benefits of EHE, this study was con-
ducted to investigate the impact of fish meal replacement with PPM and supplementation
with 300 mg/kg EHE on the growth performance, serum biochemistry, and hematological
indices of H. chinensis, as no previous research or report has been undertaken on this subject.
2. Materials and Methods
2.1. Ethical Statement
The scientific procedures were conducted according to the guidelines for the ani-
mal care and use of the University of Phayao and approved (20 December 2021) by the
Committee of Institutional Animal Care, University of Phayao, Thailand (ID: 640104033).
2.2. Preparation of EHE
The dried aerial parts ofE. hirta were purchased from a trusted herbal store with GMP
quality in Bangkok. In this study , ethanol was used as the extraction solvent due to its
relatively safe and environmentally friendly properties as an organic solvent. Additionally , it
is easy to evaporate to reduce the volume of the extract. The plant was ground into a powder,
after which the crude powder was macerated using 95% commercial-grade ethanol at the ratio
of 1:12 w/v of plant material and solvent, respectively . The sample was stirred at 100 rpm for
72 h. The mixture was then filtered to collect the ethanol part. The plant residue was then
Life 2025, 15, 115 4 of 20
macerated once more using a 1:4 ratio of plant to ethanol. The same extraction technique was
performed for three consecutive days. After filtration, the filtrates were gathered, and the
solvent was removed under low pressure at 40–50◦C using a rotary evaporator. The resulting
extract was carefully stored in a tight container, protected from light, and kept in a refrigerator.
2.3. Phytochemical Screening of EHE
In this investigation, standardized procedures were followed, in line with Pant et al.,
Hartanti and Cahyani, and Shaikh and Patil [29–31]. Various screening tests were conducted
for the presence of phytochemicals in EHE. Alkaloids were detected using Dragendorff
and Mayer’s reagent, while the Liebermann–Burchard test was employed to evaluate the
potential existence of steroids and terpenoids. For the identification of carbohydrates, deoxy
sugars, and α, β unsaturated 5-membered lactone rings, the Molisch, Keller–Killiani, and
Kedde tests were utilized, respectively. To screen for cyanogenic glycosides, the sodium
picrate technique was employed, and saponin screening was conducted using a frothing
test. The presence of phenolic compounds was investigated using the ferric chloride
technique, while the detection of flavonoids was accomplished through Shinoda’s test.
Coumarins were observed using the sodium hydroxide paper test. Finally, anthraquinones
were identified utilizing a modified Borntrager approach.
2.4. Determination of Total Phenolic Content in EHE
The content of total phenolics in the extract was determined using the Folin–Ciocalteu
colorimetric method, following the method outlined by Chandra et al., with slight modifica-
tions [29]. Gallic acid was used as a standard phenolic compound. The standard calibration
curve of gallic acid was constructed in the range of 3.125–200µg/mL. Stock and working
solutions of gallic acid and EHE were produced using 80% methanol. For analysis, 20µL of
gallic acid or EHE was pipetted into a 96-well plate, followed by 50µL of 10% Folin–Ciocalteu
reagent in water. The plate was shaken and kept in the dark for 5 min. Then, 80µL of sodium
carbonate solution (7.5%w/v in water) was added. The reaction was kept in the dark for
30 min and the absorbance was measured at 760 nm. The standard calibration curve was
plotted between the concentrations and absorbance (y = 0.0044x + 0.0041,R2 = 0.9958). The
total phenolic content was determined and calculated as milligrams of gallic acid equivalents
per gram of EHE (mg GAE/g extract). All determinations were carried out in triplicate.
2.5. Determination of Total Flavonoid Content in EHE
The aluminum chloride colorimetric method was modified from the method of
Chandra et al. for the determination of the total flavonoid content [32]. Quercetin was used as a
standard flavonoid compound. The quercetin standard and EHE were prepared by dilution
with 80% methanol. The standard calibration curve of quercetin was a plot of the absorbance
against the concentration (3.125–200µg/mL). For analysis, 20µL of the quercetin solution or
test sample was pipetted into a 96-well plate. Then, 50µL of 2% aluminum chloride in water
was added. The mixture was kept in the dark for 5 min. Thereafter, 50µL of 50 mM sodium
hydroxide in water was added. The reaction was kept in the dark for a further 30 min, and
the absorbance at 415 nm was measured. The flavonoid content was calculated as quercetin
equivalents per gram of extract (mg QE/g extract) on the basis of the standard calibration curve
of quercetin (y = 0.0037x + 0.0011,R2 = 0.9999). All determinations were carried out in triplicate.
2.6. Determination of Antioxidant Capacity
The capacity of EHE to directly react with free radicals was determined using the
2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl(DPPH) assay , which was slightly modified fromBello et al. [33].
Stock solutions of ascorbic acid (2000 µg/mL) and DPPH (0.1 mM) were prepared using
methanol. Working solutions of ascorbic acid and EHE were produced using 80% methanol.
Life 2025, 15, 115 5 of 20
The assay was performed in a 96-well plate. Next, 100 µL of ascorbic acid or EHE was
pipetted into each well, followed by 100µL of DPPH solution. The plate was meticulously
shaken and kept in a dark place for 30 min. Then, the absorbance (A) at 517 nm was mea-
sured. The % radical scavenging was calculated using the formula % radical scavenging
[(Absblank − Abssample)/Absblank] × 100 and plotted against the concentration. The antioxi-
dant capacity was reported as the IC50. All determinations were carried out in triplicate.
2.7. Preparation of Fish Meal from Pterygoplichthys pardalis
Following the methods outlined by Panase et al. [13], fish were sourced from private fish
farms in Phayao Province, Thailand, by local farmers. In total, more than 400 g ofP . pardaliswere
collected, and they underwent a thorough washing process after removing their visceral organs.
Subsequently , the fish were roasted and left to air dry completely under sunlight for a period of
five days. To eliminate any remaining moisture, all specimens were further subjected to storage
at 70 ◦C for 24 h. After this step, the specimens were finely ground into a powder using a meat
grinder, sifted through a blue nylon net with a mesh size of 425µm, and then stored in a sterile
environment. The final yield (dry weight) was 330 g per kilogram of wet weight.
2.8. Preparation of EHE-Supplemented PPM
The experimental diets, containing 0%, 25%, 50%, 75%, and 100% PPM, were sprayed
with EHE diluted in deionized water at a dose of 300 mg/kg of diet in a drum mixer and left
to dry. The sprayed pellets were then coated with a 4% agar solution at a concentration of
10 mL/kg and air-dried again. They were stored in sterile containers at room temperature
for seven days. New batches were prepared weekly [22].
2.9. Biochemical Composition Analysis of PPM and CFM
The fish meal obtained from the production process involving P . pardalis, as described
above, was analyzed together with a commercial fish meal acquired from an agricultural
supply store in Chiang Mai, Thailand. A proximate analysis was conducted, encompassing
assessments of the moisture, ash, crude protein, and crude fat, employing the standardized
methods outlined by the AOAC [34]. Specifically, the Kjeldahl distillation method was ap-
plied to determine the crude protein content, while the crude lipid content was ascertained
through Soxhlet extraction, and the ash content was determined using drying methods.
The findings from these analyses are presented in Table 1.
The biochemical compositions of the PPM and CFM were analyzed. The amino acid pro-
files were also assessed using an amino acid analyzer from the Bio 30+ series by Biochrom Ltd.,
Cambridge, UK, following an in-house method, TE-CH-372, inspired by the Official Journal
of the European Communities [35]. Meanwhile, the analysis of the fatty acid profiles was
performed via gas chromatography (GC) using an in-house method, TE-CH-208, which is de-
rived from the AOAC 996.06 standards [36]. Both analyses were carried out by the Analytical
Service at the Central Laboratory (Chiangmai, Thailand) Co., Ltd.

2.10. Experimental Frogs, Conditions for Acclimatization, and Experimental Design
Seven days before the experiment, 55-day-old juvenile frogs were obtained from the
Faculty of Agriculture and Natural Resources, University of Phayao, Thailand. They were
then raised in cages to allow the juvenile frogs to adapt to the environment. The juvenile frogs
were acclimatized in a net cage that was 200 cm× 300 cm × 50 cm in size with an oxygen
generator for 2 weeks under laboratory conditions. The water was changed at 3 intervals at a
rate of 50% of its total volume. Water quality parameters were monitored at 7:00 a.m. daily
throughout the acclimatization period. The temperature was maintained at28.6 ± 2.12 ◦C,
with a dissolved oxygen (DO) concentration of 7.2 ± 0.16 mg/L and a pH of 7.2 ± 0.35.
Measurements were conducted using multi-probes from the HORIBA U50 series, ensuring
that the conditions were similar to those described in the study by Thip-uten et al. [37].
The frogs were fed with a commercial diet twice a day at 9:00 a.m. and 5:00 p.m.
For the experiment in this study, a completely randomized design was used. Initially,
the juvenile frogs were weighed before the experiment, and the average initial weight
was 7.06 ± 12.32 g; after this, they were divided into 6 triplicate groups and placed into
net cages that were 100 cm × 200 cm × 50 cm in size, with 20 juvenile frogs per cage.
Each group was fed with their own prepared diet (Table 2) twice daily (9:00 a.m. and
5:00 p.m.) at 7% of their body weight per day for 90 days [38].

2.11. Growth Performance and Survival
At 15-day intervals, the frogs in each cage were weighed to regulate the feed quantities
and assess their growth performance. The growth parameters included weight gain (WG),
ADG, SGR, FCR, PER, and SR. The calculations for these parameters were performed using
the provided equations [39]:
WG (g) = final weight (g) − initial weight
ADG (g/day) = [{final weight (g) − initial weight (g)}]/experimental days
Life 2025, 15, 115 7 of 20
SGR (%/day) = [{ln final weight (g) − ln initial weight (g)}/experimental days] × 100
FCR = total feed fed (g)/weight gain (g)
PER = wet weight gain (g)/crude protein fed
SR (%) = [number of surviving frogs/initial number of frogs] × 100
2.12. Organosomatic Indices
At the end of the experiment, three frogs from each cage (replicate) were randomly
chosen and subjected to anesthesia using isoflurane, following the protocol outlined by
Smith and Stump [40]. The visceral organs, including the liver, spleen, kidney, fat, and
intestine, were carefully separated for further analysis to calculate the organosomatic
indices. These indices encompassed the hepatosomatic index (HSI), spleenosomatic index
(SSI), renosomatic index (RSI), intestinosomatic index (ISI), and intraperitoneal fat (IF).
The calculations were performed as follows [41]:
HSI (%) = [liver weight (g)/body weight (g)] × 100
SSI (%) = [spleen weight (g)/body weight (g)] × 100
RSI (%) = [kidney weight (g)/body weight (g)] × 100
ISI (%) = [intestine weight (g)/body weight (g)] × 100
IF (%) = [intraperitoneal fat weight (g)/body weight (g)] × 100
2.13. Study of Hematological Indices
This study randomly selected nine frogs from each group (3 frogs per replication).
Before the blood collection process, each frog was subjected to anesthesia using isoflurane,
following the method detailed by Smith and Stump [40]. On day 90 of the experimental
period, blood samples were obtained from each frog through cardiac puncture, following
the technique outlined by Heatley et al. [42]. Blood samples were drawn from the cardiac
puncture (0.4 mL) using syringes equipped with 26G needles, and these samples were
collected in K3 EDTA tubes. To determine the red blood cell count, a blood sample was
diluted to 1:300 in a 0.85% NaCl solution, while the hematocrit (Hct) was determined using
the microcentrifuge method. Furthermore, a blood sample was diluted to 1:50 in a 2% acetic
acid solution to assess the white blood cell count. The determination of both the RBC and
WBC was conducted manually using a Neubauer chamber, as described by Rehulka [43].
2.14. Serum Biochemistry Study
On day 90 of the feeding trial, the serum biochemistry was examined. After assessing
the growth indices and survival rates, 9 frogs from each group, with 3 frogs per replication,
were randomly selected for blood collection. Blood samples (0.8 mL per frog) were collected
via cardiac puncture using non-heparinized syringes. These blood samples were transferred
to micro-centrifuge tubes and allowed to clot at room temperature for a period of 4 h before
they were utilized for serum collection. Subsequently , they were subjected to centrifugation at
5000 rpm for 15 min at 25◦C. The resulting supernatants were carefully transferred to sterile
serum tubes and stored at −20 ◦C until use, with a maximum storage duration of 7 days.
The frozen serum samples were later transported to the Chiang Mai V eterinary Laboratory
Centre Limited Partnership in Chiang Mai, Thailand, for analyses. Serum indices, including
alanine transaminase (ALT), aspartate transaminase (AST), glucose, total protein, albumin, and
globulin, were assessed using an analytical chemistry analyzer (PC400, HORIBA, Kyoto, Japan).

2.15. Statistical Analysis
Before conducting the analyses of the growth parameters and hematological and
serum biochemistry indices, the data were normalized and assessed for homogeneity of
variance. Subsequently, all parameters were subjected to a one-way analysis of variance
(ANOVA), followed by Tukey’s post-hoc test at a significance level of 95% (p < 0.05). The
results are presented as mean values along with their corresponding standard deviations.

3.1. Phytochemical Composition, Total Phenolic Content, Total Flavonoid Content, and Antioxidant
Capacity of EHE
The phytochemical constituents of EHE observed in the screening tests were terpenoids,
coumarins, phenolics, and carbohydrates (Table 3). The total phenolic content, total flavonoid
content, and IC50 of EHE were 573.58 ± 29.83 mg GAE/g extract, 39.17 ± 2.90 mg QE/g
extract, and 11.06± 6.54 µg/mL, respectively (Table 4).

3.2. Amino Acid and Fatty Acid Profiles of PPM Meal and CFM
The analysis of the amino acid profile revealed that the PPM contained significantly
higher levels of each essential amino acid compared to the CFM, with amounts that were
nearly twice as high. Similarly, the non-essential amino acids were also present in higher
quantities in the PPM than in the CFM. When considering the combined results of both
essential and non-essential amino acids, it was observed that the PPM contained 1.67 times
more amino acids than the CFM (Table 5).

In contrast to the amino acid profile, the fatty acid profile showed differing results,
both in terms of types and quantities. The analysis indicated that the CFM contained a
greater variety and quantity of fatty acids than the PPM. Specifically, the levels of saturated
fatty acids, unsaturated fatty acids, monounsaturated fatty acids, and polyunsaturated fatty
acids in the CFM were 4.85, 3.54, 4.11, and 4.93 times higher, respectively. Additionally, the
amounts of omegas 3, 6, and 9 in the CFM exceeded those in the PPM by 13.21, 1.74, and
2.37 times, respectively (Table 6).

3.3. Growth Performance
After the 90-day feeding period, the findings related to the growth performance of
H. chinensis, which were exposed to six distinct experimental diets, were as follows. Notably,
significant differences (p < 0.05) in WG emerged as early as day 30 of the experimental
period. The lowest WGs were observed in 100+ at days 60 and 90, while the 75+ group
showed a significant difference from the other groups only at day 60. At the end of the
study, there were no differences between the 0, 0+, 25+, 50+, and 75+ groups (Figure 1a).
Likewise, ADG displayed a parallel trend to that of WG, showing significant differences
starting from day 30 and persisting through days 60 and 90 of the experiment. Notably,
the highest ADG values were consistently observed in the 0 group, while the 100+ group
consistently exhibited the lowest ADG values throughout the study period (Figure 1b).
Like the SGR and PER, the 100+ group exhibited the lowest values on days 30, 60, and 90 of
the experiment (Figure 1c,f). The 0 group showed the highest SGR throughout the study
period, as it revealed the highest PER only at day 30, which then decreased to lower levels
compared to the other groups at days 60 and 90. The FCR exhibited the highest levels in
the 100+ group throughout the experimental period, and it differed significantly from the
0+ group at days 60 and 90 (Figure 1e). At day 60, the SR in the 0 group was significantly
lower than those in the groups that received EHE (Figure 1d). The lowest SR, however, was
observed in the 100+ group at the end of the study.

signiﬁcant diﬀerences (
p
 
< 0.05) in WG emerged as early as day 30 of the experimental 
period. The lowest WGs were observed in 100+ at days 60 and 90, while the 75+ 
group 
showed a signiﬁcant diﬀerence from 
the 
other groups only at day 60. At the end of the 
study, there were no diﬀerences between
 
the
 
0, 0+, 25+, 50+, and 75+ groups (
Figure 1

Likewise, ADG displayed a parallel trend to that of WG, showing signiﬁcant diﬀerences 
starting from day 30 and persisting through days 60 and 90 of the experime
nt. Notably, 
the highest ADG values were consistently observed in the 0 group, while the 100+ group 
consistently exhibited the lowest ADG values throughout the study period (

the 
SGR and PER, the 100+ group exhibited the lowest values on days 30, 60, and 90

period, as it revealed the highest PER only at day 30
, which

xhibited the highest levels in 
the 100+ group throughout the 
experimental period
,
 
and 
it 
diﬀered signiﬁcantly from the 
0+ group at days 60 and 90 (
Figure 1

3.4. Organosomatic, Hematological, and Serum Biochemical Indices
At the end of the experiment, the organosomatic indices of H. chinensis showed no sig-
nificant differences, except in the case of IF (Figure 2a–e). Notably, the highest IF level was
observed in the 0 group, while the lowest levels were determined in the 0+ and 75+ groups
(Figure 2d). Hematological indices, including the WBC, RBC, and Hct were assessed in this
study (Figure 3a–c). Among these parameters, only the WBC exhibited significant differ-
ences, while the rest of the parameters did not show any significant differences between
the groups. The highest WBC level was observed in the 25+ group, whereas the lowest
level was noticed in the 50+ group. Interestingly, the WBCs in the remaining four groups
(0, 0+, 75+, and 100+) did not exhibit significant differences from each other (Figure 3a).
This study also examined various serum biochemical indices, including the total protein,
Life 2025, 15, 115 12 of 20
albumin, globulin, glucose, ALT, and AST. The findings indicated that the total protein,
albumin, globulin, and glucose were influenced by the experimental diets. Interestingly,
the 75+ group exhibited a significantly higher total protein level compared to the 0 group,
and there were no significant differences between the other five groups that received EHE
(Figure 4a). Additionally, regarding serum albumin, low values were observed in the 0, 0+,
and 25+ groups, while higher levels were discovered in the higher-dose groups (Figure 4b).
At 75% replacement, the serum albumin did not significantly differ from that of the 0 group.
For the serum globulin, the 0 group exhibited the lowest level in comparison to the other
five groups. The highest globulin level was observed in the 75+ group (p < 0.05 vs. 0 group)
(Figure 4c). The serum glucose level was not affected by EHE, but replacement with 75% of
PPM increased the level of serum glucose in a dose-dependent manner. The highest dose
of PPM exhibited no effect on the serum glucose level (Figure 4d). Neither ALT nor AST
showed significant differences among the experimental groups (Figure 4e,f).

Discussion
 
In this study, the focus was on the Chinese bullfrog, 
H. chinensis
, due to its important 
role in aquaculture. The ﬁrst consideration is that it is an 
economically valuable species 
on a global scale, and the second is its adaptability to diverse environmental conditions. 
Additionally, this frog species is well
 
suited for high
-
density farming operations. It exhib-
its a rapid growth rate and is a good source of high
-
quality meat for consumption. How-
ever,
 
d
espite these advantages, farmers face high production costs, particularly regarding 
feed expenses.
 
Thus, feed cost reduction is an important 
aspect for
 
problem
-
solving. Fish 
meal replacement 
with 
local alte
rnatives to lower costs and increase feed production has 
gained the interest of aquafeed researchers. Nevertheless, farmers, in the context of rising 
production costs, are still encountering signiﬁcant challenges, 
particularly with regard to
 
feed expenses. Consequently, the pursuit of cost
-
eﬀective solutions
 
that reduce 
feed costs 
has emerged as a paramount strategy to address this issue. In this regard, aquafeed

4. Discussion
In this study, the focus was on the Chinese bullfrog,H. chinensis, due to its important
role in aquaculture. The first consideration is that it is an economically valuable species
on a global scale, and the second is its adaptability to diverse environmental conditions.
Additionally, this frog species is well suited for high-density farming operations. It exhibits
a rapid growth rate and is a good source of high-quality meat for consumption. However,
despite these advantages, farmers face high production costs, particularly regarding feed
expenses. Thus, feed cost reduction is an important aspect for problem-solving. Fish meal
replacement with local alternatives to lower costs and increase feed production has gained
the interest of aquafeed researchers. Nevertheless, farmers, in the context of rising pro-
duction costs, are still encountering significant challenges, particularly with regard to feed
expenses. Consequently, the pursuit of cost-effective solutions that reduce feed costs has
emerged as a paramount strategy to address this issue. In this regard, aquafeed researchers
are placing a considerable emphasis on the substitution of fish meal with locally available
and cost-effective alternatives, aiming to achieve more economical and sustainable feed
production practices.
For instance, the use of commercial feed (30% protein) in combination with black
soldier fly larvae, both in dried form (54.5% protein) and fresh form (16.2% protein), has
been explored for the feeding of Thai frogs ( Rana rugosa). The results indicated that a
combination of 50% fresh black soldier fly larvae and 50% commercial feed could be
successfully applied for Thai frog production on a farm scale in Vietnam [44]. In their study,
Klahan et al. investigated a feeding regime for Thai frogs, administering frog feed in the
first month, alternating with catfish feed in the second month, and returning to frog feed in
the third month. This approach revealed a suitable feeding regime [45].
According to the research findings obtained in this study , replacing 75% of CFM with
meal from an alien fish species (P . pardalis) and mixing it with 300 mg/kg of EHE did not
result in any significant changes in growth indices when compared to the other groups. It is
also worth noting that the group fed with 100% PPM as a fish meal replacement exhibited
the lowest growth indices among all experimental groups. The selection of the 300 mg/kg
concentration of EHE in this research was based on the results given in a previous publication
by the authors. In a previous study by Panase et al., it was observed that this specific
concentration of EHE was the most effective in improving growth performance, enhancing
the hematological and organosomatic indices in hybrid catfish [27]. Using 75% replacement by
PPM did not show any adverse effects when compared to the control group. This research’s
findings align with previous reports that have demonstrated the successful utilization of diets
incorporating meat meal with replacement levels ranging from 30% to 70% as a substitute
for other types of fish meal. This acceptance of meat meal diets has been observed in both
omnivorous and carnivorous fish species [46]. Based on the analyses of the amino acid and
fatty acid profiles, it was observed that the qualitative and quantitative parameters of the
essential amino acid profile of PPM were approximately twice those of the CFM. The fatty acid
profile of PPM was notably inferior to that of the CFM, with deficiencies observed in MUFA,
PUFA, and omega 3, which were lower by factors of 3.15, 4.93, and 13.21, respectively . These
findings suggest that CFM holds greater significance, likely due to the fish meal being sourced
from one or a limited number of species. These findings are consistent with the research
conducted by Panase et al., which demonstrated that replacing fish meal with PPM in the diet
of juvenile Mekong giant catfish (Pangasianodon gigasChevey , 1931) at up to 75% showed no
adverse effects, while increasing the replacement percentage beyond this threshold resulted
in a declining trend in terms of growth performance [13]. In addition, in the juvenile guppy
(Poecilia reticulata), the growth indices were not significantly different after being fed 100%
fish meal replacement with Sailfin catfish meal from genusPterygoplichthys[17]. Moreover,
Life 2025, 15, 115 15 of 20
in the 100+ group, the CFM was entirely replaced with PPM, where PPM refers to fishmeal
produced from a single species of freshwater fish, while the CFM is derived from various
marine fish species. When examining the fatty acid profiles, it was evident that the CFM was
richer in both the types and quantities of fatty acids. Notably , it contained significantly higher
levels of unsaturated fatty acids, such as omega 3, which were more than 13 times higher than
those in the PPM. Ibrahim et al. reported that omega 3 has stress-reducing effects and can
enhance the immune response in Nile tilapia; however, there are no studies concerning these
effects in frogs [47].
The current comprehensive study aimed to substantiate the benefits of incorporating
PPM as a practical substitute for CFM, including not only the assessment of the growth
performance but also the examination of the organosomatic, hematological, and serum
biochemical indices. This holistic approach was adopted because these indices can provide
valuable insights into changes in aspects such as the visceral organ sizes, and they are
influenced by many factors, including the water quality, dietary composition, stocking
density, and stress, among others [48–50]. Regarding the organosomatic indices, the results
obtained herein demonstrated no significant differences between the groups for any param-
eter except IF. Across all groups that were fed with 300 mg/kg of EHE, a consistent trend
of reduced IF was observed in comparison to the group that did not receive the extract
(0 group). This trend suggests that EHE may influence lipid metabolism, which contributes
to promoting growth. Furthermore, this might be affected by the antioxidant capacity of
EHE. This is consistent with previous research findings, which indicated that the adminis-
tration of an antioxidant, astaxanthin, could help to reduce the IF in juvenile largemouth
bass (Micropterus salmoides) [51]. Notably, a study by Li et al. revealed that Siberian ginseng
(Acanthopanax senticosus) extract had the capacity to reduce the free fatty acids, triglycerides,
total cholesterol, and liver LDL-C, while simultaneously increasing HDL-C, in the liver
of Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) [52]. Therefore, it is plausible that the inclusion of
300 mg/kg of EHE may lead to a reduction in lipid synthesis, an enhancement in lipid
catabolism through the regulation of lipid transport, and a decrease in fat deposition
within the body. Moreover, feeding with a lotus (Nelumbo nucifera) leaf alcoholic extract
was reported to increase the serum HDL-C and reduce the serum LDL-C in grass carp,
Ctenopharyngodon idellus [53]. In this study, it is noteworthy that most parameters related
to the organosomatic indices did not exhibit significant differences between the groups.
This observation is consistent with the findings of a study conducted byPanase et al., which
also demonstrated that all organosomatic indices in juvenile Mekong giant catfish remained
stable and were not significantly altered when the fish were fed with diets that ranged from
0% to 100% fish meal replacement with P . pardalismeal [13].
In this study, fish meal replacement by PPM at all levels revealed no negative effects
on the hematological indices. Conversely, the effect on the WBC was found to be posi-
tive, possibly due to certain bioactive components that can stimulate immune function,
as previously reported by Pratheepa and Sukumaran [ 28]. Their study demonstrated
that E. hirta leaf extract exhibited the effect of increasing the RBC, WBC, hemoglobin,
antibodies, lysozyme activity, and phagocytic ratio in common carp that were infected
with Aeromonas hydrophila. Moreover, in hybrid catfish, the WBC could be enhanced with
300 mg/kg E. hirta leaf extract [27]. Garden spurge is a plant that is rich in phenolic com-
pounds, which play a significant role in enhancing immune function and antioxidative
activity [54]. The ethanolic extract of E. hirta was reported as an immunomodulator in
striped catfish (Pangasianodon hypophthalmus) by Nhu et al. The extract positively affected
the lysozyme activity, immunoglobulin levels, and cumulative mortality against bacterial
infection [55]. Significant variations were observed in the serum biochemical indices of
the experimental fish, particularly in terms of the total protein, albumin, and globulin
Life 2025, 15, 115 16 of 20
levels. These indices exhibited an increasing trend in certain groups that received EHE
supplementation compared to those that did not. This observation suggests that the bioac-
tive compounds present in the extract may have stimulated the immune responses of the
fish. The increase in the total protein, albumin, and globulin levels indicates a potential
enhancement in the fish’s innate immune response. These proteins serve as important
components in producing immunoglobulins or antibodies in fish, which play a crucial
role in bolstering their immune defenses. This aligns with the findings from the study
conducted in [56], which suggested that higher levels of total protein, albumin, and glob-
ulins are associated with a stronger innate immune response in fish. Likewise, a study
involving freshwater catfish (Pangasius sutchi) fingerlings observed that the total serum
protein, albumin, globulin, and albumin–globulin ratio levels were elevated in groups
that were fed diets supplemented with heart-leaved moonseed ( Tinospora cordifolia) leaf
extract [57]. Notably, the levels of serum glucose were influenced by the addition of EHE,
particularly in the groups that received 25% to 75% fish meal replacement. These groups
exhibited higher levels of serum glucose compared to the groups with 0% and 100% fish
meal replacement. This phenomenon may be attributed to the mixed diet composition
involving both commercial fish meal and P . pardalismeal, which resulted in the heightened
activity of digestive enzymes within the gastrointestinal tract. Consequently, the system
required increased energy resources. Glucose is recognized as a pivotal product in the
cellular respiration process, and glucose molecules play a crucial role in the bioenergetics of
animals. These molecules are subsequently converted into adenosine triphosphate through
cellular respiration, thereby serving as a primary energy source. Higher levels of glucose
are typically maintained in frogs due to the breakdown of glycogen in the liver, which is
followed by the conversion of glucose molecules into energy through glycogenolysis as
part of the cellular respiration process [58]. Meanwhile, the assessment of liver function
indicated the levels of ALT and AST in all treatment groups did not differ significantly.
These results suggest that the EHE used in this study had a discernible impact on the
liver function of the fish. The elevated levels of ALT and AST in the blood circulation
may indicate that the fish were experiencing some form of stress, resulting in liver stress
and potential damage, suggesting that elevations of ALT and AST are key indicators of
liver impairment and stress in fish [ 59]. Moreover, AST is considered one of the three
most important myocardial enzymes. It is often utilized as an indicator of cardiac function.
The findings of this study suggest that the hearts of fish may not be adversely affected or
experience injury when exposed to E. hirta extract [60]. These results are in line with a study
by Shi et al. concerning yellow catfish (Pelteobagrus fulvidraco) that were supplemented with
brown macroalgae (Sargassum horneri) at levels ranging from 0.1% to 0.4% [61]. The plant
extract exhibited improvements in growth performance. Notably, this supplementation led
to a significant increase in the levels of serum total protein and a significant decrease in
the content of serum total cholesterol and triglyceride. It is also worth mentioning that the
levels of ALT and AST remained unchanged when compared to the control group.
5. Conclusions
This study represents the first investigation focused on utilizing the alien fish species
P . pardalisfor fish meal production and its subsequent replacement of commercial fish
meal in the diets of Chinese bullfrogs (H. chinensis). The results obtained from the assess-
ment of the growth performance, organosomatic indices, some hematological parameters,
and serum biochemical indices suggest that CFM could be replaced effectively by PPM at
levels of up to 75% in the diet, without detrimental effects on the growth performance or
organosomatic indices. Furthermore, the inclusion of 300 mg/kg of EHE in the diets led to
reduce IF, increased WBCs, and some improved serum biochemical indices, especially the
Life 2025, 15, 115 17 of 20
total protein, albumin, and globulin levels. Importantly, the liver function enzymes ALT
and AST remained unaffected by this supplementation. Further research could explore
the optimum dose of EHE for improved growth performance and other relevant indices
in Chinese bullfrogs. Furthermore, the results of this experiment could serve as a guide-
line for the effective transformation of invasive alien fish species, which pose significant
environmental threats, into a valuable resource for the aquaculture industry.
