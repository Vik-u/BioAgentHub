Abstract
Objective: In 2012, the Commission on Human Medicines mandated lowering the acetamino-
phen toxicity nomogram treatment threshold in the UK to 100mg/ml at 4 h post-ingestion. The
present study aim was to evaluate biochemical and liver toxicity patterns in patients who pre-
sented with acetaminophen overdose and had low serum acetaminophen concentrations
(<150 mg/ml).
Methods: Patients admitted to the emergency department with a clear history of acute acet-
aminophen overdose with or without other medication or ethanol were consecutively enrolled
into this retrospective cohort study. Patients with serum acetaminophen concentration>150 mg/
ml or an unknown ingestion time were excluded. Data were extracted from electronic medical
records and are presented as mean/C6 SD or median (interquartile range).
Results: A total of 103 patients were included (median age, 17 [4–21] years) and 80 (78%) were
female. The median ingested acetaminophen dose was 5000 (2850–7650) mg. At baseline, the
median serum acetaminophen concentration was 42 (4.5–64.8)mg/ml, and median alanine ami-
notransferase and aspartate aminotransferase levels were 22 (17–28) and 27 (16–45) IU/L,
respectively. T wenty patients were treated with acetylcysteine, with none developing adverse
reactions. No patient developed hepatotoxicity, including patients with initial multiple product
ingestion or other risk factors.

Introduction
Acetaminophen toxicity is a commonly
cited reason for emergency department
visits and is the leading cause of acute
liver failure in developed countries.
1 The
Rumack–Matthew nomogram is intended
to guide clinicians in predicting a patient’s
risk of hepatotoxicity based on a plasma
acetaminophen concentration ascertained
within 4–24 h post-ingestion without acetyl-
cysteine treatment.
2 The Rumack–Matthew
nomogram is considered the mainstay of
risk assessment in acute acetaminophen
poisoning.
Patients falling above the threshold con-
centration of 200mg/ml at 4 h after acute
ingestion are at risk of hepatotoxicity,
with rates of severe hepatotoxicity and mor-
tality in these patients reported to reach
60% and 5%, respectively.
3 The Rumack–
Matthew nomogram treatment threshold
was reduced by 25% (equal to 150mg/ml
at 4 h post-ingestion) in the USA, at the
request of the United States Food and
Drug Administration, with the same adjust-
ment also carried out in Australia and
Canada.
4 In 2012, the Commission on
Human Medicines in the UK mandated
lowering the nomogram treatment thresh-
old to 100 mg/ml at 4 h post-ingestion.
5
Bateman et al.5 investigated 1246 patients
with acetaminophen toxicity in the year
preceding, and 1251 patients in the year fol-
lowing, the change in treatment threshold
recommendation. The study revealed
a 13.2% increase in patients requiring
admission for acetylcysteine therapy in the
year following the change and the number
of patients with adverse reactions to acetyl-
cysteine significantly increased from 87 to
145 after treatment changes. Similarly, ana-
phylactoid reactions occurred in more
patients, but the rate was not significantly
different from the year preceding the thresh-
old change (29 [9%] versus 55 [10.7%],
P ¼0.426).
5 The nomogram utilizes
population-based data. Therefore, the risk
of developing complications, even with
serum concentrations below the threshold
recommended for initiating treatment, may
exist in certain patients. There are insuffi-
cient data to address the clinical presenta-
tions of individuals with initial levels below
the treatment threshold of<150 mg/ml at 4 h
post-ingestion.
5,6 According to the guide-
lines of Dart et al.,7 glutathione depletion
(e.g., starvation), enzyme-inducing medica-
tion, and chronic alcoholism were identified
as risk factors for hepatotoxicity.7 As e p a -
rate study concluded that an initially normal
prothrombin time (PT) or international nor-
malized ratio (INR) is associated with a
lower risk of developing hepatotoxicity.
8
Given the potential inaccuracy of patient
histories, particularly regarding ingestion
time, it is unsurprising that some cases
with initial plasma concentration below
the treatment line progressed to develop
hepatotoxicity.
2 The aim of the present
study was to investigate patterns of bio-
chemical parameters and liver toxicity
markers among patients who presented
2 Journal of International Medical Research
with serum acetaminophen concentrations
below the nomogram threshold (150mg/ml)
to determine whether a conservative strategy
demonstrates an increase in rate of positive
patient health outcome and not just an over-
treatment with little added benefit.
Patients and methods
Study design and setting
This retrospective cohort study was con-
ducted at King Khalid University Hospital
(KKUH), King Saud University Medical
City (KSUMC), a tertiary-academic hospi-
tal with 1200 beds in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.
The study was conducted following the
Helsinki Declaration of 1975 (as revised in
2013) and was approved in 2019 by the
Institutional Review Board at King Saud
University in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia (E-
19-4040). This study is reported as per the
Strengthening the Reporting of Observational
Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) guide-
lines.
9 All patient details have been de-
identified to ensure confidentiality and pri-
vacy. The requirement of informed consent
was waived by the Institutional Review
Board due to the retrospective nature of
the study.
Study population
Patients who had presented to the emergen-
cy department between June 2015 and June
2019 with acute acetaminophen ingestion,
with or without other medications or etha-
nol administration, provided that the time
of acetaminophen ingestion had been
reported, were consecutively recruited.
Patients who were positive for acetamino-
phen in the urine on comprehensive drug
testing via gas chromatography-mass spec-
trometry, despite a negative quantitative
serum acetaminophen concentration, or
patients with initial serum acetaminophen
concentration <150 mg/ml at 4 h post-
ingestion, were included. Patients with ini-
tial acetaminophen concentration obtained
at 4–24 h post-ingestion were also included
if the concentration was below the
150 mg/ml line. Patients with serum acet-
aminophen concentration >150 mg/ml, or
unknown ingestion time, were excluded.
Likewise, patients with no proven acet-
aminophen toxicity by laboratory testing,
even if clinically suspected, were excluded.
Data collection
Data regarding age, sex, weight, ingested
acetaminophen dose, ingestion time, serum
acetaminophen concentration(s), alcohol
use, nutrition status, history of liver dis-
eases, co-ingestion of other medications
(e.g., opioids or antihistamines), and acetyl-
cysteine use and dose were collected from
electronic hospital records. Baseline and
daily data for serum creatinine, blood urea
nitrogen, alanine aminotransferase (ALT),
aspartate aminotransferase (AST), biliru-
bin, PT, and INR were obtained for the
first 48 h post-ingestion. Lastly, informa-
tion on hepatic encephalopathy, pH value,
and lactate were collected.
Statistical analyses
Categorical variables are presented as fre-
quencies and percentages, while continuous
variables are reported as mean/C6 SD and
median with interquartile range (IQR) to
highlight that data did not show normal
distribution. Categorical variables were
compared using v
2-test or Fisher’s exact
test and continuous variables were com-
pared using Student’s independent t-test.
Continuous variables without normal dis-
tribution were analyzed with Mann–
Whitney U-test. Data were analyzed using
STATA software, version 14 (StataCorp
LP, College Station, TX, USA) and a
P-value <0.05 was considered statistically
significant.

Results
A total of 778 patients were screened during
the study period. Of these, 675 patients
were excluded from the study (645 who
proved to have no acetaminophen toxicity,
19 patients with unknown acetaminophen
ingestion time, and 11 patients with acet-
aminophen serum concentration >150 mg/
ml). Consequently, 103 patients were
included in the study. The median (IQR)
age of the study population was 17 (4–21)
years, and the median weight was 55 (17.4–
65) kg. Female patients represented 78% of
participants (80/103). Only 2% of patients
had a history of alcohol use, and none had
a history of liver disease upon admission.
About half of the patients had co-ingested
other medications with acetaminophen
(antihistamines, opioids, and non-steroidal
anti-inflammatory drugs), and 13 patients
(12.6%) required hospital admission for
further management. More detailed study
population demographic and clinical char-
acteristics are summarized in Table 1.
Upon presenting to the emergency
department, serum acetaminophen concen-
tration was tested in all patients and the
median concentration was 42 (4.5–64.8)
mg/ml. The median total ingested acetamin-
ophen dose was 5000 (2850–7650) mg,
equating to 98.2 (59.5–153.8) mg/kg. The
median time between patients’ arrival at
the emergency department and the first
determination of serum acetaminophen
concentration was 62 (25–138) min. These
results are summarized in Table 2.
Relevant laboratory tests showed normal
readings, where the median ALT, AST, and
total bilirubin at baseline were 22 (17–28)
IU/L, 27 (16–45) IU/L, and 6 (4–9)lmol/L,
respectively. These values were slightly ele-
vated but remained within normal range
among patients followed for 24 or 48 h
post-ingestion. Regarding the coagulation
profile, the median PT was 14 (13.7–14.8)
s, and INR readings were also normal.
Additional applicable laboratory values
are shown in Table 1.
A total of 16 patients (15.53%) were
managed with charcoal only and 20
(19.42%) received acetylcysteine without
any recorded adverse drug reaction for
either treatment, or development of any

hepatotoxicity, including in patients with
initial co-ingestion or risk factors of
hepatotoxicity.
When comparing the characteristics
between patients who received acetylcys-
teine and those who did not, the mean base-
line prothrombin time (15.7 versus 14 s,
respectively) and mean total bilirubin at
baseline (11.35 versus 6.85 mmol/L, respec-
tively) were significantly higher among
patients who received acetylcysteine than
those who did not receive acetylcysteine
(all P <0.05). The mean bilirubin levels
continued to be elevated among the acetyl-
cysteine group, even at 24 h of admission
(13.66 versus 3.10 mmol/L, respectively;
P ¼0.01). However, there were no statisti-
cally significant between-group differences
in liver enzyme levels at baseline, or at
24 h or 48 h post-admission. The mean acet-
aminophen levels at presentation to the
emergency department were higher among
patients treated with acetylcysteine com-
pared with those not treated with acetylcys-
teine (71.63 versus 38.46mg/ml, respectively;
P <0.001), with no statistically significant
between-group difference at 24 h; while at
48 h, patients in the acetylcysteine treatment
group exhibited lower acetaminophen levels
(10.30 versus 52.80 mg/ml, respectively;
P ¼0.01). Of note, patients in the acetylcys-
teine treatment group had ingested higher
doses of acetaminophen versus those who
did not receive acetylcysteine treatment
(8759.71 versus 5617.25 mg, respectively;
P ¼0.01), but had significantly lower acet-
aminophen levels at 48 h. Further data
comparing the two treatment groups are
summarized in Table 3.

considered to be at low risk of hepatotoxic-
ity based on the Rumack–Matthew nomo-
gram. The Rumack–Matthew nomogram
provides a guide to the severity of acetamin-
ophen overdose to determine the initiation
of N-acetylcysteine (NAC) therapy.
However, the nomogram cannot always be
utilized, as patients may present late or acet-
aminophen ingestion may not have occurred
in a one-time toxic ingestion.
10 Although the
median serum acetaminophen concentration
at presentation to the emergency department
was 42 (4.5–64.8)mg/ml in the present study,
which is far below the Rumack–Matthew
threshold and values reported previously
by Levine et al.,
8 of 100 (44–179)mg/ml, it
concurs with values reported in two previous
studies (30 [0–660]mg/ml and 48 [23.1–114.4]
mg/ml).
5,10 In the present study, selected
patients were admitted for further observa-
tion and/or NAC treatment. The use of
biomarkers in patients with acetaminophen
toxicity should be part of the management
approach,
11 as acetaminophen concentra-
tion upon admission is not a cornerstone
of either diagnosis or initiating NAC in
cases of acetaminophen poisoning.
Furthermore, it was reported recently that
a significant percentage of patients with acet-
aminophen toxicity showed undetectable
acetaminophen levels despite remarkable
liver injury.
10
In the present study, markers of hepatic
injury showed levels comparable to those of
Levine et al.
8 However, other studies have
revealed a marked rise in hepatic injury
markers that may necessitate liver trans-
plantation despite NAC therapy.
10,12
These discrepancies may be attributed to
many variables, including ingestion of mas-
sive doses, or concomitant medications,
alcohol intake, starvation, older age,

comorbid liver disease, and late presenta-
tion. In the present case, none of the patients
developed hepatic encephalopathy, were
scheduled for liver transplantation, or died.
Changes in AST and ALT activity have
also been questioned for their ability to pre-
dict outcomes, as the development of hepa-
totoxicity is not consistently predicted by
abnormal ALT or AST activity at presen-
tation. In individuals receiving NAC treat-
ment, initially normal ALT or AST activity
was found to have a negative predictive
value for the later development of hepato-
toxicity.
13 In contrast, when combined in a
predictive model, arterial lactate and serum
creatinine were shown to be independent
predictors of poor outcome and may be
helpful in identifying individuals at risk.
14
At therapeutic doses, most acetamino-
phen is metabolized in the liver through
glucuronidation and sulfation pathways
into non-toxic metabolites. A small fraction
undergoes metabolism by CYP450
enzymes, primarily CYP2E1, forming
N-acetyl-p-benzoquinone imine (NAPQI),
a toxic metabolite. A small amount is
excreted unchanged in urine. In cases of
overdose, the glucuronidation and sulfation
pathways become saturated, leading to
increased metabolism of acetaminophen by
CYP450 enzymes to NAPQI. This metabo-
lite is responsible for hepatocyte necrosis
and, in severe cases, liver failure. Plasma
acetaminophen concentration typically cor-
relates with dose-dependent toxicity. The
pathogenesis of acetaminophen-induced
acute liver injury may involve not only the
direct hepatotoxic effects of NAPQI, but
also interactions with immune cells, includ-
ing macrophages, neutrophils, and various
lymphoid cell types. These cells represent
an inflammatory response to
acetaminophen-induced liver injury.
15–18
Regarding the management of acetamin-
ophen toxicity in the present study, most
included patients (78.4%) were managed
conservatively, and the remaining received
either NAC (19.42%) or activated charcoal
(15.53%). A study into the impact of low-
ering the acetaminophen overdose treat-
ment threshold to 100 mg/L concluded
that the number of patients admitted and
treated with acetylcysteine increased with-
out reducing adverse reactions.
6 This sup-
ports the present findings, indicating that
intentional non-adherence to guidelines
might be a conscious choice by physicians
and is not influenced by external factors.
However, adherence places a significant
cost burden on the healthcare system by
overwhelming the financial resources that
may be allocated for other interventions.
Administration of NAC at acetamino-
phen concentration levels below 150mg/ml
may be justified for certain high-risk
groups, such as patients with chronic alco-
hol use disorders, those receiving enzyme-
inducing medications, and those with
malnutrition. There is no specific ‘cutoff
value’ for NAC treatment below the
Rumack–Matthew line. Initiating NAC
when the acetaminophen concentration is
below the line remains at the physician’s
discretion, and the closer the level is to the
treatment line, the more likely the patient
will receive NAC. There is occasional con-
cern about the accuracy of the provided his-
tory; for instance, the time of ingestion may
be inaccurate (the patient may provide dif-
ferent times upon repeated questioning), or
unknown, prompting the physician to com-
mence NAC therapy for safety reasons.
5,19
In the present study, an increase in acet-
aminophen levels was observed at 48 h com-
pared with 24 h in patients who did not
receive NAC treatment. It is important to
note that data for 48-h levels were only
available for a small number of patients
(four in the NAC-treated group and two
in the group with no NAC treatment).
Nevertheless, potential explanations include
the possibility of faster and more efficient
metabolism in those receiving NAC, how-
ever, acetaminophen levels would be
8 Journal of International Medical Research
expected to decrease over time. The eleva-
tion in levels at 48 h may be attributed to
delayed gastric emptying and absorption of
acetaminophen resulting from concurrent
ingestion of medications that slow gut
motility (such as opioids, antihistamines/
anticholinergic agents) or the formation of
bezoars. Another possible explanation is
accidental acetaminophen ingestion or
administration during hospital admission.
20
The present study investigated the demo-
graphic and clinical characteristics of 103
patients with serum acetaminophen concen-
trations below the Rumack–Matthew nomo-
gram threshold (150mg/ml). However, the
study results may be limited by several fac-
tors. Firstly, the single-center, retrospective
study design limits the broader applicability
of the findings. Secondly, the small sample
size precluded adjustments for potential con-
founding variables. Moreover, the study did
not consider the costs associated with NAC
use, which is crucial for monitoring resource
allocation within the healthcare system.
Further research is warranted to address
these limitations. Furthermore, the reliabili-
ty of patient-reported ingestion times poses a
potential limitation. Lastly, the absence of
data on the type of acetaminophen formula-
tion consumed in attempted overdose
further limits the results. For instance, the
absorption of extended-release acetamino-
phen is slower than that of immediate-
release acetaminophen, which may lead to
lower acetaminophen levels at presentation
but subsequent elevation with continued
absorption.
Conclusions
In the absence of consensus regarding risk
assessment and treatment initiation for
patients not meeting the criteria of the
Rumack–Matthew nomogram, various
clinical scenarios may arise, prompting
questions about NAC treatment initiation.
Despite the limitations of the present single-
center, retrospective study design and the
modest sample size, the study offers insights
into the demographic and clinical profiles
of patients presenting with acetaminophen
toxicity below the nomogram threshold.
The present findings suggest that initiating
NAC treatment in this population may not
be necessary unless there are concerns
about the accuracy of the history provided,
or the presence of other compelling factors,
which may be justified for certain high-risk
groups, including patients with chronic
alcohol use disorders, those receiving
enzyme-inducing medications, and those
with malnutrition. Practitioners may con-
sider establishing an estimated cutoff
below the treatment line in the Rumack–
Matthew nomogram, considering clinical
characteristics and how far the serum acet-
aminophen concentration is situated below
the nomogram threshold. Future studies
should aim to elucidate the role of clinical
characteristics and the degree to which
serum acetaminophen concentration falls
below the treatment line in guiding treat-
ment decisions. Additionally, investigating
the efficacy and potential risks associated
with establishing an estimated cutoff
below the treatment line in the nomogram
may provide valuable insights for clinical
practice.
