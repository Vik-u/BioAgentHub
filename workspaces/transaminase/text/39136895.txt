Abstract
Although bosutinib is generally safe and effective, drug-related toxicities (DRTs) such as diarrhea or increased transaminase 
levels often lead to treatment discontinuation. To clarify whether a lower initial dose of bosutinib (i.e., starting at 200 mg) 
would reduce rates of discontinuation due to DRTs, we conducted a phase 2 study of BOsutinib Gradual Increase (BOGI 
trial, UMIN 000032282) as a second/third-line treatment for chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). Between February 4, 2019 
and May 24, 2022, 35 patients were enrolled. The rate of bosutinib discontinuation at 12 months was 25.7% vs. 35.9% in 
a historical control study (Japanese phase 1/2 study) (p  = 0.102). The rate of bosutinib discontinuation due to DRTs was 
significantly lower, at 11.4% vs. 28.2% (p  = 0.015). The incidence of grade 3/4 transaminase elevation was 20% vs. 29% 
(p = 0.427), while the incidence of diarrhea was 3% vs. 25% (p = 0.009). The median dose intensity of bosutinib was higher 
(391.7 mg/day vs. 353.9 mg/day). Pharmacokinetic analysis of bosutinib showed that patients who achieved a major molecular 
response tended to have high trough concentrations. Thus, a low initial dose of bosutinib followed by dose escalation reduced 
discontinuation due to severe DRTs while maintaining high dose intensity and efficacy.

Introduction
The introduction of ABL1 tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) 
has improved survival outcomes for patients with chronic 
phase chronic myeloid leukemia (CML-CP) markedly [1 ]. 
Although imatinib, a pioneering ABL TKI, has many ben-
efits for patients with CML-CP, second-generation TKIs are 
more effective [2, 3]. Bosutinib is a second-generation ABL 
TKI approved for the treatment of CML-CP resistant and/or 
intolerant to prior therapy, as well as for newly diagnosed 
patients [4–6]. Several clinical trials report the efficacy and 
safety of bosutinib; however, the drug is associated with 
drug-related toxicities (DRTs) such as diarrhea or increased 
transaminase levels, which often lead to treatment discon-
tinuation [6 , 7]. The standard initial daily dose of bosuti-
nib is 400 mg for newly diagnosed patients and 500 mg for 
resistant/intolerant patients, although some experts recom-
mend a lower initiating dose (200–300 mg) to reduce the 
incidence of adverse events (AEs) [8 ]; however, the safety 
and efficacy of lower dose initiation of bosutinib have not

been investigated in detail [9 ]. Moreover, the association 
between the pharmacokinetics (PK) of low-dose bosutinib 
and its safety/efficacy are unclear [10, 11].
Hence, we conducted a phase 2 study of BOsutinib Grad-
ual Increase as a second/third-line treatment for CML-CP 
(BOGI trial, UMIN 000032282) to ascertain whether a lower 
initiating dose of bosutinib (200 mg daily) would reduce 
discontinuation rates or treatment interruptions due to DRTs. 
We also investigated the PK of bosutinib at different doses.
Methods
Study design and patient enrollment
The BOGI trial was a single-arm, multicenter, phase 2 trial 
conducted across four Japanese hospitals; the aim was to 
investigate the safety and efficacy of low-dose initiation 
of bosutinib therapy for patients with CML-CP that was 
resistant and/or intolerant to prior therapy. Those included 
were CML-CP patients who developed at least one line of 
treatment failure (resistant and/or intolerant), were aged 
≧18 years, had an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group 
performance status score of 0–2, and had adequate organ 
function (lung, liver, and renal function parameters within 
normal ranges). Patients newly diagnosed with CML-CP, 
those with accelerated phase CML or blast phase CML, 
those who received any other chemotherapy (except hydrox-
yurea), those with a T315I or V299L BCR::ABL mutation, 
those with inflammatory bowel disease, those who received 
cytochrome P-450 CYP3A4 inhibitors or inducers, those 
infected with human immunodeficiency virus and/or hepati-
tis B/C virus, those who were pregnant or breastfeeding, and 
those with critical complications (as defined by the attend-
ing physician) were excluded. The trial was approved by 
the institutional review board of each participating hospital 
(UMIN 000032282). All procedures involving human par -
ticipants were undertaken in accordance with the principles 
of the Declaration of Helsinki, and all participants provided 
written informed consent. The protocol is available in the 
appendix (Supplementary appendix).
Procedures
After enrollment, patients received an initial daily dose 
of bosutinib (200 mg) orally. If no grade 3 or higher AEs 
occurred, the dose was escalated by 100 mg daily (up to 
500 mg daily) every 2 weeks (Supplementary appendix). 
Major BCR::ABL mRNA levels were measured using a 
commercially available quantitative reverse transcription 
PCR (RT-qPCR) kit. Measurements were made at a central 
laboratory (SRL, Tokyo, Japan or Bio Medical Laborato-
ries, Tokyo, Japan) and in accordance with the standardized 
international scale (IS). Plasma trough concentrations of 
bosutinib were measured at inVentive Health Clinical (NJ, 
USA) using a validated liquid chromatography/tandem mass 
spectrometry (LC/MS/MS) assay. Major BCR::ABL mRNA 
levels and plasma trough concentrations of bosutinib were 
measured every 3 months (i.e., at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months 
post-initiation). Two or three-color flow cytometry was per-
formed (Bio Medical Laboratories, Tokyo, Japan) at 3, 6, 
and 12 months post-initiation to assess T cell and natural 
killer (NK) cell profiles. T cell and natural killer cell sub-
sets were defined as follows: CD8 T cells =  CD3+CD8+; NK

The primary endpoint was the rate of treatment discon-
tinuation at 12 months due to DRTs. Secondary endpoints 
included the treatment interruption rate, the mean bosuti-
nib dose, number of dosing days and relative dose intensity 
up until 12 months, achievement of a cytogenetic response 
(CCyR; equivalent for BCR::ABL1 mRNA ≦  1.0%) at 6 
and 12 months, and the cumulative rates of major molecu-
lar response (MMR; BCR::ABL1  mRNA ≦ 0.1%) or deep 
molecular response (DMR; BCR::ABL1 mRNA ≦  0.01%) 
at 3, 6, 9 and 12 months. Sample size was calculated using 
research and biostatistics Cancer Research and Biostatistics 
SWOG statistical tools (null proportion = 0.32; alternative 
proportion = 0.14; one-sided α error = 5%; β error = 20%; 
power 80%), with the discontinuation rate of the previous 
Japanese phase 1/2 study of bosutinib as a reference [ 10]. 
Considering protocol deviations, the official target enroll-
ment sample size for this trial was 35.
Statistical analysis
For the primary endpoint, the rate of bosutinib discontinua-
tion at 12 months due to DRTs and the one-sided 95% confi-
dence interval (CI) were estimated using the Wilson method. 
The binomial test was used to evaluate whether the percent-
age was <32%. For the safety and secondary endpoints, 
Fisher’s exact test was used for categorical variables and 
the Mann–Whitney test for continuous variables. The Pear-
son correlation coefficient is used to determine correlation 
between bosutinib trough concentrations and several vari-
ables. Significant differences between the three groups were 
assessed using one-way ANOVA (post-hoc tests using Bon-
ferroni), and those between two groups were assessed using 
the Mann–Whitney U test. The MMR and rate of DMR, as 
well as the two-sided 95% CI, were also estimated using 
the Wilson method. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) 
curve analysis was done to determine optimal bosutinib con-
centration. The significance level for the primary hypothesis 
test was 0.05 (one-sided), and that for all other secondary 
endpoints was 0.05 (two-sided). Statistical analyses were 
performed using SAS version 9.4 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, 
NC, USA). The study is registered with the UMIN Clinical 
Trials Registry (UMIN 000032282).
Results
Patient characteristics
Between February 4, 2019 and May 24, 2022, 35 patients 
from four Japanese hospitals were enrolled. The median age 
was 61 years (range, 26–81); 19 patients were male and 16 
were female, and 16, 12, and seven had low, intermediate, 
and high Sokal scores, respectively. 11 patients were resist-
ant to prior therapy and 24 were intolerant, respectively. The 
numbers of patients previously treated with TKIs were as fol-
lows: 19 (54%) received one TKI, 12 (34%) received three, 
and four (11%) received three. Prior TKIs were imatinib 
(n = 8, 23%), dasatinib (n  = 27, 77%), nilotinib (n  = 16, 
46%), and bosutinib ( n = 1, 3%, the patient who received 
prior treatment with bosutinib was intolerant to standard 
dosage of bosutinib); 23 of 35 patients (66%) had medi -
cal complications, which included hypertension (10, 29%), 
diabetes mellitus (five, 14%), cardiovascular disease (three, 
9%), solid tumors (two, 6%), and cerebrovascular disease 
(one, 3%). The median major BCR::ABL mRNA level was 
0.1% (0.0–34.6%), and serum aspartate aminotransferase 
(AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels were 23 
U/L (11–63) and 20 U/L (12–94), respectively (Table 1).
The bosutinib discontinuation rate due to DRTs 
was lower than that reported previously
In the intention to treat population, nine of 35 patients had 
discontinued bosutinib at 12 months; four of these discon-
tinuations were due to DRTs. The total bosutinib discon-
tinuation rate was 25.7% ([95% CI, 15.6–39.3%] vs. 35.9% 
(14/39) for the Japanese phase 1/2 study [10]; p = 0.102), 
and the bosutinib discontinuation rate due to DRTs was 
11.4% ([95% CI, 5.2–23.2%] vs. 28.2% (11/39, p  = 0.015); 
the differences were significant. Common grade 3 to 4 AEs 
were consistent with the known safety profiles of bosutinib; 
these included skin rash (26%), increased AST (9%), and 
increased ALT (20%); there were no differences in grade

3–4 skin rash (p  = 1.00), increased AST (p  = 0.690), and 
increased ALT ( p = 0.554) between the present study and 
the previous the Japanese phase 1/2 study; the incidence 
of diarrhea was low (3% vs. 25% in the Japanese phase 1/2 
study; p = 0.018)). No pleural effusion (0%), cardiovascular 
events (0%), and only one cerebral hemorrhage (3%), were 
observed (Table 2). These results suggest that a lower initiat-
ing dose of bosutinib reduces the discontinuation rate due 
to DRTs; thus, the primary endpoint was met. A total of 21 
patients (60.0%) interrupted bosutinib at least once due to 
grade 3 or higher AEs, except for one patient who discon-
tinued due to a grade 2 pleural effusion at the decision of 
the physician. The other reasons for interruptions were skin 
rash (n = 9), liver dysfunction (n = 7), diarrhea (n = 1), appe-
tite loss (n = 1), acute enterocolitis (n  = 1), increased lipase 
(n = 1), nausea (n = 1), general fatigue (n = 1), cerebral hem-
orrhage (n  = 1), poisoning rash (n  = 1) and anemia (n  = 1). 
Median bosutinib interruption duration was 16 days (range, 
6–64). The mean and median bosutinib dose, the number 
of bosutinib dosing days, and the relative dose intensity up 
until 12 months were 388.7 (204.9–477.3) mg/day, 391.7 
(204.9–477.3) mg, 351.0 (20–365) days, and 78% (41–95), 
respectively. A swimmer plot detailing treatment duration 
and outcomes for individuals in the study is shown in Fig. 1.
Bosutinib efficacy was high even at the lower

BCR::ABL1 mRNA ≦ 1% was achieved by 28/35 patients 
(80.0%) at 6 months, and by 26/35 patients (74.3%) at 
12 months. Notably, all patients who could continue bosu-
tinib until 12 months achieved BCR::ABL1 mRNA ≦ 1%, 
equivalent to a CCyR. The cumulative incidences of 
MMR and DMR at 12 months were 23/35 (65.7%; 95% 
CI, 49.2–79.2%) and 15/35 (42.9%; 95% CI, 28.0–59.1%), 
respectively (Fig.  2A). For those who could be evaluated.

The cumulative incidence of a molecular response at each 
time point is presented in Fig. 2B. Taken together, the results 
suggest that bosutinib efficacy remains high in CML-CP 
patients who were resistant and/or intolerant to prior therapy, 
even when used at a lower initiating dose.
PK of bosutinib
The average trough concentration of bosutinib at 3, 6 and 
12 months was 114.4, 118.0 and 112.6 ng/mL, respectively. 
When we investigated factors that can affect the bosutinib 
trough concentration (i.e., patient age, sex, body weight, 
body mass index, liver function, and renal function), we 
found that none did (Table S1). Furthermore, there was no 
difference in average trough concentrations between those 
who continued (26 patients) and those that discontinued 
treatment due to AEs (six patients): 116.9 vs. 98.9 ng/mL, 
respectively (p  = 0.409, Mann–Whitney U test; Fig.  3A). 
With respect to an association between achievement of 
MMR or DMR and the bosutinib trough concentration, 
we found that patients who achieved molecular remission 
tended to have higher trough concentrations: MMR = 117.0 
vs. 64.1  ng/mL, respectively (p  = 0.210; Fig.  3B) and 
DMR = 117.7 vs. 104.0 ng/mL, respectively (p  = 0.355; 
Fig. 3C). The optimal trough concentration for a 1 log reduc-
tion was 121.0 ng/mL (based on ROC curve analysis and 
Youden index criteria) (Fig. 3D).
T cell and NK cell dynamics after initiation 
of bosutinib treatment
We performed flow cytometry for sequential assessment of 
changes in the T cell and NK cell profiles following ini-
tiation of bosutinib treatment. The percentages of  CD8+ T 
cells,  CD3−CD56+ NK cells,  CD16+CD56+ NK cells, and 
Tregs changed little after bosutinib initiation (Figure S1). 
Next, we evaluated the association between immune cell 
numbers and bosutinib treatment outcomes. There were no 
differences in the percentage of CD8+ T cells and NK cells 
between patients who achieved DMR and those that did 
not (Fig.  4A–C); however, patients who achieved DMR at 
12 months had a lower percentage of Tregs than those who 
did not (5.7% vs. 7.2%, respectively; p  = 0.043; Fig. 4D). 
These results indicate that bosutinib does not affect most 
immune cell populations, whereas the low numbers of Tregs 
might play a role in patient responses to bosutinib.
Discussion
International prospective clinical trials show that bosutinib 
is a safe and effective second-generation TKI for patients 
with newly diagnosed or pre-treatment refractory-intoler -
ant CML-CP [4–7], although DRT forces dose reduction in 
some patients; however, sub-analyses indicate an adequate 
molecular response in such patients [12, 13]. Establishing 
the optimal dose of bosutinib is necessary to achieve optimal

efficacy while avoiding AEs; therefore, some experts recom-
mend a lower initiating dose [8].
Mita et al. [14] conducted a retrospective study compar -
ing a dose-escalation regimen of bosutinib versus a standard 
dose starting regimen. The initiating dose of bosutinib was 
100 mg daily, escalating to 500 mg daily; the result was 
a reduction in interruption or discontinuation rates due to 
AEs when compared with the standard 500 mg daily fixed 
dose [14]. The recent BODO study, a phase 2 trial examin-
ing the safety and efficacy of step-in dosing of bosutinib 
[9], reported that a 300 mg daily initiation regimen failed to 
reduce gastrointestinal AEs or discontinuation rates; 17 of 
the 57 patients (29.8%) discontinued bosutinib due to AEs 
[9]. In the present BOGI trial, the initial dose of bosuti-
nib was 200 mg daily; subsequently, the dose was escalated 
by 100 mg daily (up to 500 mg daily) every 2 weeks. The 
primary endpoint was the bosutinib discontinuation rate due 
to DRTs at 12 months; the result was 11.4%; hence, the pri-
mary endpoint was met. The lower rate in the BOGI trial 
compared with that in the Japanese phase 1/2 study [10] 
was attributed to an apparent reduction in the incidence of 
diarrhea. Furthermore, a previous study reported a correla-
tion between the average bosutinib concentration during the 
early treatment phase (< 1 week) and occurrence of grade 3 
diarrhea, suggesting that a lower initiating dose of bosutinib 
reduce diarrhea and therefore AEs [15]. These results sug-
gest that a 300 mg daily initiating dose may be too high for a 
certain subset of patients, whereas 100 to 200 mg daily may 
be optimal [14, 16].
Approximately 10–20% of patients who receive bosutinib 
developed a grade 3 to 4 increase in transaminase levels, 
leading to discontinuation [ 4, 6, 7]; grade 3 to 4 increases

in transaminase are more common in Japanese patients than 
in non-Japanese patients (36.2 vs. 17.7%, respectively); 
this leads directly to bosutinib discontinuation in 30.4% of 
Japanese patients [17]. In the BOGI trial, we noted a similar 
frequency of grade 3 to 4 increases in transaminase (AST, 
9%; ALT, 20%) [4, 6, 7], although these did not lead to bosu-
tinib discontinuation. Since it is not uncommon for initial 
elevations in transaminase to resolve spontaneously, close 
monitoring and early evaluation of liver enzymes, along 
with appropriate modifications in the drug dose, might have 
helped these patients to continue bosutinib throughout the 
BOGI trial. Furthermore, the median dose of bosutinib in 
patients enrolled in the BOGI trial was relatively higher 
(391.7 mg/day) than that in the previous Japanese clinical 
study (353.9 mg/day) [17], although the cumulative inci-
dences of MMR and DMR at 12 months (MMR, 65.7%; 
DMR, 42.9%) were comparable with those in the BELA or 
BYOND trials [4, 7]; therefore, a lower initiating dose (fol-
lowed by subsequent dose escalation) regimen can maintain 
dose intensity, resulting in an adequate therapeutic effect. 
Since the continuation rates and efficacy of bosutinib are 
associated [4, 6, 7, 18], frequent monitoring of liver enzyme 
along with dose modification is important to avoid bosutinib 
discontinuation due to increased transaminase levels while at 
the same time enabling optimal efficacy. Although the obser-
vation period was short, the low incidence of cardiovascular 
AEs in the BOGI trial was notable.
We also measured trough concentrations of bosutinib over 
time to identify the effective therapeutic range that exhib -
its optimal safety and efficacy. Unfortunately, we found no 
significant difference in the trough concentrations between 
patients who discontinued bosutinib due to AEs (n  = 6) and 
those who were able to continue (n  = 26). This may be due 
to the fact that few patients had their concentrations meas-
ured at the time of AE onset and/or at the time of bosutinib 
discontinuation. Only six of nine patients who discontinued 
bosutinib due to AEs had bosutinib concentrations measured 
at the time determined by the protocol. Bosutinib trough

A lower initial dose of bosutinib for patients with chronic myeloid leukemia patients resistant…
concentrations are associated with gastrointestinal toxicity; 
however, the target trough concentration needed to avoid 
AEs remains unclear [15]. Patients who achieved an MMR 
tended to have higher trough concentrations, a finding con-
sistent with a previous report; the optimal trough concentra-
tion for a 1 log reduction in the BOGI trial was 121.0 ng/mL. 
Further PK studies are needed to establish target concen-
trations and the optimal individual doses require to ensure 
safety and efficacy.
Several lines of evidence suggest that CML is sensitive 
to immunotherapy [19], and that responses to TKI therapy 
can be determined not only by direct binding capacity for 
BCR::ABL but also by anti-tumor immune responses [ 20, 
21]. Imatinib or dasatinib often increase NK cell num-
bers or decrease Treg numbers, leading to favorable clini -
cal responses [22– 24], while nilotinib or bosutinib affect 
immune cells only weakly [23]. Tregs, which are major 
mediators of mammalian self-tolerance, suppress anti-tumor 
immunity, making them obstacles to successful cancer treat-
ment [25]. In the present study, we found that bosutinib did 
not affect T and NK cells, as reported previously [23, 26]; 
however, we found that the outcome of bosutinib treatment 
might be dependent on the number of Tregs. Lower Treg 
numbers are associated with successful achievement of a 
DMR [24, 27], as well as maintenance of a treatment free 
remission in CML patients because they activate anti-CML 
immune responses [28]. These results suggest that although 
bosutinib itself might have no direct effect on immune 
cells, immune cells may affect the therapeutic efficacy of 
bosutinib.
Conclusion
A lower initiating dose of bosutinib reduces drug discon-
tinuation rates, or interruption of treatment, due to severe 
DRTs, particularly diarrhea, while maintaining therapeutic 
efficacy. Although bosutinib concentration levels might 
correlate with safety and efficacy, the target trough con -
centrations required for optimal safety and efficacy remain 
unclear. Further large-scale studies are needed to further 
investigate the PK of bosutinib.
