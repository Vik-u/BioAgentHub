Omega transaminases (u-TAs) can mediate the chiral ami-
nation of several unnatural substrates without the requirement
of an
a-COOH group and are highly relevant in the production
of several pharmaceutical intermediates of commercial inter-
est. Development of better variants of
u-TAs is hence essential
for the biotransformation of unnatural substrates. We studied
the active site architecture of the wild-typeu-TAs, to engineer
enzymes that enhance the biotransformation of (R)-phenyl-
acetylcarbinol to (1 R,2 S)-norephedrine. Two such u-TAs
(TA_5182 and TA_2799) fromP. putida KT2440 strain were
overexpressed and puriﬁed as recombinant proteins. Crystal
structures of TA_5182 were solved in two conformations,
revealing signiﬁcant movements of two highlyﬂexible loops in
these different states. The TA_2799 structure was determined
as a complex with the cofactor pyridoxal 5ʹ-phosphate (PLP)
covalently bound to the catalytic K286 as an internal aldimine.
Enzyme assays indicated that TA_2799 required a four-fold
higher cofactor concentration than TA_5182 to achieve satis-
factory biotransformation of (R)-PAC. A key mutation of L322F
in TA_2799 drastically reduced ( /C248-fold) the cofactor de-
pendency of the TA_2799_L322F mutant enzyme, and the
mutant remained active for 96 h at 30
/C14C. The crystal structure
of the mutant enzyme revealed a key asparagine residue that
mediates a hydrogen bonding network at the dimeric interface
of the enzyme and is absent in TA_5182. The TA_5182_G119N
mutant also showed enhanced cofactor afﬁnity. The results of
our studies will help generatePseudomonad
u-TAs andu-TAs
from other organisms with high ef ﬁciency for asymmetric
synthesis, for further applications in large-scale biotransfor-
mation processes.
Transaminases (TAs) or aminotransferases are a class of
enzymes that catalyze the exchange of an amine (-NH2) group
with a keto (C=O) group between an amino acid and ana-keto
acid. These enzymes are highly stereoselective and have two
substrate-binding pockets of varying sizes along with the
cofactor pyridoxal 5ʹ-phosphate (PLP). During transamination,
the binding and involvement of the PLP molecule to form a
Schiff base intermediate is one of the key steps in catalysis (1).
While
a- and b-TAs require a -COOH moiety for catalysis,
u-TAs can catalyze the transamination reaction without the
requirement of the -COOH moiety. Therefore, u-TAs can
accept a wide range of donor and acceptor substrates, leading
to their potential use to synthesize commercially important
compounds (2). Due to their high enantiomeric selectivity and
environmentally friendly, concise reactions, transaminases
have broad industrial applications, especially in the pharma-
ceutical industry (3).
In recent years, biocatalytic routes have emerged as prom-
ising approaches for producing various bulk andﬁne chemicals,
including pharmaceuticals ( 4). Among the signi ﬁcant ad-
vancements in this area, the biocatalytic synthesis of chiral
amines has garnered considerable attention. Chiral amines, with
their diverse applications as drugs and chiral auxiliaries in
organic synthesis, play a crucial role in the pharmaceutical and
chemical industries. One such industrially important chiral
amine is (1R, 2S)-norephedrine ((1R, 2S)-NE). (1R,2 S)-NE and
its derivatives primarily serve as chiral auxiliaries or chiral
catalysts in various asymmetric reactions (5, 6). Chemical syn-
thesis of (1R,2 S)-NE from (R)-phenylacetylcarbinol ((R)-PAC)
poses several challenges, including low enantioselectivity and
the requirement for multiple synthesis steps involving harsh
reaction conditions (5, 7). As a result, researchers have adopted
biocatalytic strategies, utilizing transaminases as stereoselective
biocatalysts for chiral amine synthesis (6, 8, 9)( Fig. 1). Despite
their industrial importance, most reported transaminases
exhibit insufﬁcient operational or kinetic stability at high sub-
strate concentrations, in denaturing solvents, and at elevated
temperatures (4, 10). Thus, there is a need for the development
of better variants of transaminases for industrial use. Research
has focused on understanding the molecular basis of the kinetic
instability of transaminases for their rational engineering.
Studies on the well-characterized transaminase fromChromo-
bacterium violaceum (Cv-TA) indicate that PLP binding,
especially the binding of the 5ʹ-phosphate in the phosphate
group binding cup (PGBC), acts as the driving factor for the
structural rearrangements in the enzyme ( 11, 12). In this
context, the afﬁnity of transaminases toward the cofactor PLP
plays a key role in maintaining the stability of the enzyme (10).

In bacterial fold type Iu-TAs, two monomers are required to
form the active site and the PLP binding pocket. The binding of
the cofactor depends on the dynamics of the twoﬂexible loops.
The N-terminal loop acts as a “lid” covering the aromatic
moiety of the PLP molecule, and it interacts with the C-terminal
loop (termed as the “roof”) from the other monomer to
accommodate the cofactor molecule in the active site of the
enzyme. Increasing the afﬁnity of the enzyme towards PLP
enhances its stability and biophysical properties (10, 13– 15).
Over the last decade, studies have focused on (S)- selective
u-TAs belonging to fold type I from several organisms, like
C. violaceum (11),V . ﬂuvalis (16),P .p u t i d a(17), and
H. elongata (18), that highlight some of the key residues that
mediate polar interactions with the cofactor molecule and the
movement of the loop during transition of the enzyme from its
apo to holo form. However, the effect of the loop movement on
enzyme activity and cofactor afﬁnity remains unclear.
Transaminases have shown promise in ef ﬁciently
consuming the substrate (R)-PAC for (1R,2 S)-NE synthesis.
Among them, two transaminases TA_2799 (UniProt ID:
Q88J50) and TA_5182 (UniProt ID: Q88CJ8) from Pseudo-
monas putidaKT2440 have been previously reported for their
catalytic potential towards the biocatalysis of organic com-
pounds (17) and formation of (1R,2 S)-NE (9, 19). However,
there is a lack of detailed studies on the enzymatic synthesis of
(1R,2 S)-NE using these speci ﬁc enzymes. Therefore, to
address this gap, comprehensive systematic studies of the
transaminases fromP. putidaKT2440 are essential to evaluate
their suitability for the enzymatic synthesis of (1R,2 S)-NE.
In this work, we successfully overexpressed and character-
ized the two recombinant transaminases TA_2799 and
TA_5182 from P. putida KT2440 and solved their crystal
structures. We determined the structure of TA_5182 in both
relaxed (open) and closed states, mimicking the cofactor-free
and the cofactor-bound form of the enzyme, respectively.
The “roof” loop movement observed in these two forms
revealed some important interactions essential for binding of
the phosphate group of the cofactor molecule. Furthermore,
using a structure-based rational design approach, key residues
around the cofactor binding pocket of TA_2799 were mutated,
and these single mutants exhibited increased afﬁnity of the
enzyme toward PLP. As a result, the mutants showed
increased stability and enhanced biophysical properties, mak-
ing them potential candidates for large-scale biocatalysis of
(1R,2 S)-NE. Our ﬁndings are generally applicable to other
transaminases and will aid in developing better
u-TAs for
industrial applications.
Results
Expression and puriﬁcation of the wild-type TA enzymes and
their stability
TA_2799 and TA_5182 were overexpressed in E. coli
BL21 cells and puriﬁed using one-step Ni-NTA afﬁnity chro-
matography and stored in a buffer containing 50 mM HEPES,
200 mM NaCl at pH 8.0 for biochemical characterization.
TA_2799 posed a peculiar problem after the puriﬁcation of the
enzyme. Even under incubation with 50 mM PLP at 4
/C14C, the
Figure 1. Reaction pathway ofu-TAs in the formation of (1R,2 S)-Norephedrine ((1R,2 S)-NE). In the ﬁrst half of the reaction, the amine group is
transferred from the amine donor (S)-Methylbenzylamine ((S)-MBA) to the PLP molecule to form Pyridoxamine 50-Phosphate (PMP) which is no longer
covalently bound to the catalytic lysine of the enzyme. Acetophenone is produced as a by-product. In the second half of the reaction, the PMP molecule
transfers the amine group to the acceptor (R)-PAC to form the amine product (1R,2 S)-NE and the enzyme is regenerated by forming the internal aldimine
between PLP and the catalytic lysine.

enzyme tended to precipitate within 24 h when concentrated
over 5 mg/ml. Precipitation was hastened with an increment in
temperature and enzyme concentrations. On the other hand,
TA_5182 remained stable in solution at a high concentration
of 20 mg/ml. Storage instability is commonly observed in wild-
type
u-TAs (13), which makes them unsuitable for biocatalytic
reactions. We observed a signiﬁcant drop in enzyme activity
(less than 20% activity) within 24 h of puriﬁcation of the
enzyme. To address this problem with TA_2799, we added
glycerol to the freshly puriﬁed protein as an additive. It was
found that a 12.5% (v/v) glycerol mixture effectively kept the
enzyme stable in solution (kept in the dark, 4
/C14C in a freezer),
similar to the observation by Chenet al.with C. violaceumTA
(13). This can be associated with the fact that glycerol prevents
the aggregation of enzyme molecules and thus prevents pre-
cipitation (20). We proceeded to crystallize the enzymes in
their apo and PLP-bound states to understand the structural
basis of such a contrasting observation.
Crystal structures of TA_2799 and TA_5182
The crystal structure of TA_2799 was determined at a res-
olution of 1.76 Å in the PLP-bound holo form. The structure
of TA_5182 was solved in two different conformations in its
apo state, at resolutions of 3.4 Å and 2.8 Å respectively. The
crystal structure of L322F mutant of TA_2799 was solved at a
resolution of 2.5 Å. The reﬁnement statistics are summarized
in Table 1.
The overall structural fold of the TA_5182 and TA_2799
enzymes is similar to that observed for other class III fold type I
TAs with two
a/b domains (Fig. 2A). The enzymes function as
homodimers. For a better understanding of the contributions of
the two subunits of the dimer, some of the residues are marked
with a prime symbol to indicate the involvement of those
residues from another monomer. Each monomer is composed
of two major domains, the larger domain that consists of the
residues 66 to 344, and the smaller N-terminal domain that
consists of the residues 1 to 65 and the C-terminal region of
345 to 459 (Media S1). The large domain has an
a/b/a sand-
wich topology and is centered around a seven-strandedb-sheet
as observed in other fold type Iu-TAs (21). The small domain
is made up of twob-sheet assemblies. The N-terminalb-sheet
assembly is a three-stranded anti-parallel b-sheet instead of
being four-stranded as found in some u-TAs like the
C. violaceumTA andPseudomonas aeruginosaTAs, where the
last b-strand comes from the C-terminal part of the domain
(22). This b-sheet assembly is capped by twoﬂexible helices
comprising of residues 1 to 32, electron densities of which were
observed in the crystal structure of TA_2799 and the closed
state of TA_5182. In the crystal structure of the open state of
TA_5182, these residues could not be built due to poor elec-
tron density in this region and hence were excluded from the
ﬁnal reﬁned model. The C-terminal
b-sheet is four-stranded
with direction + - + + with a topology of +1, +2×,−1. As
seen in other TAs, this sheet is shielded on one side from the
solvent by three
a-helices. The other side forms a crevice with
the large domain, which accommodates the enzyme’s active
site.
There are two highlyﬂexible loops present in the structures
of TA_2799 and TA_5182 (Fig. 2, B and C) that mediate the

entry and exit of the cofactor and the substrate/byproduct into
the active site of the enzyme, leading to signiﬁcant confor-
mational changes in the enzyme structure. Other than these
two loops, there is another“outer loop” consisting of residues
84 to 96 that also shows conformationalﬂexibility. We were
able to crystallize TA_5182 in two different conformations
which we term as the open and closed state (Fig. 3A). On
formation of the internal aldimine with the PLP molecule, the
enzyme shifts from its open state to a more compact closed
form. To date, there are very few studies where similar
conformational differences have been reported, such as in the
transaminase fromC. violaceum(11) andVibrio ﬂuvialis (16).
In most of the apo form structures of the enzyme reported, the
“roof” region (residues 312– 321 in TA_2799) that lines up the
substrate entry channel is not visible due to highﬂexibility of
these regions. Comparing the structures of
u-TAs deposited in
PDB shows that the roof structure is missing in the apo
structures of fold type I transaminase enzymes fromPseudo-
monas strains (PDB ID: 5TI8, 6HX9) (17, 23). In our crystal
structure of the apo state of TA_5182, the electron density of
the roof loop is visible (Fig. 3B). In the crystal structure of the
open state of TA_5182, the“lid” loop could not be visualized
due to the inherentﬂexibility of this region. The“roof” loop
projects itself toward the PLP-binding pocket on the binding of
PLP in the active site of the enzyme. A sulfate ion can be
observed at the PLP group phosphate binding cup (PGBC) of
the active site of this enzyme (Fig. 3C). In the crystal structure
of the closed state of TA_5182, electron density for the initial
32 residues and as well as that of the“roof” and “lid” loops are
clearly visible. The conformation of the active site is similar to

PLP-bound structures ofu-TAs; however, a phosphate ion can
be seen at the PGBC of the enzyme (Fig. 3D).
TA_2799 was crystallized in the PLP-bound state. The
conformation of the enzyme is almost identical to the closed
state of TA_5182. Continuous high-quality electron density
could be seen for the covalently bound internal aldimine form
of the PLP bound to the catalytic K286 residue (Fig. 2D)i n
both the subunits. The TA_2799_L322F mutant was crystal-
lized in its apo form, with a sulfate ion bound in the
phosphate-binding pocket of the enzyme ( Fig. 2E). These
crystal structures and their analysis provide valuable infor-
mation about the role of the different residues in and around
the active site that mediate cofactor binding and the trans-
amination reaction. More details about the roles of the active
site residues and structural features of these
u-TAs in the
catalytic reaction are discussed in the subsequent sections.
Superimposition of the closed state of TA_5182 and
TA_2799 revealed that the former is almost identical to the
PLP-bound state of the enzyme, with an RMSD of 1.107 Å over
741 C
a-atoms. On comparing the individual chains of the
enzymes with other fold type Iu-TAs belonging to class III
PLP-dependent enzymes, we found that the overall fold of
TA_5182 and TA_2799 is conserved; however, the closest
homolog of TA_2799, an
u-TA from Pseudomonas jensenni
shares only 58% sequence identity. Comparing the open state of
TA_5182 with the deposited structures in PDB resulted in an
average RMSD of 2.0 Å, which is expected as the conformation
of this state is signiﬁcantly different than the PLP-bound state

of the enzyme. The superimpositions of the monomers of
TA_2799, TA_5182 open state, and TA_5182 closed state show
that the monomers have an average RMSD of 0.153 Å, 0.166 Å,
and 0.083 Å, respectively (Fig. S1 and Table S1). The major
conformational differences can be found in the roof loop and
the outer loop in the open state of TA_5182. A comprehensive
list of the structural superimposition of the crystal structures of
TA_2799 and TA_5182 with deposited structures of
u-TAs
from other organisms found in the PDB, as calculated from the
Dali server (http://ekhidna2.biocenter.helsinki.ﬁ/dali/)i sp r e -
sented inTables S2and S3. The PLP-bound state of TA_2799
is similar to most of the structures found in the PDB, which is
the catalytically competent state of the enzyme. The open state
of TA_5182 is not easily observed. It shows a distinct confor-
mation in the overall ternary structure of the enzyme, which
allows the cofactor molecule and the substrates to enter the
enzyme’s active sitevia movement of theﬂexible loops.
Comparison of the active sites of TA_2799 and TA_5182
The high-resolution crystal structure of PLP bound
TA_2799 provides insights into the architecture of the active
site of this
u-TA. The active site is located in a deep cleft
formed by the two monomers. Each dimer has two identical
active sites which are formed by the contributions of the res-
idues from both the subunits. The PLP molecule is linked to
the ε-NH
2 group of the catalytic K286via a covalent Schiff
base, and the pyrimidine ring of the cofactor molecule is
sandwiched between the Y150 and I259 residues. The aromatic
ring of the Y150 exhibits an edge-on interaction with the py-
rimidine ring of the PLP molecule. The protonated pyrimidine
nitrogen is stabilized by hydrogen bonded interactions with
D257, and the hydroxyl group of the ring forms a water
mediated hydrogen bond with E224. The phosphate group of
PLP is stabilized by an intricate hydrogen bonding network,
either directly orvia water molecules, to S118, S285, Y150, and
T323ʹ similar to the “phosphate group binding cup (PGBC)”
described by Denesyuket al. (24).
The enzymes TA_2799 and TA_5182 have a sequence
identity of 38.49% (Fig. S2), but the key residues that interact
with the PLP molecule are identical except for I259 and L322
(Fig. 4, A and B). Comparison of TA_2799 with other known
omega transaminases (10, 11, 14, 16, 17, 22, 25, 26) in the
literature shows the presence of a conserved valine at the I259
position of TA_2799 (Fig. 4D and Data S1). The presence of a
slightly bulkier I259 may play a signiﬁcant role in the occu-
pancy of the external aldimine molecule in the active site
pocket and might be the reason for the rapid conversion of
PLP to PMP by the enzyme. On the other hand, the L322
position in TA_2799 is usually occupied by an aromatic amino
acid (Fig. 4D). In TA_5182, the position is occupied by F321,
and the aromatic ring of phenylalanine contributes to an NH-
p stacking interaction with an adjacent histidine residue, and
an anion-p stacking with a conserved glutamate E123 on the
other side, which confers stability to the dimer interface
(Fig. 4C). Furthermore, in TA_2799, the glutamate residue
interacts with an asparagine and a conserved serine residue to
form an intricate hydrogen bonding network at the dimer
interface. In TA_5182, the asparagine is replaced by a glycine
residue (Fig. 4E and Data S1).
To assess the role of these residues in the cofactor binding
and stability of omega transaminases, we constructed single
mutants of TA_2799 and TA_5182. We compared the activity
of the single mutants TA_2799_I259V, TA_2799_L322F, and
TA_5182_G119N with the wild-type enzymes to increase the
stability and the afﬁnity of the enzymes toward its cofactor
PLP. Apart from this, we also evaluated the role of the Y323 in
TA_5182, which is also somewhat conserved in
u-TAs
(Fig. 4D) by evaluating two mutants, TA_2799_L322F_C324Y
and TA_5182_Y323C.
Biochemical characterizations of the TA_2799, TA_5182, and
their mutants
u-TA enzymes have been widely used for biocatalysis of
several unnatural substrates; however, the biotransformation
of (R)-PAC to (1R, 2S)-NE by
u-TAs is still poorly studied.
The study by Sehlet al. (9) reports that other than the two
enzymes discussed in this study which show good conversion
of (R)-PAC, the TA fromC. violaceum(CV2025) showed 96%
activity against (R)-PAC, while the
u-TA from P. aeruginosa
(PAO221) showed 38% activity against (R)-PAC. This study
suggested that TA_2799 and TA_5182 can be utilized for
efﬁcient biocatalysis of (R)-PAC to (1R,2 S)-NE. To biochem-
ically assess the activity of the TA enzymes TA_2799 and
TA_5182 toward conversion of (R)-PAC to (1R,2 S)-NE, we
used the triphenyl tetrazolium (TTC)-based assay developed
by Sehlet al.(9). For kinetic studies, pyruvate was used as the
amine acceptor and (S)-MBA was used as the amine donor.
TA_2799_I259V, surprisingly, had very little activity (/C2420%)
compared to wild-type TA_2799 (Fig. S3).
The TA enzymes are known to demonstrate substrate in-
hibition (27). To understand the extent of substrate concen-
tration that can be used for the TA enzymes for efﬁcient
catalysis, the enzymes were subjected to varying concentra-
tions of the substrates, keeping other parametersﬁxed. It was
observed that TA_5182 has a better tolerance towards sub-
strate inhibition in comparison to TA_2799. Interestingly, the
ratio of the amino donor: amino acceptor needs to be at least
2:1 for efﬁcient catalysis (>90% conversion of (R)-PAC) while
using (S)-MBA as the amino donor (Fig. 5, A and B).
We studied the effect of temperature on the activities of the
wild type and mutant enzymes. The TA_2799_L322F mutant
showed a 20% increase in enzymatic activity for the mutant
variant across a range of temperatures compared to the wild-
type enzyme (Fig. 5C). The optimum activity for the wild-
type TA_2799 enzyme was observed at 30
/C14C, while the
TA_2799_L322F mutant maintained 100% activity across a
wide range of temperatures from 25 to 55
/C14C. For TA_5182
and the TA_5182_G119N mutant, a similar temperature
proﬁle was observed (Fig. 5D). The G119N mutant showed
optimum activity at 30
/C14C and maintained more than 60%
activity at 50/C14C as compared to the wild-type enzyme, whose
activity dropped to 20%.

The pH-dependent activities of the enzymes and their
mutants were also measured. It was found that TA_2799 ex-
hibits the highest activity at a pH range of 7.5 to 8.5. The pH
optima tend to shift toward alkaline pH (pH 9.0) in the case of
the L322F mutant (Fig. 5E). TA_5182, on the other hand, was
found to be active in a broader pH range. The optimum ac-
tivity of the enzyme was found to be at pH 7.5, but it retained
/C2480% of its activity at pH 6.0 as well. The activity dropped
drastically to zero at pH 5.0 (Fig. 5F). A similar trend was
observed for the G119N mutant as well. Notably, the mutant
enzyme showed a 10% increase in relative activity compared to
its wild-type counterpart.
Cofactor release and PLP-dependent conversion of (R)-PAC by
u-TAs
Loss of the aminated cofactor (PMP) formed during theﬁrst
half of the reaction is a major cause for inactivation of trans-
aminases (10, 27). A study by Schellet al.(28) showed that the

PMP generated by the TA enzymes is released into the reac-
tion medium due to theﬂexibility of the loops, as PMP is no
longer covalently bound to the enzyme.
To investigate the cofactor release TA_2799 and TA_5182
were incubated with 1 mM of PLP and 10 mM of (S)-MBA and
incubated at 30/C14C in the dark in the presence and absence of
5 mM amine acceptor (R)-PAC. PLP in solution has an Ab-
sorption maximum (AbsMax) at 408 nm and PMP has an
AbsMax at 326 nm. The spectra showed characteristic peaks at
408 nm and 326 nm for PLP and PMP, respectively. The
shorter roof region of TA_5182 was thought to be more
ﬂexible and thus caters to escape from the cofactor. However,
when (R)-PAC was not present in the solution, it was seen that
TA_2799 converted all the PLP into PMP, while TA_5182 still
retained some of the PLP in the solution (Fig. 6, A and C).
TA_2799 carries out this conversion much faster compared to
TA_5182. There was no change in the PLP release proﬁle of
the TA_5182_G119N mutant (Fig. 6D). In the cofactor binding
pocket of TA_2799, as mentioned earlier, there are sub-
stitutions at the I259 in place of valine found in other
u-TAs.
The presence of the bulkier isoleucine residue may play a
signiﬁcant role in the release of the unbound external aldimine
PMP from the cofactor binding pocket, thus leading to rapid
conversion of PLP in the reaction mixture. However, the

mutant TA_2799_L322F shows conversion of PLP to PMP at a
slower rate than the wild-type enzyme, which indicates that
F322 has a key role in retaining the PMP to the enzyme active
site when the covalent bond has been broken (Fig. 6B).
The conversion of 5 mM ( R)-PAC in the presence of
10 mM (S)-MBA at different concentrations of the cofactor
PLP was also studied. TA_5182 showed efﬁcient conversion at
PLP concentrations of >200 mM, while TA_2799 required
>400 mM of the cofactor in the reaction mixture for>80%
conversion of (R)-PAC (Fig. 6E). The TA_2799_L322F mutant
was probed for its PLP dependency. Interestingly, this mutant
shows exceptionally good conversion efﬁciency, with >90%
conversion of (R)-PAC even at PLP concentrations lower than
100 mM( Fig. 6F).
Storage stability of the transaminases
The transaminase enzymes were stored at 30/C14C without any
external addition of PLP to measure the storage stability of the
enzymes. TA_2799 lost its activity within 24 h, while TA_5182
retained /C2440% of its activity for 48 h. The TA_5182_G119N
mutant showed better tolerance compared to its wild-type
counterpart, as it retained 20% of its activity after 72 h of
storage. The TA_2799_L322F mutant showed the best increase
in stability; it retained/C2470% of its activity even after 96h of

storage (Fig. 7). A possible explanation is that the mutant en-
zymes can capture the PLP cofactor from the cell lysate during
the process of puriﬁcation (as observed from the yellow color-
ation), which helps them maintain their tertiary structures. The
binding of the PLP molecule at the PLP binding site reduces the
conformational dynamics in the enzyme, as a result, the irre-
versible unfolding process is hindered.
Kinetic parameters of the enzymes and their mutants
We evaluated the kinetic parameters of the TA enzymes and
their mutants, as reported inTable 2.
u-TA enzymes are slow
in their catalysis of unnatural substrates (26). It was seen that
TA_2799 was/C2415 times faster than TA_5182 in terms of their
rates of catalysis, although the afﬁnity of TA_5182 for the
amine donor substrate(S)-MBA was/C246-fold greater than that
of TA_2799. The mutant TA_2799_L322F showed an
increased afﬁnity toward the amine donor; however, theVmax of
the enzyme and the turnover number were reduced, probably
because of the diminished movement of the dimeric interface.
However, the catalytic efﬁciency of the mutant enzyme was
calculated to be slightly greater than its wild-type counterpart.
The TA_5182_G119N mutant also showed/C243-fold increased
afﬁnity for the amine donor (S)-MBA compared to the wild-
type TA_5182; however, the turnover number of the mutant
enzyme was reduced. However, the catalytic efﬁciency of the
mutant enzyme was slightly enhanced due to the increased
afﬁnity toward the substrate (Table 2).
Discussion
Large-scale industrial applications of wild-type trans-
aminases are mostly limited by operational instability and
enzyme inactivation (10). Different approaches towards engi-
neering wild-type transaminases have shown promise for
increasing the yield of the desired amine product and
improving the stability of the enzyme (29). The dependence of
the enzyme on the PLP cofactor limits the applicability of these
enzymes since external addition of the cofactor increases
production costs (14). Moreover, cofactor binding enhances
the stability and the catalytic activity of the enzymes (15). Our
study hints at the possible factors that can lead to the devel-
opment of
u-TAs with enhanced afﬁnity for the cofactor as
well as improved thermal stability of the engineered enzymes.
Taking into account the structural and biochemical data on
TA_2799, TA_5182 and their variants, we discuss the impor-
tance of some of the structural features that modulate the
functional properties of
u-TAs.
Loop movement and structural orientation of the F321 in
TA_5182
The F321 (L322 in TA_2799) in TA_5182 is present in the
highly ﬂexible loop, also known as the “roof” of the PLP
binding site (11). This loop projects into the PLP binding
pocket upon PLP binding in the enzyme active site. Most apo-
crystal structures of
u-TAs have been determined with either
phosphate or a negatively charged ligand at the phosphate
binding pocket of the active site of the enzyme. As described
by Humble et al. in their study of
u-TA from C. violaceum
(11), the position of the loop is vastly different in the one of the
apo states of the enzyme (PDB ID: 4A6U), where the roof and
lid loops show highﬂexibility. In the apo-open state, the F321
in TA_5182 is initially positioned near the surface of the
enzyme, widening the substrate entry channel of the enzyme.
On PLP binding, this residue moves by/C2414 Å, orienting to-
ward the
a6 helix, which has S120 and S122 from the other
subunit (Fig. 8, A and B). This restructuring shifts S120 and
S122 from their initial positions, breaking their interactions
with E123ʹ, allowing S120 to coordinate the phosphate group
of PLP (Fig. 8C and Media S2). The F321 becomes stabilized
through p-stacking interactions, sandwiched between the
neighboring H319 and the E123 (Fig. 4C). In TA_2799, the
side chain of L322 is not bulky enough to cause this change,
and as a result, the phosphate group of PLP may not be as
tightly coordinated when the PLP molecule is bound to the
enzyme. L322 cannot form stacking interactions with H319
and G123 like aromatic amino acids. The effect of the L322F
mutation is observed in the thermal stability assay, as the
mutant enzyme has an increased/C246
/C14C melting temperature
(Tmapp) over the wild-type TA_2799. The mutant enzyme’s
afﬁnity towards the cofactor PLP is clearly enhanced as
observed by the yellow coloration of the enzyme solution post-
puriﬁcation and the characteristic peak for PLP at 420 nm seen
in the absorbance spectra of the puriﬁed enzyme, similar to the
report of Kwon et al. (30)( Figs. S4A and S5A). The mutant
enzyme efﬁciently converts ( R)-PAC to (1 R,2 S)-NE even
without external cofactor addition to the reaction mixture. We
expected PLP electron density in the crystal structure of the
TA_2799_L322F mutant; however, only sulfate ion density
could be seen. PLP may have been present at the active site,
but not covalently bound as an internal aldimine, and thus, the
sulfate ions from the crystallization mother liquor could
compete and displace the PLP molecule out of the active site
pocket.

enzymes after storage at 30/C14C for different time periods. The mutant
enzymes retain their activity better than their wild-type counterparts. The
TA_2799_L322F mutant retains /C2470% of its activity even after 96 h of
storage at 30 /C14C. Reactions were performed in triplicates. Individual data-
points are denoted by their corresponding symbol. Error bars represent
standard deviation of mean.

Evaluating the role of conserved Y322 in TA_5182 in
stabilizing PLP
In the same F321 roof loop, the adjacent Y322 of TA_5182
was also observed for its orientation after PLP binding. Y322 is
initially in a hydrogen bond with T127. As the loop rearranges,
Y322 moves /C2416 Å to position itself just below the PLP
molecule, and the hydroxyl group of Y322 interacts with the
main chain of the catalytic K289 ʹ, stabilizing the catalytic

residue (Fig. 8D and Media S3). This orientation of Y322
creates a ﬂoor beneath the PLP molecule, covering the deep
crater and allowing better orientation of the PLP molecule to
form the internal aldimine. In TA_2799, C324 occupies the
same position. C324 is not adequate to cover the crater, so the
crater in the crystal structure of TA_2799 isﬁlled with solvent
molecules instead (Fig. 8, E and F).
Based on this observation, we generated the TA_2799_
L322F_C324Y double mutant. However, this mutant showed
no yellow color after puriﬁcation, indicating that the afﬁnity of
this double mutant enzyme towards PLP was signi ﬁcantly
reduced in comparison to the single mutant 2799_L322F. The
enzyme precipitated within 72 h of incubation at 4
/C14C without
added cofactor or glycerol. TheKM of the double mutant for
(S)-MBA was 1.188 ± 0.122 mM, which indicates slightly
decreased afﬁnity of this mutant for the amino donor substrate
compared to the L322F mutant. TheVmax and kcat values also
decreased to 0.033 ± 0.001 U mg−1 and 1.381 ± 0.049 min−1,
respectively. There was a slight increase in the kcat/KM
(1.162 mM−1 min−1) in comparison to the wild-type TA_2799
(Table S4).
Since this mutation did not increase the af ﬁnity of the
enzyme for PLP, we mutated the enzyme TA_5182 at position
323, which is typically a conserved tyrosine or phenylalanine in
known bacterial transaminases, to cysteine as found in
TA_2799. However, this mutant showed no detectable activity
against (R)-PAC and thus was not studied further for its
implication in PLP binding.
Role of N119 in PLP binding in TA_5182
Along with the conserved F321 and E123 residues that
form an inter subunit network, the presence of the aspara-
gine residue plays a key role in increasing the afﬁnity of the
enzyme towards its cofactor ( Fig. 9, A and B). The F321
(L322 in TA_2799) is conserved in many annotated
u-TAs,
but current reports do not describe yellow color formation
due to the presence of PLP in the active site of the puriﬁed
enzyme. TA_5182 has phenylalanine at the same position
but shows a slight yellow color at concentrations>30 mg/
ml. We were interested to understand the reason behind the
enhanced afﬁnity of the 2799_L322F mutant towards the
cofactor. In the crystal structure of the TA_2799_L322F
mutant enzyme, the ND1 of the N121 residue maintains
hydrogen bonds with both OE1 and OE2 of E123, which
provides further stability to the anion-pi stacking interaction
between E123 and F322 in the same monomer. Apart from
that, the OE1 of E123 forms a hydrogen bond with OG of
S120, forming an extensive intersubunit network that

stabilizes the dimer (Fig. 9B). In the crystal structure of the
u-TA from C. violaceum (PDB ID: 4A6T) and V. ﬂuvialis
(PDB ID: 4E3R), a similar network is seen. The authors re-
ported that the puriﬁed protein appears yellow in solution,
supporting our observation. Evaluation of reported struc-
tures of
u-TAs from various Pseudomonas sp. revealed that
the u-TA from P. jensenni (PDB ID: 6G4B) harbors an
asparagine at this position, and has a Tmapp of 62 /C14C, quite
similar to the TA_2799_L322F mutant ( 26). All other re-
ported u-TAs from other Pseudomonas strains, like Pseu-
domonas str. AAC (PDB IDs: 5TI8 and 4UHM) ( 23, 25),
P. aeruginosa (PDB ID: 4B98) (22), and P. putida (PDB ID:
6HX9) (17) contain glycine at this position, like TA_5182.
Introducing glutamine at position 119 in TA_5182 (replacing
glycine) signi ﬁcantly increased the af ﬁnity of the enzyme
TA_5182 toward PLP, as observed from the yellow colora-
tion of the puriﬁed protein and spectral data (Figs. S4B and
S5B). In the crystal structure of the
u-TA from Pseudo-
monas ﬂuorescens (PDB ID: 6S54) (14), there is a leucine and
aspartate instead of the asparagine and glutamine as seen in
TA_2799. The authors reported that the V129N mutation at
the PLP binding pocket does not increase the PLP afﬁnity of
the protein. A possible reason for such observation can be
explained by our study, as the inter-subunit network as
described in Figure 9A is missing in the TA enzyme from
P. ﬂuorescens.
Conclusions
Our study on twou-transaminases (u-TAs) fromP. putida
KT2440 presents structural insights into the substrate and
cofactor binding pocket to understand the molecular basis of
PLP afﬁnity of bacterial transaminases. We solved the high-
resolution, cofactor-bound structure of TA_2799. We crys-
tallized TA_5182 in two distinct conformations and resolved
the structure of a highlyﬂexible loop that plays a direct role in
accommodation of the PLP cofactor in the active site of
u-TAs. This loop is not observed in most of the reported apo
forms of the enzyme. The structural information obtained
from these crystallographic models revealed key interactions
between the residues around the cofactor binding pocket. The
cumulative effects of these interactions enhance the binding
of the PLP cofactor, which in turn stabilizes the overall fold
and restricts the loop mobility. This is observed by the in-
crease in the melting temperature of the mutants of both the
enzymes, along with a signi ﬁcant enhancement in their
enzyme activity with(S)-MBA and (R)-PAC as substrates. In
TA_5182, F321 plays a crucial role in accommodating the
phosphate moiety of the cofactor molecule. Additionally, we
identiﬁed an asparagine residue (N115 in TA_2799) which
participates in hydrogen bonding interaction and forms an
intricate inter-subunit network that enhances the PLP afﬁnity
as well as the dimer stability of the transaminase enzymes.
Collectively, the structural data, mutations and biochemical
studies, the results of this study provide a detailed under-
standing of how to develop stable and efﬁcient
u-TAs for
biotransformation.
Experimental procedures
Lysis and elution buffers
Two types of buffers were prepared for protein puriﬁcation.
Lysis Buffer 1: 50 mM Sodium Phosphate (pH 8.0), 300 mM
NaCl; Lysis Buffer 2: 50 mM HEPES (pH 8.0), 300 mM NaCl.
The corresponding elution buffers for Ni-NTA afﬁnity chro-
matography additionally contained 250 mM imidazole.
TA_5182 was puriﬁed in Lysis Buffer 1 for setting up crys-
tallization trays. For all other studies, Lysis Buffer 2 was used.
Protein expression and puriﬁcation
The genes encodingP. aeruginosaKT2440
u-TAs TA_2799
and TA_5182 were inserted into pET43.1b expression vectors,
downstream of the 6x-His Tag and transformed intoE. coli
BL21 (DE3) cells by heat shock. Overnight-grownE. coli cul-
tures were transferred to 5 L bafﬂed Erlenmeyer ﬂasks con-
taining 1.5 L of LB (Luria-Bertani) broth supplemented with
100
mg/ml ampicillin and induced with 300mM isopropylb-D-
1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) at OD600 = 0.9 for protein
overexpression. Cells were harvested by centrifugation after
5 h of induction at 24
/C14C in mild shaking conditions (100 rpm),
resuspended in lysis buffer (L1 or L2), and homogenized by
sonication. The TA enzymes were puriﬁed via Ni-NTA afﬁnity
chromatography (HisTrap column, GE Healthcare) using the
buffers described above. The eluted fractions were concen-
trated to 15 mg/ml and buffer-exchanged into the corre-

TA_2799 and TA_5182
The sequences of TA_2799 and TA_5182 were procured
from UniProt database and aligned using Clustal Omega (31).
The conserved regions (highlighted in red) were analyzed us-
ing ESPript 3.0 web server (https://espript.ibcp.fr)( 32). To
analyze the conserved regions in bacterial fold type I
u-TAs,
sequences of bacterial fold type Iu-TAs available in the PDB
were assessed using Weblogo tool (https://weblogo.berkeley.
edu) and Clustal Omega (33).
Site-directed mutagenesis of TA enzymes
Each PCR reaction mixture consisted of DNA template
(pET 43.1b-TA_2799/TA_5182, 60 ng), forward and reverse
primers (10
mM, 6.75 ml each), 5X Q5 reaction buffer (10ml),
Q5 GC enhancer (10ml), Q5 DNA Polymerase (NEB) (1ml),
and nuclease-free water to aﬁnal reaction volume of 50ml.
PCR was performed as follows: 98/C14C for 10 min; 30 cycles of
98 /C14C for 1 min, 64 to 72/C14C (annealing) for 30 s, and 72/C14C for
10 min; ﬁnal extension at 72/C14C for 10 min 5ml of 5X Fast-
Digest Buffer (Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc) was added to the PCR
product and digested with 1 U of DpnI by incubation at 37/C14C
for 2 h. The digested product was used directly to transform
competent E. coli DH5
a cells via heat shock (2 min). The
transformed bacteria were plated on LB agar supplemented
with 100 mg/ml ampicillin and incubated overnight. Isolated
colonies were grown in LB medium containing ampicillin, and

plasmids were isolated using the Exprep Mini Plasmid Puriﬁ-
cation Kit (Genexy). Mutations were veriﬁed by sequencing,
and E. coli BL21 (DE3) cells were transformed using puriﬁed
plasmids. The primers used for the SDM studies are listed in
Table S5.
The mutant enzymes were overexpressed and puriﬁed using
the same procedure as described for the wild-type enzyme.
Enzyme activity assay
The triphenyl tetrazolium chloride (TTC)-based assay
reported by Sehlet al. (9) was used to investigate the activity
of the TA enzymes and their mutants. An 80
mlr e a c t i o n
volume containing 6.25 mM (R)-PAC and 12.5 mM (S)-MBA
was set up in reaction buffer (50 mM HEPES pH 8.0,
400
mM PLP). To this mixture, 20mlo fe n z y m e( 1 0m g / m l )
was added, to achieve ﬁnal concentrations of 5 mM amine
acceptor ((R)-PAC) and 10 mM of amino donor ((S)-MBA)
in a 100ml reaction volume. For the standard curve, 100ml
aliquots of ( R)-PAC in reaction buffer at concentrations
ranging from 1 mM to 5 mM were prepared. All enzyme
assays were performed in 96-well ﬂat-bottom microtiter
plates (Eppendorf). The plates were incubated in the dark for
2ha t3 0
/C14C. After incubation, all the samples were subjected
to 10-fold dilution with distilled water and 40 mlo fT T C
solution (1 mg/ml of TTC salt in a 1:3 v/v solution of 75%
ethanol and 1 M NaOH) was added. The reaction of TTC
with unreacted ( R)-PAC led to the formation of a red
tetrazolium salt, and its absorbance was measured at 510 nm
using a spectrophotometer (VantaStar BMG LabTech). All
assays were performed in triplicate.
To evaluate the substrate tolerance of the TA enzymes and
their mutants, enzyme activity was measured at varying con-
centrations of either amino donor or the amino acceptor while
keeping other parameters constant. To evaluate the efﬁciency
of the enzymes toward (R)-PAC, enzyme activity was measured
at varying concentrations of (R)-PAC at aﬁxed concentration
of 25 mM (S)-MBA and 1 mM PLP. Likewise, the efﬁciency of
the enzymes towards (S)-MBA was measured at varying con-
centrations of ( S)-MBA at a ﬁxed concentration of
5m M( R)-PAC and 1 mM PLP.
Temperature-dependent conversion of ( R)-PAC was
measured at different temperatures ranging from 25
/C14Ct o6 0/C14C.
The enzymes were incubated with the reaction mixture for
1.5 h, denatured by heating the assay mixture at 90/C14Cf o r5m i n ,
and ﬂash-cooled on ice. The denatured enzyme was removed
from the mixture by centrifuging at 10,000g for 3 min, and 10ml
of the supernatant was aliquoted for estimation of remaining
(R)-PAC.
For pH-dependent studies, different buffers corresponding
to a pH range from 5.0 to 9.5 were used to prepare the re-
action mixtures containing 6.25 mM (R)-PAC, 12.5 mM (S)-
MBA and 500
mM PLP. 20ml of the puriﬁed enzyme (2 mg/
ml) was added to each reaction and incubated for 1.5 h, de-
natured by heating the assay mixture at 90
/C14C for 5 min, and
ﬂash-cooled in ice. The denatured enzyme was removed from
the mixture by centrifuging at 10,000g for 3 min, and 10mlo f
the supernatant was aliquoted for estimation of remaining
(R)-PAC.
For kinetic studies, theﬁrst half of the transamination re-
action was measured using high-performance liquid chroma-
tography (HPLC). (S)-MBA (0– 5 mM) was used in the reaction
mixture containing 20 mM pyruvate as amino acceptor, 2 mM
PLP, and 200
mg of TA enzyme in 100ml reaction buffer. After
30 min of incubation at 30/C14C, the reaction was stopped by
heating the mixture to 90/C14C, and 400ml of ddH2O was added
to the reaction. The mixture was centrifuged at 16,000g for
20 min to remove the denatured enzyme. 10ml of the super-
natant was injected into the HPLC system (Jasco MD-4015) at
a ﬂow rate of 1 ml/min through an Agilent C-18 column. The
mobile phase consisted of 30:70 (v/v) acetonitrile:ddH
2O
mixture, and the amount of acetophenone produced was
measured at 245 nm. One unit (U) of enzyme activity denotes
the amount of enzyme required to produce 1mmol of aceto-
phenone per minute.
Time-dependent PLP conversion assay
To measure PLP conversion by the TA enzymes and their
mutants, 100 ml reactions were prepared in HEPES buffer pH
8.0, 1 mM PLP and 10 mM (S)-MBA. 100 mg of enzyme was
added per reaction. The assays were performed in 96-wellﬂat-
bottom microtiter plates (Eppendorf) and readings were taken
at 10-min intervals, for 2 h. The spectra were recorded from
300 nm to 500 nm.
For PLP dependent conversion of (R)-PAC, 100
ml reactions
were set up in 96-wellﬂat-bottom microtiter plates (Eppen-
dorf) consisting of 5 mM (R)-PAC, 10 mM (S)-MBA, 100mgo f
enzyme and different concentrations of PLP ranging from 0 to
1000
mM. The plates were incubated at 30/C14C for 4 h and the
remaining ( R)-PAC was measured using the TTC based
method mentioned earlier.
Storage stability assay
Freshly puri ﬁed TA enzymes and their mutants were
concentrated to 10 mg/ml and stored at 30/C14C in the dark for
96 h. Conversion of 5 mM ( R)-PAC in the presence of
10 mM (S)-MBA was measured at periodic intervals in 100ml
reactions as described earlier.
Crystallization
The enzymes TA_2799, TA_5182 and TA_2799_L322F
were concentrated to 15 to 20 mg/ml for setting up crystalli-
zation trials. In the case of TA_2799, additional glycerol at a
ﬁnal concentration of 12% was added to inhibit precipitation of
the enzyme. Crystallization screens were set up using the
sitting drop vapor diffusion method with an automated
Phoenix (Art Robins) robot (Protein Crystallography Facility,
IIT Bombay) in 96 well Intelliplate with a 1:1 mother liquor:
enzyme ratio. Various commercially available screens such as
PEG suite (Qiagen), PEG Rx (Qiagen), PEG Ion (Qiagen), In-
dex and JCSG+ (Molecular Dimensions) were used for crys-
tallization screening. The crystallization trays were incubated

at 22/C14C (except for TA_2799, which was incubated at 18/C14C)
in a vibration-free cooling incubator. The drops were regularly
monitored for crystal growth under a stereomicroscope.
Several conditions produced crystals, and the best crystals
were grown within 51 days (Fig. S6).
X-ray diffraction data collection and processing:
X-ray diffraction experiments were performed under liquid-
nitrogen cryoconditions at 100 K. A solution of 25% (v/v)
glycerol mixed with the respective mother liquor served as the
optimal cryoprotectant for freezing the crystals. The crystals
were brieﬂy soaked in their corresponding cryoprotectant so-
lutions using a nylon loop andﬂash frozen in a liquid nitrogen
stream at 100 K prior to data collection. Data sets of TA_2799
and TA_5182 (both open and closed states) were collected
using the rotation method, with 0.5
/C14rotation per frame at a
wavelength of 1.5418 Å using CuKa X-ray radiation generated
by a Rigaku Micromax-007HF generator equipped with R-Axis
IV++ detector at the Protein Crystallography Facility, IIT
Bombay. The crystal of TA_2799_L322F mutant was diffracted
at the INDUS-II synchrotron beamline PX-BL-21 equipped
with a MAR CCD detector, at RRCAT, Indore, India at a
wavelength of 0.9789 Å. The image frames of the data set were
indexed, integrated and scaled using XDS (34). The intensities
were converted to structure factors using F2MTZ and CAD in
CCP4 (35). The data collection and reﬁnement statistics are
summarized in Table 1.
Structure solution and reﬁnement
The structures of the open and the closed states of
TA_5182, and the PLP bound TA_2799 and the
TA_2799_L322F mutant were solved by the molecular
replacement method. The monomer of the crystal structure of
the
u-TA from Pseudomonas sp. (PDB ID: 5TI8) (61%
sequence identity) was used as the initial model for solving the
structure of TA_5182 in its open state. The initial phases were
obtained using the MORDA pipeline of the CCP4 online
server (36). For solving the structure of TA_2799, the crystal
structure of the
u-TA fromP. jensenni (PDB ID: 6G4B) (58%
sequence identity) served as the initial model. The closed
structure of TA_5182 was solved using the open structure
TA_5182 as the initial model. The model building was done by
visual inspection of electron density in COOT (37) and itera-
tive cycles of reﬁnement by REFMAC5 (38) or using phe-
nix.reﬁne ofPHENIX (39). The covalently bound PLP was built
in the F
o-Fc omit electron density map and subsequently
reﬁned in the PLP bound structure of TA_2799. The solvent
molecules and ions were subsequently added at peaks of
electron density higher than 3
s in s-A weightedFo-Fc electron
density maps while monitoring the decrease of Rfree and
improvement of the overall stereochemistry and Figure of
Merit (FOM). The RMSD values were calculated by super-
imposing the ﬁnal reﬁned structures onto their respective
templates used for structure solution [TA_5182 open state
(9J4Z) to 5TI8: 0.9 Å over 387 C
a atoms, TA_2799 (9J2K) to
6G4B: 0.9 Å over 451 Ca atoms].
Data availability
The atomic coordinates of TA_2799, TA_2799_L322F,
TA_5182 open and TA_5182 closed were deposited in the
Protein Data Bank (PDB) with accession codes 9J2K, 9J4Y,
9J4Z and 9J50 respectively. All relevant data are available from
