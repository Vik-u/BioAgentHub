Abstract
Background Hepatic fibrosis, a progressive fibrotic response to chronic liver injury, is characterized by excessive 
collagen deposition and impaired tissue repair. This pathological process leads to liver dysfunction and potential 
progression to irreversible cirrhosis or hepatocellular carcinoma. Currently, therapeutic options targeting the 
underlying mechanisms remain limited. Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), particularly herbal decoctions, have 
demonstrated efficacy in the treatment of hepatic fibrosis, although the precise mechanisms remain insufficiently 
elucidated.
Objective The objective of this study is to examine the mechanistic role of a TCM herbal decoction designed to 
promote Qi, blood circulation, and water excretion, in modulating the Nrf2/GPX4 signaling pathway and inhibiting 
ferroptosis in a rat model of hepatic fibrosis.
Methods A total of 17 Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into five groups. The blank control group (Group A) 
comprised three rats. Hepatic fibrosis was induced in the remaining rats, which were then randomized into four 
groups: the untreated fibrosis (Group B), TCM-treated (Group C), TCM combined with ferroptosis inhibitor (Fer-
1) (Group D), and TCM combined with Fer-1 and autophagy inhibitor (3-MA) (Group E). Groups A and B received 
equal volumes of normal saline. Serum and hepatic tissues were collected for analysis. Serum levels of aspartate 
transaminase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), malondialdehyde (MDA), and 
iron were measured. Liver tissues were subjected to hematoxylin and eosin staining and Masson’s trichrome staining 
to assess pathological changes. Protein expression levels of solute carrier family 7 member 11 (SLC7A11), nuclear 
factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2), and glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4) were assessed using western blot 
analysis.

Background
Hepatic stellate cells become excessively activated in 
response to chronic liver impairment caused by various 
factors. This activation leads to the substantial accumu -
lation of extracellular matrix, functioning as a reparative 
response to liver injury. Consequently, the normal liver 
architecture is disrupted, resulting in the development 
of hepatic fibrosis (HF) [ 1]. In the absence of timely and 
effective intervention, hepatic fibrosis may progressively 
deteriorate, ultimately leading to irreversible hepatic cir -
rhosis, and, in severe cases, hepatocellular carcinoma [ 2]. 
Therefore, implementing early therapeutic strategies to 
counteract hepatic fibrosis and prevent its progression to 
advanced stages is of paramount importance.
Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) offers distinctive 
advantages in the management of hepatic fibrosis. TCM 
has been extensively used in both the prevention and 
treatment of liver diseases, with its efficacy being widely 
recognized. In the context of hepatic fibrosis, TCM is 
notable for its multifaceted therapeutic approaches, tar -
geting the condition at various levels and through mul -
tiple mechanisms. Among these approaches, the herbal 
decoction promoting qi, blood circulation, and water 
excretion, developed by Professor Chen Kunshan based 
on clinical experience, has been used for the treatment of 
hepatic fibrosis and hepatic cirrhosis [ 3]. This formula -
tion has demonstrated efficacy in suppressing the activ -
ity of the Necdin-Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway and 
reducing the inhibitory effects of Wnt/β-catenin on per -
oxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma, thereby 
impeding the progression of hepatic fibrosis [ 4, 5]. How-
ever, the precise mechanisms through which this herbal 
decoction mitigates hepatic fibrosis remain to be fully 
elucidated.
Ferroptosis, first detected in 2012, is an iron-dependent 
form of regulated cell death [ 6]. This process primarily 
results from the excessive accumulation of intracellular 
lipid reactive oxygen species and iron-dependent deple -
tion or functional inactivation of glutathione peroxidase 
4 (GPX4) [ 7]. The fundamental mechanisms underlying 
ferroptosis involve increased iron accumulation, impair -
ment of the lipid repair system, and lipid peroxidation, 
ultimately leading to membrane disruption and apoptosis 
[8]. 
Aberrant iron metabolism remains a critical risk fac -
tor in the pathological progression from hepatic fibrosis 
to cirrhosis. Disrupted iron homeostasis is associated 
with metabolic dysregulation within hepatic tissues and 
the development of fibrosis [ 9]. Experimental studies in 
animal models have demonstrated the prominent role of 
transferrin in the progression of hepatic fibrosis in mice, 
particularly when induced by a diet high in iron content 
and exposure to carbon tetrachloride (CCl4). Further -
more, successful inhibition of ferroptosis ameliorates 
these pathological changes [10]. 
The Nrf2/GPX4 signaling pathway functions as a key 
antioxidant defense mechanism and is involved in the 
regulation of ferroptosis. Current studies have indicated 
that activation of the Nrf2/GPX4 signaling pathway can 
reduce iron accumulation, thereby mitigating cellular 
damage and apoptosis associated with ferroptosis. Spe -
cifically, activation of Nrf2 and upregulation of GPX4 
levels attenuate intracellular oxidative stress and inhibit 
ferroptosis in cardiomyocytes exposed to RSL3, a known 
ferroptosis inducer [ 11]. In animal models of non-alco -
holic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), metformin increases 
the expression of Nrf2, heme oxygenase-1, and GPX4. In 
contrast, the administration of brusatol, an Nrf2 inhibi -
tor, significantly reverses the positive regulatory effects 
of metformin on the Nrf2/GPX4 signaling pathway and 
reduces its hepatoprotective effects in NAFLD models. 
These findings indicate that metformin may exert its 
liver-protective properties by activating the Nrf2/GPX4 
signaling pathway and suppressing ferroptosis [ 12]. 
Therefore, activation of this pathway plays a key role in 
ferroptosis inhibition.
Preliminary theoretical investigations used network 
pharmacology and data mining techniques to examine 
Results Group B exhibited significant deterioration compared to the control group (p < 0.05), including marked 
hepatic lipidosis and fibrosis surrounding the hepatic portal vein. Elevated levels of AST, ALT, Fe2+, MDA, TNF-α, and 
collagen volume were observed (p < 0.05), along with significantly reduced expression of GPX4, Nrf2, and SLC7A11 
(p < 0.05). In contrast, Groups C, D, and E demonstrated significantly decreased levels of AST, ALT, Fe2+, MDA, TNF-α, 
and collagen volume (p < 0.05), accompanied by increased expression of GPX4, Nrf2, and SLC7A11 (p < 0.05) when 
compared to Group B.
Conclusion The herbal decoction demonstrated anti-fibrotic effects in a rat model of hepatic fibrosis, potentially 
through activation of the Nrf2/GPX4 signaling pathway and suppression of ferroptosis. These findings suggest 
a mechanistic basis for the observed efficacy of this TCM formulation and support its potential as a therapeutic 
candidate for hepatic fibrosis.

the therapeutic potential and mechanisms of TCM in 
regulating ferroptosis for the treatment of HF. Initial vali-
dation was conducted using molecular docking technol -
ogy, indicating that Milkvetch Root ( Radix Astragali seu 
Hedysari in Latin, Huang Qi in Pinyin), Salvia Root Radix 
(Radix Salviae Miltiorrhizae  in Latin, Dan Shen in Pin -
yin), and Suberect Spatholobus Stem ( Caulis Spatholobi

involved in modulating ferroptosis and ameliorating 
hepatic fibrosis. Among these, Milkvetch Root and Salvia 
Root Radix constitute the primary ingredient combina -
tion of the herbal decoction promoting qi, blood circula -
tion, and water excretion.
From these theoretical findings, this study aimed to 
elucidate the mechanisms by which the herbal decoction 
promoting qi, blood circulation, and water excretion mit-
igates HF. The study focused on assessing the biological 
effects of ferroptosis on hepatocytes in a rat model of HF. 
Additionally, the influence of the herbal decoction on HF 
progression, as well as the signaling pathways and molec-
ular targets involved was assessed. The objective of this 
study is to provide mechanistic insights that may guide 
the clinical application of this TCM formulation.

while the autophagy inhibitor, 3-MA, was acquired from 
Shanghai Yuanye Bio-Technology (Lot: J22HS188439). 
Xylene (Product No.: 33535) and absolute ethanol (Prod -
uct No.: 32061) were procured from Xilong Scientific. 
Additionally, 95% ethanol (Product No.: 32061) was 
sourced from the same manufacturer.
Methods
Grouping and handling of the rats
Grouping and model preparation: With the exception 
of the blank control group, all remaining groups were 
randomly assigned to five treatment groups and admin -
istered a 50% CCL4 vegetable oil solution, as outlined 
in Table  1. Group A consisted of healthy rats (Control), 
while Group B served as the HF model group (Model). 
Group C received the herbal decoction promoting qi, 
blood circulation, and water excretion (TCM). Group D 
was treated with the same herbal decoction in combina -
tion with the ferroptosis inhibitor (Fer-1) (TCM + Fer-1). 
Group E was administered the herbal decoction along 
with both the Fer-1 and the autophagy inhibitor (PI3K 
inhibitor: 3-MA) (TCM + Fer-1 + 3-MA).
Each group consisted of three rats, except for the con -
trol group (Group A) and the HF model group (Group B), 
which each included four rats. The injected solution ratio 
of CCL4 to olive oil was 1:1. Intraperitoneal injections 
were administered at a dose of 1.5 mL/kg, twice weekly, 
for four consecutive weeks. The control group received 
an equivalent volume of normal saline via intraperitoneal 
injection.
Three days prior to model induction, gastric gavage 
was initiated in Groups C, D, and E, and continued until 
48 h after model completion. Gavage administration was 
conducted twice daily at 12-hour intervals for four con -
secutive weeks. The volume of the gavage solution was 2 
mL per 100 g of body weight per day. In Groups A and B,

gastric gavage was replaced with an equivalent volume of 
normal saline.
Observation of hematoxylin and eosin (HE) and Masson’s 
trichrome staining
Liver tissues obtained from the rats were subjected to 
HE staining to assess pathological changes. Additionally, 
Masson’s trichrome staining was conducted to assess the 
presence of excessive collagen deposition within the liver 
tissues [13]. 
The primary reagents and dyes used included hema -
toxylin staining reagent (ZLI-9610, Beijing Zhong Shan-
Golden Bridge Biological Technology), eosin staining 
reagent (G1100, Beijing Solarbio Science & Technology), 
and Masson’s trichrome staining reagent (G1006, Ser -
vicebio Technology).
Tests using the fully automatic biochemistry analyzer
Serum samples, stored at -20  °C, were analyzed for 
aspartate transaminase (AST), alanine aminotransferase 
(ALT), and ferrous iron (Fe 2+) levels. The analyses were 
conducted using a fully automatic biochemical ana -
lyzer (BK-600, Biobase Biodustry, Shandong), following 
the instructions provided by the manufacturer with the 
reagent kit. The reagents used included AST (Product 
No.: 70110, Biobase Biodustry, Shandong), ALT (Prod -
uct No.: 70111, Biobase Biodustry, Shandong), and Fe2+ 
(Product No.: 70142, Shandong Biobase Biotechnology).
Detection of TNF-α expression levels using ELISA
Hepatic blood samples were collected from the rats and 
subjected to centrifugation to isolate the serum. The 
expression levels of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) 
in the serum samples were measured using an enzyme-
linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kit (E-EL-R2856c, 
Wuhan Elabscience Biotechnology), following the manu -
facturer’s instructions.
Detection of relevant protein expression levels using 
western blot method
Liver tissue proteins were extracted using RIPA cell lysis 
buffer (C1053, Beijing Pulley Gene Technology), and their 
concentrations were measured using the BCA method. 
Equal amounts of protein samples were then prepared 
for western blot analysis to quantify the levels of GPX4, 
NRF2, and SLC7A11 proteins [ 14, 15]. Protein bands 
were recorded using ultra-high sensitivity chemilumines-
cence imaging system instrument (Chemi DocTM XRS+, 
BIO-RAD Laboratories, Shanghai). Table  2 provides 
information about the antibodies used and their respec -
tive dilution factors.
Statistical analysis
All data are expressed as the mean ± standard deviation 
(x̅  ± s). Statistical analyses were conducted using SPSS 
20.0 software. Comparisons of numerical values among 
multiple groups were performed using one-way analy -
sis of variance, with the significance level set at α = 0.05 
(p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant). Graphs 
were generated using GraphPad Prism 9.0 software.
Results
Observation of pathological changes in rat liver tissues in 
each group
Figure 1 presents the results of HE staining. Liver tissues 
from rats in the blank control group indicated no signifi -
cant pathological changes. In Group A, the hepatic lob -
ule structure remained intact, with liver cells appearing 
uniform in size and hepatic cords arranged radially, with-
out evidence of inflammatory cell infiltration or collagen 
deposition.
In contrast, Group B demonstrated marked fatty 
lesions and fibrosis formation around the portal vein 
when compared to the blank control group. Following the 
administration of the therapeutic intervention, Groups 
C, D, and E exhibited a significant reduction in hepatic 
fibrosis compared to Group B [16]. 
The degree of inflammatory activity and liver tissue 
fibrosis was assessed using the METAVIR scoring system, 
as detailed in Table 3 [17]. 
Observation of HF using Masson’s trichrome staining
The experimental results are presented in Fig.  2; Table 4. 
A significantly higher collagen volume was observed in 
the liver tissue of Group B compared to the blank control 
group (p < 0.05). In contrast, Groups C, D, and E demon -
strated a significant reduction in collagen volume when 
compared to Group B (p < 0.05).

SLC7A11 proteins compared to the blank control group 
(p < 0.05), along with a slight decrease in NRF2 protein 
expression.
In contrast, Groups C, D, and E indicated significant 
increases in SLC7A11 protein levels compared to Group 
B ( p < 0.05), while a slight elevation in NRF2 protein 
expression was also observed. Furthermore, a significant 
increase in GPX4 protein expression was detected in 
Groups C and D ( p < 0.05). In Group E, GPX4 protein 
expression was decreased; however, the difference did 
not reach statistical significance (p > 0.05).
Discussion
HF represents a critical pathological process in the pro -
gression of various chronic liver diseases toward cirrhosis 
or hepatocellular carcinoma, serving as a common path -
way in liver injury [16]. CCl4 is widely used as an inducer 
of liver fibrosis due to its operational simplicity and high 
similarity to human hepatic fibrosis [ 18]. The adminis -
tration of CCl4 in rats induces sustained hepatic injury 
through recurrent and persistent necrosis of hepatocytes, 
ultimately leading to hepatic fibrosis.
In this study, significant pathological changes were 
observed in the liver tissues of rats in Group B following 
repeated administration of low-dose CCl4, administered 
twice weekly for four consecutive weeks. These findings 
confirmed the successful establishment of the hepatic 
fibrosis model. Serum levels of AST and ALT are widely 
recognized as sensitive biomarkers for assessing liver 
function impairment [19]. 
Experimental data indicated a significant increase in 
the activities of AST and ALT enzymes in Group B com -
pared to the control group, indicating substantial liver 
damage. In contrast, Groups C, D, and E demonstrated 
significantly lower serum levels of AST and ALT com -
pared to Group B, indicating that the herbal decoction

promoting qi, blood circulation, and water excretion 
exerts a protective effect in rats with hepatic fibrosis 
(Fig. 3; Table 5).
Oxidative stress and inflammatory responses are piv -
otal in the pathogenesis and progression of hepatic 
fibrosis. An imbalance in the regulation of oxidative free 
radicals can lead to their excessive generation, resulting 
in an abnormal elevation of MDA levels, a classical end 
product of lipid peroxidation [20]. According to research, 
it was indicated that ROS may contribute to the initiation 
and progression of fibrosis, implying that oxidative stress 
may exacerbate fibrotic changes [21–23]. 
The assessment of serum MDA levels is used as an 
indicator of oxidative damage, while the measurement of 
TNF-α levels in serum serves as a marker of inflamma -
tory response.
Nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) 
serves as a key regulatory factor within the cellular 
defense system against oxidative stress [ 24]. Studies have 
demonstrated that mulberry extract activates the Nrf2 
signaling pathway, thereby promoting the synthesis of 
antioxidant enzymes. This activation significantly sup -
presses oxidative stress, ferroptosis, and hepatic inflam -
mation, indicating its potential anti-fibrotic effects [25]. 
The Ginseng, Poria, and White Atractylodes Rhizome 
Powder formula has demonstrated therapeutic efficacy 
in reducing oxidative stress through the upregulation of 
the Nrf2 signaling pathway. This enhancement of Nrf2 
expression effectively inhibits ferroptosis in hepatocytes, 
contributing to the alleviation of alcoholic liver injury. In 
addition, the formula exhibits both antioxidant and anti-
inflammatory properties, further supporting its potential 
as a therapeutic intervention [26]. 
GPX4 is a monomeric glutathione peroxidase enzyme 
that plays a key role in reducing hydroperoxides within 
lipid membranes. This function establishes GPX4 as an 
essential component of the enzymatic defense system 
against lipid peroxidation [27]. 
Deficiency in GPX4 induces ferroptosis, a process char-
acterized by the inability of GPX4 to adequately degrade 
phospholipid hydroperoxides, such as arachidonic acid 
hydroperoxide. This deficiency leads to the accumulation 
of lipid peroxides, ultimately initiating ferroptosis [ 28, 
29]. 
Research has shown that irisin inhibits ferroptosis in 
hippocampal neurons by modulating the Nrf2/GPX4 sig -
naling pathway. This inhibition has been associated with

improvements in the inflammatory microenvironment 
observed in sepsis-associated encephalopathy [30]. 
This study aimed to assess the potential therapeutic 
effects of an herbal decoction promoting qi, blood cir -
culation, and water excretion in the prevention of HF. 
The investigation focused on elucidating the underlying 
mechanisms, particularly the activation of the NRF2/
GPX4 signaling pathway, to inhibit hepatocytic ferropto -
sis in a rat model of CCL4-induced HF.
The experimental results indicated a significant reduc -
tion in the protein expression levels of NRF2 and GPX4 
in Group B compared to the control group. In con -
trast, Groups C, D, and E displayed varying degrees of 
increased expression levels of NRF2 and GPX4 when 
compared to Group B, with the exception of Group E.
SLC7A11, the core subunit of the System Xc- com -
plex, plays a substantial role in maintaining cellular redox 
balance by mediating the import of cystine, which is 
essential for glutathione (GSH) synthesis. Cysteine, syn -
thesized from cystine, acts as a key antioxidant that miti -
gates lipid peroxidation, thereby lowering lipid peroxide 
levels and preventing ferroptosis [31]. 
The interaction between Beclin-1 and SLC7A11 rep -
resents a key regulatory step within the System Xc- 
structure. This interaction leads to the suppression of 
SLC7A11, resulting in the inhibition of ferroptosis, a pro-
cess facilitated by phosphorylation at serine residues 90, 
93, and 96 [ 32]. Disruption of hepatic iron metabolism 
can lead to iron overload, which may exacerbate ferrop -
tosis [33, 34]. 
The experimental results demonstrated a significant 
decrease in the expression level of SLC7A11 protein 
and a significant increase in iron levels in Group B com -
pared to the control group. In contrast, Groups C, D, 
and E exhibited significantly higher expression levels of 
SLC7A11 protein and a notable reduction in iron levels 
when compared to Group B. These findings indicate that 
the herbal decoction promoting qi, blood circulation, 
and water excretion effectively suppresses the onset of 
hepatic ferroptosis.
Emerging evidence increasingly supports the notion 
that ferroptosis is closely associated with autophagy, a 
fundamental process for maintaining cellular homeo -
stasis. Dysregulated autophagy or enhanced lysosomal 
activity results in the accumulation of iron ions and lipid

peroxides within cells, thereby promoting ferroptosis 
[35]. The autophagic degradation of ferritin facilitates the 
release of Fe3+, leading to an increase in intracellular free 
iron levels and subsequently triggering ferroptosis. Fur -
thermore, suppression or deletion of nuclear receptor 
coactivator 4 (NCOA4) expression, along with the inhibi-
tion of autophagy, has been found to significantly reduce 
ferroptosis incidence [36]. 
Aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator-like 
protein 1 (ARNTL1), a key protein involved in circa -
dian rhythm regulation, undergoes selective degradation 
through p62-mediated autophagy. This degradation 
mechanism results in increased expression of Hypoxia-
inducible factor hydroxylase 1 (PHD1), promoting lipid 
peroxidation and consequently facilitating ferroptosis 
[37, 38]. 
Additionally, studies have revealed that a reduction in 
GSH levels is associated with increased expression of the 
autophagy marker protein microtubule-associated pro -
tein 1 light chain 3, heightened formation of autophagic 
vacuoles, and pronounced activation of autophagy [ 33, 
39]. 
However, further investigation is required to eluci -
date how the herbal decoction promoting qi, blood cir -
culation, and water excretion influences ferroptosis and 
contributes to the improvement of liver fibrosis in rats 
through the modulation of autophagy.
Conclusion
The herbal decoction promoting qi, blood circulation, 
and water excretion demonstrates potential in mitigat -
ing oxidative stress and inflammation, regulating iron

contribute to the inhibition of hepatocytic ferroptosis, 
suggesting therapeutic benefits in managing HF. The 
underlying mechanism involves the activation of the 
NRF2/GPX4 signaling pathway, which suppresses hepa -
tocytic ferroptosis and offers protective effects in rats 
with HF.
However, limitations related to the small sample size 
and the unclear role of autophagy signaling in ferroptosis 
inhibition warrant further investigation. Additional stud -
ies are required to clarify these aspects and to validate 
the observed therapeutic effects.
