Pyridoxal 5’-phosphate (PLP)-dependent enzymes are a versatile
class of biocatalysts and feature a variety of industrial
applications. However, PLP is light sensitive and can cause
inactivation of enzymes in certain light conditions. As most of
the PLP-dependent enzymes are usually not handled in dark
conditions, we evaluated the effect of visible light on the
activity of PLP-dependent enzymes during production as well
as transformation. We tested four amine transaminases, from
Chromobacterium violaceum, Bacillus megaterium, Vibrio fluvialis
and a variant from Arthrobacter species as well as two lysine
decarboxylases, from Selenomonas ruminantium and the LDCc
from Escherichia coli. It appeared that five of these six enzymes
suffered from a significant decrease in activity by up to 90 %
when handled in laboratory light conditions. Surprisingly, only
the amine transaminase variant from Arthrobacter species
appeared to be unaffected by light exposure and even showed
an activation to 150 % relative activity over the course of 6 h
regardless of the light conditions.
Introduction
Pyridoxal 5’-phosphate (PLP) is the active form of vitamin B
6
which is involved in numerous key metabolic pathways in living
cells.
[1]
Since mid of the 20
th
century, it is known, that PLP serves
as a cofactor for enzymatic reactions,
[2]
including decarboxyla-
tion, de- and transamination, racemization, elimination and
replacement.
[3]
The unique structure, consisting of a hetero-
aromatic pyridine ring and three functional residues, enables
PLP to be a versatile coenzyme.
[4]
In PLP-dependent enzymes,
PLP is usually covalently bonded to a conserved lysine residue
in the enzymatic active site by its aldehyde group. This Schiff-
base structure is commonly referred to as internal aldimine. In
the first step of a catalytical reaction, the internal aldimine
breaks up, when PLP forms a new bond with the amino group
of the respective substrate. This newly formed structure was
declared as external aldimine.
[5]
Upon breakage of a bond to
the amino group α-carbon, a stabilized carbanionic intermedi-
ate is formed, which is supposed to be existent in all PLP-
dependent enzymes.
[6]
The subsequent reaction depends on
the type of enzyme involved, but mechanistic similarities
provide a link between different PLP-dependent enzymes.
Sorting these enzymes according to fold types, sequence
similarities, regio- and stereospecificities allows a detailed
classification.
[7–10]
The most prominent structure is fold-type I,
which is present mostly in amine transaminases (ATAs) and
decarboxylases.
[8]
As they catalyze a variety of reactions, PLP-
dependent enzymes are extraordinary biocatalysts, which puts
them in focus for industrial applications
[11]
and makes them
subject of a number of structure-function relationship
studies.
[4,12–15]
An important point, when employing PLP-
dependent enzymes, is, that PLP is light sensitive and has
chromophoric properties.
[16]
Thus, it easily degrades upon
illumination. The light-dependent degradation process of free
PLP (1) had been analyzed in detail and appeared to be oxygen
dependent with the main photoproducts being 4-pyridoxic acid
5’-phosphate (2) and a benzoin like PLP dimer (3) as depicted in
Figure 1.
[17,18]
However, it was stated, that the dimer (3) was
formed later during the isolation process by oxidation of the
originally formed pyridoin of PLP.
[18]
It already had been
suggested, that PLP should be protected from illumination,
especially when in solution.
[18]
PLP even has the ability to act as
a specific photosensitizer. When exposed to light, it has been
reported, that PLP can irreversibly inactivate enzymes, when
bound as internal aldimine, as in this case histidine residues in

the enzymatic active site were destroyed.
[16]
In the following,
PLP had been applied for the intended photoinactivation of
aldolases from rabbit muscles or spinach leaves.
[19,20]
During the
attempt to increase the thermal and storage stability of the
amine transaminase from Chromobacterium violaceum (CvATA),
Chen and co-workers showed, that after three days of
incubation in light, the enzyme was completely inactive, while
the enzyme incubated in the dark retained 64 % residual
activity.
[21]
When high concentrations of PLP (5 mM) were
added, the residual activity after three days could be improved
in both setups. When analyzing the stability of the amine
transaminase from Vibrio fluvialis (VfATA), the addition of 5 mM
PLP led to an increased stability in the dark, while in the light,
the enzyme was completely inactive after five days of
incubation.
[22]
These findings indicate that a light-dependent
inactivation of PLP-dependent enzymes is an important issue.
However, the inactivation process may vary in different PLP-
dependent enzymes and is connected to the unique PLP
binding abilities of the respective enzymes. As the loss of the
cofactor is a critical limitation to PLP-dependent enzymes,
[23]
the
characterization and optimization of the PLP binding affinity in
general has been subject of a number of studies.
[24–27]
In another
set of studies, it has been shown, that upon photoexcitation,
PLP rapidly forms a reactive triplet state.
[28]
Interestingly, when
bound to the active site lysine of an aspartate amine trans-
aminase, blue light pulses actually supported the formation of
the carbanionic intermediate within microseconds, resulting in
an increased catalytic activity.
[29–31]
A similar photoactivation has
already been described for the enzymatic decarboxylation of 5-
hydroxytryptophan.
[32]
Although some studies exist, to the best
of our knowledge, the effect of light on the stability of PLP-
dependent enzymes has not been in scientific focus in the first
place. As PLP-dependent enzymes during production and use
are presumably most of the time not handled in dark
conditions, the question arises, if the influence of light does
generally reduce the catalytic activity of PLP-dependent
enzymes due to the photoactive properties of PLP. Here, we
tested the effect of visible light on the catalytic activity of a
number of PLP-dependent enzymes, such as four ATAs and two
lysine decarboxylases (LDCs). Both enzyme classes are interest-
ing targets for different industrial fields and frequently applied.
ATAs catalyze the transfer of an amino group from an amino
donor to an acceptor, which is shown in Scheme 1A for the
conversion of (rac)-α-methylbenzylamine ((rac)-α-MBA; 4) and
pyruvate (5) to acetophenone (6) and alanine (7). In the last
years, ATAs have gained attention for the production of high
value chemicals, especially chiral amines, which are versatile
building blocks for pharmaceuticals.
[33–35]
LDCs produce cadav-
erine (1,5-diamino-pentane; 9) from the decarboxylation of L-
lysine (8; Scheme 1B). Cadaverine is a promising compound
with many bioactivities and of special interest for the polymer
industry, as it represents an innovative platform chemical for
the production of bio-based polyamides.
[36–38]
In our experi-
ments, we employed the CvATA
[39]
and the VfATA
[40]
as well as
the ATA from Bacillus megaterium (BmATA)
[41]
and a variant of
the ATA from Arthrobacter species (AsATAmut11). The AsATA-
mut11 is a special enzyme, which was engineered to produce
the antidiabetic compound sitagliptin in a manufacturing
setting.
[42]
Further we tested the LDC from Selenomonas
ruminantium (SrLDC)
[43]
as well as the LDCc from Escherichia coli
(EcLDC).
[44]
After determining strong inactivation of the CvATA
with intense blue light illumination, we analyzed the effect of
standard laboratory light conditions (combined electric and sun
light) on all of the mentioned PLP-dependent enzymes,
involving the enzyme production and reactions in varying light
and buffer setups. This article is intended to sensitize
researchers working with PLP-dependent enzymes to consider
the light factor when optimizing reaction conditions and even
when producing the enzymes.
Results and Discussion
Blue light inactivation of the CvATA
As PLP absorbs specifically in the blue light region of the visible
light spectrum, around 440 nm, it has been reported, that PLP
can be stimulated by blue light illumination.
[28,29]
To determine
changes in the spectrum of free PLP during illumination in
different setups, 0.1 mM PLP solutions in HEPES buffer (pH 7.5)
were subjected to illumination by a single blue LED (~ 60 mW/
cm
2
) or by ordinary laboratory and sunlight (~ 0.25 mW/cm
2
;
Figure 2A). In the following, light conditions consisting of
laboratory and sunlight are referred to as “normal light
conditions”. The spectrum of the PLP solution kept in the dark
did not change over the course of 60 min and showed an
absorption maximum at 388 nm. This indicated, that PLP is
stable in dark conditions. In both illuminated setups, the
spectrum of PLP changed with a new maximum being formed
at 288 nm. This photoproduct was isolated by Morrison and
Long and was identified as PLP dimer, which reportedly is
produced in a benzoin-like self-condensation.
[18]
However, the
PLP spectrum after blue light illumination showed another peak
at 320 nm, which supposedly depicts the photoproduct 4-
pyridoxic acid 5’-phosphate, described by Reiber.
[17]
It seems
like the degradation of PLP and the photoproducts formed over
the time-course vary depending on the illumination setup.

Thus, we observed a main peak appearing at 308 nm in the PLP
solution after 5 min illumination with normal light, while after
5 min of blue light illumination most of the PLP dimer was
already formed (Figure SI.2). Seemingly, blue light has a
particularly strong degrading effect on PLP.
As reported by Chen, et al.
[21]
for an illumination test
employing the CvATA, the enzyme lost 100 % of its activity after
incubation in light for three days. Here, we tested the CvATA in
an illumination experiment using specific high-intensity blue
light exposure (Figure 2B). The enzymatic reaction was initiated
in the dark for 10 min before the reaction mixture was
subjected to blue light illumination. When the illumination was
started, the activity of the CvATA started to decrease signifi-
cantly within minutes. After 30 min, corresponding to 20 min of
blue light exposure, 100 % of the enzyme activity was lost. As
none of the other reaction components besides PLP showed a
response to blue light exposure (Figure SI.3), it is proposed, that
the inactivation effect is mediated by degraded PLP, which acts
as a photosensitizer being primarily triggered by blue light.
Thus, it could be demonstrated, that it is possible under certain
circumstances to inactivate PLP-dependent enzymes completely
by illumination with blue light in only 20 min.
Comparison of the activity of PLP-dependent enzymes in
three light setups
From Figure 2B could be concluded, that blue light had a
strong deactivating effect on PLP-dependent enzymes, but we
observed as well in Figure 2A, that after 60 min of illumination,
the degradation of free PLP in solution was similar in blue and
in normal light. Thus, it seems likely, that illumination with
normal light (sun and electric light) might have a strong effect
on the activity of PLP-dependent enzymes as well. On one
hand, it was not commonly described, that PLP-dependent
enzymes and PLP were handled under dark conditions. On the
other hand, PLP-dependent enzymes are not generally inactive,
as plenty of articles describe successful transformations with
PLP-dependent enzymes without protecting the enzyme from
light. This means, if PLP-dependent enzymes are negatively
affected by normal light (~ 0.25 mW/cm
2
) during their produc-
tion and in enzymatic reactions, the effect is not as drastic as
compared to specific blue light illumination (~ 12 mW/cm
2
). To
evaluate the effect of normal light on the activity of PLP-
dependent enzymes, each enzyme was tested in three light
conditions (Figure 3). i) In dark conditions (Figure 3A), the
protein production, the purification of the target proteins and

the final enzymatic reactions were conducted in darkest
possible conditions. To prevent degradation, PLP solutions were
handled solely in the dark as well. Before the respective
enzymatic reactions were started, PLP solutions were incubated
for 3 h and enzyme solutions for 1 h on ice in dark conditions
using ten times concentrated stock solutions to keep it
consistent with the following setup. ii) In normal light con-
ditions (Figure 3B), production, purification and enzymatic
reaction were performed under the influence of sun and electric
light, representing general laboratory (normal) light conditions.
Prior to the light exposed enzymatic reactions, PLP solutions
were incubated for 3 h and enzyme solutions for 1 h on ice in
normal light conditions using ten times concentrated stock
solutions, to mimic standard waiting times in laboratory
procedures, which might facilitate degradation of PLP and
inactivation of PLP-dependent enzymes (Figure 3D). iii) The last
tested setup comprised mixed conditions (Figure 3C), where
expression and purification were performed in normal light
conditions equal to setup B, but the final enzymatic reactions
were done in dark conditions equal to setup A, using dark PLP
solutions as well. Thus, it ought to be evaluated, if PLP-
dependent enzymes are able to regenerate some of their
activity, which they might have lost during light exposure.
The activity of six PLP-dependent enzymes in normal light
and mixed conditions is depicted relative to their activity in the
dark (Figure 4). Due to variations in their response to the
different light setups, the enzymes were grouped in three
categories. The CvATA and the BmATA (Figure 4A) both showed
a significant but moderate response to light exposure.
Compared to their activity in dark conditions, the CvATA
exhibited 40 % reduced activity in light conditions and the
BmATA was 30 % less active. In mixed conditions, when
undegraded PLP was added for the initial rate reaction, the
CvATA and the BmATA were able to restore 30 % to 50 % of the
activity lost during previous light exposure.
We could not detect any aggregates or precipitates in the
reaction mixture after completed light exposure, which would
indicate an unfolding of the illuminated enzymes. The PLP-
dependent enzymes in Figure 4B were not influenced by
illumination in a negative way. In this particular test, the activity
of the VfATA appeared to be within the range of the error for all
three illumination setups. Interestingly, the AsATAmut11
showed significant activation in normal light and in mixed
conditions. The activity seemed to be about 50 % higher,
relative to the dark conditions. The last category (Figure 4C)
comprises the LDCs, which show a very intense response to
illumination. The EcLDC appeared to be 85 % less active in the
applied light setup compared to the handling in dark conditions
and the SrLDC lost 45 % of activity. In mixed conditions, the
SrLDC could restore 50 % of the lost activity but for the EcLDC
the increase was only about 10 %. As the EcLDC is a relevant
enzyme for industry applications,
[37,45,46]
the limitation of light
exposure to an absolute minimum seems to be critical and
might allow for ten times higher activity levels. Of the six PLP-
dependent enzymes, that were tested in different light
conditions, four showed a significant decrease in activity due to
light exposure. These four enzymes were all able to regenerate
some of the activity, when undegraded PLP was added for the
enzymatic reaction. Thus, the inactivation seen in normal light
conditions, cannot only be caused by the photosensitizing
effect, that was described by Rippa and Pontremoli,
[16]
as this
effect was described to be irreversible. Instead, it appears that

standard deviation of technical triplicates.

one of the factors involved in restoring activity is the ability of
the enzyme to exchange PLP in the active site. When the
enzyme has a lower binding affinity towards PLP, PLP in a
certain stage of degradation could be easier replaced with fresh
PLP than in enzymes with a strong binding affinity for PLP. It
has been reported, that the CvATA has a relatively low binding
affinity for PLP,
[21]
which could explain, that the recovery of
activity in the mixed illumination condition with fresh PLP is
relatively high (Figure 4A). A similar high recovery rate was seen
here for the SrLDC (Figure 4C), which is reported to have a
flexible binding site and a low PLP affinity as well.
[47]
However,
proving this theory requires further analysis, while the evalua-
tion of the cofactor binding in PLP-dependent enzymes is
subject to other articles.
[12,22,23,26]
The combined effect of different buffer systems and
illumination on the activity of PLP-dependent enzymes
The changing spectrum of a PLP solution in HEPES buffer after
1 h normal light exposure has been shown previously (Fig-
ure 2A). As a range of other buffers are commonly applied in
biocatalysis, we tested, if the already observed changes in the
absorption of PLP relate to other buffers after 3 h of normal
light exposure as well (Figure 5). Besides HEPES buffer (Fig-
ure 5B), we also tested 0.1 mM PLP solutions in water (Fig-
ure 5A), 100 mM (pH 7.5) potassium phosphate buffer (Fig-
ure 5C), TEA buffer (Figure 5D) and TRIS buffer (Figure 5E). The
PLP solution in water (Figure 5A) showed a lower absorption in
general, but the overall pattern is comparable to HEPES buffer,
where the main peak of free PLP at 388 nm in the dark shifted
to 288 nm, indicating the formation of the PLP dimer.
Interestingly, a small peak at 288 nm could already be seen in
the dark sample, suggesting, that some PLP molecules have
degraded, likely caused by the absence of a stabilizing buffer.
Though, it has been reported, that pH changes might have an
influence on the detection of the photoproducts of PLP.
[17]
Changes in the spectrum of a PLP solution in phosphate buffer
(Figure 5C) are an exact representation of the changes seen in
HEPES buffer, assuming the degradation mechanisms are equal.
However, the degradation in TEA buffer (Figure 5D) seemed to
behave differently, as the main photoproduct after 3 h of
normal light exposure appeared to be the 4-pyridoxic acid 5’-
phosphate (320 nm). Based on this spectrum, the PLP dimer
(288 nm) was marginally formed. The spectra of a PLP solution
in TRIS buffer (Figure 5E) exhibited a completely different
pattern. After dark incubation, the main peak of PLP could not
be observed at 388 nm but at 410 nm. Further, there was
another prominent peak at 275 nm. After 3 h of light exposure,
the spectrum of free PLP in TRIS buffer did barely change,
revealing only a minor additional peak at 340 nm. Even when
the normal light exposure was extended to 24 h, the spectrum
did not exhibit any other changes. This could either imply, that
TRIS buffer is able to prevent the degradation of PLP in solution,
or that the combination of the TRIS buffer salt and PLP create
an overlying absorbance, which covers the detection of certain
photoproducts. Since TRIS buffer was used for protein purifica-
tion in previous experiments (Figure 4), it would be very
beneficial to maintain the integrity of PLP during the purifica-
tion process.
The most interesting buffers to test for enzymatic reactions
with different light setups compared to HEPES buffer appeared
to be potassium phosphate buffer and TRIS buffer, as these are
all compatible with our enzymes. From the spectra (Figure 5) it
was expected that the enzyme inactivation in phosphate buffer
might be similar to HEPES buffer, while the inactivation in TRIS
buffer might be prevented. Therefore, the specific activities in
dark and normal light conditions were tested in 100 mM
(pH 7.5) HEPES, TRIS and phosphate buffer for the CvATA and
the VfATA (Figure 6). Protein purification was performed using
the respective buffers as well, except for the protein used for
the transformations in HEPES buffer.
As protein purification in HEPES buffer was not possible in
this case due to protein degradation, the enzymes used for the
transformation in HEPES buffer were purified in TRIS buffer as
well. Regarding the CvATA, the inactivation was similar in the
three tested buffers. As already observed in Figure 4A, after
light exposure in HEPES buffer, the activity was reduced by
Figure 5. Comparison of spectra from 0.1 mM PLP solution in water (A), or different buffers (100 mM, pH 7.5 each), such as HEPES (B), potassium phosphate
(C), TEA (D) or TRIS (E) after 3 h incubation on ice in the dark (*) or with normal light exposure of ~ 0.25 mW/cm

40 % compared to the activity under dark conditions. TRIS
buffer could not prevent the inactivation of the CvATA, under
normal illumination the activity was reduced by 30 %. Thus, the
activity decrease due to light exposure was slightly less
compared to HEPES buffer, but still present. Compared to the
other buffers, the specific activity in TRIS buffer was reduced
under dark conditions. In phosphate buffer, the CvATA showed
a significantly higher specific activity under dark conditions.
However, the inactivation after normal light exposure was
significantly higher (50 %) as well. The VfATA did not show any
inactivation after light exposure in HEPES buffer previously
(Figure 4B), which could be confirmed in this experiment
(Figure 6). However, illumination of the VfATA in TRIS buffer and
in phosphate buffer, resulted in an inactivation by 50 %
compared to the dark approaches. The specific activity in
phosphate buffer was again highest in relation to the other
buffers. While the light-mediated inactivation of the CvATA was
similar in all three buffer systems, the VfATA exhibited strong
inactivation in TRIS and phosphate buffer, however, HEPES
buffer seemed to prevent light-mediated inactivation exclu-
sively in case of the VfATA. About any interaction between
HEPES buffer and the VfATA, which might facilitate a higher
stability of PLP in the enzymatic active site, can only be
speculated. It can be assumed, that the application of TRIS
instead of phosphate buffer during the production process of
the enzymes does not prevent light mediated inactivation.
Thus, it has been shown, that the specific activity of enzymes
varies depending on the employed buffer system. In this case,
highest specific activities were achieved in potassium
phosphate buffer under dark conditions. When comparing the
enzyme activities under light exposure in TRIS buffer with the
activity in dark phosphate buffer, we could demonstrate, that
the specific activity of PLP-dependent enzymes could be
increased about four-fold, by adjusting buffer and light
conditions.
Activation of the AsATAmut11
Another special case is represented by the AsATAmut11. From
Figure 4B could be recognized, that after 1 h of incubation in
normal light and mixed conditions, the AsATAmut11 showed
drastically increased activity. These results were re-evaluated by
testing the activation of the AsATAmut11 in normal light
conditions for a period of 6 h in HEPES buffer (Figure 7). The
activity in dark conditions, incubated for 6 h, served as control.
A key observation was that the previously noted activation did
not only occur in illuminated conditions, but as well in dark
conditions. Thus, activation was not by light, but by incubation
of the AsATAmut11 in buffer. Accordingly, the cause of
activation in our case is different from the case of Hill, et al.
who used a special illumination setup for the activation of a
PLP-dependent aspartate aminotransferase.
[28–30]
In dark condi-
tions (HEPES buffer), the activity increased by 35 % within 6 h of
incubation relative to the activity after 0 h of incubation. In
normal light conditions (HEPES buffer), the activity seemed to
increase until a maximum activity of 138 % was reached after
6 h of incubation. However, after 24 h of incubation in normal
light conditions, the activity had decreased again, reaching a
level of 125 % of activity, while in dark conditions the activity
remained at the same level over the course of 24 h of
incubation (Figure SI.4). As the results with light exposure come

with a notable error, it remains unclear if light has an additional
beneficial effect on the activation of the AsATAmut11. Another
experiment with 30 min of targeted blue light illumination, as
follow up to 6 h incubation in dark conditions, had no negative
impact on the activity level of the AsATAmut11 likewise,
highlighting the superior stability of this enzyme under light
exposure. As in case of the VfATA a variation in the reaction
buffer led to different inactivation characteristics, the activation
of the AsATAmut11 in HEPES buffer was compared to
phosphate buffer (Figure 7). In previous experiments employing
the CvATA and the VfATA (Figure 6), the application of 100 mM
potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.5) mediated a higher specific
activity in the dark, compared to other buffers, combined with a
strong deactivating effect upon illumination (Figure 6). In
phosphate buffer, the activation of the AsATAmut11 in dark as
well as in light conditions was drastically reduced. After 3 h of
incubation in dark phosphate buffer, the relative activity was
increased by 15 %. For samples taken after 3 h of incubation in
light or after 6 h incubation in light and dark, the activation of
the AsATAmut11 in phosphate buffer was limited to an increase
of 5 %. Thus, by employing phosphate buffer the activity of the
AsATAmut11 could not be further increased. After seeing the
general activation in the dark over time for the AsATAmut11,
we also checked the activity of CvATA over the course of 6 h of
incubation in 100 mM HEPES buffer (pH 7.5) under dark
conditions, however, an activation could not be noticed
(Figure SI.5). Moreover, the relative activity slightly declined by
5 % during the incubation period. The incubation over time was
performed using ten times concentrated enzyme stock solu-
tions (10 mg/mL for AsATAmut11, 5 mg/mL for CvATA). It has
been previously shown for the CvATA, that the residual activity
of the enzyme could be increased by 10 %, when a 5 mg/mL
enzyme solution was incubated in 50 mM HEPES buffer (pH 8.2)
for 24 h. In this study by Chen et al., the effect was not seen for
the incubation of enzyme solutions with lower
concentrations.
[48]
Similar to the activation of the AsATAmut11
described herein, an activation by 29 % was reported for the
incubation of freshly purified CvATA overnight in 50 mM HEPES
buffer (pH 8.3). It was discussed, that the result might be due to
complete dimerization to form active enzyme.
[49]
Further, it is
known, that the supplementation of PLP (> 0.25 mM) as well as
the addition of co-solvents such as DMSO, methanol and
glycerol can increase the stability of ATAs in aqueous
solutions.
[22,39,48,50]
Thus, enzyme activation seems to be depend-
ent on the selected ATA and the incubation conditions such as
buffer concentration and pH. However, an inactivation by light
of the AsATAmut11 could not be observed, here. Certainly, the
AsATAmut11 appeared to exhibit extraordinary stability in the
applied reaction setups. Even through intense and targeted
blue light illumination and after 24 h of normal light exposure,
the enzyme still displayed increased activity of about 125 %.
Besides the conversions achieved in sitagliptin synthesis,
[42]
the
high stability to light and the activation observed in this work
are great features of the AsATAmut11. However, the mechanism
which enables the AsATAmut11 to maintain high stability in
various light and reaction setups has yet to be evaluated, but it
could be associated with the introduced mutations.
[42]
Conclusion
Herein, we evaluated the effect of visible light on the activity of
six PLP-dependent enzymes. We could observe that the photo-
degradation of free PLP in solution under normal light exposure
(sun and electric light) is similar to specific blue light
illumination. By exposing the amine transaminase CvATA to
targeted and highly energetic blue light illumination, we were
able to inactivate the enzyme completely within 20 min of
illumination. Tests with PLP-dependent enzymes in three differ-
ent light setups revealed, that even under normal light
exposure the CvATA and the BmATA exhibited a loss of about
40 % activity, compared to their activity in dark conditions. In
case of the EcLDC and the SrLDC, an even stronger response to
light was observed, resulting in an inactivation by up to 90 %.
Experiments with different buffer systems showed, that the
specific activity of PLP-dependent enzymes, especially of the
VfATA, is not only depending on light conditions alone but also
on the selected reaction buffer and certainly a number of
additional factors. The AsATAmut11 represented an interesting
case, as the enzyme seemed to be resistant to illumination and
an inactivation was not observed for different light and buffer
setups. Moreover, by incubation in HEPES buffer for a minimum
of 6 h, the AsATAmut11 exhibited an activation of up to 150 %,
the underlying mechanism yet remains unclear. This increased
light stability is certainly, amongst others, one of the features,
making this amine transaminase mutant so potent. Based on
our results, we recommend to anyone working with PLP-
dependent enzymes, to select a reaction system with a suitable
buffer carefully and to evaluate the light sensitivity of the
respective enzyme, not only during the enzymatic reaction but
also during enzyme production and purification. Thus, it might
be possible to increase the activity of certain PLP-dependent
enzymes easily by up to ten times.

agar with 100 μg/mL ampicillin for all constructs, except for
transformations using pET29a or pKK32 vectors, here 50 μg/mL
kanamycin was used, and incubated overnight at 37 ° C.
Production and purification of enzymes
For all enzymes, the production was performed under normal light
and under dark conditions. For normal light conditions, windows
were left uncovered and the electric light was switched on but no
specific or targeted illumination occurred. In dark conditions,
illumination was avoided as much as possible. Flasks and solutions
were wrapped in aluminum foil, windows were covered, and the
electric light was switched off. The target enzymes were produced
in shaking flasks with a filling volume of up to 15 %. A single colony
from the respective overnight plate was transferred to 50 mL LB
medium (with 100 μg/mL ampicillin for all constructs, except for
cells transformed with pET29a or pKK32 vectors, here 50 μg/mL
kanamycin was used) and the precultures were cultivated overnight
at 37 ° C and 150 rpm (Infors HT, Bottmingen, Switzerland). For the
main culture, auto induction (AI) medium was used, which was
incubated for 48 h at 37 ° C (decreased to 20 ° C after 2 h) and
150 rpm (Infors HT, Bottmingen, Switzerland). Cells were harvested
by centrifugation (Avanti J-20 XP, Rotor JLA-8.1000, Beckman
Coulter, Brea, CA, USA, 30 min, 8,000 rpm, 4 ° C) and the resulting
cell pellets were frozen. For the purification, frozen cells containing
the respective enzymes were thawed and resuspended (30 % (w/v))
in TRIS buffer (50 mM, pH 7.5, 0.2 mM PLP) with 1 mg/mL lysozyme
(Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) and 10 units/mL benzonase (Merck,
Darmstadt, Germany) for 30 min on ice. The cells were disrupted by
ultrasonication (Digital Sonifier 450, Emerson Electric Co., Ferguson,
MO, USA) on ice for a total sonication time of 5 min (2 s pulse, 8 s
pause) at 60 % intensity. After centrifugation (Avanti J-20 XP, Rotor
JA-25.50, Beckman Coulter, Brea, CA, USA, 45 min, 20,000 rpm, 4 ° C),
the supernatant was applied to a Ni-NTA Superflow resin (Qiagen,
Hilden, Germany), pre-equilibrated with TRIS buffer (50 mM, pH 7.5,
0.2 mM PLP) using an ÄKTA pure chromatography system (GE
Healthcare, Bosten, MA, USA). After a washing step with an
appropriate washing buffer (50 mM TRIS buffer, pH 7.5, 0.2 mM PLP,
25 mM imidazole), the His
6
-tagged proteins were eluted (50 mM
TRIS buffer, pH 7.5, 0.2 mM PLP, 300 mM imidazole). Relevant
protein samples were pooled and desalted on a HiTrap
TM
Sephadex
G-25 resin (GE Healthcare, Bosten, MA, USA), pre-equilibrated with
TRIS buffer (10 mM, pH 7.5, 0.2 mM PLP). For enzymatic reactions
with the CvATA and VfATA in potassium phosphate buffer,
potassium phosphate buffer was used instead of TRIS buffer during
the production and purification process. The protein concentration
of the pooled relevant samples was adjusted to 1 mg/mL with
water. After freezing the protein solutions overnight, it was
submitted to lyophilization (Alpha 1-4 LD Plus, Martin Christ
Gefriertrocknungsanlagen GmbH, Osterode am Harz, Germany).
ATA initial rate reactions and analytics
The ATA activities were tested in different light setups, which were
explained above. Illumination of enzyme and PLP solutions
occurred using ten times concentrated stock solutions. The trans-
formations were performed in 1 mL scale in 100 mM HEPES buffer,
TRIS buffer or potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.5) containing
0.1 mM PLP, 30 mM (rac)-α-MBA (4) and 60 mM pyruvate (5). For an
optimal initial rate measurement, the enzyme concentrations were
set to 0.5 mg/mL for CvATA, 0.05 mg/mL for VfATA, 0.1 mg/mL for
BmATA and 1 mg/mL for AsATAmut11. The protein concentrations
were determined according to Bradford
[54]
after diluting relevant
samples 1 : 100 (v/v) in the respective buffer. Initial rate reactions
were incubated for a duration of 30 min at 20 ° C and 600 rpm in
transparent or amber colored microcentrifuge tubes in a thermo-
mixer (comfort 5335r, Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany). Product
formation was detected via HPLC analysis. The enzymatic reaction
in samples taken during the initial rate experiments was quenched
1 : 20 (v/v) in a mixture of 45 % acetonitrile, 55 % H
2
O and 0.1 %
trifluoroacetic acid (v/v). The samples were analyzed by reversed
phase chromatography using an Ultimate 3000 HPLC system
(Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) equipped with a
diode array detector and a LiChrospher® 100 RP-18 column (Merck,
Darmstadt, Germany). The analysis was carried out isocratically with
a flow rate of 1.5 mL/min at 25 ° C for 10 min using a solvent
mixture of 45 % acetonitrile, 55 % H
2
O and 0.1 % trifluoroacetic acid
(v/v). A 10 μL sample was injected and the absorption of
acetophenone (6) was detected at 254 nm with a retention time of
4.3 min. A slope was generated from the resulting peak areas,
corresponding to the relative activity of the respective ATA. For
specific activity determination, the concentration of the formed
acetophenone (6) was calculated from the peak areas using a
calibration curve (Figure SI.1). The activity is given in U mL
  1
, which
is defined as the amount of enzyme in 1 mL reaction solution,
which catalyzes the formation of 1 μmol acetophenone (6) per
minute. The error bars in the respective diagrams give information
about the standard deviation of technical triplicates.
LDC initial rate reactions and analytics
The relative LDC activities in different light setups were measured
via a newly developed colorimetric assay using the indicator 4-
nitrophenol for the decarboxylation reaction from L-lysine (8) to
cadaverine (9; manuscript in preparation). Illumination of enzyme
and PLP solutions was done as described previously using ten times
concentrated stock solutions. The corresponding illumination setup
is depicted in Figure SI.6.A–B. Colorimetric measurements and initial
rate reactions were performed using a UV-Vis spectrophotometer
(UV-1800, Shimadzu, Kyōto, Japan) in a 1.5 mL cuvette at 20 ° C,
measuring the absorbance at 400 nm in 10 s intervals. Before the
enzymatic reactions in 1 mL scale were started, 10 mM L-lysine (8)
and 0.1 mM PLP were pre-incubated in 25 mM HEPES buffer
(pH 6.0) for 4 min. Then, 0.1 mM 4-nitrophenol was added and the
initial rate measurement was started by addition of 0.05 mg/mL
EcLDC or 0.025 mg/mL SrLDC. After manual stirring for a couple of
seconds, a blank measurement was performed and then the
photometric measurement was started, which lasted 30 min. The
error bars in the respective diagrams give information about the
standard deviation of the technical triplicates.
Blue light inactivation of the CvATA
Blue light experiments with the CvATA were performed for initial
rate reactions as described above. A reaction solution containing
0.03 mg/mL enzyme was incubated for 10 min in an amber colored
microcentrifuge tube in a thermomixer (comfort 5335r, Eppendorf,
Hamburg, Germany; 600 rpm, 22 ° C), before the solution was
subjected to blue light illumination for 25 min. Inactivation experi-
ments were carried out in a stirred 2 mL glass vessel (600 rpm),
blue LED strips (60 LEDs, 450 nm, X105-0200, revoART GmbH,
Markkleeberg, Germany; ~ 12 mW/cm
2
) were used for illumination.
The corresponding blue light setup is depicted in Figure SI.6.E–F.
Light intensities at 450 nm were determined with a distance of
1 cm from the light source using an energy meter PM100D
equipped with a S302 C sensor (Thorlabs, Newton, NJ, USA). As the
energy meter shows sensitivity not only for light but as well for
temperature changes, the measured light intensities might be error
prone. The reaction setup was cooled with ice to compensate for a
temperature increase mediated by the LED strips. The temperature

of comparison, the corresponding dark control was handled at the
exact same temperature conditions. Samples taken during the
initial rate reaction were analyzed via HPLC as described above.
From the resulting peak areas, the corresponding concentration of
acetophenone (6) was calculated using the mentioned calibration
curve.
Spectrophotometric analysis of PLP solutions
The spectrophotometric analysis of PLP solutions was done in a
1.5 mL cuvette at 20 ° C using a UV-Vis spectrophotometer (UV-
1800, Shimadzu, Kyōto, Japan), measuring the spectrum from
250 nm to 500 nm. Test samples in 1 mL scale contained 0.1 mM
PLP dissolved in 100 mM HEPES, TRIS, potassium phosphate, TEA
buffer (all pH 7.5) or in water. 1 h blue light illumination was carried
out in a stirred 1.5 mL quartz glass cuvette (Hellma GmbH & Co. KG,
Müllheim, Deutschland; 600 rpm) using a blue LED (450 nm, royal
blue, XP-E2 SMD-LED, Star-PCB; Cree, Durham, NC, USA; ~ 60 mW/
cm
2
). The corresponding single blue LED setup is depicted in
Figure SI.6.C–D. The light intensity at 450 nm was measured as
described above. The setup was cooled with ice to keep the
solution at an average temperature of 22 ° C. Illumination of PLP
solutions in normal light conditions was done as described above.
