Abstract: Pyridoxal-5′-phosphate (PLP)-dependent transaminases are highly efﬁcient biocatalysts for
stereoselective amination. D-amino acid transaminases can catalyze stereoselective transamination
producing optically pure D-amino acids. The knowledge of substrate binding mode and substrate
differentiation mechanism in D-amino acid transaminases comes down to the analysis of the transam-
inase from Bacillus subtilis. However, at least two groups of D-amino acid transaminases differing
in the active site organization are known today. Here, we present a detailed study of D-amino
acid transaminase from the gram-negative bacterium Aminobacterium colombiense with a substrate
binding mode different from that for the transaminase from B. subtilis. We study the enzyme using
kinetic analysis, molecular modeling, and structural analysis of holoenzyme and its complex with
D-glutamate. We compare the multipoint binding of D-glutamate with the binding of other substrates,
D-aspartate and D-ornithine. QM/MM MD simulation reveals that the substrate can act as a base
and its proton can be transferred from the amino group to the α-carboxylate group. This process
occurs simultaneously with the nucleophilic attack of the PLP carbon atom by the nitrogen atom
of the substrate forming gem-diamine at the transimination step. This explains the absence of the
catalytic activity toward (R)-amines that lack an α-carboxylate group. The obtained results clarify
another substrate binding mode in D-amino acid transaminases and underpinned the substrate
activation mechanism.

1. Introduction
Chiral amines are important pharmaceutical ingredients and building blocks for drugs.
Transamination reaction is an effective biocatalytic route for obtaining optically pure amines,
as transaminases demonstrate excellent enantioselectivity and enantiomeric excess of more
than 99% [1]. Transaminases (TAs, aminotransferases, EC 2.6.1) are well-established in
large-scale chemistry [2–4]. These are pyridoxal-5′-phosphate (PLP)-dependent enzymes
that catalyze the stereoselective transfer of an amino group from an amino donor (amine
or amino acid) to a keto compound (ketone, keto acid, or aldehyde) to form new amino
and keto products [5–7]. The transamination reaction consists of two half-reactions: the

amino group of the ﬁrst amino substrate is transferred to PLP to produce pyridoxamine
5′-phosphate (PMP) and keto acid (ketone). In the second step, the keto substrate accepts
the amino group of PMP to yield a new amino acid (amine) and regenerates PLP [ 5,8].
The catalytic unit of TAs is a homodimer, with two active sites formed by the amino acid
residues of both subunits [9–12]. Stereospeciﬁcity of TAs results from the position of the
bound substrate relative to the PLP molecule [ 5,13,14], which forms Schiff base linkage
with the side chain of a lysine residue in the active site, thus dividing the latter into two
pockets: the O-pocket (on the phenyl side of PLP) and the P-pocket (on the phosphate side
of PLP) [13,15]. The residues lining the O- and P-pockets are involved in substrate binding
and determine the substrate speciﬁcity of TAs. TAs belong to I and IV fold types according
to the organization of PLP-binding fold [ 16]. TAs of PLP fold type IV are distinguished
by both (L)-speciﬁc and (R)-speciﬁc amination of keto compounds and include branched-
chain L-amino acid TAs (BCATs, EC 2.6.1.46) producing L-amino acids, D-amino acid TAs
(DAATs, EC 2.6.1.21) producing D-amino acid and (R)-amine: pyruvate TAs producing
primary (R)-amines (R-TAs, EC 2.6.1.B21) [9,13,17].
DAATs are found in bacteria and plants [18]. DAATs catalyze synthesis of D-amino
acids that in vivo are further involved in antibiotics synthesis, peptidoglycan metabolism,
plant growth metabolism, etc. [ 19–21]. In vitro, the benchmark reaction of DAATs is a
transamination between D-alanine and α-ketoglutarate (Scheme 1) [22,23].

excess of more than 99% [1]. Transaminases (T As, aminotransferases, EC 2.6.1) are well-
established in large-scale chemistry [2–4]. These are pyridoxal-5 ′-phosphate (PLP)-de-
pendent enzymes that catalyze the stereoselective transfer of an amino group from an 
amino donor (amine or amino acid) to a keto compound (ketone, keto acid, or aldehyde) 
to form new amino and keto products [5–7]. The transamination reaction consists of two 
half-reactions: the amino group of the first am ino substrate is transferred to PLP to pro-
duce pyridoxamine 5 ′-phosphate (PMP) and keto acid (ketone). In the second step, the 
keto substrate accepts the amino group of PMP to yield a new amino acid (amine) and 
regenerates PLP [5,8]. The catalytic unit of TAs is a homodimer, with two active sites 
formed by the amino acid residues of both subunits [9–12]. Stereospecificity of TAs results 
from the position of the bound substrate relative to the PLP molecule [5,13,14], which 
forms Schiff base linkage with the side chain of a lysine residue in the active site, thus 
dividing the latter into two pockets: the O- pocket (on the phenyl side of PLP) and the P-
pocket (on the phosphate side of PLP) [13,15] . The residues lining the O- and P-pockets 
are involved in substrate binding and determine the substrate specificity of TAs. TAs be-
long to I and IV fold types according to the organization of PLP-binding fold [16]. TAs of 
PLP fold type IV are distinguished by both (L)-specific and (R)-specific amination of keto 
compounds and include branched-chain L-amino acid TAs (BCATs, EC 2.6.1.46) produc-
ing L-amino acids, D-amino acid TAs (DAATs, EC 2.6.1.21) producing D-amino acid and 
(R)-amine: pyruvate TAs producing primary (R)-amines (R-TAs, EC 2.6.1.B21) [9,13,17].

Scheme 1. Transamination reaction between D-alanine and α-ketoglutarate, catalyzed by DAAT. 
The properties of several DAATs have been described, namely: DAATs from the bac-
teria Bacillus sp. YM-1 (bsDAAT) [22], Bacillus sphaericus  (bsphDAAT) [24], Geobacillus 
toebii SK1 (SK1DAAT) [25], Lactobacillus salivarius (lsDAAT) [25], Curtobacterium pusillum 
(CpuTA) [26], Haliscomenbacter hydrossis (Halhy) [27] and from plant Arabidopsis thaliana 
(atDAAT) [18]. The substrate spectrum of the DAATs includes various D-amino acids and 
α-keto acids, with CpuTA being also active with primary ( R)-amines. Crystal structures 
of some bacterial DAATs are known, these are bsDAAT (PDB ID: 1DAA, 3DAA), CpuTA 
(PDB ID: 5K3W), and Halhy (PDB ID: 7P7X) and two putative DAATs—from Burkholderia 
thailandensis (btDAAT, PDB ID: 4TM5) and Mycobacterium tuberculosis (mtDAAT, PDB ID: 
6Q1R). 
Currently, two variants of substrate binding in DAATs are revealed (Figure 1). The 
first one, canonical (applied for identification of specificity-determining sequence motifs 
and described by Hőhne et al. [28]), was observed in bsDAAT [11,29–31]. The triad of the 
amino acids in the O-pocket Y31, R98*, and H100* (* here and after indicates residues from 
the adjacent subunit of the functional dimer) form a carboxylate trap that binds the α-
carboxylate group of D-amino acids [31]. Later, Ro et al. proposed that the binding of α-
ketoglutarate in bsDAAT is supported by the coordination of the γ-carboxylate group in 
the P-pocket via K35 [32]. Another non-cano nical substrate binding mode has been pro-
posed for CpuTA and Halhy [26,27]. The O-pockets of both TAs lacked a canonical triad, 
however, possessed two positively charged residues, nonequivalent to the R98* and 
H100* of bsDAAT—R51*, K117 in CpuTA [26] and R28*, R90 in Halhy [27]. These residues

suggested to bind the α-carboxylate group of substrates D-amino acids [ 26]. Positively
charged residues, nonequivalent to the K35 of bsDAAT, were observed in identical positions
in the P-pockets of CpuTA and Halhy—R273 and K241, respectively. However, nothing was
suggested about their roles in the binding of the γ-carboxylate group of α-ketoglutarate.

Herein, we report insights into substrat e binding in DAAT from the gram-negative 
mesophilic bacterium Aminobacterium colombiense (AmicoTA) [33]. Using kinetic analysis, 
we observed the activity of AmicoTA toward different D-amino acids, with D-glutamate 
being the most specific substrate. Structure-based sequence alignment revealed the iden-
tical active site residues between AmicoTA and both canonical and non-canonical DAATs. 
Thus, both substrate binding modes were allowed in the active site of AmicoTA. To clarify 
this issue, we investigated AmicoTA usin g X-ray crystallography and molecular model-
ing. Finally, molecular dynamic simulations with combined quantum mechanics/molecu-
lar mechanics potentials were performed to clarify the molecular mechanism of the for-
mation of gem-diamine from the Michaelis complex that initiates transimination.

2.1. Structure-Based Sequence Alignment of AmicoTA and Known DAATs  
According to [9,13,28], the active site of DAATs is formed by secondary structural 
elements (SSE), grouped into the O-pocket and P-pocket (Figure 1). The O-pocket is lined 
by residues of βX- and βY-strands, β-turn1, and O-pocket α-helix, and is partially capped 
by the residues of the O-pocket loop. The O-pocket is responsible for the binding of the α-
carboxylate group of substrates, and the P-pocket—for the binding of a side group of sub-
strates. Structure-based sequence alignment of homologous DAATs (Figure S1) revealed 
two groups of DAATs (canonical and non-canonical) differing in the O-pocket organiza-
tion: DAATs with canonical “carboxylate trap” and DAATs with two R/K residues in the 
O-pocket (Table 1). The P-pockets in both gr oups of DAATs do not contain conservative 
residues. However, in several DAATs P-pockets contain a positively charged R/K residue 
from βX-strand (bsDAAT, bsphDAAT, SK1DAAT) or β-turn2 (btDAAT, CpuTA, and 
Halhy). Similar to bsDAAT, these R/K residues could coordinate the γ-carboxylate group 
of substrate α-ketoglutarate. The interdomain loop in the known structures of DAATs is 
out of the active site (Figure 1) and seems not to participate in catalysis [27,31,34]. The

of the active site (Figure 1) and seems not to participate in catalysis [ 27,31,34]. The pe-
culiar feature of canonical DAATs is the high similarity of sequence fragments encoding
β-turn1, which borders the entrance to the active site. No similarity is observed among
sequence fragments encoding β-turn1s in non-canonical DAATs. β-Turn2, which borders
the P-pocket, in both DAAT groups contains Ser and Thr residues in random positions.
Finally, the speciﬁcity-determining motifs of the two groups of DAATs differ signiﬁcantly
(Table 2).

Searching for TAs in the genome of bacteria A. colombiense revealed a new PLP-
dependent DAAT (GenBank ID: WP_013049219)—AmicoTA. The identities of the amino
acid sequences of AmicoTA with canonical bsDAAT and non-canonical CpuTA were 28.7%
and 31.2%, respectively. The AmicoTA sequence included residues matching to motifs of
both DAAT groups (Tables 1 and 2). While R27 (O-pocketα-helix), F32, T34 (βX-strand),
and R88 (βY-strand) residues corresponded to non-canonical DAATs motifs, the K99 and
H101 (O-pocket loop) residues matched to canonical DAATs motifs. To shed light on the
properties of AmicoTA, the recombinant enzyme was expressed in a soluble form, puriﬁed
to homogeneity (Figure S2), and characterized in detail.
2.2. Substrate Speciﬁcity Proﬁle of AmicoTA
An analysis of half-reactions was performed to ﬁnd amino donors. Since the overall
transamination reaction is the sum of two consecutive half-reactions [8,37], the substrate
spectrum (amino donors) of TA can be obtained from the analysis of the TA afﬁnity in half-
reactions for compounds with the amino group/keto group (in the absence of the inhibition
by the second substrate and the second product) [5,8,14]. The half-reaction analysis of the
PLP form of AmicoTA with various amino donors demonstrated the speciﬁcity of AmicoTA
for various D-amino acids. (Table 3, Figure S3). No activity with L-amino acids and primary
amines was observed. The best amino donors were D-glutamate and D-alanine.

AmicoTA catalyzed transamination at 30–60 ◦C and pH 6–10 (Figure 2). The optimal
pH and temperature for the reaction between D-alanine and α-ketoglutarate were 8.5–9.0
and 60 ◦C (Figure 2), respectively. The optimal parameters for the reverse reaction between
D-glutamate and pyruvate were pH 8.0 and 50 ◦C, respectively (Figure 2). Kinetic parame-
ters of the overall transamination reaction between D-alanine and α-ketoglutarate as well
as the reverse reaction between D-glutamate and pyruvate are shown in Table 4 (Figure S4).

hibition by the second substrate and the seco nd product) [5,8,14]. The half-reaction anal-
ysis of the PLP form of AmicoTA with various amino donors demonstrated the specificity 
of AmicoTA for various D-amino acids. (Table 3, Figure S3). No activity with L-amino

AmicoTA catalyzed transamination at 30–60 °C and pH 6–10 (Figure 2). The optimal 
pH and temperature for the reaction between D-alanine and α-ketoglutarate were 8.5–9.0 
and 60 ° С (Figure 2), respectively. The optimal parameters for the reverse reaction be-
tween D-glutamate and pyruvate were pH 8.0 and 50 ° С, respectively (Figure 2). Kinetic 
parameters of the overall transamination reaction between D-alanine and α-ketoglutarate 
as well as the reverse reaction between D-glutamate and pyruvate are shown in Table 4

According to the kinetic analysis of thermostability, the half-life of AmicoTA was about
10 h at 60 ◦C, 40 h at 50 ◦C, and 100 h at 40 ◦C (Figure S5A). In the presence of substrates
(operational stability), the half-life of AmicoTA decreased to 10 min at 60 ◦C, 10 h at 50 ◦C,
and 35 h at 40 ◦C (Figure S5B). Both experiments were performed at high concentrations of
AmicoTA. No enzyme inactivation was observed in the standard assay at lower enzyme
concentrations.
The enantioselectivity of AmicoTA was evaluated in the overall reaction between 4-
methyl-2-oxovalerate or phenylpyruvate and D-glutamate as an amino donor. The product
yield of D-leucine and D-phenylalanine after 48 h of the reaction at 30◦C achieved 98% and
32%, respectively (Figure S6). The enantiomeric excess of D-leucine and D-phenylalanine
was 99.1 and 99.3%, respectively.
2.3. The Overall Structure of AmicoTA
The crystal structure of the holoenzyme was elucidated at 1.9 Å resolution. The
asymmetric unit contained two subunits organized in a dimer whose buried area comprised
15% of the total surface area of each subunit. According to gel ﬁltration, AmicoTA is a
dimer in solution as well (Figure S7). The organization of the AmicoTA dimer (Figure 3A)
Molecules 2023, 28, 2109 7 of 21
corresponded to the functional units of TAs of PLP fold type IV [9–12,31,38,39], which is in
agreement with the general conclusion about the similarity of the overall fold organization
among TAs of PLP fold type IV [9,28]. The closest structural homologs of the AmicoTA
were BCATs fromGeoglobus acetivorans and Archaeoglobus fulgidus [40], Halhy [27] and R-TA
from A. fumigatus [12] (Table S1).

right subunit, the small domain is shown in light  pink, the large domain in light green, the inter-

(B) The active site of AmicoTA. The impo rtant structural elements are shown: βX- and βY-strands

the O-pocket loops (D) of AmicoTA (O-pocket loop—blue, interdomain loop—magenta), bsDAAT

Each subunit of the dimer consisted of two α/β domains: a small domain (residues 
1–114) and a large domain (residues 127–275) , connected by the interdomain loop (resi-
dues 115–126) (Figure 3A). The interdomain loop of AmicoTA (115–126) was out of the 
active site as in known DAATs (Figure 3B). Two proline residues make the interdomain 
loop rigid similar to bsDAAT (Table 1). It is fixed on the verge of the active-site cavity by 
two hydrogen bonds. This arrangement of the interdomain loop seems to be a common 
feature of DAATs [9,11,34] (Figure 3С). The O-pocket loop (95–109) was also located out-
side the active site in the AmicoTA dimer (Fig ure 1B,D), i.e., in an open conformation. 
Positions of other structural elements in the active site: βX-strand (30–37), βY-strand (85–
92), β-turn1 (173–176), and β-turn2 (234–237) were similar to those of known TAs of PLP 
fold type IV [9–12].

hydrogen bonds. This arrangement of the interdomain loop seems to be a common feature
of DAATs [9,11,34] (Figure 3C). The O-pocket loop (95–109) was also located outside the
active site in the AmicoTA dimer (Figure 1B,D), i.e., in an open conformation. Positions of
other structural elements in the active site: βX-strand (30–37), βY-strand (85–92),β-turn1
(173–176), and β-turn2 (234–237) were similar to those of known TAs of PLP fold type
IV [9–12].

2.4. Active Site Organization in the AmicoTA Dimer
The AmicoTA dimer contains two identical active sites formed by the residues of two
small domains of both subunits and a large domain of one subunit. The PLP molecules are
clearly seen in the electron density of both active sites and are bound via Schiff base linkage
with K142. The phosphate moiety of PLP has a common to known TAs of PLP fold type
IV multiple coordination via hydrogen bonds with the side chains of R51, T198, and T199,
backbone nitrogen atoms of T198, T199, and T235 as well as water-mediated hydrogen
bonds with T34, T177, R200, and T233. The pyridine ring of PLP is sandwiched by the side
chain of L195 and backbone atoms of H175 and S176 ( β-turn1) (Figure 4 and Figure S8).
Y146 forms a hydrogen bond with the phenyl group of PLP ( Figure S8). E172 forms a
hydrogen bond with the N1 atom of the pyridine ring of PLP . Noteworthily, E172 forms a
direct hydrogen bond with the N1 atom in one subunit (Figure S8A), while it coordinates
the N1 atom via the water molecule in the other subunit (Figure S8B). Generally, there is a
direct hydrogen bond between the N1 atom of the pyridine ring and the carboxylate group
of aspartate or glutamate residue among TAs of PLP fold type IV [10–12,26,41].

small domains of both subunits and a large domain of one subunit. The PLP molecules 
are clearly seen in the electron density of bo th active sites and are bound via Schiff base 
linkage with K142. The phosphate moiety of PLP has a common to known TAs of PLP

by the side chain of L195 and backbone atoms of H175 and S176 ( β-turn1) (Figures 4 and 
S8). Y146 forms a hydrogen bond with the phenyl group of PLP (Figure S8). E172 forms a 
hydrogen bond with the N1 atom of the pyri dine ring of PLP. Noteworthily, E172 forms 
a direct hydrogen bond with the N1 atom in one subunit (Figure S8A), while it coordinates 
the N1 atom via the water molecule in the ot her subunit (Figure S8B). Generally, there is 
a direct hydrogen bond between the N1 atom of the pyridine ring and the carboxylate 
group of aspartate or glutamate residue among TAs of PLP fold type IV [10–12,26,41]. 
Considering the conventional division of th e active site into O-pocket and P-pocket 
[9,13,15], the O-pocket of AmicoTA is lined by residues of βX- and βY-strands as well as 
β-turn1 and O-pocket α-helix. The O-pocket is open: neither the O-pocket loop nor β-turn1 
shields it from the solvent. It contains five positively charged residues, which can bind the 
α-carboxylate group of a substrate: R27*, R8 8, K99*, H101*, and H175 (Figure 4A). K99* 
and H101* residues (equivalent to R98* and H100* in canonical bsDAAT) are located on 
the O-pocket loop and are oriented away from the active site in the holoenzyme. The third 
residue of the canonical carboxylate trap (Y31 in bsDAAT) is substituted for F32 in 
AmicoTA; however, the nearby located T34 might bear its function. Although the residues 
of the canonical triad are mostly in place, th e presence of a canonical carboxylate trap is 
unclear from the holoenzyme structure. Additionally, R27* and R88 from O-pocket α-he-
lix and βX-strand, respectively, together with T34 can organize an alternative carboxylate 
trap.

The P-pocket of the AmicoTA active site is lined by S36, M86, and 234GTVK237 residues

domain loop contains the R116 residue, which might be involved in targeting a negatively 
charged substrate. Of note, in the holoenzyme structure, the R116 side chain has no elec-
tron density.

Considering the conventional division of the active site into O-pocket and P-pocket[9,13,15],
the O-pocket of AmicoTA is lined by residues ofβX- and βY-strands as well asβ-turn1 and
O-pocketα-helix. The O-pocket is open: neither the O-pocket loop norβ-turn1 shields it from
the solvent. It contains five positively charged residues, which can bind theα-carboxylate
group of a substrate: R27*, R88, K99*, H101*, and H175 (Figure 4A). K99* and H101* residues
(equivalent to R98* and H100* in canonical bsDAAT) are located on the O-pocket loop and
are oriented away from the active site in the holoenzyme. The third residue of the canonical

2.5. Structural Analysis of the Substrates Binding in the Complex of AmicoTA with D-Glutamate
To shed light on the substrate binding mode in AmicoTA, the structure with D-
glutamate was obtained at 1.9Å resolution. The RMSD for Cαatoms between subunits of
the holoenzyme and the complex with D-glutamate did not exceed 0.4 Å. In the complex
D-glutamate is covalently bound with PLP via Schiff linkage (Figure 4B). Considering that
the dihedral angle C3-C4-C4 ′-N4′is 60◦and 40◦in subunits A and B, respectively, the
adduct between D-glutamate and PLP is a ketimine rather than an aldimine. The hydrogen
bond between the phenyl oxygen of the PLP ring and the N4 ′atom of Schiff linkage is
unobvious. The occupancy of the adduct was found to be 0.7, the rest of the cofactor was
in PMP form. Several residues in the active site and PLP changed their orientation upon
D-glutamate binding, compared to holoenzyme. The pyridine ring was tilted 15 ◦from
its position in the holoenzyme around the N1-C6 bond, and the released side chain of the
catalytic lysine moved toward Y146, forming a hydrogen bond between its εNH2 group
and OH group of Y146. The α-carboxylate group of D-glutamate formed a salt bridge
with the guanidine group of R27* and a hydrogen bond with the hydroxyl group of T34.
Backbone nitrogen atoms of V236 and K237 as well as the Nεatom of the latter coordinated
the γ-carboxylate group of D-glutamate.
Both the O-pocket loop and the interdomain loop did not change their conformations
upon binding of the substrate. Neither K99* with H101* (analogs of the “carboxylate trap”
in bsDAAT) nor R116 was found to participate in the substrate binding. The si-face of
the ketimine was exposed to the bulk solvent, while the re-face oriented to the protein
side was shielded from the water molecules. Of note, R88, which is located near R27*,
was not involved in the substrate binding; it remained intact, bound by several hydrogen
bonds with residues of both subunits of the dimer. The orientation of the side chain of
H175 was unfavorable for hydrogen bonding with the α-carboxylate group of D-glutamate,
although histidine could be protonated at pH 6.5 (crystallization conditions). Instead,
H175 was oriented as in the holoenzyme, which may be a result of crystal soaking in a
D-glutamate solution.
To summarize, no canonical “carboxylate trap” was formed when D-glutamate entered
the active site. No other “carboxylate trap” was formed by R27*, R88, and T34 as well.
The α-carboxylate group of the substrate was coordinated only by R27* and T34. The
γ-carboxylate group of D-glutamate was coordinated by the positively charged side chain
of K237 and backbone nitrogen atoms of K237 and V236 in the P-pocket. The active site is
open to the solvent.
2.6. Substrate Binding Modes Revealed by Molecular Dynamic Simulations
We performed MD simulations to examine the substrate binding in the active site
of AmicoTA. D-glutamate was found to be the best amino substrate for the AmicoTA,
considering both kmax and KD values. This is in line with the fact that α-ketoglutarate
carrying the similarγ-carboxylate group is the best keto substrate. Classical MD simulations
were carried out to obtain the ES complex of WT AmicoTA with D-glutamate (Figure 5A).
In the ES complex, the negatively charged α-carboxylate group forms stable salt bridges
with the side chain of R27*, and the γ-carboxylate group forms a stable salt bridge with
the side chain of K237. We performed additional MD simulations of the ES complexes
with other substrates considered in the study. D-aspartate carries a negatively charged
β-carboxylate group on its side chain, which does not interact with K237 and is exposed to
the solution. This agrees with the almost 60 times increase of the KD value compared with
D-glutamate. Unexpectedly, D-ornithine with a protonated amino group in its side chain
had a relatively low KD value. MD simulations demonstrate that it forms a stable complex
between its hydrophobic part, including CβH2-CγH2-CδH2 fragment and a side chain of
V236; the protonated amino group is exposed to the solution and shields hydrophobic
fragments from interactions with water molecules that should stabilize the Gibbs energy of
the entire system (Figure 5B).

from interactions with water molecules that should stabilize the Gibbs energy of the entire 
system (Figure 5B).

2.7. Michaelis Complex of AmicoTA with D-Glutamate and Substrate-Assisted Mechanism  
of Catalysis 
The first process during the transamination reaction is a transimination, that is, the 
amino group of a substrate substitutes the amin o group of catalytic lysine in the internal 
aldimine, an adduct of PLP and catalytic lysine in the active site of TAs [7,14]. It was 
shown for TAs of PLP fold type I, that the effectiveness of this step is achieved by the 
deprotonation of the attacking amino group and concerted protonation of the imine nitro-
gen atom in the internal aldimine, such combination raises the nucleophilicity of the at-
tacking group and facilitates the leaving group release [7,42]. The absorbance spectra of 
the holo form of AmicoTA at different pH  showed the predominance of the protonated 
internal aldimine at pH range 7.0–10.0 (Figure 6). No peak at 360–375 nm [32,43] that cor-
responded to the deprotonated form of the internal aldimine was observed.

2.7. Michaelis Complex of AmicoTA with D-Glutamate and Substrate-Assisted Mechanism
of Catalysis
The ﬁrst process during the transamination reaction is a transimination, that is, the
amino group of a substrate substitutes the amino group of catalytic lysine in the internal
aldimine, an adduct of PLP and catalytic lysine in the active site of TAs [7,14]. It was shown
for TAs of PLP fold type I, that the effectiveness of this step is achieved by the deprotonation
of the attacking amino group and concerted protonation of the imine nitrogen atom in
the internal aldimine, such combination raises the nucleophilicity of the attacking group
and facilitates the leaving group release [7,42]. The absorbance spectra of the holo form of
AmicoTA at different pH showed the predominance of the protonated internal aldimine
at pH range 7.0–10.0 (Figure 6). No peak at 360–375 nm [32,43] that corresponded to the
deprotonated form of the internal aldimine was observed.
Since the imine nitrogen in the internal aldimine of AmicoTA is protonated, the
substrate binding mode should provide an assistance to the deprotonation of the amino
group of D-amino acid. No proton acceptor was found in the active site close to the amino
group of the substrate except the α-carboxylate of the substrate, which is common for all D-
amino acids. Moreover, at optimal pH 8.5 and 9.0, the percentage of the deprotonated form
of D-alanine and D-glutamate does not exceed 8% and 25%, correspondingly. Therefore,
we examined substrate-assisted catalysis. The mechanism of the ﬁrst elementary step of the
chemical reaction was calculated at the QM(PBE0-D3/6-31G**)/MM MD level of theory.
Umbrella sampling procedure was utilized, and the reaction coordinate was chosen as a
sum of the distances between the hydrogen atom of the protonated amino group and the
oxygen atom of the α-carboxylate group of the substrate, and between the nitrogen atom
of the substrate and the C4′atom of PLP . The Gibbs energy proﬁle is depicted in Figure 7.
The substrate acts as a base and the reaction is initiated by the proton transfer from the
protonated amino group of the substrate to its α-carboxylate group. In the transition state
region, the proton is already transferred to the carboxylate of the α-carboxylate group;
the lone pair of the neutral amino group is oriented toward the PLP carbon atom and the
distance of the nucleophilic attack is 2.8–2.9 Å that is favorable for the following C—N bond

formation. The neutral α-carboxylate group of the substrate is stabilized by the hydrogen
bond with the phenyl group of PLP . Thus, at the ﬁrst step, the gem-diamine is obtained,
and the entire system is stabilized by about 6 kcal/mol relative to the ES complex.

strate binding mode should provide an assistance to the deprotonation of the amino group 
of D-amino acid. No proton acceptor was found in the active site close to the amino group 
of the substrate except the α-carboxylate of the substrate, which is common for all D-

3. Discussion 
AmicoTA is a transaminase of PLP fold type IV, which is active toward D-amino 
acids and α-keto acids. The highest conversion rate is achieved in transamination between 
D-alanine and α-ketoglutarate at pH 8.5–9.0, 60 °C. It concedes bsDAAT [34] and Halhy 
[27] in a catalytic turnover rate in the reaction between D-alanine and α-ketoglutarate 15–
25 times in the optimal conditions. At the same time, if we consider Km meaning as «the 
affinity of the enzyme for the substrates in  the steady state» [44], these values for α-ke-
toglutarate are similar in DAATs. It appears that a proper binding of α-ketoglutarate is a 
key feature of DAATs. In this case, the specif icity for other substrates depends on the ef-
ficiency of their binding in the active site optimized for α-ketoglutarate. The efficient bind-
ing of α-ketoglutarate means the coordination of  both carboxylate groups. In AmicoTA, 
two sites of carboxylate group binding were found: one in the O-pocket formed by R27* 
and T34, and another in the P-pocket formed by K237 and V236.  
Noteworthy, the O-pocket loop is considered to be a specificity-determining struc-
tural element in TAs of fold type IV [9,13,28]  because it contains residues for substrate 
binding. Additionally, the O-pocket loop in closed conformation together with the inter-
domain loop shields the active site from the solvent. The closed active sites in complexes 
with substrates are observed for R-TAs and BCATs but not for canonical bsDAAT 
[10,31,39,40,45,46]. This is not the case for AmicoTA as well. Despite the open active site, 
in the transamination reaction catalyzed by  AmicoTA both the enantiomeric excess and 
the product yield of the D-amino acids surpass 99% and 98%, correspondingly. These ob-
servations support the substrate-differentiation role of the active site closure but not the 
catalytic one in TAs [9,10,47]. To summarize, the substrate binding in AmicoTA is 
achieved by multiple interactions with residu es located on the fixed structural elements 
of the active site. The substrate differentiation mechanism should be clarified. Moreover, 
it remains unclear how DAATs escape the side reaction of racemization. 
The mechanism of the overall transamination  reaction including the transimination 
step was established for aspa rtate aminotransferase from E.coli [8,14,48], which demon-
strated maximal activity at pH 7.0–8.0 and had deprotonated imine nitrogen at this pH 
range. In the Michaelis complex, the attacking protonated aspartate donates its proton to 
imine nitrogen of the internal aldimine, and transimination proceeds [7,14]. The estab-
lished mechanism of transi mination became disputable for DAATs and BCATs 
[10,22,24,49,50], as the imine nitrogen of the internal aldimine was protonated in the pH

Additionally, the O-pocket loop in closed conformation together with the interdomain loop

are observed for R-TAs and BCATs but not for canonical bsDAAT [10,31,39,40,45,46]. This
is not the case for AmicoTA as well. Despite the open active site, in the transamination
reaction catalyzed by AmicoTA both the enantiomeric excess and the product yield of
the D-amino acids surpass 99% and 98%, correspondingly. These observations support
the substrate-differentiation role of the active site closure but not the catalytic one in

substrate differentiation mechanism should be clariﬁed. Moreover, it remains unclear how
DAATs escape the side reaction of racemization.
The mechanism of the overall transamination reaction including the transimination
step was established for aspartate aminotransferase from E.coli [8,14,48], which demon-
strated maximal activity at pH 7.0–8.0 and had deprotonated imine nitrogen at this pH
range. In the Michaelis complex, the attacking protonated aspartate donates its proton to
imine nitrogen of the internal aldimine, and transimination proceeds [7,14]. The established
mechanism of transimination became disputable for DAATs and BCATs [10,22,24,49,50],
as the imine nitrogen of the internal aldimine was protonated in the pH optima of these
TAs [22,24,49,51]. Goto and coauthors suggested for BCAT from E. coli that a proton from
the substrate amino group migrated to a negatively charged hole formed in the active
site by the phosphate group of cofactor and the adjacent α-carboxylate group of L-amino
acid substrate [52]. This hypothesis does not suit for DAATs. In the active site of DAATs,
the α-carboxylate group of a substrate and the phosphate group of the cofactor occupy
opposite pockets. Here, we suggest substrate-assisted catalysis as a possible route of the
amino group deprotonation in a Michaelis complex in the transimination step. The α-
carboxylate group of a substrate acts as a proton acceptor, with the Schiff base of the lysine
residue and PLP being in a protonated state in the pH range 7–10 and unable to accept
a proton. QM/MM MD simulation for AmicoTA demonstrated that the proton transfer
from the amino group to the α-carboxylate group in the substrate occurs together with the
nucleophilic attack of the substrate nitrogen atom on the internal aldimine carbon atom
forming a gem-diamine. This process results in the 6 kcal/mol lowering of the energy of
the entire system and happens with the low energy barrier. Our ﬁndings are in line with the
previous computational study of the related PLP-dependent ornithine decarboxylase [53].
Similar to our ﬁndings, the amino group is neutral during the formation of the C-N bond
in the gem-diamine and the carboxylate group is neutral as well. The only difference is that
in [53], the substrate is already neutral in the Michaelis complex, whereas in our model it
is a zwitterion and its transformation to the neutral species occurs in the transition state
region of the ﬁrst elementary step.

4. Materials and Methods
4.1. Cloning, Expression, and Puriﬁcation of the Recombinant AmicoTA
Gene AmicoTA_1844 encoding PLP type IV transaminase (275 a.a., 30.7 kDa) was
identiﬁed in the genome of A. colombiense (strain DSM 12261/ALA-1) [33]. The optimized
sequence (http://genomes.urv.es/OPTIMIZER/, accessed on 1 February 2022) was syn-
thesized with 5′and 3′overhangs complementing the NdeI and HindIII restriction sites
by ATG Service Gene (St. Petersburg, Russia) and then cloned into the pET-21d vector
(Novagen, Darmstadt, Germany) modiﬁed as described in [54] to produce a protein fused
at the N-terminus with a (His)6-tag and a TEV protease site. E. coli Rosetta (DE3) pLysS cells
(Novagen, Germany) transformed with the construct were grown in LB high salt medium
containing 100 µg/mL ampicillin and 34 µg/mL chloramphenicol (Panreac-AppliChem,
Darmstadt, Germany) at 37 ◦C until the OD600 value reached 0.8, and then expression was
induced with 0.2 mM IPTG. After incubation for 18 h at 30 ◦C, the cells were harvested by
centrifugation, resuspended in a 50 mM K-phosphate buffer, pH 8.0, supplemented with
500 mM NaCl, 20 mM imidazole, 0.5 M urea, 5 mM β-mercaptoethanol, 10% (v/v) glycerol,
0.2 µg/mL lysozyme, 100 µM PLP , and 1 mM PMSF, and disrupted by sonication. 0.1 mg
of DNAse (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) was added to the crude cell extract and it
was centrifuged for 45 min at 18,500×g at 4 ◦C. The supernatant was ﬁltered through a
0.45 µm ﬁlter (Millipore, Burlington, MA, USA) and applied to a 5 mL HisTrap HP column
(Cytiva, Marlborough, MA, USA), equilibrated with 50 mM K-phosphate buffer, pH 8.0,
containing 500 mM NaCl, 20 mM imidazole and 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100. The (His)6-tagged
recombinant AmicoTA was eluted with a linear gradient from 20 to 500 mM imidazole
in the same buffer without Triton X-100. The target protein was incubated for 1 h with 1
mM PLP at 25 ◦C, concentrated up to 20–25 mg/mL with a 30 kDa cut-off centrifugal ﬁlter
device (Millipore, USA) and transferred into storage buffer (50 mM K-phosphate, pH 8.0,
containing 100 mM NaCl, 1 mM β-mercaptoethanol and 100 µM PLP), then diluted by
glycerol 1:1 and stored at −20 ◦C. The (His)6-tagged recombinant AmicoTA was used for
the biochemical characterization.
For crystallization, the fraction of (His)6-tagged recombinant AmicoTA was incubated
overnight at 4 ◦C with (His)6-tagged TEV protease (1 mg per 10 mg of the protein) solution,
containing 1 mM EDTA, 5 mM β-mercaptoethanol and 10% (v/v) glycerol, then dialyzed
against the 50 mM K-phosphate buffer, pH 8.0, containing 500 mM NaCl, 20 mM imidazole
and 20 µM PLP , and applied to a HisTrap HP column (Cytiva, USA). A (His) 6-tagged
TEV protease and cleaved (His)6-tag were absorbed on the column, whereas the recombi-
nant AmicoTA without (His)6-tag was collected in the ﬂow-through mode, concentrated,
and applied to a Superdex 200 10/300 GL column (Cytiva, USA) equilibrated in 50 mM
HEPES buffer, pH 8.0, containing 100 mM NaCl and 100µM PLP . The collected fractions
were transferred into 20 mM HEPES buffer, pH 8.0, and applied to a MonoQ 10/100 GL
column (Cytiva, USA) equilibrated with the same buffer and eluted with a linear NaCl
gradient (20–500 mM). The fractions of recombinant AmicoTA were concentrated up to
15–20 mg/mL, transferred to the crystallization buffer: 20 mM HEPES, pH 8.0, supple-
mented with 50 mM NaCl, 100µM PLP , and 1 mM DTT, and frozen at−70 ◦C. Recombinant
HGDH from Acidaminococcus fermentas was obtained similarly to AmicoTA. The protein
purity was analyzed by SDS-PAGE (12%). The protein concentration was determined
spectrophotometrically [55].
4.2. Enzyme Activity Assay
The activity of the puriﬁed AmicoTA in the transamination reaction between D-
alanine and α-ketoglutarate was determined spectrophotometrically by applying lactate
dehydrogenase (LDH) assay on the SPECTROstar Omega (BMG Labtech, GmbH, Ortenberg,
Germany) plate reader in the microtiter plates (200 µL) (UV-Star, Greiner Bio-One GmbH
-Frickenhausen, Germany). The assay was performed with 5–500 mM D-alanine and
0.5–20 mM α-ketoglutarate, 0.05–0.1 µM of the puriﬁed AmicoTA, 330 µM NADH, and
4 U/mL LDH from rabbit muscle (Roche Diagnostics GmbH, Mannheim, Germany) in
Molecules 2023, 28, 2109 14 of 21
50 mM CHES buffer, pH 9.0, containing 60 µM PLP at 60 ◦C. The reaction was initiated by
D-alanine. The reaction progress was monitored by detecting a decrease in the absorbance
at 340 nm (ε(NADH) = 6220 M−1 cm−1). The standard assay was performed with 50 mM
D-alanine and 5 mM α-ketoglutarate. The activity of AmicoTA was calculated from the
initial linear region of the progress curve of the reaction. One unit (U) was deﬁned as
the amount of the enzyme that catalyzed the conversion of 1 µmol of the substrate into a
product per minute.
The activity of the AmicoTA in the transamination reactions between D-glutamate
and pyruvate was determined spectrophotometrically by applying (R)-2-hydroxyglutarate
dehydrogenase (HGDH) assay, respectively, on the SPECTROstar Omega (BMG Labtech,
Germany) plate reader in the microtiter plates (200 µL). The HGDH-assay was performed
with 1–30 mM D-glutamate and 10–500 mM pyruvate, 0.1–0.3µM of the enzyme, 330 µM
NADH, and 4 U/mL recombinant HGDH from A. fermentas in 50 mM K-phosphate buffer,
pH 8.0, containing 60 µM PLP at 60 ◦C. The reaction was initiated by D-glutamate. The
reaction progress in HGDH-assay was monitored by detecting a decrease in the absorbance
at 370 nm (ε(NADH) = 2484 M−1 cm−1) because at 340 nm, the absorption from pyruvate
at high concentrations was signiﬁcant.
Steady-state kinetic parameters of the overall reaction catalyzed by the AmicoTA be-
tween D-alanine and α-ketoglutarate, D-glutamate and pyruvate were calculated from the
substrate saturation curves at the constant co-substrate concentration using the Michaelis–
Menten model.
The kinetic parameters were calculated by fitting the initial velocity data toEquation (1):
V = Vmax ×A ×B
KAm ×B + KBm ×A + A ×B (1)
where V is the initial velocity, Vmax is the maximal velocity, A and B are substrate concen-
tration, and KA
m and KB
m are the Km of substrates A and B, respectively. All measurements
were performed at least in triplicates. The data were analyzed using Origin 8.0 software
(OriginLab, Northampton, MA, USA).
4.3. Effect of pH and Temperature on the Overall Transamination Reaction
pH and temperature effects were determined in the overall transamination reaction
between 50 mM D-alanine and 5 mM α-ketoglutarate and 5 mM D-glutamate and 50 mM
pyruvate. The pH optimum was determined at 30 ◦C using the following buffers: 25 mM
Tris-HCl and 25 mM K-phosphate, pH 6–9, and 50 mM CHES buffer, pH 9–10. The
temperature dependence of the reaction rate was studied in the range from 30 to 70 ◦C in
50 mM K-phosphate buffer, pH 8.0. When measuring activity at 65 and 70 ◦C, the pyruvate
and α-ketoglutarate formation was monitored using a discontinuous LDH or HGDH assay,
correspondingly, in 100 mM K-phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, at 25◦C [46].
4.4. Analysis of Thermal Stability and Operational Stability
The thermal stability of AmicoTA was determined by incubating 45 µM AmicoTA at
40, 50, and 60 ◦C in 50 mM CHES buffer, pH 9.0, containing 100 µM PLP . The operational
stability was determined by incubating 45 µM AmicoTA at 60 ◦C in 50 mM CHES buffer,
pH 9.0, containing 100 µM PLP , 100 mM D-leucine, and 20 mMα-ketoglutarate. Residual
activity was measured in the standard assay at several time points for 120 h.
4.5. Half-Reaction Assay
The PLP-form of AmicoTA was obtained by incubation with an excess of both PLP and
α-ketoglutarate for 1 h at 25◦C, followed by transfer into 50 mM CHES buffer, pH 9.0, using
a 5 mL Desalting column (Cytiva, USA). Half-transamination reactions of the AmicoTA PLP
form (35–40 µM) with D-amino acids were followed spectrophotometrically at 408 nm by
measuring a decrease in the aldimine concentration in presence of different concentrations
of D-amino acids in 50 mM CHES buffer, pH 9.0 at 40 ◦C in UV-transparent microtiter
Molecules 2023, 28, 2109 15 of 21
plates (UV-Star, Greiner, Germany) using SPECTROstar Omega plate reader (BMG Labtech,
Germany). The rate constants of half-reactions were determined by ﬁtting Equation (2):
At = A∞ + ∆Aexp (−kobst) (2)
where At is the absorbance at time t, ∆A is the difference between absorbance at t = 0 and
t = ∞, A∞ is the ﬁnal absorbance, and kobs is the observed rate constant. The dissociation
constant for the enzyme–substrate complex KD, the maximal rate constant kmax, the rate
constant of the reverse reaction kr, and the speciﬁcity constant kmax
KD
were obtained by ﬁtting
Equation (3):
kobs = kmax[S]
KD + [S] + kr (3)
All measurements were performed at least in triplicates. The data were analyzed using
Origin 8.0 software.
4.6. Analysis of the Product Yield and Enantiomeric Excess in the Transamination Reaction
The product yields were determined in the catalyzed by AmicoTA reactions between
4-methyl-2-oxovalerate and D-glutamate and between phenylpyruvate and D-glutamate by de-
termining the consumption of 4-methyl-2-oxovalerate or the formation of D-phenylalanine.
A one-pot three-enzyme system was employed to shift the equilibrium toward the products.
The coproduct, α-ketoglutarate, was removed from the reaction mixture by HGDG assay
while recovering NADH in D-glucose conversion catalyzed by glucose dehydrogenase.
The reaction mixture contained 100 mM K-phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, 100 µM PLP , 100 mM
D-glutamate, 50 mM 4-methyl-2-oxovalerate or 50 mM phenylpyruvate, 4 mg/mL WT
AmicoTA, 1 mM NADH, 150 mM D-glucose, 180 U/mL HGDH, and 30 U/mL glucose
dehydrogenase (Sigma, USA). The reaction mixtures were incubated at 30◦C with 4-methyl-
2-oxovalerate for 20 h and with phenylpyruvate for 40 h. The reactions were terminated by
removing the enzyme using an Amicon-Ultra-15 centrifugal tube (Millipore, USA), and
then the ﬁltrate was analyzed by HPLC (ÄKTA Puriﬁer, Marlborough, MA, Cytiva, USA)
using a reverse-phase C18 column (Zorbax Eclipse XDB-C18, 5 µm, 4.6 ×150 mm, (Agilent,
Santa Clara, CA, USA)). The chiral analysis of produced D-leucine and D-phenylalanine
was performed by HPLC using a reverse-phase C18 column with a UV detector set at
340 nm. HPLC conditions are described in the Supplementary Materials.
4.7. Crystallization and Data Collection
Initial crystallization screening was performed on a robotic system (Rigaku Americas
Corporation, The Woodlands, TX USA) using 96-well VDX plates (Hampton Research,
Aliso Viejo, CA USA) and commercial crystallization screens from Hampton Research
(Aliso Viejo, CA USA) and Molecular Dimensions Inc (Holland, OH USA) by the “hanging
drop” vapor diffusion method. A 15 mg/mL of the AmicoTA holo form in 20 mM HEPES
buffer pH 8.0 containing 50 mM NaCl, 100 µM PLP , and 1 mM DTT was mixed with the
crystallization solution in the ratios 1:1, 1:2 (0.1 µL drop volume), and 2:1 (0.2 µL drop
volume). The volume of the precipitant solution in the reservoir was 50 µL. The initial
crystallization hit was observed under the following conditions: 0.2 M sodium nitrate,
0.1 M Bis-tris propane, pH 6.5, 20% PEG3350 at 1:1 ratio at 288 K. Further optimization
of crystal growth was made using the “hanging drop” vapor-diffusion method in 24-well
VDX plates (Hampton Research). The drop volume was increased to 3 µL, and the volume
of the precipitant solution to 500 µL.
Crystals of the AmicoTA complex with D-glutamic acid were obtained by soaking
the crystal of the holoenzyme in a crystallization solution containing 100 mM substrate for
5 min.
Crystals of the AmicoTA holoenzyme and its complex were brieﬂy soaked in a mother
liquor containing 20% glycerol immediately before diffraction data collection and ﬂash-
frozen in liquid nitrogen. Datasets were collected at 100K at ID23-1 beamline (ESRF,
Molecules 2023, 28, 2109 16 of 21
France) [56] and Rigaku OD XtaLAB Synergy-S (IOC RAS, Russia) for holoenzyme and
complex with D-glutamate, respectively. The datasets for holoenzyme were indexed, inte-
grated, and scaled using the XDS package [57], while for the complex with D-glutamate the
CrysAlisPro software v.1.0.43 (Oxford Diffraction/Agilent Technologies UK Ltd., Yarnton,
UK) was used. Space groups were suggested by Pointless [58] as P212121 for both structures
(Table 5).

4.8. Structure Solution and Reﬁnement
The structure of the holo form of AmicoTA was solved by the molecular replacement
method using the MOLREP program [59] with the atomic coordinates of the BCAT transam-
inase from the archaeon Geoglobus acetivorans (PDB ID: 5E25) as a starting model, while
the structure of the AmicoTA complex was solved using the AmicoTA holo form structure.
Two copies of the protein were found in an asymmetric unit of both structures.
The reﬁnement of all structures was carried out using the REFMAC5 program of the
CCP4 suite [60]. The visual inspection of electron density maps and the manual rebuilding
of the model were carried out using the COOT interactive graphics program [ 61]. The
isotropic B-factor and the hydrogen atoms in ﬁxed positions were included during the
Molecules 2023, 28, 2109 17 of 21
reﬁnement. In both ﬁnal models, the protein subunits within the asymmetric unit have a
similar fold with corresponding pairwise RMSD not exceeding 0.25Å.
4.9. Structure Analysis and Validation
The visual inspection of the modeled structure was carried out using the COOT
program and the PyMOL Molecular Graphics System, Version 4.6 (Schrödinger, USA). The
structure comparison and superposition were made using the PDBeFOLD program [62].
The contacts were analyzed using the PDBePISA [63].
4.10. Molecular Modeling
The crystal structure of the AmicoTA in the PLP bound form obtained in this study
was utilized as a source of coordinates of heavy atoms. Substrates were incorporated in
the active sites of both monomers of the dimeric structure. We studied complexes with D-
glutamate, D-aspartate, D-ornithine, and D-alanine. Simulations for all model systems were
performed mimicking pH9; aspartate and glutamate residues were negatively charged,
lysine and arginine residues were protonated and histidine residues were neutral. The
protonation state of either the N δ or Nε atom of the histidine side chain was chosen
depending on its local environment. All MD simulations were performed in NAMD3 [64]
with the 1 fs integration time step at p = 1 atm and T = 300 K with the length of each
trajectory 200–300 ns. CHARMM36 parameters [65] were utilized for protein, TIP3P [66]
for water molecules and modiﬁed CGenFF [67] for the PLP .
QM/MM MD simulations were performed in the TeraChem [68] and NAMD2 pro-
grams [69] using a speciﬁc interface [70]. QM subsystem was described at the PBE0-D3/6-
31G** level [71]; it included the PLP and the part of the K142, D-glutamate, and neighboring
residues that form hydrogen bonds. Umbrella sampling simulations were performed for
the ﬁrst step of a chemical reaction. Different reaction coordinates were tested during the
simulations. First, we examined the possible reaction path as a set of sequential processes:
a proton transfer followed by the nucleophilic attack as two separate steps. To do this, the
reaction coordinate for the ﬁrst step was suggested as a difference between two distances
along the proton transfer, N . . . H and O . . . H distances. We failed to locate a minimum
corresponding to the neutral substrate; therefore, we next tried to use a reaction coordinate
that comprised both proton transfer and nucleophilic attack. The reaction coordinate was
set as a sum of the distances between the hydrogen atom of the protonated amino group
and an oxygen atom the α-carboxylate group of the substrate and between the nitrogen
atom of the substrate and a C4′atom of PLP . A set of 10 ps QM/MM MD simulations were
performed with harmonic potentials added on reaction coordinate with the force constant
of kcal/mol/Å2 and centered from 2.7 Å to 5.1 Å with 0.3 Å step. The transition state region
corresponds to the reaction coordinate around 3.9 Å and the corresponding QM/MM MD
trajectory is available at ZENODO (https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7633915, accessed on
21 February 2023). Umbrella integration was applied to reconstruct the Gibbs energy proﬁle.
5. Conclusions
D-amino acid transaminase from A. colombiense (AmicoTA) has been identiﬁed and
characterized. The enzyme is active toward various D-amino acids and α-keto acids and
can be applied for stereoselective amination of compounds with α-carboxylate group at
pH 7–10 in the temperature range 30–60 ◦C. The active site of AmicoTA is set up for a
multipoint binding of α-ketoglutarate or D-glutamate. The binding of other substrates is
less effective. The substrate binding mode does not include residues from the O-pocket
loop, the multipoint substrate binding is provided by the residues from the ﬁxed structural
elements of the active site. The same binding mode seems to be realized in the homologous
transaminases from C. pusillum, H. hydrossis, M. tuberculosis, and A. thaliana. To the best of
our knowledge, in the studied transaminases of PLP fold type IV , the residues of mobile
O-pocket loop typically participate in the binding of substrates, thus providing the effective
