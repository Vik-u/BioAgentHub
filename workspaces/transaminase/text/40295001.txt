Abstract 
Background/Aim: Primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) is a chronic autoimmune liver disease characterized by bile duct 
destruction, cholestasis, and inflammation, often leading to fibrosis and cirrhosis. While ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) 
is the standard treatment, some patients exhibit suboptimal responses, necessitating adjunctive therapies. Molecular 
hydrogen (H 2), known for its antioxidant and anti ‑inflammatory properties, has shown potential in mitigating  
oxidative stress and immune dysregulation in autoimmune liver diseases. This case report evaluates the therapeutic 
efficacy of H2 capsules in managing PBC with elevated liver enzymes and immune dysregulation.  
Case Report: A 44‑year‑old male with PBC, splenomegaly, and elevated IgG4 levels presented with acute cholestatic 
hepatitis. Laboratory tests revealed significantly elevated aspartate transaminase (AST) (279 U/l) and alanine

aminotransferase (ALT) (183 U/l). Despite UDCA therapy, liver enzymes remained persistently high. On August 30, 
2024, molecular hydrogen capsule therapy was introduced as adjunctive treatment. Over four months, AST and ALT 
levels declined to 95 U/l and 70 U/l, respectively, without adverse e ffects. Immune markers (KLRG ‑1, PD‑1, and 
Tim3), previously reduced during PBC flares, normalized post ‑treatment. Imaging confirmed stable fibrosis, and  
IgG4 levels decreased, suggesting reduced autoimmune activity. The patient also reported improvements in fatigue 
and pruritus, enhancing overall quality of life.  
Conclusion: Molecular hydrogen capsules therapy may serve as a sa fe and e ffective adjunctive treatment for PBC, 
contributing to improved liver enzyme levels, immune regulation, and patient well ‑being. Further studies are  
warranted to validate these findings and establish standardized treatment protocols in autoimmune liver diseases.

Introduction 
 
Primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) is a chronic autoimmune 
liver disease characterized by the progressive destruction of 
small intrahepatic bile ducts, resulting in bile flow  
obstruction and cholestasis. This disruption triggers  
inflammation and fibrosis, which may progress to cirrhosis 
if untreated. While the exact etiology remains unclear,  
genetic predisposition, environmental triggers, and  
associations with other autoimmune conditions, such as 
Sjögren’s syndrome and autoimmune thyroiditis, are  
believed to contribute to disease development (1, 2). The 
primary treatment for PBC is ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA), 
a bile acid that enhances bile flow and slows disease  
progression. Most patients experience significant benefits 
from UDCA, particularly when initiated in the early stages of 
the disease (3, 4). Emerging therapies, including fibrates and 
molecular hydrogen (H₂), are being investigated for their 
potential to reduce cholestasis and modulate inflammation. 
The therapeutic effects of H₂ stem from its unique ability to 
function as a selective antioxidant and regulator o f 
inflammation, oxidative stress, and cellular signaling (5). H₂ 
has been shown to directly neutralize reactive oxygen  
species, such as hydroxyl radicals and peroxynitrite, thereby 
mitigating oxidative stress, reducing inflammation,  
inhibiting apoptosis, and attenuating fibrosis (6). 
Molecular hydrogen exerts anti‑inflammatory effects by 
modulating key signaling pathways, including nuclear factor‑
kappa B (NF ‑ĸB) (7, 8). By inhibiting NF ‑ĸB activation, 
hydrogen reduces the production o f pro ‑inflammatory 
cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF‑α), 
interleukin 1 β (IL‑1β), and interleukin 6 (IL‑6), which play 
pivotal roles in autoimmune and inflammatory diseases (9, 
10). Additionally, hydrogen activates pathways such as AMP‑
activated protein kinase (AMPK) and nuclear factor 
erythroid 2–related factor 2 (Nrf2), enhancing cellular repair 
mechanisms and maintaining redox homeostasis (11, 12). 
Nrf2 activation up‑regulates antioxidant and detoxification 
enzymes, further amplifying hydrogen’s protective effects 
(13). By mitigating oxidative stress, H2 therapy alleviates 
cellular damage that contributes to inflammation and  
fibrosis in PBC. This reduction in oxidative injury slows bile 
duct damage and fibrosis progression, ultimately improving 
liver function (14). Although molecular hydrogen therapy 
remains in the early stages of application for liver diseases, 
its safety profile and ability to target key drivers of PBC, 
including oxidative stress and immune dysregulation,  
highlight its potential as an adjunct to standard treatments 
such as UDCA. Ongoing research continues to evaluate its 
efficacy and establish standardized therapeutic protocols. 
This report presents a case of PBC with significantly elevated 
liver enzymes success fully managed with adjunctive  
molecular hydrogen therapy. 
In this case, the patient received hydrogen capsules  
(PURE HYDROGEN) supplied by HoHo Biotech Co., Ltd.  
(Taipei, Taiwan, ROC). Each capsule contained 170 mg of

hydrogen‑enriched calcium, delivering approximately  
1.7×1,021 molecules of hydrogen‑equivalent to the hydrogen 
concentration found in 24 cups (200 ml each) o f water 
containing 1,200 ppb (0.6 mM) of dissolved hydrogen. This 
study was approved by the Institutional Review Board (IRB) 
of Tri‑Service General Hospital, National Defense Medical 
Center, Taiwan (IRB approval number: B202105106;  
approval date: July 18, 2023) and conducted in accordance 
with all relevant ethical guidelines. Written informed consent 
was obtained from the patient for publication of this case 
report. The study adhered to the ethical standards of the 
institution, the 1964 Declaration o f Helsinki, and its  
subsequent amendments or comparable ethical standards. 
 
Case Report 
 
A 44 ‑year‑old male with a history o f primary biliary  
cholangitis (PBC), splenomegaly (long ‑axis diameter:  
16.1 cm), and elevated IgG4 levels was re ferred for the 
management o f acute cholestatic hepatitis. Initial  
laboratory tests revealed markedly elevated liver enzyme 
levels [aspartate transaminase (AST): 279 U/l, alanine  
aminotransferase (ALT): 183 U/l; Figure 1]. Serological  
analysis demonstrated positive anti ‑mitochondrial 
antibodies (45 U/ml; reference range <20 U/ml), a high 
antinuclear antibody (ANA) titer (1:1,280), and elevated 
IgG4 levels (93.00 mg/dl; reference range=8‑140 mg/dl). 
Despite adherence to conventional therapy with  
ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) and dietary modifications, 
liver function showed only minimal improvement. 
On August 30, 2024, molecular hydrogen capsule  
therapy was initiated as an adjunctive treatment. The patient 
was prescribed one of H2 capsules daily. Over four months, 
significant biochemical improvements were observed, with 
AST levels decreasing to 95 U/l and ALT to 70 U/l by  
December 2024 (Figure 1). No adverse e ffects were  
reported, and the patient noted an overall improvement in 
well‑being. Imaging studies, including liver ultrasound and

therapy on August 30, 2024.
MRI, showed no evidence o f new biliary obstruction or  
significant fibrosis progression of fibrosis during this period. 
Follow‑up FibroScan results indicated stable liver  
stiffness measurements, corroborating the biochemical  
improvements. Additionally, IgG4 levels decreased from 
their initial elevated levels, suggesting reduced autoimmune 
activity. The patient’s quality o f li fe, assessed using a  
structured questionnaire, showed significant improvement, 
with reductions in fatigue and pruritus, common symptoms 
of PBC. During PBC flares, key immune markers such as 
killer cell lectin like receptor G1 (KLRG‑1), programmed 
death‑1 (PD ‑1), and T ‑cell immunoglobulin and mucin  
domain 3 (Tim3) were notably reduced (Figure 2 and Figure 
3), correlating with disease activity. After supplementation 
with molecular hydrogen, these markers returned to normal 
levels, indicating an immunomodulatory effect of H2.  
 
Discussion 
 
This case highlights the potential o f H 2 therapy as an  
adjunctive treatment for PBC, particularly in patients with a 
limited response to conventional therapies such as UDCA. 
The patient’s significant biochemical improvement, coupled 
with enhanced quality o f li fe and reduced autoimmune 
activity, underscores the multifaceted therapeutic effects of 
H2 in managing oxidative stress, inflammation, and immune 
dysregulation (7, 15). The selective antioxidant properties 
of H2 likely contributed to the observed reduction in liver

enzyme levels. By neutralizing hydroxyl radicals and  
peroxynitrite, H2 mitigates oxidative stress, a primary driver 
of liver injury in PBC (16, 17). Additionally, its ability to 
modulate inflammatory pathways, such as NF ‑ĸB and  
AMPK/Nrf2, not only reduces pro‑inflammatory cytokines 
but also enhances the production of cytoprotective enzymes, 
thereby promoting cellular repair and maintaining redox 
balance (18, 19). 
The observed reduction in IgG4 levels is particularly 
noteworthy, as elevated IgG4 levels are linked to autoimmune 
activity in certain hepatitis patients (20, 21). The immuno‑
modulatory effects of H2, evidenced by the normalization of 
key immune markers such as KLRG ‑1, PD‑1, and Tim3,  
suggest a role in regulating the immune responses that  
contribute to hepatocyte injury. These findings are consistent 
with preclinical studies demonstrating H 2’s ability to  
attenuate immune‑mediated damage. The absence o f 
adverse effects in this patient further supports the safety 
profile of molecular hydrogen therapy. Its non ‑invasive 
nature and ease of administration in the form of oral capsules 
make it an attractive option for long‑term management of 
chronic liver diseases. However, this case also underscores 
the need for larger, controlled studies to validate these  
findings and establish standardized dosing protocols. 
 
Conclusion 
 
Molecular hydrogen therapy appears to be a sa fe and  
effective adjunctive treatment for PBC, especially in patients 
with an inadequate response to conventional therapies. By

targeting oxidative stress, inflammation, and immune  
dysregulation, H2 o ffers a comprehensive approach to  
slowing disease progression and enhancing patient  
outcomes. While this case report contributes to the growing 
body of evidence supporting its therapeutic potential, further 
research is necessary to confirm its efficacy, optimize its use, 
and explore its role in other autoimmune liver diseases.
