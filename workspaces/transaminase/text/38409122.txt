Biocatalytic cascade to polysaccharide 
amination

Abstract 
Background Chitin, the main form of aminated polysaccharide in nature, is a biocompatible, polycationic, and anti-
microbial biopolymer used extensively in industrial processes. Despite the abundance of chitin, applications thereof 
are hampered by difficulties in feedstock harvesting and limited structural versatility. To address these problems, 
we proposed a two-step cascade employing carbohydrate oxidoreductases and amine transaminases for plant 
polysaccharide aminations via one-pot reactions. Using a galactose oxidase from Fusarium graminearum for oxida-
tion, this study compared the performance of CvATA (from Chromobacterium violaceum) and SpATA (from Silicibacter 
pomeroyi) on a range of oxidized carbohydrates with various structures and sizes. Using a rational enzyme engineer-
ing approach, four point mutations were introduced on the SpATA surface, and their effects on enzyme activity were 
evaluated.
Results Herein, a quantitative colorimetric assay was developed to enable simple and accurate time-course meas-
urement of the yield of transamination reactions. With higher operational stability, SpATA produced higher product 
yields in 36 h reactions despite its lower initial activity. Successful amination of oxidized galactomannan by SpATA 
was confirmed using a deuterium labeling method; higher aminated carbohydrate yields achieved with SpATA com-
pared to CvATA were verified using HPLC and XPS. By balancing the oxidase and transaminase loadings, improved 
operating conditions were identified where the side product formation was largely suppressed without negatively 
impacting the product yield. SpATA mutants with multiple alanine substitutions besides E407A showed improved 
product yield. The E407A mutation reduced SpATA activity substantially, supporting its predicted role in maintaining 
the dimeric enzyme structure.
Conclusions Using oxidase–amine transaminase cascades, the study demonstrated a fully enzymatic route to poly-
saccharide amination. Although the activity of SpATA may be further improved via enzyme engineering, the low 
operational stability of characterized amine transaminases, as a result of low retention of PMP cofactors, was identified 
as a key factor limiting the yield of the designed cascade. To increase the process feasibility, future efforts to engi-
neer improved SpATA variants should focus on improving the cofactor affinity, and thus the operational stability 
of the enzyme.

Graphical Abstract
Background
Natural aminated polysaccharides mainly occur in 
forms of chitin and peptidoglycan. Whereas chitin 
comprises repeating N -acetylglucosamine, peptidogly -
can consists of alternating N-acetylglucosamine and 
N-acetylmuramic acid; in both cases, the repeating 
units are connected via β-(1→ 4)-linkages. Chitin is a 
major component of arthropod exoskeletons and fun -
gal cell walls; today, chitin extracted from crustacean 
shells serves as the main source of aminated polysac -
charides for applied purposes [1 ]. In industrial pro -
cessing, chitin is extracted chemically using acid–base 
treatments or enzymatically by proteases; it is then 
often deacetylated to chitosan to introduce primary 
amine functionalities [1 , 2]. Given its biocompatible, 
polycationic, and antimicrobial properties, chitosan has 
been used as a flocculant in wastewater treatment, an 
enhancer in plant growth regulation, and a component 
of controlled-release drug matrices [3 , 4]. In consumer 
products, chitosan has been used increasingly as a food 
additive, a beverage stabilizer, and a cosmetic ingre -
dient [4 ]. The intensive processing requirements and 
challenges relating to feedstock collection from largely 
animal sources, however, limit the supply of sustain -
ably sourced chitosan for the wide range of aminated 
polysaccharide applications. From a performance per -
spective, the narrow pH range conducive to solubilizing 
chitosan in water (pH 4.5–5) and the low mucoadhe -
siveness of chitosan at physiological temperature and 
pH further restrict its applications as a bio-flocculant 
for water purification or a component of biomedical 
materials used in controlled drug release systems [5 , 
6]. Compared to chitin, large-scale, diverse, and dis -
tributed processes exist that sustainably harvest plant 
polysaccharides, mainly cellulose, for paper, packaging, 
and textile manufacturing [7 , 8]. Hemicelluloses, which 
represent a comparatively underused fraction of plant 
fiber, adopt a range of structures with different chemi -
cal and physical properties [9 ]. Although hemicelluloses 
and other plant polysaccharides lack amine functional -
ity, sustainable routes to their amination would gener -
ate a plant-based alternative to chitin that also benefits 
from existing large-scale biorefinery processes.
Existing pathways to aminated polysaccharides from 
plant polysaccharides consist of mainly cellulose ami -
nation via (2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidin-1-yl)oxyl or 
periodate oxidation followed by reductive amination 
[5, 10–12]. Besides the use of strong oxidizers and toxic 
metal catalysts, over-oxidation and depolymerization 
of cellulose are major drawbacks of these chemical pro -
cesses. Enzymatic reactions are typically performed at 
milder conditions and have higher specificity, and thus 
represent compelling  alternative approaches for plant 
polysaccharide amination. Previously, Aumala et al. [13] 
demonstrated the use of a two-step cascade employing 
carbohydrate oxidoreductases and amine transami -
nases for plant carbohydrate aminations (Fig.  1): in the 
first step, a galactose oxidase from Fusarium gramine -
arum (FgrGaOx; UniProt ID: A0A2H3HJK8) is used to 
introduce an aldehyde group at the C-6 hydroxyl posi -
tion of galactose and galactose-containing oligosaccha -
rides. In the second step, an amine transaminase from 
Chromobacterium violaceum (CvATA; UniProt ID: 
Q7NWG4) is used to transfer a primary amino group 
from donor molecule to the C-6 aldehyde present in 
the carbohydrate acceptor [13]. Briefly, galactose oxi -
dases are copper-dependent enzymes that belong to 
the auxiliary activity family 5 subfamily 2 (AA5_2) in 
the carbohydrate-active enzyme (CAZy) database [14]. 
The specificity of galactose oxidase towards the C-6

hydroxyl of galactose and terminal galactose residues in 
oligo- and polysaccharides is well documented [15, 16], 
which has been exploited in productions of thermally 
stable hydrogels and aerogels from guar galactomannan 
and tamarind galactoxyloglucan [17, 18].
Transaminases (TAs), on the other hand, are pyridoxal-
5′-phosphate (PLP) dependent enzymes that catalyze the 
transfer of primary amino groups from amines to the car-
bonyl carbons of ketones or aldehydes [19]. The reaction 
is carried out via a ping-pong mechanism in which PLP is 
used as an electron shuttle. First, a primary amino group 
from the amino donor is transferred to a PLP cofactor, 
which deaminates the donor and forms a pyridoxamine-
5′-phosphate (PMP) intermediate; the PMP in turn 
donates the amino group to the acceptor, generating a tar-
get amine and recovering PLP for the next catalytic cycle 
[20, 21]. As members of fold types I and IV PLP-depend -
ent enzymes, TAs are further categorized into α-TAs and 
amine transaminases (ATAs) based on their regioselec -
tivity. Whereas α-TAs only catalyze the transamination 
between α-amino- and α-aldo/keto-acids, ATAs can 
in principle convert any primary amines to ketones or 
aldehydes (or vice versa) regardless of the location of the 
amino group [20]. As a result, ATAs are frequently used 
in asymmetric syntheses of chiral amines, which are fun -
damental building blocks of many high-value chemicals 
and pharmaceuticals [22]. A prominent success of indus -
trial ATA applications is the synthesis of the antidiabetic 
(R)-sitagliptin using the extensively engineered ATA-117 
[23]. Following a “substrate-walking” process, the active 
site of the ATA was expanded stepwise to accommodate 
bulky side groups. Compared to the chemical approach, 
the enzymatic process eliminates the use of toxic rho -
dium catalysts and improves the optical purity of the 
product to over 99.95% [23]. Similar processes have been 
developed for the production of other active pharmaceu -
tical ingredients including norephedrine, rivastigmine, 
and perindopril [22]. Despite the successes in engineer -
ing ATAs for bulky monomeric amine synthesis, the 
activity and specificity of ATAs towards carbohydrates, 
including polysaccharides, remain unexplored.
Herein, CvATA and SpATA from Silicibacter pomeroyi 
(UniProt: Q5LMU1) were compared for the ability to 
aminate plant polysaccharides, specifically galactoman -
nan and xyloglucan. CvATA is one of the most reported 
ATAs and is known for its high catalytic efficiency and 
broad substrate scope [24]. The enzyme was previously 
shown to be active on oxidized mono- and oligosaccha -
ride substrates [13], however, its activity towards higher 
molecular weight oxidized polysaccharides is unknown. 
Previous studies showed that SpATA can accept bulky 
substrates including Jeffamines and halogenated prochi -
ral ketones [25, 26], which makes it a promising enzyme 
for polysaccharide amination. In this study, a new colori -
metric assay was established to compare the yield of ami -
nated polysaccharides produced by CvATA and SpATA. 
The FgrGaOx and ATA activity in simultaneous cascades 
were balanced to suppress gel formation that reduces 
product yield by consuming oxidized intermediates. The 
possibility of increasing SpATA activity on polysaccha -
rides via site-directed mutagenesis was also explored, 
which revealed combinations of alanine substitutions 
with beneficial effects on the SpATA activity towards pol-
ysaccharide substrates.
Results
Colorimetric assays to evaluate ATA activity on oxidized 
carbohydrates
The initial activity of CvATA and SpATA on FgrGaOx-
oxidized galactose, lactose, melibiose, raffinose, galac -
tomannan, and xyloglucan was measured using the 
acetophenone assay; transaminase activity on pyru -
vate was measured for comparison. Similar to the 
values reported by Aumala et  al. [13], the initial activ -
ity of CvATA on pyruvate and oxidized galactose was 
7500 ± 430  U/g and 74.2 ± 2.1  U/g, respectively. Nota -
bly, the initial activity of SpATA was roughly half that 
measured for CvATA, specifically 2830 ± 170  U/g and 
Fig. 1 The proposed oxidation–transamination biocatalytic cascade adopted from Aumala et al. [13]. The amination of d-galactose at the C-6 
position is shown as an example. Aminations of other monosaccharides and positions are possible in theory by selecting different carbohydrate 
oxidoreductases

40.5 ± 1.8  U/g on pyruvate and oxidized galactose, 
respectively. No significant activity was measured for 
either ATA on oxidized oligo- and polysaccharide sub -
strates, likely due to the rapid evaporation of acetophe -
none under standard assay conditions.
The volatility of acetophenone and background inter -
ference that increases over time meant that the acetophe-
none assay is not suitable for measuring ATA-catalyzed 
aminations of oxidized oligo- and polysaccharides (Addi -
tional file  1: Figs. S1, S2). Instead, a variation of the 
2-(4-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-amine assay (the NPEA assay), 
originally developed by Baud et  al. [27], was developed 
herein to establish a colorimetric method for quantifying 
transamination reactions on oxidized carbohydrates. In 
the NPEA assay, a red precipitate forms when the NPEA 
reacts with its deaminated form (Fig.  2A), which is a by-
product of the transamination reaction. The quantitative 
NPEA assay (the Q-NPEA assay) established here uses 
adhesive and transparent film to seal each reaction well 
on a microtiter plate and incubates the reactions with 
the film side facing down (Fig.  2B). As the reaction pro -
gresses, the red precipitate adheres to the film, forming 
a transparent colored layer with a maximum absorbance 
near 440  nm (Additional file  1: Fig. S3). The Q-NPEA 
assay is quantitative for amino acceptor conversions up 
to 1.0  mM under the experimental setup used in this 
study (Fig.  3); notably, the linear range can be adjusted 
by varying the reaction volume or the area of the adhe -
sive surface. The accuracy of the standard curve was veri -
fied by parallel HPLC-RI measurements that quantified 
the depletion of pyruvate in ATA reactions comprising 
excess NPEA; complete depletion of 0.1 mM to 1.0 mM 
pyruvate was confirmed for all reactions (Additional 
file 1: Fig. S4).

from 0.1 to 1.0 mM was used as the amino acceptor, and 10 mM NPEA was used as the amino donor. The microtiter plate was sealed 
with transparent and adhesive film and was incubated at 37 °C and 600 rpm for 24 h with the film side facing down. The absorbance of reaction 
wells was measured at 440 nm using a spectrophotometer, and depletion of pyruvate in all reactions was confirmed using HPLC-RI (Additional file 1:

CvATA and SpATA-catalyzed transamination of Fgr -
GaOx-oxidized oligo- and polysaccharides were then 
compared using the Q-NPEA assay (Fig.  4). Both ATAs 
were active on all tested oxidized carbohydrates despite 
differences in the degree of polymerization and the glyco-
sidic linkage connecting the terminal oxidized galactose 
to the rest of the substrate. After 36 h, reactions compris-
ing SpATA consistently produced higher product yield 
compared to those comprising CvATA, even though the 
latter had higher initial activity on pyruvate and oxidized 
galactose. The same trend was observed when using ESI-
Q-TOF MS to evaluate galactose amination after 24  h, 
which showed the relative intensity of aminated galactose 
produced by SpATA was approximately twice that pro -
duced by CvATA (Fig. 5). Notably, CvATA treatments led 
to higher substrate conversions in the first 4 h; however, 
the enzyme was completely deactivated within 12  h. By 
contrast, SpATA remained active over the full incubation 
period (36 h), explaining overall higher product yields in 
corresponding reactions.
Direct detection of aminated galactomannan by X‑ray 
photoelectron spectroscopy and mass spectrometry
X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was used to 
detect the enzymatic introduction of primary amino 
groups to the oxidized polysaccharide amino acceptor, 
specifically oxidized galactomannan. Using the nitrogen 
signal from the oxidized galactomannan as a baseline, the 
signal corresponding to the primary amino group was 
2.5 times higher after treatment with SpATA compared 
to CvATA (Fig.  6). To quantify the degree of amination 
of each product on the basis of oxidized galactose, the 
GC–MS-based deuterium labeling method described 
in Parikka et  al. [15] was used to determine the per -
centage of oxidized galactose in galactomannan that 
remained after amination by each ATA. Relative to the 
untreated control, the degree of oxidation (DO) of the 
oxidized, CvATA aminated and SpATA aminated galac -
tomannan were 54.1 ± 1.7%, 55.4 ± 1.7%, and 44.4 ± 5.9%, 
respectively. The reduction in DO after SpATA treat -
ment corresponds to 9.7 ± 3.5% amination of galactose in 
galactomannan, or 17.9 ± 3.9% amination of the oxidized 
galactose subunits, which quantitatively agrees with the 
Q-NPEA assay result. In contrast, CvATA treatment did 
not produce a measurable reduction in DO, further dem -
onstrating the low performance of CvATA on oxidized 
polysaccharides.
Balancing oxidase and ATA activity to reduce gel formation
Gel formation is often observed after polysaccharide oxi -
dation and results from acetal bond formation between 
aldehyde groups introduced by oxidation and hydroxyl 
groups abundant in the polysaccharide substrate [17]. 
Gelation is expected to reduce amination by reducing the 
available carbonyls and imposing a diffusion barrier that 
impedes ATA access to the substrates. Despite conduct -
ing simultaneous oxidation and transamination reactions 
herein to reduce the acetal bond formation, evidence of 
gel formation was observed (Additional file  1: Fig. S5A). 
In an effort to further reduce gel formation that con -
sumes oxidized intermediates through side reactions, 
a series of experiments were performed to improve the 
balance of FgrGaOx and SpATA used in the reaction. 
Measured using the 2,2′-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazo -
line-6-sulfonic acid) assay (the ABTS assay), the activity 
of FgrGaOx on galactose was 69,100 ± 2100 U/g with no 
Fig. 4 Conversions of FgrGaOx-oxidized carbohydrates through amination by CvATA (blue) and SpATA (orange) measured using the Q-NPEA assay. 
The oxidation and transamination reactions were performed simultaneously in one pot. The inserted line graph shows the amination of oxidized 
galactose with a linear time scale to underscore the higher initial activity of CvATA. Reactions (200 µL) comprised 50 mM HEPES buffer (pH 7.5), 
29.8 µg/mL FgrGaOx, 12.8 µg/mL catalase, 1.8 µg/mL HRP , 150 µg/mL ATA, 20 µM PLP , 10 mM NPEA and carbohydrates containing 5 mM galactose 
and were carried out at 37 °C and 600 rpm. (n = 4, error bars indicate standard errors)

significant inhibition by the aminated product, which is 
equivalent to 2.06 ± 0.06  U/mL under our experimental 
setup. In comparison, units of SpATA activity on oxidized 
galactose was 58 ± 2 U/g, equivalent to 0.009 ± 0.0002 U/
mL in the cascade reaction or less than 0.5% of FgrGaOx 
activity.
The impact of decreasing FgrGaOx loading and 
increasing SpATA loading on galactomannan amina -
tion was studied using the Q-NPEA assay (Fig.  7). To 
track the reduction in gel formation, product precipi -
tate formed on the transparent adhesive film and in the 
suspension (i.e., trapped in the gel formed after oxida -
tion) were quantified by separately measuring the optical 
absorbance of the adhesive film and the assay solution. 
Reducing the FgrGaOx loading by 80% reduced gel for -
mation by 76.4%. The product formation, on the other 
hand, dropped by only 7.5%. Compared to the origi -
nal FgrGaOx dose, aminated galactomannan produced 
using 20% of the original FgrGaOx loading was observ -
ably more homogeneous and fluid-like (Additional file  1: 
Fig. S5B). Further reducing the FgrGaOx dose resulted in 
a linear reduction in product formation. Increasing the 
SpATA dose resulted in a linear increase in product for -
mation over 4 h (Fig.  8) and increasing the SpATA dose 
three times (from 0.15 to 0.45  mg/mL) increased the 
product yield after 32  h by 44%. Notably, for all tested 
ATA loadings, reactions stopped after 32  h regardless 
of the aminated galactomannan yield or the amount of 
remaining oxidized substrate.
Mutant design and testing
Given the higher yield of SpATA-catalyzed aminations 
compared to CvATA, SpATA serves as a preferred start -
ing point for protein engineering aimed at enhancing the 
enzymatic synthesis of aminated polysaccharides from 
plant sources. Inspection of the SpATA surface revealed 
closely positioned hydrophobic and aromatic residues 
near the active site entrance that could form a potential 
polysaccharide binding cleft. Using docking simulations, 
four hydrophilic amino acids were identified as block -
ing polysaccharide access to the putative binding surface 
(Additional file  1: Fig. S6 and Fig.  9). To maintain the 
Fig. 5 ESI-Q-TOF MS spectra (positive ionization mode) of aminated galactose produced via CvATA and SpATA treatments with simultaneous 
FgrGaOx oxidation. The relative abundance of aminated galactose was quantified using HEPES as an internal reference. Reactions (1 mL) comprised 
50 mM HEPES (pH 7.5), 29.8 µg/mL FgrGaOx, 1.8 µg/mL HRP , 12.8 µg/mL catalase, 0.15 mg/mL ATA, 20 µM PLP , 5 mM (S)-1-phenylethylamine 
and 5 mM galactose were carried out at 37 °C and 600 rpm for 5 h

hydrophobicity of the region and reduce the steric hin -
drance of polysaccharide binding, four alanine substi -
tutions (E34A, K93A, Y403A and E407A) were created 
following an alanine scanning strategy [28].
Ten SpATA mutants were constructed, including four 
single mutants (E34A, K93A, Y403A, E407A), three dou -
ble mutants (E34A/K93A, K93A/Y403A, Y403A/E407A), 
two triple mutants (E34A/K93A/Y403A, E34A/K93A/
E407A), and one mutant containing all four amino acid 
substitutions. The Q-NPEA assay was used to quantify 
the formation of aminated products from FgrGaOx-
oxidized galactomannan (Fig.  10). Compared to wild-
type SpATA, single mutations E34A, K93A and Y403A 
showed no or detrimental effects on product yield, 
whereas mutants with combined mutations E34A/K93A, 
K93A/Y403A and E34A/K93A/Y403A increased product 
yield after 30  h by 9.3–19.3%. Most notably, the E407A 
substitution reduced product yield of wild-type SpATA 
by 35.3%; moreover, introducing the E407A substitution 
to E34A/K93A and E34A/K93A/Y403A reduced corre -
sponding product yields by 29.0% and 13.7%, respectively.
Discussion
Amine transaminases are versatile biocatalysts that 
have the potential to substitute harmful chemical cata -
lysts and harsh reaction conditions in the production of 
high-value chiral amines. The substrate scope of ATAs 
is typically evaluated using the acetophenone assay [29], 
a well-established method relying on the detection of 
Fig. 6 The XPS spectra showing nitrogen profiles of CvATA 
and SpATA aminated galactomannan with oxidized and non-oxidized 
galactomannan as references. The spectra were adjusted by scaling 
amide peaks to the same height so the amine peaks could be 
directly compared. The intensity of peaks is shown using a linear 
scale. Reactions (500 µL) comprised 50 mM potassium phosphate 
buffer (pH 7.5), 20 µM PLP , 29.8 µg/mL FgrGaOx, 12.8 µg/mL 
catalase, 1.8 µg/mL HRP , 0.15 mg/mL ATA, 5 mM (S)-1-PEA and 0.29% 
galactomannan containing 5 mM galactose. Reactions were carried 
out at 37 °C and 600 rpm for 24 h in 1.5 mL centrifuge tubes. The 
oxidized reference did not contain ATA, and the non-oxidized 
reference did not contain any enzymes. Enzymes (SpATA, FgrGaOx, 
catalase, and HRP) were added to both references after reactions 
to the concentrations stated above. Samples were desalted 
immediately using 100 kDa centrifuge filters before freeze–drying 
and XPS analyses

doses. The 1.0 × FgrGaOx dose corresponds to 29.8 µg/mL FgrGaOx, 12.8 µg/mL catalase, and 1.8 µg/mL HRP . All reactions were carried out at 37 °C 
and 600 rpm on 96-well plates (n = 4, error bars indicate standard errors)

UV-absorbing acetophenone when the amino donor 
1-phenylethylamine (1-PEA) is deaminated. Although 
the assay is highly sensitive and easy to deploy, aceto -
phenone evaporation and limitations on enzyme con -
centration and UV-absorbance of the amino acceptor are 
major drawbacks affecting the versatility of the assay [30]. 
The NPEA assay developed by Baud et al. [27] offers an 
alternative way of ATA screening. By generating a colored 
precipitate, the assay provides visual confirmation of 
reaction progress, however, the formation of an opaque 
suspension means that it can only be used for semi-quan-
titative comparisons of ATA activity [30]. In this study, 
the Q-NPEA assay was established, which builds from 
the NPEA assay and enables accurate quantification of

sites were replaced with PMP to construct the holoenzyme. A galactomannan oligosaccharide with an 11-mannose backbone and one galactose 
side chain on the fifth mannose unit connected via α-(1→6)-linkage was used in the docking simulation

the reaction product. Compared to other colorimetric 
assays, such as the Ehrlich test presented by Cairns et al. 
[30] which requires the addition of the Ehrlich reagent 
containing concentrated HCl and alcohol to measure 
indole formation, the Q-NPEA assay is easy to set up and 
allows continuous conversion measurements without 
terminating the reaction using additional reagents. Addi -
tionally, the selective binding of product precipitates to 
the transparent adhesive film allows for ATA screening 
on insoluble substrates, such as oxidized cellulose and 
other biopolymers, which are often difficult compounds 
to screen using spectrophotometric assays.
Using the Q-NPEA assay, the activity of both CvATA 
and SpATA towards oxidized polysaccharides was con -
firmed, specifically oxidized galactomannan and xylo -
glucan, on which activities were comparable to those 
measured on oxidized oligosaccharides. Although 
CvATA showed higher initial activity, SpATA remained 
active over longer reaction times, which led to higher 
product yield and a higher degree of polysaccharide 
amination. By balancing the FgrGaOx and SpATA 
loadings, gel formation in simultaneous galactoman -
nan oxidation–transamination reactions was signifi -
cantly suppressed without negatively impacting the 
product yield. Simply increasing SpATA concentration 
increased product yield; however, enzyme deactivation 
after 32  h regardless of SpATA loading suggests that 
low operational stability is the main factor limiting the 
enzyme performance (Fig. 8 ).
CvATA deactivation was previously investigated and 
is believed to result from dimer dissociation [31, 32]. 
The “phosphate group binding cup” (PGBC) in the ATA 
active site consists of conserved amino acids that bind 
the PLP/PMP cofactor and maintain the integrity of the 
ATA structure via non-covalent interactions bridged by 
the bound cofactors (Additional file  1: Fig. S7) [33– 35]. 
According to Börner et al. [31], the formation of the less 
stable ATA–PMP complex in the first half-transamina -
tion reaction allows PMP to escape, which destabilizes 
the PGBC and can lead to the dissociation, unfold -
ing, and irreversible deactivation of the ATA (Fig.  11). 
This mechanism explains CvATA deactivation and the 
discoloration of the reaction media (Additional file  1: 
Fig. S8) with PLP depletion, which is supported by 
the ESI-Q-MS detection of PMP-derived compounds 
in discolored reaction medium (Additional file  1: Fig. 
S9) [31]. For SpATA, however, PMP formation was not 
detected in reactions containing only (S )-1-PEA and 
the PLP cofactor, suggesting an alternative deactivation 
pathway that involves the amino acceptor. Evidently, 
the creation of SpATA variants with improved opera -
tional stability will require a deeper understanding of 
the ATA inactivation mechanism.
To date, attempts to engineer ATAs have primarily 
focused on enhancing the catalytic efficiency and broad -
ening the substrate scope of ATA for better acceptance of 
monomeric substrates with bulky substituents [36–41]. 
Strategies have focused on engineering the substrate

indicates the conversion achieved by the wild-type SpATA in 30 h, and percentages indicate how 30-h conversions achieved by SpATA variants 
compare to the wild-type SpATA. Reactions (200 µL) consisted of 50 mM HEPES buffer (pH 7.5), 29.8 µg/mL FgrGaOx, 12.8 µg/mL catalase, 1.8 µg/
mL HRP , 0.15 mg/mL ATA, 10 mM NPEA, 20 µM PLP and 0.29% galactomannan containing 5 mM galactose. Reactions were conducted at 37 °C 
and 600 rpm on a 96-well plate (n = 4, error bars indicate standard errors)

binding pockets, whereas positions distant from the 
active site are often overlooked. Herein, a structure-
based approach was used to modify surface-exposed 
amino acids on SpATA that could improve the bind -
ing of polysaccharide substrates to the enzyme surface. 
Although single mutations did not show positive effects 
on enzyme activity, mutants with multiple alanine substi-
tutions other than the E407A increased the yield of ami -
nated galactomannan. Saturation mutagenesis could be 
used at the positions identified herein to further improve 
SpATA activity on oxidized polysaccharides. Notably, 
the kcat of the E407A variant (1.9 ± 0.2   s−1) on pyruvate 
was 2.5 times lower than wild-type SpATA (4.8 ± 0.7  s−1) 
(Additional file  1: Fig. S10), which may be attributed to 
the location of E407A mutation near the interfacial loops 
that stabilize the dimeric structure of SpATA (Additional 
file 1: Fig. S11) [42].
Although the SpATA activity on oxidized carbohy -
drates may be improved through further enhancing 
substrate binding, the low operational stability and low 
affinity of the enzyme towards the PLP and PMP cofac -
tors remain problems affecting its applications in indus -
trial processes. In general, amino acid sequences of fold 
type I ATAs are highly conserved at the cofactor binding 
pocket near the PGBP [33–35] but are less conserved 
near the pyridinium ring binding motif. A study by Roura 
et al. [43] identified a single point mutation (V124N) in 
CvATA that enhances hydrogen bonding with the PMP 
pyridinium nitrogen, increasing the enzyme’s affinity to 
PMP by 3 times. The equivalent position in SpATA is 
already an asparagine, which may explain the compara -
tively high operational stability of SpATA. Nevertheless, 
maximizing SpATA catalytic cycles and product yield 
from the oxidation–transamination cascade required an 
exogenous supply of PLP , justifying enzyme engineering 
efforts that focus on further increasing the cofactor affin -
ity of SpATA.
Conclusions
Using a one-pot oxidation–transamination cascade, this 
work established a fully enzymatic pathway for amina -
tions of plant-derived polysaccharides. Validated using 
HPLC-RI and a GC–MS-based deuterium labeling 
method, the Q-NPEA assay developed herein enabled 
simple and accurate time-course yield measurements 
for transamination reactions. Balancing the activity 
of FgrGaOx and ATAs used in the cascade effectively 
suppressed gel formation without substantially reduc -
ing product yield. Via rational design, alanine substitu -
tions were performed on selected surface amino acids 
of SpATA which have potential effects on polysaccha -
ride binding. Mutants with multiple alanine substitu -
tions other than E407A produced up to 20% higher 
product yield. The E407A mutation showed detrimen -
tal effects on SpATA activity, and the position may have 
important functions in maintaining the dimeric enzyme 
structure. The low operational stability of ATAs, caused 
by low affinity towards the PLP and PMP cofactors, was

identified as a major problem limiting the yield of ami -
nated products. To increase the applicability of the 
designed cascade in industrial settings, amino acid posi -
tions in ATA structure affecting the cofactor binding 
need to be identified and exploited.

Production and purification of amine transaminases 
from Chromobacterium violaceum (CvATA) and Silicibacter 
pomeroyi  (SpATA)
The ATA production and purification protocol was 
adopted from Aumala et  al. [13] with minor modifica -
tions. Briefly, the E. coli BL21(DE3) strains containing 
pET-29(a)+ and pET-22(b)+ plasmids subcloned with 
codon-optimized CvATA and SpATA genes, respec -
tively, were cultivated in LB media (Miller) supplemented 
with 50  µg/mL kanamycin and 100  µg/mL ampicillin, 
respectively. The cultures were grown at 37  °C until the 
optical density at 600  nm reached 0.6–0.8, and enzyme 
productions were induced by adding 1  mM isopropyl-
β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) to the cell cultures. 
The inductions were conducted for 15–16 h at 30 °C and 
220 rpm. The cells were pelleted by centrifugation, resus -
pended in the lysis buffer (50 mM potassium phosphate 
at pH 7.5, supplemented with 0.1  mM PLP and 20  mM 
imidazole), and sonicated to release the intracellularly 
expressed ATAs.
After cell lysis, the lysates were clarified by centrifu -
gation (15,000×g, 90  min), and the ATAs were purified 
using Ni–NTA columns (the washing step was done with 
the lysis buffer, and the elution buffer contains 50  mM 
potassium phosphate at pH 7.5, supplemented with 
0.1  mM PLP and 500  mM imidazole). Buffer exchange 
was performed using 50 mL centrifuge filters with 10 kDa 
MWCO, and the purified ATAs were stored in 50  mM 
potassium phosphate (pH 7.5) buffer containing 0.1 mM 
PLP . The concentration and purity of the purified ATAs 
were determined using the Bradford assay and SDS-
PAGE, respectively. The ATAs were diluted to 30 mg/mL, 
aliquoted, and stored at − 80 °C until further use.
Activity measurements via the acetophenone assay
The activity of ATAs towards selected amino accep -
tors was measured using the acetophenone assay, which 
measures the rate of acetophenone generation by meas -
uring the UV-absorbance of the assay mixture at 245 nm. 
Assay mixtures contained 50  mM HEPES buffer (pH 
7.5), 5  mM (S)-1-PEA, 20  µM PLP , and 5  mM pyruvate 
or selected carbohydrates containing 5  mM galactose. 
When oxidized carbohydrates were used as  the amino 
acceptor, 29.8 µg/mL FgrGaOx, 12.8 µg/mL catalase, and 
1.8 µg/mL HRP were also added. The assay mixtures were 
pre-oxidized at 37  °C for an hour, and transamination 
reactions were carried out on a UV-compatible 96-well 
microtiter plate at 200  µL volumes. For each reaction, 
30  µg ATA was added (300  ng when using pyruvate as 
the amino acceptor), and the plate was moved immedi -
ately to a plate reader operating at 37 °C without shaking. 
The absorbance readings were taken at 245  nm in 30-s 
intervals for 30  min, and linear portions of the absorb -
ance-vs-time graphs were used to calculate the rates of 
acetophenone formation. All experiments were con -
ducted in 4 replicates (n = 4).
ATA kinetic parameter measurements 
via the acetophenone assay
The kinetic parameters of ATAs were measured using 
the acetophenone assay and using pyruvate with con -
centrations from 0.001 to 0.1 mM as the amino acceptor. 
The reactions were performed in the same way as in the 
activity measurements except for using variable pyruvate 
concentration. Reactions (200  µL) were performed on a 
UV-compatible 96-well microtiter plate at 37 °C without 
shaking. The UV-absorbance of the assay mixtures was 
measured at 245 nm in 20-s intervals for 10 min, and the 
initial linear portion of absorbance-vs-time graphs was 
used to calculate the rate of acetophenone formation. The 
initial rates were plotted against pyruvate concentrations, 
and kinetic parameters were calculated using Prism 10 
software.
Conversion measurements via the Q‑NPEA assay
The conversions of transamination reactions were meas -
ured using the Q-NPEA assay. The assay mixtures were 
prepared the same way as in the acetophenone assay 
except that 10  mM NPEA was used instead of 5  mM 
Page 12 of 15Feng et al. Biotechnology for Biofuels and Bioproducts           (2024) 17:34 
(S)-1-PEA. The enzymes, including FgrGaOx, catalase, 
HRP , and ATAs were added at variable loadings depend-
ing on the objective of the experiment. The assay reac -
tions were performed in 200 µL volumes in a transparent 
96-well microtiter plate. After loading all assay compo -
nents, the plate was sealed using a piece of transparent 
and adhesive film (Bio-Rad MSB-1001) and was incu -
bated with the film side facing down in a thermomixer 
at 37  °C and 600  rpm. The absorbance of reactions was 
measured at 440  nm using a plate reader at 9 different 
points with the film side facing up, and the absorbance 
values were averaged and converted to NPEA consump -
tion using a standard curve (described below). Normally, 
absorbance readings are taken with the film attached to 
the plate. For the experiment described in Fig.  7, how -
ever, the film was peeled off, rinsed with water, and re-
applied onto a clean plate, and absorbance readings were 
taken separately from both plates.
The standard curve was constructed using 0.1 to 
1.0  mM pyruvate as the amino acceptor and 10  mM 
NPEA as the amino donor. Besides pyruvate and NPEA, 
assay mixtures also contained 50  mM HEPES, 20  µM 
PLP , and 0.15  mg/mL SpATA. The reactions were per -
formed in 200 µL volumes following the Q-NPEA assay 
protocol. The absorbance of each reaction was measured 
at 440 nm and mapped to the corresponding initial pyru -
vate concentration. The assay mixtures were analyzed in 
parallel using HPLC-RI, and complete pyruvate depletion 
was confirmed for reactions with all pyruvate concentra -
tions. All experiments were performed with 4 replicates 
(n = 4).
Confirmation of galactose aminations by ESI‑Q‑TOF MS
Aminated galactose samples for ESI-Q-TOF MS analysis 
were produced in 1 mL volumes using (S)-1-PEA as the 
amino donor. The reaction mixtures were prepared the 
same way as in the acetophenone assay. The reactions 
were performed in 1.5  mL microcentrifuge tubes on a 
thermomixer operating at 37 °C and 600 rpm for 5 h. The 
products were purified by filtration using a Pall Nanosep 
centrifuge filter (1 kDa cutoff) and diluted 10 times prior 
to the MS analyses (the diluted samples contained 5 mM 
HEPES buffer and 0.5  mM original/oxidized/aminated 
galactose). The ESI-Q-TOF MS data were acquired by 
the BioZone mass spectrometry facility (University of 
Toronto) using a Q Exactive Orbitrap mass spectrom -
eter (Thermo Scientific) with nano-electrospray ionizer 
in positive mode. Data analysis and visualization were 
performed using the Xcalibur software. All samples were 
produced in triplicates (n = 3).
Confirmation of galactomannan amination by X‑ray 
photoelectron spectroscopy
Aminations of galactomannan were performed the same 
way as galactose aminations except for using 50  mM 
potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.5) instead of HEPES 
and a longer reaction time of 24 h. The oxidized reference 
was produced without the addition of ATA and the non-
oxidized reference was produced without any enzyme. 
After reactions, SpATA was added to the oxidized ref -
erence, and SpATA, FgrGaOx, catalase, and HRP were 
added to the non-oxidized reference to make the refer -
ences have the same composition as aminated samples. 
The products were desalted using Amicon Ultra-0.5 cen -
trifuge filters (100  kDa cutoff) to remove proteins and 
residual amino donors and were washed repetitively until 
the calculated buffer concentration fell below 0.1% of the 
original value (1000× dilution). The desalted products 
were freeze–dried, and the XPS analyses were performed 
by OCCAM (University of Toronto) using a K-Alpha 
X-ray photoelectron spectrometer system (Thermo 
Scientific).
Galactose oxidase activity measurement using the ABTS 
assay
The ABTS assay was conducted in 250  µL volumes on 
a transparent 96-well microtiter plate. The assay mix -
ture comprised 50  mM HEPES buffer (pH 7.5), 5  mM 
galactose, 2 mM ABTS, 1.8 µg/mL HRP , and 29.8 ng/mL 
FgrGaOx. Before adding galactose, the mixtures were 
incubated at 30  °C for 15  min to activate galactose oxi -
dase. After adding all components, the microtiter plate 
was immediately transferred to a plate reader operating 
at 30 °C, where the absorbance of reactions was measured 
at 420 nm for 30 min in 30-s intervals without shaking. 
The activity of FgrGaOx was calculated from the linear 
portion of the absorbance-vs-time graph. In the product 
inhibition experiment (Additional file  1: Fig. S12), 5 mM 
C-2 glucosamine was added to the assay reaction as a 
model aminated product. All other components and pro -
cedures remain the same.
Degree of galactomannan amination measurement using 
a GC–MS‑based deuterium labeling method
The degree of galactomannan amination was measured 
by comparing the DO prior to and after transamination 
reactions. The DO of galactomannan was measured using 
a GC–MS-based deuterium labeling method described in 
Parikka et al. [15], and the protocol described in the paper 
was adopted with minor changes. Briefly, oxidation and 
transamination reactions were performed in series using 
the same reaction mixture and experimental setup as used 
in XPS sample preparations. During the oxidation stage, 
250 µL reaction mixtures containing 59.6 µg/mL FgrGaOx,

25.6  µg/mL catalase, 3.6  µg/mL HRP , and 0.58% galacto-
mannan (equivalent to 10  mM galactose) was transferred 
to a 2-mL centrifuge tube and was incubated at 37 °C and 
600 rpm for 4 h in a thermomixer without controlling the 
oxygen level. The product was heated to 100 °C for 5 min 
to deactivate the oxidase, and other reaction components 
were added. The final composition of the reaction (500 µL) 
was the same as that used for preparing XPS samples. After 
adding the ATA, the reaction was again incubated at 37 °C 
and 600 rpm for 12 h. Following the transamination reac-
tion, 3 mg of  NaBD4 was added to each reaction to reduce 
the remaining oxidized galactose back to the non-oxidized 
form and have a deuterium atom replacing a hydrogen 
atom in the C-6 hydroxyl group. The reactions were then 
stirred overnight at room temperature. After the reduc -
tion, the remaining  NaBD4 in the product was neutralized 
by adding 15  µL acetic acid. Galactomannan was precipi-
tated using 70% ethanol and collected by centrifugation. 
The precipitated galactomannan was dried under a stream 
of nitrogen at 40  °C and acid methanolyzed using 2  mL 
methanolysis reagent at 100 °C for 3 h. The degraded prod-
uct was again dried under a stream of nitrogen at 40  °C, 
and silylation was performed by adding 1 µL trimethylsilyl 
chloride, 99  µL N,O-Bis(trimethylsilyl)trifluoroacetamide, 
and 100  µL pyridine to each sample and incubating the 
samples for 1  h at 60  °C. The silylated product was dried 
under nitrogen at room temperature and dissolved in 1 mL 
of heptane. The final products were filtered using 0.22 µm 
filters and analyzed using GC–MS.
The GC–MS (Agilent 5977B MSD no FID, DB-5HT 
column) was performed at 17  psi using 150  °C helium as 
the elution gas. The column temperature profile was set 
to 150  °C (3  min)–2  °C/min–180  °C–4  °C/min–200  °C 
(5  min). Under this setup, the galactose peak appeared 
11.6  min after elution started, with m/z 361 and m /z 362 
peaks corresponding to the non-oxidized and oxidized 
galactose, respectively. Using the benchmarking data from 
Parikka et al. [15], the DO of galactomannan was calculated 
as:
where A and B are the relative abundance of the m/z 361 
and m/z 362 peaks, respectively. For aminated galacto -
mannan, the DO needs to be corrected for amination 
using:
where oxidation percentage Oxidation % is the value cal -
culated using Eq. (1), and reference oxidation percentage 
(Oxidationref % ) is the DO measured for the oxidized 
reference (with no ATA). The degree of galactomannan 
(1)Oxidation % = B−A/3
B+2A/3 × 100% ,
(2)
Oxidation Corr % = Oxidation % × 1−Oxidationref %
1−Oxidation % ,
amination was then calculated as the differences between 
the corrected and reference oxidation percentages.
Identification of amino acids important for polysaccharide 
binding using docking simulation
The substrate docking simulations were performed using 
AutoDock FR [45]. The apo-form SpATA structure was 
obtained from the RCSB PDB database and modified 
by substituting the sulfate ions in active sites with PLP 
or PMP to generate holo-form structures. The SpATA 
mutants were created using the mutagenesis function and 
energy-minimized using the optimize function in Pymol. 
The receptor files were prepared by removing water and 
non-polar hydrogens, and the locations of binding pock -
ets were determined using the AutoDock Tools. A galac -
tomannan oligosaccharide with an 11-mannose backbone 
and one galactose connected to the fifth mannose unit 
via α-(1→6)-linkage was used in the docking simulation. 
The simulations were performed with an exhaustiveness 
of 16 and the results were visualized in Pymol.
Site‑directed mutagenesis and transformation into E. coli 
hosts
The genes encoding the SpATA mutants were pro -
duced using the Agilent QuikChange site-directed 
mutagenesis kit and following the manufacturer’s pro -
tocol with minor modifications. A list of primers and 
their properties, as well as the PCR reaction settings, 
are summarized in Additional file  1: Table  S1. Using 
the Qiagen Miniprep DNA extraction kit, the template 
plasmids were extracted from the corresponding E. coli  
DH5α strains, and the concentrations of the templates 
were measured using a nanodrop spectrophotometer 
(Thermo Scientific). The PCR reactions were performed 
following the manufacturer’s protocol, and products 
were analyzed using DNA agarose gel to confirm suc -
cessful gene amplification. The amplified products were 
digested with DpnI endonuclease to remove the tem -
plates and transformed into electrocompetent E. coli  
DH5α cells via electroporation. The transformed strains 
were cultivated in SOC medium for 1 h and inoculated 
on LB (Miller) plates supplemented with  0.15 mg/mL 
ampicillin. Successfully transformed hosts were fur -
ther cultivated in liquid media, and their plasmids were 
extracted and sequenced to verify the incorporation 
of designed mutations. Plasmids with designed muta -
tions were then transformed into chemically competent 
E. coli BL21(DE3) cells, which were again cultivated in 
SOC medium and plated on LB plates with 0.15 mg/mL 
ampicillin and stored in 25% (v/v) glycerol at −  80  °C 
until further use.
