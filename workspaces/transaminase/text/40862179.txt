Along with the increasing prevalence of type 1 diabetes (T1D), 
there has been a growing concern about its associated 
comorbidities, such as fatty liver disease.[1] Fatty liver disease, 
also known as non‑alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), is 
a common liver condition that affects individuals with T1D 
and obesity. NAFLD is characterized by the accumulation of 
fat in the liver, which can lead to inflammation, scarring, and 
liver damage.[2] The relationship between T1D and NAFLD 
Abstract
Background: At present, increasing evidence has reported circulating microRNAs (miRNAs) as potential clinical biomarkers for specific 
diseases and administration of pharmaceutical agents. The main aim of this study was to compare the effect of two selected home‑based 
resistance exercise (HBRE) and game‑based exercise training (GBET) groups on microRNA21‑5p expression and biomarkers related to 
non‑alcoholic fatty liver in children with type 1 diabetes (T1D).
Materials and Methods: Twenty children with T1D aged 10–15 years were randomly assigned to one of two groups (HBRE: n = 10; GBET: 
n = 10). The exercise training lasted for 8 weeks with three sessions per week. The liver enzyme profile, hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), glucose, 
microRNA‑21‑5p, insulin, and Homeostasis Model Assessment for Insulin Resistance (HOMA‑IR) levels were measured before and after the 
interventions in both groups. In addition, the cardiopulmonary fitness and body fat percentage (BF%) of the participants were also evaluated.
Results: After exercise interventions, miR‑21‑5p increased significantly for both intervention groups (HBRE: 8.9% vs. GBET: 6.7%; P = 0.001). 
The levels of alanine transaminase (ALT) (HBRE: 60.71% vs. GBET: 49.15%) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) enzymes (HBRE: 
54.02% vs. GBET: 34.02%), the glucose (HBRE: 15.03% vs. GBET: 16.26%), and the HbA1c (HBRE: ‑10.44% vs. GBET: ‑6.52%) were 
decreased significantly (P ≤ 0.05). The cardiorespiratory endurance of subjects increased (HBRE: 2.85% vs. GBET: 3.75%), but there were 
no differences between groups (P ≥ 0.05).
Conclusions: Both HBRE and GBET protocols were effective to improve cardiorespiratory fitness, liver enzyme profile, glycemic control, 
and miR‑21‑5p changes that seem to be indicative of the pathological status of T1D children.

is complex and not yet fully understood. However, recent 
research has shed light on the mechanisms underlying the 
development of NAFLD in individuals with T1D.[3]
Results of different studies about the prevalence of NAFLD 
in patients with T1D are not similar, and some reported 
a higher rate of fatty liver in this population compared to 
individuals without T1D.[4] The exact mechanisms underlying 
the development of fatty liver disease in T1D are not yet fully 
understood, but several factors have been implicated.[2] Studies 
have shown that poor glycemic control, longer duration of 
T1D, and obesity are associated with an increased risk of 
developing fatty liver disease in patients with T1D.[5] Longer 
duration of T1D is also associated with an increased risk of 
fatty liver disease, possibly due to the cumulative effect of 
chronic hyperglycemia and insulin resistance. [4] Obesity is a 
well‑established risk factor for cardiovascular problems and 
fatty liver disease, and its prevalence is particularly high in 
patients with T1D who are overweight/obese.[6] Studies have 
shown that lifestyle interventions, better glycemic control, and 
exercise training can prevent and manage fatty liver disease 
in patients with T1D. [7] However, physical exercise can be 
difficult due to glycemic disturbances and hypoglycemia risk, 
which are major barriers. Adolescents with T1D face these 
diabetes‑specific challenges in addition to common physical 
exercise barriers.
Physical exercise can reduce liver fat and improve liver function 
in T1D patients. [8] Physical activity may impact NAFLD 
prevention and treatment by affecting mitochondrial function 
and structure. However, the roles of microRNAs (miRNAs), 
DNA methylation, and histone modification in NAFLD 
development remain unclear and require further investigation.[8]
Recent research has examined the involvement of miRNAs 
in the development and progression of NAFLD in children. 
Dysregulation of miR‑122, miR‑34a, miR‑21, and miR‑192 
has been observed in children with NAFLD, suggesting their 
potential role in regulating lipid metabolism, inflammation, 
and fibrosis in the liver. Targeting these miRNAs could be 
a potential therapeutic approach for treating NAFLD in 
children.[8] However, further research is needed to validate 
their use as diagnostic and therapeutic tools.
The increasing incidence of T1D and its related complications 
emphasizes the need for effective interventions to prevent or 
manage these conditions. Physical exercise has shown promise 
in preventing and managing fatty liver disease, a common 
comorbidity in T1D patients. Noninvasive diagnostic markers, 
such as miRNAs, are dysregulated in patients with NAFLD, 
indicating their potential use as diagnostic and therapeutic 
tools.[8]
Considering that both home‑based resistance exercise (HBRE) 
and game‑based exercise training (GBET) protocols could 
overcome key barriers to exercise in adolescents with T1D. 
This study aims to investigate the effect of two selected HBRE 
and GBET groups on miR‑21‑a level and biomarkers related 
to non‑alcoholic fatty liver in children with T1D. The research 
seeks to determine whether changes in miRNA levels due to 
exercise interventions can serve as biomarkers to predict future 
non‑communicable disease risks in adulthood. The study could 
provide valuable insights into the benefits of physical exercise 
and miRNA evaluation for high‑risk populations, such as T1D 
children and adolescents.
MaterIals and Methods
Design and population
This study was designed as a randomized controlled trial with a 
pretest‑posttest design that was held in Isfahan, Iran. T1D patients 
aged 10–15 years referred to diabetes clinics of Isfahan City 
were enrolled in the study. The exclusion criteria for participants 
were as follows: (1) voluntary withdrawal of participants for 
any reason; (2) illness and injury or inability to exercise during 
the research period; and (3) absence of more than three sessions 
during the training period. The Consolidated Standards of 
Reporting Trials (CONSORT) diagram of participants’ recruitment, 
allocation, and analysis is indicated in Figure 1. The consent 
form was obtained from parents and students before the start 
of the course. Selected were randomly assigned to two groups: 
HBRE (n = 10) and GBET (n = 10).
Before the training sessions, all selected patients with T1D and 
their parents were informed about the details of the training 
sessions and the protocol. They were also trained on how to 
achieve better glycemic control before, during, and after the 
training sessions, based on the recommended guidelines for 
exercise in children with T1D.
This comprehensive training ensured that both the participants and 
their parents were fully informed about the structure, objectives,

and proper execution of the training program. The training was 
conducted in accordance with the established guidelines for 
exercise management in pediatric T1D populations.[8]
The goal was to equip the patients and their parents with the 
necessary knowledge and skills to effectively manage the patients’ 
glycemic levels throughout the training sessions, in order to 
optimize the safety and benefits of the exercise program.
To make sure that the effect of the exercise interventions was 
less affected by other covariate variables, participants and their 
parents were instructed to maintain their regular diet and daily 
physical activity during the exercise intervention periods.
Measurements
Anthropometric measurements
Participants’ body weight and height were assessed at 
baseline. The body mass index (BMI) was calculated by 
dividing the weight by the square of the height in meters. 
Body fat percentage (BF%) was determined using a body 
composition analyzer (InBody 270, Korea).[9] The peak oxygen 
uptake (VO2peak) was assessed by the 20‑m multistage shuttle 
run test using the standard procedure. The total number of laps 
has been used to estimate peak oxygen consumption (VO2peak), 
using the formula proposed by Matsuzaka et al.[10]
Biochemical measurements
The extraction of serum and biochemical measurements
The blood samples containing 5cc following 12 hours of 
overnight fasting in pretest‑posttest phases (24 hours before 
and 48 hours after the last training session) were collected from 
the left brachial vein in the sitting position and transferred 
to test tubes. The blood samples were centrifuged at 4°C for 
10 minutes at a speed of 3000 RPM, and the resulting serums 
were frozen at ‑80°C until further measurements of fasting 
blood sugar (FBS), hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), liver function 
tests, and insulin levels.
The diagnostic kits of Pars Azmoon (Tehran, Iran) were used 
for the measurement of FBS and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) 
and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) liver enzymes. HbA1c 
levels were measured using the high‑performance liquid 
chromatography (HPLC) method with Labnovation LD‑600 
equipment (China). Insulin resistance was calculated by three 
formulas as follows: Homeostasis Model Assessment for 
Insulin Resistance (HOMA‑IR) = (fasting plasma glucose 
level [mg/dL] × fasting insulin level [μunit/mL])/405.[11]
The measurement of serum miR‑21‑a
The reverse transcription‑quantitative polymerase chain 
reaction (RT‑qPCR) method was applied to measure the serum 
level of miRNA‑21‑a. To this end, miRNA was first extracted 
from serum samples by PAXgene Blood miRNA Kit (Qiagen, 
Germany) based on the method provided by the manufacturer. 
cDNA Synthesis Kit was used for RT of the extracted RNAs 
based on the manufacturer’s recommended protocols. Then, 
the human miRNA‑21‑a sequence was extracted from the 
miRBase database and the desired primer was designed by 
the web‑based software miRNA design tool to perform RT 
and qPCR. The processes of RT and qPCR were conducted 
using the kit prepared by Ansal Company (Tehran, Iran), 
including primer sequences and SYBR Green‑based Master 
Mix. In this study, U6 was considered a control gene. RT was 
performed according to the technique provided by the kit, 
and qPCR was performed using Rotor‑Gene 6000 (Corvette, 
Australia) during 40 two‑stage cycles including 30 seconds 
at 95 degrees and 30 seconds at 60 degrees. The melting test 
was conducted at 65 to 95 degrees in 1‑degree increments. 
The findings were analyzed by the REST software to calculate 
the relative expression (fold change) for each candidate 
miRNA within each group and were then calculated using 
the equation: 2 ‑ΔΔCt.[12,13] The results were represented based 
on the ∆ ct of pretest and posttest of each group as well as 
their fold changes.
Exercise interventions
Resistance exercises were performed three times a week and 
were designed as HBRE, so the resistance was human body 
weight. Values for intensity, duration, and effort gains in the 
HBRE group were closely monitored. [14] To do this, subjects 
performed their exercises under the guidance of a researcher 
once a week, while they recorded their activities in home 
sessions (twice a week). The videos were sent weekly to the 
research team. Table 1 summarizes the exercise program of the 
HBRT group.[15] In the GBET group, subjects were required to 
participate in their leisure activities, such as soccer, cycling, 
volleyball, swimming, and gymnastics, 3 days a week, for a 
total of 150 minutes of regular exercise per week.[16] Practicing 
basic sports skills and playing games starts with 50 minutes 
in the first week, increasing by 5 minutes every 2 weeks and 
about 75 minutes in the final training. Each session included 
15 minutes of warm‑up and cool‑down exercises.
As mentioned above, all patients and their parents were trained 
on how to achieve better glycemic control before, during, 
and after the training sessions, based on the recommended 
guidelines for exercise in children with T1D.
Statistical analysis
To calculate the mean and standard deviation values of the 
variables, descriptive statistics were used. The Shapiro‑Wilk 
test was used to determine the normality of the data. 
To determine the effects of the intervention, analysis of 
covariance (ANCOV A) test was used, with the changes in 
miR‑21‑a, liver enzymes, VO2peak as the dependent variables, 
and baseline data of miR‑21‑a, lipid liver enzymes, VO 2 
peak, and BF% as the covariates. The IBM SPSS software 
version 22 (IBM, Armonk, New York, USA) was used for the 
analysis of data. The significance level was set at P ≤ 0.05.
results
Twenty adolescents, both boys and girls, participated in the 
study. The mean ages of participants in the HBRE and GBET 
groups were 12.6 (±1.3) and 12.4 (±0.8) years, respectively.

The two study groups were matched for age and sex [in the 
HBRE group: female/male = 6/4; in the GBET group: female/
male = 7/3 (P > 0.05)]. The characteristics of the participants 
in the two studied groups at baseline and after the training 
period are presented in Table 2.
At baseline (pretest), participants in both groups were similar 
in terms of weight, BMI, percentage of body fat, and VO 2 
peak (P > 0.05). The mean levels of biochemical variables 
of participants at baseline and posttest are shown in Table 3. 
The mean level of ALT, AST, glucose, HbA1c, and miR‑21‑a 
has a significant change after the training period in the two 
studied groups (P < 0.05). The mean level of HOMA‑IR had 
no significant change after training sessions (P < 0.05). The 
insulin level increased significantly in the GBET group after 
training (P < 0.05).
As shown in Figure 2, miR‑21‑a levels were significantly changed 
in the HBRE and GBET groups after intervention (within‑group 
variability) (HBRE: 8.9% vs. GBET: 9.2%;  P  = 0.012; 
η2 = 0.228), but no significant differences were observed 
between the two experimental groups (P = 0.513; η2 = 0.118).
dIscussIon
This study aimed to investigate the effects of two selected exercise 
modes, HBRT and GBET, on the levels of miR21‑a, liver enzymes, 
fasting blood sugar, insulin, and insulin resistance in adolescents 
with T1D. The results showed a slight but significant increase in 
miR‑21a levels after 8 weeks of exercise interventions in both 
HBRT and GBET groups after training. However, there was no 
significant difference between the two exercise groups. We also 
found a significant decrease in the level of liver enzymes, HbA1c, 
and glucose levels in both groups after the intervention, but there 
were no significant differences between the two types of exercises. 
The insulin resistance had no significant change after interventions 
in both groups.
The results of our study regarding the effectiveness of the two 
types of training on the expression of miR‑21‑5p and glycemic 
control are consistent with Valenti et al .,[17] Zhou et al .,[12] 
Aljawarneh et al.,[18] and García‑Hermoso et al.[19] but not with

Vandoni and colleagues found that miR‑21a decreased after 
12 weeks of resistance training in athletes, indicating that 
changes in miR‑21a depend on the type and intensity of 
training. Endurance athletes have higher baseline levels than 
strength athletes. [22] Studies have shown that miR‑21 has 
multiple functions, such as activating T cells and regulating 
immune and anti‑inflammatory responses, as well as dual 
effects on pancreatic beta cells, and may have different changes 
in T1D patients at different stages.
MiR‑21 has also been shown to be involved in regulating cell 
death of pancreatic beta cells and insulin secretion stimulation. 
MiR‑21 is known as one of the accessible miRNAs in the 
cardiovascular system, and previous studies have demonstrated 
important characteristics of miR‑21 in the cardiovascular 
system with assays showing increased mutations and loss of 
function. However, miR‑21 expression patterns and functions 
reported in different CVDs are different. [12] Considering our 
findings, it is suggested that physical activity could prevent the 
development of T1D‑related complications, such as NAFLD 
and cardiovascular complications, through modulation of 
function and structure of mitochondria as well as other 
epigenetic mechanisms, including the role of miRNAs, DNA 
methylation, and histone modification.[23]
It has been shown that there was a significant decrease in 
ALT enzyme levels compared to the pretest in the selected 
HBRE (60.71%) and GBET (49.15%) groups after 8 weeks 
of exercise interventions. However, no significant difference 
was observed between the two training groups. Regarding 
AST enzyme levels, we also found a significant decrease 
compared to the pretest in the selected HBRE (54.02%) and 
GBET (34.02%) groups after 8 weeks of exercise interventions. 
Results of a systematic review and meta‑analysis by Babu et al. 
have demonstrated that exercise without substantial weight 
loss was found to significantly decrease the concentrations of 
ALT and AST.[24] Zinvand Lorestani et al. reported significant 
reduction in the level of the liver enzymes after 12 weeks of 
aerobic exercise in obese children.[25]
Results of a recent systematic review and meta‑analysis 
regarding the effectiveness of different types of exercise on 
key indicator of NAFLD found that aerobic training is the most 
effective mode of exercise for improving ALT and resistance 
training is the optimal exercise modality for improving AST. 
They concluded that by considering the various benefits 
observed, the best exercise approach for patients with NAFLD 
is a combination of aerobic training and resistance training.[26]
Recent studies suggest that the prevalence of NAFLD in T1D 
is high, but there is significant variability in current studies 
due to differences in diagnostic accuracy, retrospective study 
designs, and other factors, such as metabolic control and patient 
education.[2] Elevated liver enzymes are considered a risk factor 
for developing NAFLD and its related comorbidities in T1D 
patients. Therefore, it is recommended that exercise training 
programs be implemented into the daily routine of patients to 
help prevent T1D‑related complications.[27]
Based on the findings of recent studies, it is suggested that 
miRNAs may play a vital role in the development of NAFLD 
and its progression to more severe forms and that targeting 
these miRNAs could be a potential therapeutic approach for 
treating the disease.[28,29] However, further research is needed to 
validate the use of miRNAs as a diagnostic tool for NAFLD. In 
this study, we found that the posttest fasting blood glucose level 
decreased significantly after 8 weeks of exercise interventions 
compared to pretest in the selected HBRE (15.03%) and 
GBET (16.26%) groups. Furthermore, it was found that there 
was no significant difference between the two exercise groups.

The results of this study are consistent with the research of 
Tornese et al .,[15] Iraji et al .,[30] Khalil Tahmasbi et al .,[31] 
Zaharieva et al.,[32] Kim et al.,[33] and Haffar et al.[34]
Planning an exercise management program for adolescents 
with T1D involves monitoring blood glucose levels before, 
during, and after exercise and adjusting appropriate exercise 
training strategies. Continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) 
provides accurate information about blood glucose levels 
and trends before, during, and after exercise. Although there 
is no target range for blood glucose levels for optimal athletic 
performance, studies have not demonstrated any difference 
in athletic performance skills during acute hyperglycemia 
compared to normal glycemic status. CGM provides more 
complete information on hyperglycemia correction strategies 
and hypoglycemia prevention than self‑monitoring of blood 
glucose (SMBG). Advances in technology have made CGM 
more accessible and user‑friendly, allowing for real‑time 
monitoring and alerts.[35]
The findings of this study indicated a significant decrease in 
glycosylated hemoglobin levels compared to the pretest in 
the HBRE and GBET groups, with no significant difference 
between the two groups. The study’s findings were consistent 
with those of previous studies [36] and were not similar to 
those reported by Banaei et al.[37] Regular physical activity 
based on the recommendations of the International Diabetes 
Association or the American Sports Medicine Association 
for 5–6 days a week and 60 minutes per session can have 
a positive impact on HbA1c levels in diabetic children. 
Results of a systematic review study indicated that exercise 
interventions can significantly reduce HbA1c and insulin 
dose per day and increase cardiorespiratory fitness in children 
and adolescents with T1DM, and longer interventions and 
high‑intensity GBETs may be more effective in improving 
these parameters. The findings provide a basis for future 
studies on how to plan and prescribe exercise programs among 
diabetic children.[19]
This study found no significant changes in insulin levels 
between the pretest and posttest in the selected HBRE and 
GBET groups. Both types of exercises had a role in increasing 
insulin levels in diabetic adolescents, but HBRE was preferred 
over GBET. Our findings in this regard were consistent with 
Chetty et al.,[35] Kim et al.,[33] and Lu et al.,[38] but were not 
similar to Banaei et al.[37]
The insulin signaling cascade leads to several signals and 
patterns in the plasma membrane, ensuring the use and 
transfer of GLUT‑4. When insulin response is disrupted or 
stopped completely (e.g. in T1D), the key mediator for glucose 
transport or GLUT‑4 cannot perform its function, leading to 
metabolic diseases. The precise mechanism by which exercise 
causes GLUT‑4 transport and movement remains unclear, 
but muscle contraction activates AMP‑activated protein 
kinase (AMPK), indicating that exercise leads to increased 
exocytosis and decreased endocytosis of GLUT‑4.[39]
This study found a slight and non‑significant increase in 
insulin resistance levels in the both HBRE and GBET training 
groups after 8 weeks of exercise interventions. Previous 
studies on insulin resistance have reported conflicting results. 
Recent studies have emphasized that even severe genetic 
mutations involving insulin receptors lead to increased 
blood sugar, hyperinsulinemia, ovulatory dysfunction, 
hyperandrogenism, acanthosis, and excessive soft tissue 
growth, but no manifestations of insulin dysfunction are 
observed.
The pathogenesis of insulin resistance is complex and involves 
multiple factors, such as genetics, lifestyle, and environmental 
factors. Exercise has been shown to improve insulin resistance 
by increasing insulin sensitivity and glucose uptake in skeletal 
muscle. However, the optimal exercise regimen for improving 
insulin resistance is still unclear.[40‑42]
It is suggested that to obtain clearer association between the 
two exercise protocols and insulin level and insulin resistance, 
the intervention should be continued for a longer duration, 
such as 12–24 weeks.
Though many studies reported the relationship between aerobic 
fitness and many diseases, especially in children,[43,44] physical 
activity is known to be a major component for controlling 
obesity and diabetes in children, but which type of exercise 
is most effective is still debated. Some studies suggest that 
combined resistance and aerobic exercises may be more 
effective than resistance or aerobic exercises alone to control 
lean body mass and body composition. However, training 
status, exercise intensity, exercise duration, sex differences, 
and nutrition have all been shown to affect cellular expression 
responsible for fat oxidation rate. Resistance exercise can 
increase mitochondrial enzymes and fatty acid transporters, 
resulting in increased fat oxidation. GBET is also known 
to increase catecholamines, especially epinephrine, which 
increases lipolysis, the main factor in releasing fatty acids 
from adipose tissue.[45] Some studies have shown that GBET 
can reduce subcutaneous fat, especially in the abdominal area 
and total body mass.[22,46]
In this study, there were limitations, such as the number of 
participants and the lack of precise monitoring of the diet 
and daily activities of the participants. [47] It is suggested that 
future studies use larger sample sizes and longer exercise 
interventions. To achieve more clearer conclusion, it is 
recommended to use exercise interventions with longer 
durations (e.g. 6 months or more) in future studies due to 
the minor changes that occur in blood proteins in the short 
term. To investigate the effects of different training methods 
from a sustainability perspective, it is suggested to conduct 
research with various exercise interventions, especially on 
other miRNAs that are associated with metabolic control of 
the patients with T1D and have limited research conducted 
on their effects.

conclusIon
The findings of this study found that 8 weeks of selected GBET 
and HBRE groups led to reduced liver enzyme, improved 
glycemic control, and a slight increase in hsa‑miR‑21a. These 
indices are predictors of the risk of fatty liver and T1D, and 
better glycemic control as well as liver function can lower 
the risk of NAFLD and its related comorbidities. Therefore, 
it can be cautiously concluded that regular physical activity, 
especially selected GBET and HBRE groups, has positive 
effects on the main variables of research and can improve the 
indicators of T1D.
