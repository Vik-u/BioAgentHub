Abstract: The widespread application of w-transaminases as
biocatalysts for chiral amine synthesis has been hampered by
fundamental challenges, including unfavorable equilibrium
positions and product inhibition. Herein, an efficient process
that allows reactions to proceed in high conversion in the
absence of by-product removal using only one equivalent of
a diamine donor (ortho-xylylenediamine) is reported. This
operationally simple method is compatible with the most
widely used (R)- and (S)-selective w-TAs and is particularly
suitable for the conversion of substrates with unfavorable
equilibrium positions (e.g., 1-indanone). Significantly, sponta-
neous polymerization of the isoindole by-product generates
colored derivatives, providing a high-throughput screening
platform to identify desired w-TA activity.
The development of broadly applicable catalytic methods for
the sustainable production of chiral amines has been identi-
fied as a key research priority by the pharmaceutical
industry.
[1] The importance of this challenge is highlighted
by the numerous active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs),
bioactive natural products, and pharmaceutical building
blocks that contain chiral amines.
[2] In recent years, the
development and application of enzymes as biocatalysts for
the asymmetric synthesis of chiral amines has received
considerable attention.
[3] Examples of enzyme classes that
have been utilized for their synthesis include w-transaminases
(w-TAs),[4] ammonia lyases, [5] imine reductases, [6] amine
dehydrogenases,[7] and monoamine oxidases. [8] Increasingly
sophisticated techniques for enzyme evolution [9] have led to
the development of engineered biocatalysts, which have been
optimized for application in industrial processes. [10]
The structural simplicity and broad availability of prochi-
ral ketones make these structures attractive starting materials
for the synthesis of chiral building blocks. For example, the
application of ketoreductases is currently one of the most
common strategies employed for chiral alcohol synthesis.
[11]
The analogous asymmetric reductive amination of ketones
represents a significant challenge in organic synthesis and has
been highlighted as an extremely desirable transformation for
use in the pharmaceutical industry.
[1] w-TAs are a family of
pyridoxal-5’-phosphate (PLP)-dependent enzymes that
require a sacrificial amine donor to mediate the reversible
conversion of prochiral ketones into the corresponding
optically pure amines.
[4] The broad substrate scope and high
levels of regio- and stereoselectivity associated with these
enzymes make them ideal biocatalysts for chiral amine
synthesis in research laboratories and in manufacturing
processes. This point is highlighted by the recent application
of an engineered ( R)-selective w-TA in a biocatalytic process
for the large-scale production of the anti-diabetic API
sitagliptin.
[10a] Despite the enormous potential of w-TAs,
fundamental challenges associated with severe by-product
inhibition and with displacing unfavorable equilibrium posi-
tions towards product formation have prevented the wide-
spread application of these biocatalysts.
[12a] The use of amine
donors in large excess combined with the in situ removal of
ketone by-products is generally required to achieve high
yields of the desired amines (Figure 1). The most widely
employed strategy uses alanine as the amine donor and relies
on combinations of expensive, cofactor-dependent enzymes
for pyruvate removal (Figure 1a).
[12] An elegant alternative
strategy was recently described in which the ketone by-
product is effectively removed by spontaneous conversion
into the more stable phenol tautomer. [13] Unfortunately, the
application of these approaches for scalable amine synthesis is
limited by the high costs associated with their use. The
preferred method for large-scale production currently
involves the use of a significant excess of isopropyl amine
donor in combination with the technically challenging
removal of the acetone by-product by evaporation (Fig-
ure 1bii).
[10a,14] A further challenge that complicates the
development of efficient w-TA-mediated processes is the

libraries of engineered variants for enhanced activity, selec-

[15]
Herein, we describe the application of a non-chiral, low-cost
amine donor that serves the dual function of efficiently
displacing unfavorable reaction equilibria towards product
formation whilst providing a substrate-independent high-
throughput colorimetric screening method to detect desired
w-TA activity.
Commercially available ortho-xylylenediamine dihydro-
chloride (1) was initially evaluated as an amine donor for the
biocatalytic amination of (4-fluorophenyl)acetone ( 2). Using
a commercial w-TA (ATA113 from Codexis) as the biocat-
alyst, complete conversion of 2 (5 mm) into 3 (>99%,
>99% ee) was achieved using one equivalent of the amine
donor. Significantly, the reaction could also be carried out at
a substrate concentration of 100 m m without compromising
the conversion (Scheme 1). For comparison, the use of
structurally related benzylamine (1.5 equiv) or l-alanine
(10 equiv, no pyruvate removal) as the amine donor resulted
in poor conversion ( <5%) into the desired product (Table 1).
The success of the xylylenediamine donor can be attributed to
the spontaneous conversion of the cyclic imine by-product 4
into the more stable aromatic isoindole 5, effectively remov-
ing this component from the system. Transfer of an amino
group from diamine 1 to the PLP cofactor to generate the
required pyridoxamine-5 ’-phosphate (PMP) intermediate is
likely to occur through rapid 5- exo-trig cyclization of the
remaining primary amine onto an aldimine intermediate,
although a stepwise hydrolysis/cyclization pathway cannot be
excluded. Significantly, the isoindole by-product 5 undergoes
spontaneous polymerization resulting in the formation of
intensely colored derivatives,
[16] providing a sensitive and
operationally simple method of identifying desired trans-
aminase activity.
To demonstrate the broad utility of this method, biotrans-
formations were carried out with benzaldehyde ( 6) and
a series of prochiral ketones 7–12 using ATA113 and diamine
1 (Table 1). Substrates 6–12 were efficiently converted into
the corresponding amines with excellent conversion using
<1.5 equivalents of diamine 1. With the exception of 10, the
reactions proceeded with high selectivity ( >99% ee). Benzyl-
acetone ( 10) was converted into ( S)-(
+)-1-methyl-3-phenyl-
propylamine with 78% ee using either diamine 1 or l-alanine
(10 equiv) in combination with the lactate dehydrogenase
(LDH)/glucose dehydrogenase (GDH) pyruvate removal
system, demonstrating that 1 does not influence the reaction
enantioselectivity. Regio- and stereoselective amination of
diketone 11 was followed by spontaneous cyclization into the
corresponding pyrroline as described previously.
[17] The
efficient biocatalytic amination of 1-indanone ( 12) represents
a significant challenge with existing amine donors because of
highly unfavorable equilibrium positions.
[12a] Impressive con-
versions of 54% and 73% into ( S)-1-aminoindane were
achieved using 1.0 and 1.5 equivalents of diamine 1, respec-
tively. The corresponding biotransformations using l-alanine
(10 equiv) in combination with the LDH/GDH pyruvate
removal system resulted in a modest 21% conversion. In the

absence of pyruvate removal, no conversion was detected
using up to 100 equivalents of l-alanine.
Combined, these results clearly demonstrate the effi-
ciency and operational simplicity of the biotransformations
that use 1 as the amine donor. A further significant advantage
of this system lies in the formation of intensely colored by-
products, which presumably arise from spontaneous polymer-
ization of isoindole 5 and offer a simple high-throughput
screening strategy to identify desired transaminase activity.
We sought to employ this assay to rapidly evaluate a panel of
commercially available w-TAs for their ability to utilize 1 as
an amine donor. This panel included a series of six ( S)-
selective (Figure 2a; L2, L4, and L6 A–F) and six ( R)-
selective (L1, L3, and L5 A–F) w-TAs from the Codex ATA
screening kit v2, which have been specifically engineered to
operate using high concentrations of isopropyl amine donor
and are currently the most widely utilized w-TA biocatalysts
for chiral amine synthesis. In the absence of an amine
acceptor, low levels of color change were observed with
a number of these biocatalysts following incubation with
diamine 1 (5 mm) for three hours (L1 and L2), which is
presumably due to the conversion of enzyme-bound PLP into
PMP , although the presence of small quantities of ketone
impurities in the commercial enzyme preparation cannot be
excluded. The addition of benzylacetone ( 10;5m m, 1.0 equiv)
as an amine acceptor resulted in significant color changes in
a number of the biotransformations after only 15 minutes (L3
and L4). Following overnight incubation, reactions with all
Codexis biocatalysts resulted in the formation of intensely
colored solutions and significant quantities of dark precipitate
(L5 and L6), demonstrating the broad utility of this amine
donor for the synthesis of both the ( S) and ( R) enantiomers of
chiral amines. In all cases, significant conversion of 10 into the
corresponding amine was confirmed by GC-FID analysis (see
the Supporting Information, Tables S1 and S2), demonstrat-
ing the reliability of this simple screening strategy, which
provides an ideal high-throughput platform for evaluating
panels of w-TA biocatalysts for their activity towards large
libraries of ketone or aldehyde substrates. In general, higher
conversions were achieved with the ( S)-selective biocatalysts
than with their ( R)-selective counterparts. Comparable levels
of conversion of 10 were achieved using the corresponding
immobilized w-TA biocatalysts that were recently commer-
cialized by Purolite/Codexis.
Further evidence for the reliability of this colorimetric
screening method was obtained by using commercial w-TAs
supplied by Almac (L7 A–F). Whereas the biotransforma-
tions with TAm106/TAm107 (L7A and L7B, respectively)
proceeded with moderate conversion and gave intensely
colored reaction mixtures, the reactions with TAm121 (L7D)
and TAm140 (L7F) gave no conversion ( <1%), and the
wells remained pale yellow. Significantly, low but detectable
levels of color change were observed in the reactions with
TAm115 (L7C) and TAm125 (L7E), which were shown to
proceed with <5% and 5% conversion, respectively (see
Table S3).
Aside from providing a high-throughput method to
evaluate the activity of commercial w-TAs, the colorimetric
screening strategy described above offers an ideal platform
for the development of a new generation of w-TA biocatalysts
that are engineered to efficiently utilize 1 as an amine donor.
Unfortunately, the protein sequence of commercial biocata-
lysts is rarely disclosed, necessitating the identification and
application of suitable wild-type enzymes as starting points
for directed evolution. We have recently reported the use of
a transaminase from Pseudogulbenkiania ferrooxidans (pf-
ATA) for the regio- and stereoselective amination of dike-
tones using l
-alanine as the amine donor. [17] We now
demonstrate that this wild-type biocatalyst displays modest
activity towards diamine 1 (see the Supporting Information).

Significantly, this has allowed the development of a single-
enzyme, colony-based assay to identify desired w-TA activity.
Such assays are particularly useful as they allow the rapid
evaluation of large libraries of enzyme variants in a high-
throughput manner. In the presence of diamine 1, E. coli
colonies expressing the pf-ATA gene rapidly became dark
(Figure 2b). Control experiments using benzylamine or
diamine 1 in combination with cells lacking the pf-ATA
gene did not lead to a color change in the colonies. The
success of this assay lies in the formation of insoluble
polymeric isoindole by-products, which prevent undesired
diffusion. Solid-phase assays based on horseradish peroxidase
(HRP)/H
2O2 mediated polymerization of suitable substrates
have previously been successfully exploited to engineer
oxidase enzymes with enhanced biocatalytic properties.
[18]
The analogous assay for w-TA activity described herein is
suitable for screening genomic libraries and culture collec-
tions to identify undiscovered w-TAs and is expected to
greatly facilitate the process of engineering enzymes with high
activity towards amine donor 1 and with enhanced properties
for biocatalytic applications.
In summary, we have developed a simple and highly
efficient process for chiral amine synthesis employing w-TA
biocatalysts. The use of ortho-xylylenediamine 1 serves the
dual function of displacing challenging reaction equilibria
towards product formation while generating intensely colored
by-products, which has allowed the development of liquid-
phase and colony-based assays. This method offers an ideal
strategy for screening large substrate panels or libraries of
w-TA variants to facilitate the development of the next
generation of w-TA biocatalysts by directed evolution.
