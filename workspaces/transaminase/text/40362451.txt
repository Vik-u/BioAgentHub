Abstract: Researchers have long focused on the accumulation of amyloid beta (Aβ) pep-
tides in the brain as a primary pathological hallmark driving cognitive decline. This study
investigated the neuroprotective effects of Rosa rugosa (RR) root extract and its key bioac-
tive constituent, oleamide, against amyloid beta (Aβ)-induced neurotoxicity. Initially, an
ethanolic extract of RR root was screened via in vitro assays to assess antioxidant and
cytoprotective potential in rat pheochromocytoma cells. Subsequent fractionation, open-
column chromatography, and preparatory thin-layer chromatography led to the isolation of
oleamide, confirmed by gas chromatography–mass spectrometry and 1H/13C nuclear mag-
netic resonance analyses. In vivo experiments using intracerebroventricularly injected Aβ
in male mice demonstrated that both RR root extract and oleamide significantly improved
cognitive performance in the Y-maze and passive avoidance tests. Additionally, oleamide
restored acetylcholine levels and reduced malondialdehyde concentrations in brain tissue,
indicating mitigation of oxidative stress and support of cholinergic function. No significant
toxicity was observed, as evidenced by stable serum transaminase levels and unaltered
body or brain weights. These findings highlight oleamide’s potential to protect against
Aβ-driven pathology through multiple mechanisms, including reduced lipid peroxidation
and improved neurotransmission. Further investigations into oleamide’s molecular targets
and synergy with existing therapies may advance its development as a novel candidate for
Alzheimer’s disease prevention or adjunct treatment.

1. Introduction
Over the past few decades, dementia—particularly Alzheimer’s disease (AD)—has
drawn increasing attention due to its rising global incidence and the significant socioeco-
nomic burden it imposes. Researchers have long focused on the accumulation of amyloid
beta (Aβ) peptides in the brain as a primary pathological hallmark driving cognitive decline
in AD [1]. However, this field recently faced a major controversy following allegations of
data manipulation in key Aβ-related studies. A significant scandal emerged in 2022 when

an investigation revealed potential image fabrication in a high-profile study that claimed
that a specific oligomeric form of A β (Aβ*56) was responsible for memory impairment.
This revelation raised serious concerns about the integrity of foundational research support-
ing the amyloid hypothesis. Despite these controversies, the debate over Aβ’s role in AD
pathogenesis remains active. While the scandal prompted renewed scrutiny of Aβ-centric
hypotheses, it does not entirely invalidate the substantial body of evidence linking A β
pathology to Alzheimer’s progression. Contemporary investigations continue to explore
the complex interplay between Aβ, tau proteins, neuroinflammation, and other molecular
events to develop a more comprehensive understanding of AD’s multifactorial nature [2].
Despite the development of drugs that have received approval from the U.S. Food and
Drug Administration for Alzheimer’s disease, current therapeutics largely focus on symp-
tomatic relief or modestly slowing disease progression, rather than outright prevention [3].
As a result, there remains a strong demand for novel strategies—particularly preventive
interventions—that may alter disease trajectory before irreversible neuronal damage occurs.
This has spurred a surge of interest in lifestyle modifications and nutritional approaches
to support healthy cognitive aging [ 4]. A growing number of studies are delving into
bioactive compounds in foods, with the hope of intercepting AD processes at earlier stages,
including studies we have reported elsewhere [5,6].
Within this context, the root of Rosa rugosa (RR) is a promising traditional remedy
given its rich content of phenolic compounds, vitamins, and other bioactive constituents.
RR has demonstrated antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects in various disease models,
ranging from inflammatory disorders to metabolic dysfunction [7]. In traditional East Asian
medicine, the root of RR has been utilized for the treatment of various ailments, including
inflammatory conditions, dysentery, and menstrual irregularities. These historical applica-
tions are documented in classical Korean and Chinese pharmacopeias and are increasingly
supported by recent ethnopharmacological studies [8,9]. In particular, RR root extract has
demonstrated antioxidant and lipid-lowering effects in 3T3-L1 cells, suggesting that the
whole extract possesses physiological activities beyond those of individual compounds [8].
A comprehensive review by Zhang et al. [9] further highlights the broad pharmacological
profile of RR, encompassing its anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and metabolic regulatory
properties. These findings reinforce the traditional perception of RR root as a functional
remedy and support its potential utility in preventing or mitigating neurodegenerative
processes such as those observed in Alzheimer’s disease. Likewise, some studies have un-
covered potential protective mechanisms—such as the suppression of oxidative stress—in
cellular and animal models, hinting at broader benefits that may extend to age-related
neurodegeneration [10]. However, despite these encouraging findings, direct evidence of
RR root’s capacity to counteract Aβ-induced neurotoxicity—a core pathological feature of
AD—remains scarce. Specifically, few studies have identified or validated the individual
constituents in RR root responsible for neuroprotection in the context of Aβ accumulation.
One study found that extracts of RR exhibited neuroprotective effects against oxidative
stress-induced cognitive dysfunction, suggesting potential implications for AD [11], but
did not address whether RR directly modulates Aβ-mediated mechanisms.
Among the various bioactive components in plants with potential central nervous
system activity, oleamide has attracted increasing attention. Oleamide is an endogenous
fatty acid amide first identified in cerebrospinal fluid and is known to regulate sleep, mood,
and neural transmission. Importantly, oleamide has been shown to exert neuroprotective
effects in several experimental contexts, including enhancement of choline acetyltrans-
ferase activity, modulation of microglial inflammation, and promotion of Aβ clearance via
phagocytosis. Additionally, studies suggest that oleamide may shift amyloid precursor
protein (APP) processing toward the non-amyloidogenic pathway by activatingα-secretase

(ADAM10), potentially reducing A β generation. Despite these promising findings, the
presence of oleamide in RR roots has not been previously reported, and its role in mediating
RR’s neuroprotective effects has yet to be explored.
Therefore, the present study aims to bridge these gaps by evaluating the neuropro-
tective efficacy of RR root extract against A β-induced oxidative stress and behavioral
impairment, identifying the major active constituent within RR root, and assessing the
in vivo effects of the isolated compound—oleamide—on cognitive performance, oxidative
stress, and cholinergic function in a mouse model of A β toxicity. Through this integra-
tive approach, we seek to establish oleamide as a novel phytochemical candidate with
therapeutic relevance in the context of AD prevention and intervention.
2. Results and Discussion
2.1. Screening for Protective Effect of Plant Extracts Against Oxidative Stress In Vitro
To select the active sample extract against oxidative stress on the PC12 cells, various
native edible extracts were screened using the 2 ′,7′-dichlorofluorescein diacetate (DCF-
DA) and 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl-tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assays, in
which hydrogen peroxide was used to induce oxidative stress. The rationale behind this
is based on the Aβ accumulation in the brain of AD patients, which exacerbates reactive
oxygen species (ROS) generation and cognitive malfunctions. Among the 26 screened
plant extracts, several—including those derived from Euryale ferox Salisb. and Ulmus pumila
L.—exhibited moderate protective effects in one or both assays. However, the extract from
RR roots consistently showed the most pronounced reduction in intracellular ROS and
the highest restoration of cell viability under oxidative stress. This superior performance
across both assays provided strong justification for selecting RR root for further bioactivity-
guided fractionation and compound identification (Table 1). Specifically, the DCF-DA
assay showed that RR roots extract achieved a 91.5% decrease in intracellular oxidative
stress (expressed as a protective effect in Table 1), indicating a strong antioxidative capacity.
In parallel, the MTT assay revealed a 121.4% improvement in cell viability relative to
the hydrogen peroxide-challenged control, suggesting that the RR root extract effectively
mitigated ROS-induced cytotoxicity. These findings highlight the potential of RR root as
a promising source of neuroprotective agents against oxidative stress, leading to further
fractionization of the RR root extract to identify active constituents.

2.2. Identification of Chemical Structure of Active Constituent in the RR Root Extract
Multiple separation and isolation techniques were adopted to identify active con-
stituents responsible for the protective potential of RR root extract (Figure 1). First, the
ethanolic extract of RR root was subjected to liquid–liquid fractionization, using n-hexane,
chloroform, and ethyl acetate, respectively. Fractionization using each solvent was repeated
three times and then each layer was evaporated under reduced pressure at 39 ◦C and
prepared for the DCF-DA and MTT assays. In the DCF-DA assay, as expected, the positive
control (POS; hydrogen peroxide only) had about 20 times higher intracellular ROS levels
relative to the negative control (NEG, no treatment); while the reference control (REF;
100 µM vitamin C treatment) showed dramatic protection compared to the POS (Figure 2A).
The inhibitory effect of RR root extracts on intracellular ROS formation in the PC12 cells
was demonstrated, although there was no difference in protection between chloroform and
ethyl acetate fractions (i.e., C1 through C3 and EA1 through EA3; Figure 2A). In the cell
viability assay (i.e., MTT), the treatment with 200µM hydrogen peroxide (i.e., POS) reduced
cell viability to approximately half of the untreated control (NEG), indicating a marked
cytotoxic effect. Pre-incubation with 100 µM vitamin C (REF) restored viability to a level
exceeding 100% of NEG. Among the tested fractions from RR roots, the hexane (H1–H3)
and chloroform (C1–C3) groups exhibited modest protective effects, with viability generally
ranging from about 60–90% relative to NEG. In contrast, the ethyl acetate fractions (E1–E3)
displayed robust cytoprotection, with E2 in particular elevating viability to roughly 200% of
the NEG—surpassing even the REF group (Figure 2B). Based on these results, we selected
the EA2 fraction for further purification processes.

was observed in fractions eluted with chlorofor m–ethanol mixtures ranging from 80:20
to 50:50 (Figure 2C). In the MTT assay, the fraction eluted with 60:40 chloroform–ethanol
showed the highest cell viability (Figure 2D), and therefore, these fractions were combined

and evaporated for TLC analysis. Lastly, the 60:40 chlorofor m–ethanol fractions were
subjected to the TLC plate and then separated. The solvent mixture of chloroform and
ethanol (55:45) was employed and the developed bands were visualized using an ultravio-
let lamp (245 and 365 nm); each band was scraped, extracted with ethanol, and assessed
for protective effects (i.e., MTT and DCF-DA assays). Amongst nine TLC bands, band
#4 (Rf value = 0.43) showed superior inhibition of DCF formation as well as cell viability
(Figure 2E,F).
The selected TLC band was extracted and evaporated under reduced pressure at
39 ◦C. The obtained sample was dissolved in ethanol and analyzed by HPLC using C 18
Pak MG S5 column. The data were monitored over the range 200–800 nm, with detection
wavelength at 280 nm. A significant peak appeared at 42 min (Figure 3A). GC-MS analysis
was subsequently performed by an Agilent 6890 Plus gas chromatograph equipped with a
5977 N mass selective detector quadrupole MS system. As illustrated by the total ion chro-
matogram (Figure 3B), a prominent peak emerged at around 24.8 min, displaying a mass
spectrum consistent with oleamide (oleic acid amide). Following GC–MS analysis of the
RR root extract fraction, to confirm this preliminary identification, commercially obtained
oleamide was analyzed alongside the isolated fraction using the 13C and 1H-NMR. As
shown, the NMR spectra of the sample fraction and the standard oleamide displayed highly
similar chemical shifts and splitting patterns, corroborating that the principal component
in the extracted band is indeed oleamide. This combined approach—mass spectrometric
matching followed by comparative NMR—provides strong evidence that oleamide is the
bioactive constituent isolated from RR root extract (Figure 3C,D).

formation was observed in fractions eluted with chloroform–ethanol mixtures ranging 
from 80:20 to 50:50 (Figure 2C). In the MTT as say, the fraction eluted with 60:40 chloro-

2.3. RR Root Extract and Oleamide Improved Aβ1-42-Induced Behavioral Abnormalities and
Brain Biomarkers
Two sets of animal intervention studies were conducted to examine the neuroprotec-
tive potential of RR root extracts and their bioactive oleamide. First, the percentage of
spontaneous alternation in the Y-maze test reflects working memory performance. Mice
injected with Aβ1-42 (POS) displayed a significantly lower alternation behavior compared
to the NEG (p < 0.05), indicating impaired spatial working memory induced by the ICV
injection in our study. Oral administration of RR root extract at 400, 800, or 1200 mg/kg im-
proved alternation behavior relative to the POS, suggesting a neuroprotective effect. These
doses were determined based on previous in vivo studies utilizing plant extracts with simi-
lar pharmacological profiles and traditional medicinal use, as reported by Na et al. [11] and
Lee et al. [8]. In addition, a study by Park et al. [12] demonstrated that RR root extract exhib-
ited hepatoprotective effects in rats at doses of 250 and 500 mg/kg, supporting the safety
and biological activity of this extract in vivo. Accordingly, the 1200 mg/kg dose in our
study was included as a high-dose exploratory group to assess potential dose-dependent
efficacy and upper-limit tolerability. Notably, no significant toxicity was observed at this
high dose, as evidenced by stable body weight, brain weight, and serum transaminase lev-
els, indicating a favorable safety profile. However, no clear dose dependence was observed
among the three doses, as each treatment group exhibited statistically comparable improve-
ments over the POS (Figure 4A). In addition, there was no statistical difference between the
groups in the number of animals’ arm entries. The improvement in spontaneous alternation
performance across all administered doses (400, 800, and 1200 mg/kg) indicates potential
memory-enhancing properties. However, the absence of a clear dose–response relationship
suggests that the effects may reach a saturation point at lower doses. Figure 4B presents the
passive avoidance test results, with step-through latency serving as an index of memory
retention. The POS, which received Aβ1-42 injection, displayed a markedly lower latency
compared to the NEG, indicating impaired avoidance learning. In contrast, mice treated
with RR root extract at 400, 800, or 1200 mg/kg showed a noticeable increase in latency
relative to the POS group, suggesting a protective effect against A β-induced cognitive
deficits (Figure 4B). However, again, no clear dose dependence was observed among the
three RR treatment groups. Additionally, to monitor any abnormal signs of toxicity, whole
body weight, brain weight, as well as serum AST and ALT levels were measured, with no
statistical differences noted in any marker (Figure 4C,D).
Although the inclusion of a standard positive control, such as donepezil, tacrine,
or Ginkgo biloba extract, is commonly employed in behavioral pharmacology studies to
contextualize efficacy, we chose not to include such a control in the present work. This
decision was based on the well-established reproducibility of A β1-42-induced cognitive
deficits in rodent models, which allowed us to prioritize comparative evaluation between
vehicle-treated, Aβ-injected, and test substance-treated groups. Furthermore, at the time
the experiments were conducted, Ginkgo biloba extract had not been officially recognized as
a validated neuroprotective agent by regulatory authorities and thus was not considered
an appropriate pharmacological comparator. Nonetheless, we agree that including a
recognized positive control would further reinforce the comparative interpretability of
our findings. Therefore, future studies should include a standard reference agent to better
contextualize the behavioral efficacy of RR root extract and oleamide in comparison to
established treatments.

The observed neuroprotective e ﬀects of RR root extract align with prior ﬁndings 
demonstrating the antioxidative and anti-inﬂammatory properties of RR extracts in neu-
rodegenerative models. For instance, RR extract mitigated cognitive dysfunction and 
stress-induced impairments via serotonergic pathways, suggesting potential bene ﬁts for 
memory-related tasks [11]. Similarly, a study examining RR ﬂower buds identiﬁed phe-
nolic glucosides with neuroactive properti es that improved sensorimotor gating de ﬁcits 
in mice [13]. While these studies focused on di ﬀerent aspects of cognitive function, they 
provide supporting evidence that various parts of RR contain bioactive compounds with 
neuroprotective potential. In line with this, our results provide important insights into the 
bioactive compound(s) responsible for the protective eﬀects of RR root extract against Aβ
1-
42-induced neurotoxicity in vivo. 
To this end, we executed an intervention study with an identical study design using 
oleamide. Spontaneous alternation behavior in the Y-maze test was evaluated following 
oleamide treatment at 0, 10, 20, and 40 mg/kg [14]. Relative to the NEG, the Aβ1-42-injected 
group (i.e., POS) displayed a signiﬁcant decline in alternation percentage, whereas admin-
istration of oleamide at 40 mg/kg improved alternation behavior; the two low doses, 10 
mg/kg and 20 mg/kg, produced no di ﬀerence compared to the NEG [Figure 5A]. Step-
through latency in the passive avoidance task was substantially reduced in the A β1-42-in-
jected group (POS) compared to the NEG, signifying impaired memory retention.

The observed neuroprotective effects of RR root extract align with prior findings
demonstrating the antioxidative and anti-inflammatory properties of RR extracts in neu-
rodegenerative models. For instance, RR extract mitigated cognitive dysfunction and
stress-induced impairments via serotonergic pathways, suggesting potential benefits for
memory-related tasks [11]. Similarly, a study examining RR flower buds identified phe-
nolic glucosides with neuroactive properties that improved sensorimotor gating deficits
in mice [13]. While these studies focused on different aspects of cognitive function, they
provide supporting evidence that various parts of RR contain bioactive compounds with
neuroprotective potential. In line with this, our results provide important insights into
the bioactive compound(s) responsible for the protective effects of RR root extract against
Aβ1-42-induced neurotoxicity in vivo.
To this end, we executed an intervention study with an identical study design us-
ing oleamide. Spontaneous alternation behavior in the Y-maze test was evaluated fol-
lowing oleamide treatment at 0, 10, 20, and 40 mg/kg [ 14]. Relative to the NEG, the
Aβ1-42-injected group (i.e., POS) displayed a significant decline in alternation percent-
age, whereas administration of oleamide at 40 mg/kg improved alternation behavior;
the two low doses, 10 mg/kg and 20 mg/kg, produced no difference compared to the
NEG [Figure 5A]. Step-through latency in the passive avoidance task was substantially
reduced in the Aβ1-42-injected group (POS) compared to the NEG, signifying impaired
memory retention. Treatment with oleamide at 10 mg/kg and 20 mg/kg partially restored
Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2025, 26, 4214 9 of 17
latency, and 40 mg/kg elicited greater improvements in the test [Figure 5B]. Again, to
monitor the potential toxicity of oleamide intervention, whole body weight, brain weight,
as well as serum AST and ALT levels were measured; however, no statistical differences
were found [Figure 5C,D]. Additionally, oxidative stress induced by ICV injection of Aβ
was assessed through MDA measurements in brain tissue homogenates. As expected,
the Aβ-injected group (POS) showed a marked elevation in MDA compared to the NEG,
indicating heightened lipid peroxidation. Administration of oleamide produced significant
reductions in MDA relative to POS at all levels [Figure 5E]. Lastly, ACh levels in brain
tissues were quantified, given that a well-known feature of Aβ-induced neurotoxicity is
the reduction of ACh, a critical neurotransmitter for learning and memory [ 15]. In the
present study, Aβ-injected mice (POS) exhibited significantly lower ACh concentrations
in the brain compared to the NEG, which aligns with the cholinergic hypothesis of AD,
in which A β accumulation correlates with the deterioration of cholinergic neurons. In
our study, administration of oleamide at 20 mg/kg and 40 mg/kg led to progressively
higher concentrations, indicating a dose-dependent improvement. The 40 mg/kg dose in
particular returned ACh to near-NEG levels, suggesting that oleamide can help preserve or
recover cholinergic function under Aβ-induced stress. In this study, Aβ1-42 injection led to
elevated levels of malondialdehyde (MDA) and decreased acetylcholine concentrations in
mouse brain tissue, indicating significant oxidative stress and cholinergic impairment. Both
the RR root extract and its major constituent oleamide effectively reversed these effects,
which suggests that the primary neuroprotective mechanism involves the mitigation of
Aβ-induced oxidative damage. These findings align with previous reports showing that
Aβ accumulation exacerbates reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, leading to lipid
peroxidation and disruption of neuronal membrane integrity. The observed reduction
in MDA levels and behavioral improvements further support the antioxidant properties
of RR and oleamide in preventing A β-mediated neuronal dysfunction. While neuroin-
flammation is another critical factor in AD progression, our study did not directly assess
inflammatory markers; thus, we have limited our discussion to the confirmed antioxidative
and cholinergic effects. Overall, our second animal intervention study using oleamide
generally suggests that Aβ-induced oxidative stress can be attenuated by oleamide in a
dose-dependent manner, with higher doses conferring more pronounced protection against
lipid peroxidation and decline in ACh concentrations.
While the current study confirmed that oleamide, a major constituent of RR root
extract, effectively reduced lipid peroxidation and restored acetylcholine levels in Aβ1-42-
injected mice, it is important to note that these biochemical assays were not conducted
for the RR extract-treated groups. This was primarily due to limitations in sample avail-
ability and the study’s targeted focus on compound-level validation of oleamide. Given
that the RR extract also showed behavioral improvements comparable to oleamide, it is
possible that other constituents within the extract may contribute to similar antioxidant
and cholinergic mechanisms. Future studies should aim to include parallel biochemical
assessments in extract-treated animals to evaluate potential synergistic effects and to more
fully characterize the multi-component nature of RR root’s neuroprotective actions.
The findings from our second animal intervention study aligned with previous studies
investigating oleamide’s role in neuroprotection and its potential therapeutic relevance in
AD. Oleamide has been identified as a compound that modulates cholinergic signaling,
which is critical for learning and memory. Our group previously reported that oleamide
enhances the activity of choline acetyltransferase, an enzyme responsible for ACh synthesis,
leading to improved cognitive performance in scopolamine-induced amnesia models [16].
This supports our findings that oleamide treatment at 20 mg/kg and 40 mg/kg restored
ACh levels and improved behavioral performance. In addition, studies suggest that
Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2025, 26, 4214 10 of 17
oleamide exerts neuroprotective effects by reducing oxidative stress and neuroinflamma-
tion. For instance, it was reported that oleamide, a bioactive compound in fermented
dairy products, enhances microglial phagocytosis of A β aggregates while suppressing
neuroinflammation [17], which is in good agreement with our results, where a significant
reduction in MDA levels was observed following oleamide administration.

lowed by Dunnett’s post hoc test. Results are shown as means ± standard deviations (n = 7–8). Dif-

The ﬁndings from our second animal intervention study aligned with previous stud-
ies investigating oleamide’s role in neuroprotection and its potential therapeutic relevance 
in AD. Oleamide has been identiﬁed as a compound that modulates cholinergic signaling, 
which is critical for learning and memory. Our group previously reported that oleamide 
enhances the activity of choline acetyltransferase, an enzyme responsible for ACh synthe-
sis, leading to improved cognitive performance in scopolamine-induced amnesia models 
[16]. This supports our ﬁndings that oleamide treatment at 20 mg/kg and 40 mg/kg re-
stored ACh levels and improved behavioral performance. In addition, studies suggest that 
oleamide exerts neuroprotective eﬀects by reducing oxidative stress and neuroinﬂamma-
tion. For instance, it was reported that oleamide, a bioactive compound in fermented dairy 
products, enhances microglial phagocytosis of Aβ aggregates while suppressing neuroin-
ﬂammation [17], which is in good agreement with our results, where a signiﬁcant reduc-
tion in MDA levels was observed following oleamide administration. 
Although this study focused on the antiox idant and cholinergic mechanisms of RR 
root extract and oleamide, we acknowledge that neuroinﬂammation is a critical contribu-
tor to Aβ
1-42-induced neuropathology. While previous studies have shown that RR extracts 
can attenuate inﬂammation in models of metabolic and inﬂammatory disease, we did not 
directly assess neuroinﬂammatory markers such as TNF-α, IL-1β, or microglial activation

Although this study focused on the antioxidant and cholinergic mechanisms of RR
root extract and oleamide, we acknowledge that neuroinflammation is a critical contributor
to Aβ1-42-induced neuropathology. While previous studies have shown that RR extracts
can attenuate inflammation in models of metabolic and inflammatory disease, we did not
directly assess neuroinflammatory markers such as TNF-α, IL-1β, or microglial activation
in the current study. Future work will incorporate such analyses to clarify whether RR root
extract also modulates neuroinflammatory pathways in the context of Aβ-induced toxicity.
Aβ toxicity is a central feature of AD pathogenesis, contributing to synaptic dys-
function, neuroinflammation, and neuronal loss. The present study demonstrates that
oleamide from RR root extract exerts protective effects against Aβ-induced neurotoxicity.
Previous studies suggest that oleamide may mitigate Aβ-related pathology through a dual
mechanism involving suppression of microglial activation and enhancement of the non-
amyloidogenic APP processing pathway. Neuroinflammation is a key contributor to AD
progression, with activated microglia exacerbating neuronal damage through the release of
Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2025, 26, 4214 11 of 17
pro-inflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) [18]. The results
indicate that oleamide reduces TNF-α levels in microglial cells, an effect that appears to
be mediated through P2Y-type G-protein-coupled receptor signaling. This is particularly
relevant given that persistent neuroinflammation has been implicated in impaired A β
clearance and increased neuronal susceptibility to toxicity.
In addition to its role in neuroinflammation, oleamide appears to influence Aβ pro-
duction through the regulation of α-secretase activity [19]. A recent report suggests that
oleamide enhances the activation of ADAM10, a keyα-secretase enzyme responsible for the
non-amyloidogenic cleavage of APP . This pathway precludes the formation of Aβ peptides
by shifting APP metabolism away from the amyloidogenic pathway, thereby reducing
Aβ plaque formation. Given that ADAM10 function is known to decline with disease
progression, its pharmacological activation has been proposed as a potential therapeutic
strategy for AD. The ability of oleamide to stimulate this pathway may thus provide a
direct mechanism for limiting Aβ accumulation.
Moreover, accumulating evidence points to oleamide’s immunomodulatory effects on
microglial cells. Microglia, as the primary immune cells of the central nervous system, play a
dual role in neurodegeneration: while they help clear Aβ aggregates through phagocytosis,
prolonged activation can lead to the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines that exacerbate
neuronal damage. Oleamide has been shown to reduce the expression of inflammatory
mediators such as TNF- α and IL-1β in activated microglia, potentially via modulation
of P2Y-type G-protein-coupled receptor signaling. This anti-inflammatory action may
contribute to an enhanced microglial phenotype more conducive to A β clearance and
neuroprotection. These mechanisms, in tandem with oleamide’s antioxidative effects, may
offer a more comprehensive explanation for its neuroprotective properties observed in the
current study.
While the current findings highlight oleamide as a promising neuroprotective agent,
several limitations warrant further investigation. Future studies should aim to delineate the
precise molecular signaling pathways through which oleamide modulates ADAM10 activity
and inflammatory responses in the brains (in our case, ICV injection of Aβ1-42). Although
oleamide was identified as a major compound and further validated for its neuroprotective
effects, the extract likely contains other bioactive constituents that may contribute to its
overall activity. Future studies will aim to isolate and evaluate additional compounds,
including flavonoids and triterpenoids, to further understand the multi-component nature
of the extract’s efficacy. Long-term administration studies in in vivo AD models will be
necessary to evaluate the sustained efficacy and safety of oleamide-based interventions.
Additionally, the potential for oleamide to be used in combination with existing anti-Aβ
therapies should be explored to determine whether its effects can be augmented through
multimodal treatment strategies. Nonetheless, our study presents several key strengths.
First, a systematic and comprehensive approach was employed to identify oleamide as the
primary bioactive constituent in RR root extract. Through a combination of fractionation,
chromatography, GC-MS, and NMR analyses, we successfully isolated and structurally
characterized oleamide as the active neuroprotective compound from the RR root extract.
Second, we examined both the crude extract (RR root extract) and the isolated bioactive
compound (oleamide) in animal experiments, allowing for a more detailed evaluation of
their respective neuroprotective effects. Finally, the study also incorporated biochemical
analyses to assess ACh levels, oxidative stress marker (MDA), and serum AST/ALT levels,
ensuring a thorough evaluation of oleamide’s efficacy and safety profile. The lack of
significant toxicity observed at effective doses suggests a favorable application window,
supporting the feasibility of oleamide-based interventions against AD.

3. Materials and Methods
3.1. Materials
DCF-DA, MTT, dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), hydrogen peroxide, and L-ascorbic acid
(vitamin C) were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, USA). Silica gel was
purchased from Merck (Darmstadt, Germany), and amyloid beta peptide was sourced from
Bachem Holding (Bubendorf, Switzerland). Serum transaminase assay kits were supplied
by Asan Pharmaceutical (Seoul, Republic of Korea). Unless otherwise noted, all additional
chemicals were of analytical grade.
3.2. Cell Culture Conditions
The PC12 cell line (CRL-1721) was obtained from the American Type Culture Collection
(ATCC; Manassas, VA, USA). RPMI 1640 medium, donor horse serum, fetal bovine serum
(FBS), and antibiotic–antimycotic were purchased from Gibco-Invitrogen (Grand Island, NY,
USA). Sodium bicarbonate was sourced from Sigma-Aldrich. Sodium chloride, disodium
hydrogen phosphate (sodium hydrogen phosphate anhydrous), and potassium dihydrogen
phosphate (potassium phosphate monobasic) were obtained from Junsei Chemical (Tokyo,
Japan). Potassium chloride was procured from Showa Chemicals (Tokyo, Japan). PC12 cells
were cultured in 100 mm tissue culture dishes in a medium supplemented with 10% heat-
inactivated horse serum, 5% fetal bovine serum, and 1% antibiotic–antimycotic. The cells
were maintained in an incubator at 37 ◦C with water saturation and 5% of CO2. Cultured
dishes were dislodged and passaged when each dish was 80–90% confluent. The medium
was changed at least three times a week.
3.3. Measurement of Intracellular Oxidative Stress in PC12 Cells
Intracellular oxidative stress was assessed using the DCF-DA assay as described
elsewhere [ 5,20]. Briefly, PC12 cells were plated in 96-well plates at a density of
2.0 × 105 cells/mL (100 µL per well). After seeding, cells were pretreated with each test
sample (1 mg/mL) for 48 h, then exposed to 100 µM hydrogen peroxide (freshly prepared)
or no treatment for two hours. Following this incubation, 250 µM DCF-DA was applied for
50 min. The conversion of DCF-DA to fluorescent 2′,7′-dichlorofluoroscein was measured
using a fluorometer (GENois TECAN; Mannedorf, Switzerland) at an excitation wavelength
of 485 nm and an emission wavelength of 535 nm.
3.4. Measurement of Cytotoxicity Using MTT Reduction Assay
The cytotoxicity of samples was tested using the conventional MTT reduction assay
as reported elsewhere [20]. Briefly, PC12 cells were seeded in 96-well plates at a density
of 2.0 × 105 cells per mL (100 µL per well) and allowed to adhere overnight. Following
pretreatment with test samples (1 mg/mL) for 48 h, cells were exposed to oxidative stress
by adding 200 µM hydrogen peroxide for two hours. After the stress period, 0.25 mg/mL
MTT solution was added to each well, and the plates were incubated for an additional three
hours at 37 ◦C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere. During this incubation, viable cells reduced MTT
to insoluble formazan crystals. After incubation, the medium was removed and 150 µL
of DMSO was added to each well to solubilize the formazan. The absorbance was then
measured at 570 nm with a reference wavelength of 630 nm using a microplate reader
(GENois TECAN). Cell viability was calculated as a percentage relative to control wells
that were not exposed to oxidative stress.
3.5. Preparation of Plant Extracts for Screening
Twenty-six different dried plant materials were purchased from Gyeong-dong Market,
an oriental medicine store (Seoul, Republic of Korea). The scientific names of the samples
Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2025, 26, 4214 13 of 17
are provided in Table 1. Each sample was verified for identity based on morphological
characteristics and stored at 4 ◦C prior to extraction. Approximately 50 g of each dried
sample was pulverized to a fine powder using a laboratory mill. The powdered material
was then extracted with 80% ethanol at a ratio of 1:5 (w/v), followed by stirring at room
temperature for 24 h. The extract was filtered through Whatman No. 42 filter paper, and the
residue was re-extracted twice under the same conditions to maximize yield. The combined
filtrates were concentrated under reduced pressure at 39 ◦C using a rotary evaporator.
Dried extracts were stored at −20 ◦C until further use. For screening assays, each extract
was dissolved in 5% DMSO to a final concentration of 1 mg/mL.
3.6. Isolation and Purification of Active Constituent from RR Root Extract: Liquid–Liquid
Fractionation, Open-Column Chromatography, and Preparatory Thin Layer
Chromatography (TLC)
Approximately 4 kg of RR roots were extracted with 80% ethanol at a ratio of 1:5 (w/v),
followed by stirring at room temperature for 24 h. The extraction process was repeated to
maximize yield. The combined filtrates were then concentrated under reduced pressure,
resulting in about 221 g of a crude ethanolic extract. Of this total, 20 g of extract was reserved
for further in vivo experimentation. To facilitate subsequent fractionation processes, the
extract was dissolved in 1600 mL of water. A sequential liquid–liquid fractionation protocol
was then performed; first, three separate volumes (each 4800 mL) of n-hexane were added,
with each addition followed by thorough mixing and a 24-h standing period to allow for
layer separation. The upper n-hexane layer was collected, leaving a residue in the aqueous
fraction. Next, the same procedure was repeated with chloroform, again in three 4800 mL
additions, to yield a chloroform layer. Finally, ethyl acetate was used in three 4800 mL
increments under the same conditions, yielding an ethyl acetate layer. Each layer was
evaporated under reduced pressure at 39 ◦C and prepared for MTT and DCF-DA assays to
determine the most potent fraction.
After liquid–liquid fractionation, to further purify the bioactive fraction obtained from
preliminary fractionation, open column chromatography was performed using silica gel
as the stationary phase. Briefly, the silica gel (328.25 g) was first activated by drying at
100 ◦C for at least two hours and then packed into a glass column under gentle tapping to
ensure uniform packing. The chosen fraction from the liquid–liquid fractionation, based
on the MTT and DCF-DA assays, was dissolved in a minimal volume of the initial mobile
phase and carefully loaded onto the top of the silica bed. After, an elution gradient was
established with a binary solvent system (i.e., chloroform and ethanol); a stepwise gradient
was initiated from 100:0 (v/v) chloroform–ethanol to 90:10, 80:20, 70:30, and so on, until
reaching 0:100. Eluent was passed through the column under gravity and fractions (790 mL
each) were collected sequentially. A total of 11 fractions were obtained, evaporated, and
then subjected to the MTT and DCF-DA assays.
Preparative TLC was performed to separate the active compound from the selected
fraction, which represented the highest attenuating effects against oxidative stress among
the fractions. Briefly, a selected fraction was dissolved in absolute ethanol (300 mg/mL),
then spotted on a silica gel 30 cm × 30 cm TLC plate (Merck; Darmstadt, Germany).
One microliter of spotted sample on the plate was developed in the solvent mixture of
chloroform and ethanol (55:45 mL) and visualized using an ultraviolet lamp (245 and 365
nm). After completing the development of TLC bands, each band was scraped and extracted
with ethanol for the measurements of protective effects (i.e., MTT and DCF-DA assays).
3.7. High-Pressure Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) Analysis
In order to isolate the active compound from the fraction of preparative TLC, an HPLC
system coupled with a YL9160 PDA detector was utilized. A Capcell Pak C18 MG S5
Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2025, 26, 4214 14 of 17
column (reverse phase column, size: 4.6 × 250 mm) was employed at 23 ◦C, with a flow
rate of 1 mL/min and wavelength of 200–800 nm. Separation was conducted with a linear
gradient of 0–100% ethanol over 90 min. The sample was dissolved in HPLC-grade ethanol
at the concentration of 1 mg/mL, and the injection volume was 20 µL.
3.8. Elucidation of Active Component Structure: Gas Chromatography (GC)–Mass Spectrometry
(MS) and 1H and 13C-Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) Analyses
GC-MS analysis was performed using an Agilent 6890 Plus gas chromatography
system, equipped with a 5977 N mass selective detector quadruple mass spectrometer
system (Palo Alto, CA, USA). The MS capillary column (30 mm × 0.25 mm, 0.25 µm film
thickness, 5% diphenyl–95% dimethylsiloxane phase) was obtained from J&W Scientific
(Folsom, CA, USA). The temperatures of the GC injection port and MS interface were
run in the electron impact ionization (EI) mode, with electron energy at 79 eV . The mass
spectrometer was operated in full scan mode between 50 and 700 amu. In order to identify
active constituents, the Wiley 7 N spectra database was used. Subsequently, the13C and
1H-NMR were carried out and recorded on a high-resolution NMR (Avance-600, Bruker;
Karlsruhe, Germany) spectrometer operating at 700 MHz and 25 ◦C. The sample was
dissolved in methyl-d3 alcohol-dl.
3.9. In Vivo Experiment I and II: Mouse Intervention Studies Using RR Roots Extract and
Oleamide Therein
ICR (Institute of Cancer Research) male mice (five weeks old) were obtained from
Daehan Biolink (n = 7–8/group; Chungnam, Republic of Korea). The mice were housed
nine per cage in a room maintained with a 12-hr light–dark cycle, 55% humidity, and
23–25 ◦C temperature. For the crude extract intervention (i.e., in vivo experiment I), RR
roots extract was mixed in a commercial diet at a concentration of 400, 800, and 1200 mg/kg
body weight. For the oleamide intervention (i.e., in vivo experiment II), the compound was
mixed with the commercial diet at a concentration of 10, 20, and 40 mg/kg body weight.
The ICR mice were allowed free access to feed and water for 3 weeks, then administrated
Aβ via intracerebroventricular (ICV) injection. Aβ was dissolved in 0.85% (w/v) of sodium
chloride solution, and the injection volume was 5 µL (i.e., 410 pmol/mouse). A Hamilton
micro-syringe fitted with a 26-gauge needle was inserted to a depth of 2.5 mm. The
animal intervention study protocol was approved by the Korea University IACUC review
(KUIACUC-2017-142).
3.10. Y-Maze Test: Assessment of Immediate Working Memory
Spontaneous alternation behavior in a Y-maze was used to evaluate immediate work-
ing memory. The test was performed three days after intracerebroventricular (ICV) injection
of Aβ1-42 to allow for the development of cognitive impairment [ 21]. The Y-maze, con-
structed of black-painted plastic, consisted of three arms each measuring 33 cm in length,
15 cm in height, and 10 cm in width, arranged at equal angles. Mice were placed at the
end of one arm and allowed to explore freely for 8 min. An arm entry was counted only
when the mouse’s hind paws were fully within that arm. An alternation was defined
as consecutive entries into all three arms in overlapping triplet sets. The percentage of
alternation was calculated as [actual alternations/(total arm entries − 2)] × 100.
3.11. Passive Avoidance Test: Assessment of Aversion Learning Ability
A passive avoidance test was performed to assess the aversion learning ability of mice
as reported elsewhere [20]. A passive avoidance apparatus with two compartments—a
lighted side and a dark side—was used. During the training trial, each mouse was placed in
the illuminated compartment. Upon entering the dark compartment, the mouse received an
Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2025, 26, 4214 15 of 17
unavoidable electric shock (0.5 mA for 1 s). One day later, a retention trial was conducted:
the mouse was again placed in the lighted compartment, and the time taken to re-enter the
dark compartment (step-through latency) was recorded, with a maximum limit of 300 s.
3.12. Evaluation of Acute Toxicity of RR Root Extract and Oleamide In Vivo
After the behavior tests, the acute toxicity of the samples was measured using the
serum transaminase reagents kit (AM 101-K, Asan Pharmaceutical; Seoul, Republic of
Korea) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
3.13. Assessment of Lipid Peroxidation Using the ICR Mice Brain
Malondialdehyde (MDA) levels in brain homogenates were quantified using a thiobar-
bituric acid (TBA)–based assay. Briefly, 80µL of each homogenate was mixed with 1% (v/v)
phosphoric acid and 160 µL of 0.67% (w/v) TBA. The mixture was then heated at 95 ◦C for
45 min. After cooling to room temperature, n-butanol was added to extract the resulting
colored complex, and absorbance was measured at 532 nm using a UV-1601 spectropho-
tometer (Shimadzu; Kyoto, Japan). Protein content in each sample was determined by the
Bradford method (Bio-Rad; Hercules, CA, USA), and final MDA levels were expressed as
nanomoles per milligram of protein.
3.14. Assessment of Acetylcholine (ACh) Levels in the ICR Mice Brain
The ACh content was measured using the Hestrin method as described previously [22].
Brain homogenate (1 mL) was mixed with 2 mL of alkaline hydroxylamine reagent. After
1 minute, 1 mL of hydrochloride solution and 1 mL of iron solution were added. The density
of the purple–brown color was determined (540 nm).
3.15. Statistical Analysis
The data are presented as mean ± standard deviation. The normality of distribution
was assessed for each dataset using the Shapiro–Wilk test. If the data were normally dis-
tributed (p > 0.05), a one-way ANOVA followed by Dunnett’s post hoc test was used to com-
pare the experimental groups. If normality was not satisfied (p ≤ 0.05), the Kruskal–Wallis
test followed by Dunn’s multiple comparisons test was applied. A p-value of 0.05 or less
was considered statistically significant, and GraphPad Prism (Ver. 7.00) was used for the
analyses (GraphPad Software; San Diego, CA, USA).
4. Conclusions
To summarize, our study provides compelling evidence that RR root extract and
its bioactive constituent, oleamide, exhibit significant neuroprotective effects against Aβ-
induced toxicity. By employing a multi-step biochemical and analytical approach, oleamide
was identified as the key neuroactive compound within RR root extract. Furthermore,
behavioral improvements observed in the Y-maze and passive avoidance tests suggest
that oleamide mitigates A β-induced cognitive impairments in a dose-dependent man-
ner. Importantly, the absence of overt toxicity at neuroprotective doses strengthens the
case for oleamide as a viable candidate for further applications in humans. Future stud-
ies should focus on elucidating the precise molecular pathways underlying oleamide’s
neuroprotective actions, investigating its long-term efficacy in chronic AD models, and
assessing potential synergistic effects when combined with existing Aβ-targeting or anti-
inflammatory therapies.
