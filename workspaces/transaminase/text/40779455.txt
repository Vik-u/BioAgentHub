Introduction
Atherosclerosis is a chronic immunometabolic disease that is a leading cause of cardiovascular disease 
(CVD) and death globally (1). It is associated with endothelial cell dysfunction, retention of cholesterol-rich 
lipoproteins in arterial walls, and chronic inflammation (2, 3). High plasma low-density lipoprotein–choles-
terol (LDL-C) levels have historically been considered the most significant risk factor for promoting devel-
opment and progression of atherosclerosis. LDL-lowering medications such as statins decreased CVD-re-
lated mortalities for the first decade of their use, but CVD mortality has steadily increased since 2014 with 
alarming rising rates in younger patients (4). Furthermore, statins are associated with serious side effects 
that can result in discontinuation, including liver toxicity. Patients with CVD often present with liver disease 
comorbidities, and liver injury and steatosis are strong predictors of early atherosclerosis (5, 6). Therefore, 
alternative medications are needed for these patients, including those with difficulty tolerating statins. More 
recently, PCSK9 inhibitors have been approved to lower LDL-C levels but are limited by recurrent intrave-
nous injections and resulting immunogenicity (7, 8).
Butyrate, a microbiome-derived short-chain fatty acid with pleiotropic effects on inflammation 
and metabolism, has been shown to significantly reduce atherosclerotic lesions, rectify routine 
metabolic parameters such as low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL -C), and reduce systemic 
inflammation in murine models of atherosclerosis. However, its foul odor, rapid metabolism in the 
gut and thus low systemic bioavailability limit its therapeutic effectiveness. Our laboratory has 
engineered an ester-linked L-serine conjugate to butyrate (SerBut) to mask its taste and odor and 
to coopt amino acid transporters in the gut to increase its systemic bioavailability, as determined 
by tissue measurements of free butyrate, produced by hydrolysis of SerBut. In an apolipoprotein 
E–knockout (ApoE)–/– mouse model of atherosclerosis, SerBut reduced systemic LDL -C, 
proinflammatory cytokines, and circulating neutrophils. SerBut enhanced inhibition of plaque 
progression and reduced monocyte accumulation in the aorta compared with sodium butyrate. 
SerBut suppressed liver injury biomarkers alanine transaminase and aspartate aminotransferase 
and suppressed steatosis in the liver. SerBut overcomes several barriers to the translation of 
butyrate and shows superior promise in slowing atherosclerosis and liver injury compared with 
equidosed sodium butyrate.

While statins remain the gold standard for atherosclerosis therapy, decades of research have revealed 
the critical role of the immune system in disease progression. Following initial lipoprotein deposition and 
oxidation in the subendothelial space, tissue-resident immune cells become activated, and monocytes are 
recruited to the early lesions (9). Oxidized LDL can activate the NF-κB pathway in recruited monocytes, 
resulting in the upregulation of proinflammatory genes, such as adhesion molecules, chemokines, and cyto-
kines (e.g., IL-1α/β, IL-6, and IL-12) (10). For example, monocyte-chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP-1), 
also known as C-motif chemokine ligand 2 (CCL2), regulates inflammatory monocyte trafficking between 
the bone marrow , circulation, and atherosclerotic plaques by binding to its cognate receptor CCR2 on 
immune cells and endothelial cells. Upon uptake of excess oxidized LDL, monocytes differentiate into 
lipid-laden foam cells, which become dysfunctional and contribute to the formation of necrotic core in later 
stages of plaque development (9).
Several studies have reported a predictive relationship between biomarkers of inflammation (e.g., 
C-reactive protein) and cardiovascular events, as well as a direct benefit of antiinflammatory interventions 
in humans (11–15). For example, colchicine, which inhibits the NF-κB–regulated NLR family pyrin-do-
main-containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome, provided proof of concept of the benefits of broad immuno-
suppression (11, 12). Colchicine treatment reduced cardiovascular events but was associated with increased 
lethal infections at high doses, although it received FDA approval at low doses (15–18). Antibody-mediated 
neutralization of IL-1β has also been evaluated in clinical trials but did not meet the primary end point 
at low doses and was similarly associated with a higher incidence of lethal infections (14). Thus, there is 
a need for innovative therapeutics that lower lipids and lipid-driven inflammation without inducing liver 
toxicity or impairing the patient’s ability to fight common infections.
Partially due to its role in regulating inflammation, the gut-heart axis has been repeatedly implicated 
in CVD (19, 20). High-fat diets (HFDs) lead to microbiome dysbiosis and increased risk of CVD, while 
high-fiber diets lead to increased production of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) and atheroprotection (19, 
21–23). Butyrate, an antiinflammatory SCFA and fermentation product of the gut microbiome, has received 
widespread attention for its immunomodulatory applications in immunometabolic diseases such as obesi-
ty, atherosclerosis, and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (24–29). Butyrate exerts antiinflammatory effects 
in immune cells through inhibition of histone deacetylases (HDACs), resulting in suppression of NF-κB 
activation and reduced proinflammatory cytokine secretion (24, 30) . Other antiinflammatory mechanisms 
of butyrate are indirect, such as enhancing the intestinal barrier and thus decreasing the translocation of 
inflammatory molecules like lipopolysaccharide (LPS) (31). Butyrate is further proposed to be atheropro-
tective via regulation of lipid and glucose metabolism genes and improved gut microbiota diversity (31–33). 
In the liver, butyrate reduces hepatic steatosis by increasing fatty acid β-oxidation capacity and decreasing 
lipid synthesis (34). Many studies in experimental CVD animal models and humans have demonstrated 
the use of oral butyrate supplementation as both antiinflammatory and lipid lowering, underscoring the 
therapeutic potential of butyrate to influence development and progression of CVD and expand non-statin 
therapeutic options (32, 33, 35–38).
Despite this potential, pharmacological aspects of butyrate, whether administered orally or generated 
by fermentation in the gut, present substantial limitations. The high concentrations of systemic, circulating 
butyrate required for its antiinflammatory activity (e.g., HDAC inhibition) are not found at physiological 
levels (31, 39). Likewise, oral administration of exogenous butyrate is limited by its fast metabolism in 
the gut, resulting in low absorption into circulation (~3–4 mM in plasma), its foul odor and taste, and its 
large doses required. We have previously engineered a small molecule prometabolite consisting of butyrate 
esterified to L-serine, O-butyryl-L-serine (SerBut), to address the challenges of butyrate translation (28). We 
hypothesize that amino acid transporters in the small intestine allow SerBut to exit the lumen in the small 
bowel and thus bypass metabolism in the large bowel, increasing systemic bioavailability. This esterifica-
tion favorably masks the odor and taste, increases half-life, and maintains the pleiotropic benefits of native 
butyrate upon hydrolysis.
Our group has shown that once- to twice-daily oral gavage of SerBut suppresses disease progression 
in murine models of autoimmune disease such as rheumatoid arthritis and multiple sclerosis (28). Here, 
we aimed to investigate the efficacy of SerBut dosed through drinking water in a murine apolipoprotein 
E–knockout (ApoE–/–) model of atherosclerosis, examining effects on vascular inflammation, plaque for-
mation and composition, systemic metabolic regulation, and HFD-induced liver injury. We show that this 
systemically bioavailable form of butyrate reduces plaque in the aortic root via inhibition of progression,

accumulation of immune cells in the aorta, and liver steatosis. Furthermore, plasma analysis shows SerBut 
reduces the fraction of LDL-C, systemic inflammatory cytokines, circulating neutrophils, and liver damage 
markers elevated by HFD feeding. Under these experimental conditions, equidosed treatment with sodium 
butyrate (NaBut) failed to produce these favorable effects on cardiovascular or hepatic(immuno)pathology.
Results
SerBut is a cytocompatible and stable carrier of  antiinflammatory free butyrate. Previously, our laboratory has 
shown that SerBut suppressed inflammatory marker expression in bone marrow–derived dendritic cells 
(BMDCs) (28, 40). Importantly, we additionally observed that SerBut maintained attenuated HDAC inhibi-
tion activity in a macrophage-like cell line (RA W 264.7) (28). We hypothesized that SerBut could be dosed 
much higher than 0.2 mM, the previously administered dose, without inducing cytotoxicity. Thus, we eval-
uated the cytocompatibility of SerBut compared to NaBut in RA W 264.7 macrophages (Figure 1A and 
Supplemental Figure 1; supplemental material available online with this article; https://doi.org/10.1172/
jci.insight.191090DS1). While NaBut significantly reduced cell viability at 4 mM and above, SerBut exhib-
ited no cytotoxicity even at a concentration of 12 mM. We hypothesized this reduction in cytotoxicity, 
and the previously noted attenuation of HDAC inhibition activity, was due to inactivation of the butyrate 
upon conjugation to serine. Using liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS), 
we determined that approximately 10% of the SerBut sample was free butyrate at the time of measure-
ment (Figure 1B). To investigate stability, we repeated the experiment with SerBut in FBS-supplemented 
complete media stored for 1 month at 37°C (Figure 1B). The relative concentration of free butyrate did 
not change, indicating that esterases in FBS did not hydrolyze SerBut overtime but some free butyrate was 
available in the solution.
Exogenous NaBut supplementation is known to exert antiinflammatory effects through NF-κB sup-
pression in macrophages in vitro and in vivo (24, 30, 35). We next investigated whether SerBut maintained 
NaBut’s antiinflammatory effects in macrophage-like RA W 264.7 cells. SerBut at 12 mM significantly 
suppressed LPS-induced NF-κB activation comparable to 1.3 mM NaBut (Figure 1C), aligning with our 
finding that 10% of the SerBut sample was free butyrate (Figure 1B). NF-κB activation regulates the inflam-
matory macrophage phenotype, inducing proinflammatory cytokine secretion and reactive oxygen species 
production. Therefore, we next investigated expression of activation and inflammation markers down-
stream of NF-κB inhibition. Interestingly, only 12 mM SerBut significantly reduced both induced nitric 
oxide synthase (iNOS) and CD80 expression after LPS stimulation (Figure 1, D and E). Furthermore, 
12 mM SerBut suppressed NF-κB–regulated production of proinflammatory cytokines that are known to 
orchestrate inflammatory immune cell activation and recruitment, IL-6, MCP-1, and GM-CSF , as effec-
tively as 1.3 mM NaBut (Figure 1, F–J). The antiinflammatory cytokine IL-10 was significantly increased 
by NaBut treatment, while SerBut treatment produced a trending increase compared with LPS-stimulated 
controls (Figure 1J). The iNOS-suppressing capacity of high doses of SerBut was maintained even during 
longer LPS stimulations (Supplemental Figure 1C) and had beneficial effect on activation markers CD80 
and CD86 compared with NaBut but not LPS alone (Supplemental Figure 1, A and B). However, this effect 
was not observed when butyrate was dosed after LPS stimulation (Supplemental Figure 1, D–F).
Seryl modification of  butyrate significantly enhances its bioavailability and therapeutic efficacy in atherosclerotic 
mice. To determine the bioavailability of SerBut in cardiovascular organs of hyperlipidemic mice, we gavaged 
equimolar amounts of SerBut and NaBut to ApoE –/– mice on an HFD (42% calories from fat) to ensure 
comparable consumption of butyrate by all mice at the given time point. Three hours after administration, 
we analyzed the biodistribution of free butyrate via LC-MS/MS. (Figure 2A). SerBut dosing significantly 
increased free butyrate in the heart and aorta compared with both NaBut-treated and PBS-treated mice 
(Figure 2, B and C). Corroborating our previous work (28), we also observed significant increases in the liver, 
inguinal lymph nodes (ILNs), kidney, spleen, lung, and plasma (Figure 2, D–H, and J). We also saw trending 
increases of free butyrate in the mesenteric lymph nodes (MLNs) of SerBut-treated mice (Figure 2I).
NaBut is limited in its translation by butyrate’s rapid consumption by colonocytes as a primary energy 
source in the distal gut. We propose that the enhanced biodistribution of free, active butyrate (following 
cleavage from serine) in SerBut-treated mice is due to small intestinal escape from the gut via amino acid 
transporters. To probe this hypothesis, we repeated the experiment and analyzed the biodistribution of free 
active butyrate in distinct sections of the intestinal tissue and the intestinal contents (Figure 2, K and L, and 
Supplemental Figure 2). Because neither ApoE –/– nor HFD feeding would be expected to change amino 
4

acid receptor expression or function in the intestine, this was performed in C57BL/6 mice on a normal diet. 
There were no significant changes in free butyrate in the intestinal contents for SerBut-treated mice (Sup-
plemental Figure 2). Conversely, in the upper and lower small intestine and ileum tissue (41), we observed 
significantly more free, active butyrate in SerBut-treated mice compared with both PBS- and NaBut-treated 
mice, indicating enhanced SerBut transport out of the gut in the small intestine (Figure 2, M–O). We saw 
no increase in butyrate in the colon tissue (Figure 2P).
To investigate SerBut’s effect on cardiovascular disease, ApoE–/– mice were given 150 mM SerBut or 
NaBut dissolved in water ad libitum over 6 weeks in concert with an HFD (Figure 3A). This study fur-
thermore allowed us to investigate a more translatable method of administration by adding SerBut to the 
drinking water, in contrast with administering by oral gavage. Treatment with serine showed no significant 
differences from controls in murine models of autoimmune disease (28) and thus was not included in this 
study. After 6 weeks, we observed significantly less Oil Red O–stained plaque area in the aortic root of Ser-
But-treated mice compared with both control and NaBut-treated groups (Figure 3, B, C, and E). We then 
asked whether plaque complexity and stage were changed between treatment groups, potentially indicating 
suppression of disease progression. Utilizing Stary histological grading (42) and quantification of plaque 
components, we found a significant reduction in plaque severity score, CD68 + stained area, and necrotic 
core area in SerBut-treated mice compared with water-treated mice (Figure 3, F–H, and Supplemental Fig-
ure 3, A–D) and trended lower compared with NaBut-treated mice (Figure 3D). We then investigated the 
plaque immune phenotype by immunofluorescent staining of CD68, iNOS, and DAPI. Although the total 
numbers of CD68 + macrophages were reduced compared to NaBut-treated groups, the macrophages per 
unit area were not (Supplemental Figure 3F-I). However, both CD68 + cells and iNOS + cells per unit area 
atherosclerotic lesion were increased in NaBut-treated groups, indicating a more inflamed plaque phenotype 
in NaBut-treated groups compared with both water-and SerBut-treated groups (Figure 3, I–L).
Since immune cell infiltration into the aorta has been shown to accelerate disease pathogenesis, we next 
asked whether SerBut reduced vascular inflammation (43). Through flow cytometry of the aorta, we found

that only SerBut significantly reduced CD45 + total leukocytes, CD11b + monocytes, and CCR2 +CD11b+ 
monocytes in the aorta compared with control groups, while NaBut did not (Figure 3, M–O). CD11c +M-
HCIIhi dendritic cells, CD11b+F480+ macrophages, and CD19+ B cells were significantly reduced by both 
NaBut and SerBut compared with water controls (Supplemental Figure 4). Additionally, CD11b +Ly-
6Chi monocytes and CD4 + T cells were significantly reduced only in SerBut-treated mice compared to 
water-treated controls (Supplemental Figure 4).
We next evaluated the effect of SerBut on systemic markers of inflammation. SerBut reduced the 
inflammatory cytokines IL-6 and IFN-γ in plasma significantly compared with control groups, while 
NaBut treatment did not (Figure 3, M and N). Both NaBut and SerBut showed a trend toward reduc-
tion in plasma IL-1β (Supplemental Figure 4). SerBut significantly reduced the frequency of circulating 
Ly6G+CD11b+ neutrophils compared with both NaBut- and water-treated controls (Figure 3S). Additional-
ly, SerBut expanded regulatory T cells (Tregs) in the MLNs but not the skin-draining lymph nodes or spleen 
(Supplemental Figure 5). However, in both the MLNs and spleen SerBut reduced the Th17/Treg cell ratio, 
indicating a more tolerogenic phenotype. In the spleen, NaBut-treated mice also showed a lower Th17/
Treg cell ratio (Supplemental Figure 5). In the MLNs, but not the ILNs, CD11b+F480+ macrophages exhib-
ited significantly decreased inflammatory marker iNOS + compared with controls, but not NaBut-treated 
mice (Supplemental Figure 6). Importantly, all cages consumed comparable amounts of water (Figure 3P), 
suggesting that the effect of SerBut is due to its immunological effects and not to the administration of a 
higher dose. Overall, SerBut exerted more efficacious antiatherogenic and antiinflammatory effects in vivo 
than NaBut systemically and at the site of disease compared with water-treated control groups.
Butyrate dosing has been shown to significantly affect the gut microbiome and its metabolic prod-
ucts (31, 44). Thus, we wanted to understand how the 2 types of exogenous butyrate (SerBut and NaB-
ut) affected the microbiome, particularly the colonic microbiota. Based on our biodistribution data, we 
expected that SerBut is predominantly absorbed in the small bowel and transited to systemic circulation, 
thus avoiding the microbial communities found in the colon and their interaction with the host there. 
To understand the potential association between the microbiome and the antiatherosclerotic effects of 
SerBut and NaBut, we performed sequential multiple linear regressions on 16S rRNA sequencing of the 
colonic contents after treatment on HFD for 6 weeks (Supplemental Figures 7–9). We asked whether 
pathology readouts were associated with butyrate treatment (combining SerBut and NaBut together), 
seryl modification of butyrate, or the relative abundance of individual bacterial genera to identify specif-
ic taxa implicated in disease pathology. We found that seryl modification of butyrate, i.e., SerBut treat-
ment, could alone explain the reduction in plaque after controlling for most bacterial genera. We asked 
whether the bacterial genera that were required to explain the reduction in the plaque were expanded 
by SerBut treatment, potentially indicating their mediation of SerBut’s beneficial effects (Supplemental 
Figure 7, B–G). None of these bacteria were expanded by SerBut treatment, indicating that they likely 
do not mediate SerBut’s beneficial effects on atherogenesis. The genus Lactobacillus was the only bacterial 
variable that alone could explain the reduction in plaque in the aortic root after controlling for the afore-
mentioned variables (Supplemental Figure 8).
By contrast, unmodified-butyrate treatment could not explain the observed reduced disease pathology 
and required the abundance of multiple bacterial taxa (Supplemental Figure 9) to explain correlations with 
disease pathology. We then asked whether SerBut’s efficacy can be explained by expanding the abundance 
of Lactobacillus and found that both water control and NaBut groups had significantly more Lactobacillus 
than SerBut groups (Supplemental Figure 8B). Next, we asked whether the treatment group significantly 
modulated the relationship of Lactobacillus abundance with plaque (Supplemental Figure 8C). SerBut-treat-
ed groups showed no relationship between Lactobacillus and plaque, while both NaBut- and water-treated 
groups showed a negative correlation between Lactobacillus and plaque. Together, these data demonstrate 
the differences between the microbiome effects of these 2 forms of exogenous butyrate, suggesting differ-
ing mechanisms of action. We hypothesize that the majority of SerBut’s effect on plaque formation and 
inflammation may not be mediated though modulation of relative abundance of bacterial genera in the 
C57BL/6 mice fed a normal chow (NC) diet, after which they received a single equimolar gavage of 272 mM butyrate as SerBut or NaBut. (L) Diagram of

microbiome, although NaBut treatment may mediate some efficacy through bacterial expansion. Further 
sequencing may be able to provide species-level characterization that could identify single bacteria with 
differentially abundant growth or function due to treatment groups.
SerBut suppresses HFD-induced liver injury. Since NaBut has been shown to reduce plasma lipids in 
murine models of atherosclerosis (38), we asked whether SerBut was also able to influence plasma lip-
ids. LDL-C as a fraction of total cholesterol was significantly reduced by both SerBut and NaBut treat-
ment (Figure 4A and Supplemental Figure 10). Additionally, the ratio of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) 
to total cholesterol was significantly increased in SerBut-treated mice compared with NaBut treatment 
(Figure 4B and Supplemental Figure 10). Neither SerBut nor NaBut influenced total cholesterol or tri-
glycerides in the plasma (Figure 4, C and D). Interestingly, SerBut significantly reduced plasma alanine 
transaminase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) compared with both water control and NaB-
ut groups (Figure 4, E and F), showing reduction in liver damage induced by HFD for SerBut but not 
NaBut treatment. NaBut-treated mice experienced a significant increase in lipase — a common marker 
of pancreatitis — in the plasma, while SerBut showed no effect (Figure 4G), suggesting that SerBut may 
have an enhanced safety profile compared with NaBut. The positive effects of SerBut were indepen-
dent of body weight, as SerBut-treated mice had similar weights to water controls throughout the study 
(Figure 4H). Overall, seryl esterification significantly enhances the antiatherosclerotic hepatoprotective 
activity and safety profile of butyrate.
It has previously been reported that butyrate can reduce fatty deposits, fibrosis, and inflammation in 
the liver (29, 45). Many patients with CVD have liver disease due to metabolic dysregulation, increased 
innate immune cell activation, and unresolved inflammation due to sustained NF-κB activation (46). Fur-
thermore, many lipid-lowering drugs such as statins increase lipid uptake by the liver by increasing LDL-R 
expression, potentially inducing liver toxicity that prevents patients with liver disease from taking these 
medications (7). In the ApoE –/– atherosclerotic model, HFD feeding induces hepatic lipid accumulation 
and inflammation in addition to plaque accumulation in the aorta (47). Thus, motivated by our finding of 
significantly reduced plasma ALT and AST in SerBut-treated groups (Figure 4, E and F), we further inves-
tigated SerBut’s potential beneficial effect on liver health under HFD feeding. Using a previously described 
liver histology scoring system, we investigated key features of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and liver inju-
ry in mice: steatosis (macrovesicular fat), nuclear hypertrophy, and lobular inflammation of the liver (CD3+ 
immune cells) (48). Steatosis was significantly suppressed by SerBut treatment, but not by treatment with 
NaBut (Figure 5A). Neither SerBut nor NaBut significantly reduced CD3 + immune cell infiltration into 
the livers, indicating no change in lobular inflammation, which may be expected at such early time points 
in murine liver disease models (Figure 5B). Hepatocellular nuclear hypertrophy was suppressed by both 
SerBut and NaBut treatment (Figure 5C). Interestingly, both SerBut and NaBut treatment significantly sup-
pressed LDL-R protein levels as shown by Western blot (Supplemental Figure 10). These data suggest that 
the reduction in circulating LDL-C levels via NaBut and SerBut treatment is not due to increased uptake of 
lipids via increased LDL-R expression. Thus, the overall summed histological score indicated reduced liver 
pathology in the ApoE–/– HFD model due to SerBut, but not NaBut, treatment (Figure 5D). Representative 
images are shown (Figure 5, E–L).
We then asked whether SerBut’s effects on disease pathology and inflammation may be partially medi-
ated by changes in lipid metabolism by measuring lipogenic and lipid oxidation gene expression by qPCR 
after treatment for 6 weeks (Supplemental Figure 10, F–L). SerBut-treated mice had significantly reduced 
expression of Acly compared with NaBut-treated mice but not compared to water-treated groups. No signif-
icant changes were seen in de novo lipogenesis, namely fatty acid synthase (Fasn) and acetyl CoA carboxy-
lase 1 (Acaca). Carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1a (Cpt1a), the rate-limiting enzyme in β-oxidation, also was 
not significantly changed but showed a strong trend toward reduction compared with water-treated groups 
(P = 0.06). Taken together, these data suggest that reduction in liver lipogenesis nor increase in β-oxidation 
had measurable impact on phenotypic changes.

Discussion
Butyrate, a key link between gut microbiota and metabolic health, has long been investigated for its bene-
ficial effects in many metabolic and immune dysregulated states. The vast majority of either physiological 
(via microbial fermentation in the distal gut) or orally administered butyrate is metabolized by intestinal 
colonocytes as a primary energy source, limiting its antiinflammatory efficacy that might otherwise occur 
with systemic exposure. Since very little enters the circulation, the primary effect of orally dosed free butyr-
ate is hypothesized to be on the intestinal lining and microbiome rather than distant organs and immune 
cells (49, 50). In the gut, butyrate promotes differentiation of colonic Treg cells via HDAC inhibition, 
allowing increased peripheral Treg cells by emigration (51, 52). Our lab previously engineered butyrate to 
escape the gut, utilizing esterification to a hydroxyl-containing amino acid, serine, hypothesized to allow 
butyrate transport into the portal blood through small intestinal amino acid transporters (28). This modifi-
cation may additionally allow transit across the plasma membrane via transporters, dependent on the cell 
type. In this study, we assayed free, active butyrate in the gut contents and tissues separated by gut segment 
(Figure 2 and Supplemental Figure 2). We found that only in small intestinal tissue did SerBut-dosed mice 
show a significant increase in free, active butyrate by LC-MS/MS. These data, which we believe to be

novel, support our hypothesis that SerBut escapes in the small intestine, evading consumption in the distal 
gut. Due to the promiscuous nature of amino acid transporters in the intestine and the failure of previous 
knockout experiments to inhibit amino acid transport, we did not investigate the specific amino acid trans-
porter responsible for SerBut’s uptake (41), hypothesizing that SerBut transport is mediated by multiple 
amino acid transporters.
In this study, we investigated the progression of cardiometabolic disease in ApoE –/– mice fed an HFD 
for 6 weeks in concurrence with SerBut or NaBut administered in drinking water ad libitum (Figure 3A).

aortic root and plasma LDL-C levels without affecting body weight (Figure 3H and Figure 4, A and H). 
SerBut did not induce liver injury or elevate LDL-R, as is common in some current standard-of-care thera-
peutics, but in fact inhibited liver injury induced by HFD feeding (Figure 4, E and F , Figure 5, and Supple-
mental Figure 10). These results support previous work showing butyrate’s protection against LPS-induced 
inflammatory liver injury through NF-κB suppression (21) and liver injury in an HFD-fed model (29) with-
out suffering from dosing and translational limitations.
The in vivo studies described here have important limitations that may influence human translation. 
The ApoE–/– murine model of atherosclerosis is advantageous due to its representation of inflammation yet 
has several limitations in recapitulation of human lipid metabolism. For example, since the lipid-lowering 
effect of statins is partially dependent on the presence of ApoE (53, 54), direct comparisons to the standard 
of care are precluded in this model. Furthermore, analysis of long-term suppression of liver injury would 
require longer periods of HFD feeding, as HFD-fed murine models of liver injury do not recapitulate the 
human disease until 8–16 weeks of HFD (55). The murine ApoE –/– model lacks expression of the human 
lipoprotein gene CETP (encoding cholesteryl ester transfer protein), human CVD contributor lipopro-
tein(a), and differential bile acid composition. Thus, the lipid-lowering and immunometabolic modulatory 
properties of SerBut, especially those potentially due to modulation of liver metabolism, require further 
investigation to understand how these differences could impact translation.
Therapeutically targeting inflammation to reduce CVD has shown promise in recent trials such as the 
CANTOS (Cardiovascular Risk Reduction Study [Reduction in Recurrent Major CV Disease Events]) 
(14) and COLCOT (Colchicine Cardiovascular Outcomes Trial) (12) trials. In these trials, patients with 
relatively low levels of serum LDL-C or previous myocardial infarction events, respectively, saw reduced 
adverse cardiovascular events with immunotherapy. These results strongly suggest that inflammatory 
pathways play an important role in disease promotion. However, these trials used broad antiinflamma-
tory medications: the IL-1β –neutralizing antibody canakinumab and the NLRP3 inflammasome inhib-
itor colchicine, respectively. A significant increase in lethal infections led to concerns about the safety 
of these drugs, although low doses of colchicine have been FDA approved. Despite these challenges, 
research on antiinflammatory approaches to treating and suppressing CVD became an important step 
toward better therapeutics (56).
Butyrate demonstrates antiinflammatory NF-κB–suppressing effects in myeloid cells by acting as an 
HDAC inhibitor (57), preventing NF-κB p65 from binding inflammatory gene promoters (58). Downstream 
of NF-κB activation, the NLRP3 inflammasome, in concert with caspase-1, cleaves pro-IL-1β to its active 
form. Active IL-1β stimulates enhanced secretion of IL-6 and IFN-γ along with other proinflammatory 
cytokines. We previously showed that SerBut maintains the HDAC-inhibiting activity of free butyrate (28). 
Here, we further demonstrate SerBut’s antiinflammatory effect, showing that SerBut suppresses NF-κB, 
downregulates iNOS expression, and reduces secretion of proinflammatory cytokines in macrophage-like 
cells in vitro (Figure 1, C–I).
We note that esterases that can cleave SerBut to yield bioactive butyrate are both extracellular and 
intracellular. Different relevant cell types may have many different import capabilities for both SerBut and 
hydrolyzed butyrate. SerBut presumably enables entry to the cytoplasm and liberation of free butyrate 
therein via intracellular esterases in vivo in various cell types. In addition to acting as a delivery vehicle for 
free butyrate, there are possible disparate molecular mechanisms of SerBut as a full construct that were not 
investigated in this study. There are a variety of tissue-specific esterases that could cleave SerBut, many of 
which are different between humans and mice (59). Increased bioavailability of free, active butyrate (Fig-
ure 2 and Supplemental Figure 2) shows that SerBut is indeed cleaved in assayed tissue types and leads to 
improvements in cardiometabolic health in each tissue of interest (aorta, heart, and liver). However, ester-
ase expression differences between human and mice could lead to differing results in humans. It is yet to be 
seen whether these differences will prove beneficial or detrimental to the translation.
In murine atherosclerosis, SerBut reduced total immune cells, monocytes, and CCR2 + monocytes in 
the aorta compared with water-treated controls (Figure 3, M–O). This indicates suppression of myeloid 
activation, potentially resolving atherogenic inflammation and reducing recruitment (60). Systemically, 
SerBut reduced the proinflammatory cytokines IL-6 and IFN-γ in the plasma (Figure 3, Q and R) and 
circulating neutrophils (Figure 3S). A reduction in circulating monocytes, neutrophils, and platelets has 
previously been seen as a side effect in clinical trials investigating HDAC inhibitors (61). This side effect 
has inhibited the use of small molecule HDAC inhibitors for use in chronic diseases. It is an open question 
12
RESEARCH ARTICLEJCI Insight 2025;10(15):e191090  https://doi.org/10.1172/jci.insight.191090
whether use of SerBut in humans would produce these complications; however, reduced inflammatory 
cells in circulation reduce the number of cells that can contribute to plaque formation, providing more 
benefit than complication. Importantly, we previously showed that although SerBut reduces innate immune 
activation, it does not dampen responses to vaccination in the presence of an adjuvant consisting of alum 
admixed with the TLR4 agonist monophosphoryl lipid A (28). Questions remain on the effect of SerBut 
treatment on innate immune responses to infection; however, previous reports suggest that the antiinflam-
matory effects of butyrate are context dependent (28).
In summation, we have demonstrated that systemically bioavailable butyrate dosed through SerBut is 
able to modulate immunity, thus suppressing atherosclerosis progression and liver pathology in the ApoE–/– 
HFD murine model of atherosclerosis. Butyrate has long been of interest in cardiometabolic disease, but 
its exploration has been limited by its low bioavailability and aversive sensory experience. Our results show 
that addressing these challenges significantly accentuates the benefit of butyrate dosing in the ApoE –/– 
model of atherosclerosis compared with treatment with NaBut. SerBut’s liver protective effect was also 
accentuated compared with NaBut, likely attributable to enhanced exposure of the liver as indicated in 
our biodistribution study. This information may be useful in considering simple, low-toxicity combinations 
to reduced progression of cardiometabolic disease, including in patients with previous liver disease, liver 
injury, or mutations in the ApoE gene diminishing their response to statins (5, 53, 54).

Sex as a biological variable. This study was conducted using female ApoE–/– mice. Sex differences are known 
to influence the development of atherosclerosis and metabolic disease (62). For example, female mice typi-
cally develop larger aortic root lesions earlier than male mice. Female mice also exhibit a stronger adaptive 
immune response to oxidized LDL and a more robust innate immune response to TLR stimulation (63, 64). 
In contrast, pharmacological interventions such as PPARγ agonists and IFN-γ deficiency have shown thera-
peutic benefits primarily in male mice (65, 66). These observations suggest that sex may influence the magni-
tude of therapeutic response in ApoE–/– mice. However, because inflammation is a central feature of athero-
sclerosis in both sexes, and because of the complex immunological mechanisms involved in our study, it is 
difficult to predict whether sex-specific differences would enhance or attenuate the observed effects. To reduce 
biological variability and maintain clarity in data interpretation, we conducted all experiments in a single sex.
Synthesis of  SerBut. SerBut was synthesized as described previously (28). Briefly, L-serine (20 g, 0.19 
mol) was added to trifluoroacetic acid (200 mL), and the suspension was stirred for 30 minutes until every-
thing dissolved. Butyryl chloride (25.7 mL, 0.23 mol) was then added to the solution, and the mixture was 
stirred for 2 hours at room temperature. The reaction was then transferred to an ice bath, and diethyl ether 
(500 mL) was added, which resulted in precipitation of a white solid. The resulting fine white precipitate 
was collected by filtration, washed with cold diethyl ether, and dried under vacuum to yield 26.3 g of O-bu-
tyryl-L-serine (0.15 mol, 79%). The final product was confirmed by 1H NMR (500 MHz, DMSO-d6) [ppm]: 
0.88 (3H, t), 1.55 (2H, m), 2.32 (2H, t), 4.30 (1H, t), 4.43 (2H, d), 8.66 (2H, s), 14.06 (1H, s).
Derivatization and LC-MS/MS detection of  butyrate. Samples were prepared and derivatized as described 
previously (28). Stock solutions were prepared in water/acetonitrile (ACN) (1:1 v/v): 3-nitrophenylhydra-
zine (NPH), and 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide (EDC) (in 1% pyridine). The internal stan-
dard, 4-methylvaleric acid, was added. Samples were mixed with NPH and EDC stocks at a 1:1:1 volume 
ratio. The mixture was heated in a heating block at 60°C for 30 minutes. Samples were filtered through 0.22 
μm filters and stored at 4°C before analysis.
An Agilent 6460 Triple Quad MS-MS was used to detect the derivatized butyrate. Both derivatized 
butyrate-NPH and 4-methylvaleric-NPH were detected in negative mode. Column: Thermo Fisher Scientif-
ic C18 4.6 × 50 mm, 1.8 μm particle size, at room temperature. Mobile phase A: water with 0.1% v/v for-
mic acid. Mobile phase B: ACN with 0.1% v/v formic acid. Injection volume: 5.0 μL. Flow rate: 0.5 mL/
min. Gradient of solvent: 15% mobile phase B at 0.0 minutes; 100% mobile phase B at 3.5 minutes; 100% 
mobile phase B at 6.0 minutes; 15% mobile phase B at 6.5 minutes. The MS conditions were optimized 
using pure butyrate-NPH or 4-methylvaleric-NPH at 1 mM. The fragment voltage was set to 135 V , and the 
collision energy was 18 V . Multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) of 222 → 137 was assigned to butyrate, 
and MRM of 250 → 137 was assigned to 4-methylvaleric acid as the internal standard. The ratio between 
MRM of butyrate and 4-methylvaleric acid was used to quantify butyrate concentration.

LPS-induced activation of  RAW 264.7 macrophages and RAW-blue macrophages. RA W 264.7 (ATCC, TIB-71) 
macrophages were cultured at 37°C and 5% CO2 in DMEM (Gibco) supplemented with 1 mM HEPES, 1 
mM sodium pyruvate, 10% FBS, and penicillin/streptomycin. Cells were plated in round-bottom 96-well 
plates at 100,000 cells per well and incubated with different concentrations of either NaBut or SerBut (0.15–
12 mM) for 24 hours. Cells were then rinsed with PBS and then stimulated with 200 ng/mL LPS in media 
for 6 hours. The cell culture supernatant was collected and analyzed by LEGENDPlex to analyze the con-
centrations of cytokines (BioLegend). Cell phenotype was analyzed using flow cytometry (Cytek Aurora).
NF-κB inhibition was assayed using the NF-κB-SEAP reporter cell line, RA W-Blue (InvivoGen, raw-
sp). Cells were plated in round-bottom 96-well plates at 100,000 cells per well and cocultured with differ-
ent concentrations of either NaBut or SerBut (0.15–12 mM) for 24 hours. After the addition of butyrate, 
cells were rinsed with phosphate buffered saline (PBS) and then stimulated with 200 ng/mL LPS in media 
for 6 hours.
Cell viability assay. CellTiter 96 AQueous one Solution Cell Proliferation Assay (MTS) (Promega, 
G3582) was used according to the manufacturer’s instructions to analyze cytotoxicity of SerBut and NaBut 
at various concentrations (0.15–12 mM) in RA W 264.7 macrophages. Viability values were normalized to 
untreated cells (100%) and Triton X-100–treated cells (0%). Since absorbance is directly proportional to the 
number of living cells in culture, values greater than 100% indicate cell growth compared with controls.
Mice. Female ApoE –/– mice, aged 6–8 weeks, were purchased from The Jackson Laboratory (stock 
002052; B6.129P2-Apoetm1Unc/J). Female C57BL/6 mice aged 6–8 weeks were purchased from Charles River 
(strain code 027, Charles River). C57BL/6 and ApoE–/– mice were maintained in a specific pathogen–free 
facility at the University of Chicago. Mice were maintained on a 12-hour light/dark cycle at a room tem-
perature of 20°C–24°C.
Biodistribution of  SerBut. ApoE–/– mice on 6 weeks of HFD were orally gavaged with 272 mM butyrate, 
equal to approximately 24 mg butyrate (52 mg SerBut or 30 mg NaBut) or PBS. Three hours after admin-
istration, mice were anesthetized under isoflurane, and blood was collected via submandibular vein into 
EDTA-coated tubes. The tubes were centrifuged, and plasma was collected and frozen at –80°C. Mice were 
then pressure perfused with 30 mL of PBS containing 1 mM EDTA via the left ventricle after severing the 
inferior vena cava. Organs, including liver, MLNs, ILNs, spleen, lung, heart, aorta, small intestine, and large 
intestine were collected and then transferred to –80°C until further processing. To extract butyrate from plas-
ma or organs, a 1:1 (v/v) ACN/water solution was used. Plasma was mixed 1:1 with the ACN/water solu-
tion and centrifuged to remove denatured proteins. Organs were weighed, transferred to Lysing Matrix D 
tubes (MP Biomedicals), and combined with the 1:1 v/v ACN/water solution. Samples were then lysed using 
a FastPrep-24 5G homogenizer (MP Biomedicals) and centrifuged. The supernatants were collected for butyr-
ate measurement by LC-MS/MS. The final butyrate content in each organ was normalized by organ weight.
Drinking water SerBut administration in ApoE–/– model. For 6 weeks, mice were freely administered water, 
water containing 150 mM SerBut, or water containing an equimolar amount of NaBut. SerBut water was 
pH adjusted using 10 M NaOH to a final pH of 7.4. NaBut water was not pH adjusted and had a pH of 
approximately 8. In concert, mice were fed an HFD with 42% from fat and 0.2% total cholesterol (Envigo, 
TD-88137) ad libitum. After 6 weeks, mice were euthanized. The lMLNs, ILNs, spleen, heart, and aor-
ta were harvested and processed for flow cytometry analysis (67). The liver was harvested and part was 
homogenized in tissue protein extraction reagent buffer (Invitrogen, 78510) supplemented with protease 
inhibitor mini tablets (Thermo Fisher Scientific, PIA32955) for Western blotting and qPCR. The remaining 
liver was fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and embedded in paraffin for histological analysis.
Flow cytometry and antibodies. Flow cytometry was performed using a BD LSRFortessa or a Cytek Auro-
ra full-spectrum cytometer. Data were analyzed using FlowJo version 10.8.0. eFluor 780 Viability Dye 
(Invitrogen, 65-0865-14) and antibodies against the following markers were used in the RA W 264.7 mac-
rophage in vitro studies: CD86 (BV421; BD Horizon, catalog 564198), CD80 (BC650; BioLegend, clone 
16-10A1, catalog 104732), and iNOS (APC; Invitrogen, clone CXNFT, catalog 17-5920-9). Live/Dead 
Blue (Invitrogen, 123105A) and antibodies against the following markers were used in the atherosclerosis 
mouse models: F4/80 (FITC; BioLegend, clone BM8, catalog 123108), CD3e (BV605; BD Biosciences,

Flow cytometry of  the aorta. As previously described (67), mice were pressure perfused with 30 mL of 
PBS via the left ventricle after severing the inferior vena cava. The heart with the ascending and descend-
ing aorta to the diaphragm was harvested. The perivascular adipose tissue was carefully removed by 
microdissection while keeping the adventitia intact. The aorta was then cut at the base of the heart, placed 
in digestion media, and cut into 5 mm long pieces. To create a single cell suspension, digestion media 
consisted of DMEM supplemented with 0.5 mM CaCl 2, 2.5 mM MgCl2, 125 U/mL collagenase XI (Sig-
ma-Aldrich), 450 U/mL collagenase I (Sigma-Aldrich), 60 U/mL hyaluronidase, (Sigma-Aldrich), and 
60 U/mL DNase I (Sigma-Aldrich). After 45 minutes of digestion at 37°C with orbital shaking, aortas 
were passed through a 70 μm cell strainer, rinsed, pelleted, and plated into a U-bottom 96-well microplate 
for staining. Cells were washed in PBS and stained for 15 minutes on ice with 1:500 Live/Dead Fixable 
Violet Dye (Invitrogen) and 1:200 anti-mouse CD16/CD32 (clone 93, BioLegend). Cells were washed in 
PBS supplemented with 2% FBS (FACS buffer) and stained for 30 minutes on ice with surface antibodies 
at a 1:200 dilution in a 1:1 mixture of FACS buffer and Brilliant Stain Buffer (BD Biosciences). Cells 
were washed with FACS buffer and PBS and fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde on ice for 20 minutes. Cells 
were washed twice with PBS and resuspended in FACS buffer. Precision count beads (BioLegend) were 
used to determine absolute cell counts. In this study, antibodies used included those against CD16/CD32 
(BioLegend, clone 93, catalog 101302), CCR2 (PE; R&D Systems, catalog FAB5538P), CD11b (BV605; 
BioLegend, clone M1/70, catalog 101257), CD11c (PE-Cy7; BD Biosciences, clone HL3, catalog 558079, 
BD Biosciences), CD19 (APC; BioLegend, clone 1D3, catalog 152412), CD3e (BUV395; clone 145-2C11, 
catalog 563565), CD45 (BV786; BD Biosciences, clone 30-F11, catalog 564225), F4/80 (BUV496; BD 
Biosciences, clone T45-2342, catalog 750644), I-A/I-E (PerCP-Cy5.5; BioLegend, clone M5/114.15.2, 
catalog 107626), Ly-6C (APC-Cy7; BioLegend, clone HK1.4, catalog 128026), and Ly-6G (FITC; eBio-
science, clone 1AB, catalog 11-9668-80).
Sectioning and Oil Red O staining of  aortic root. Hearts were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 24 hours and 
cryopreserved with sucrose (15% sucrose for 24 hours, 30% sucrose for 24 hours, 1:1 30% sucrose and OCT) 
before being embedded in OCT (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Frozen embedded samples were sectioned at 8 
μm until all 3 leaflets were visible. Aortic root sections were brought to room temperature and rehydrated 
with PBS. Staining solution was freshly prepared by mixing 3:2 Oil Red O (0.5% in isopropanol, Sigma 
Aldrich) to water. The solution was filtered through a 0.22 μ m PES syringe filter (Millipore) and pipetted 
onto sections. After 15 minutes in a sealed dark chamber, sections were washed 3 times with water and 
imaged. Images were analyzed using QuPath (v0.5.0) (https://qupath.github.io). Each leaflet was circled 
broadly to include the plaque and then subsequently trained on the QuPath pixel classifier using the soft-
ware’s artificial neural network. Training images were then tested and validated to identify the plaques to 
calculate their area and exclude non-plaque structures in the image. Plaque sizes were subsequently averaged 
and used to determine percentage Oil Red O–positive plaque area in the leaflet.
Immunohistochemistry and Stary plaque severity grading. Frozen aortic root sections were fixed in Zamboni 
fixative for 10 minutes. After TBS wash, slides were loaded on Leica Bond RX automated stainer. Anti–
mouse CD68 antibody (BioLegend, catalog 137001, clone FA-11; 1:4000) was applied to tissue sections for 
60 minutes of incubation at room temperature. Following TBS wash, tissue sections were incubated with 
rabbit anti-rat IgG (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 31219) 30 minutes. The antigen-antibody binding was detect-
ed using Polymer-HRP (Leica Biosystems, Bond Polymer Refine Detection kit, DS9800). The slides were 
coverglassed by autocoverslipper (Tissue-Tek Glas g2). Stary plaque severity grading was done as previously 
described (42). Briefly, each individual mouse was scored if there were at least 2 sections showing all 3 leaf-
lets of the aortic valve that could reasonably be scored. Each leaflet was scored individually per aortic valve 
and subsequently averaged per section. All sections were averaged per mouse for a final score. Sections were 
graded blinded. Table 1 explains the scoring scale. Quantitative analysis of plaque features was performed 
using a classifier in QuPath (v .05.0).
Immunofluorescent staining of  the aortic root. Aortic root sections were brought to room temperature and 
rehydrated with PBS and permeabilized with 10% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). Sections were blocked with 
0.05% casein in PBS and stained overnight at 4°C with rat monoclonal anti–mouse CD68 at 1:400 (BioLeg-
end, clone FA-11) and rabbit polyclonal anti–mouse iNOS at 1:50 (Proteintech, 18985-1-AP). Sections were 
then washed with PBS with 0.05% Tween 20 and incubated for 1 hour at room temperature with secondary

antibodies Alexa Fluor 488 donkey polyclonal anti-rabbit IgG at 1:500 (Invitrogen, A21208) and Alexa 
Fluor 555 donkey polyclonal anti-rabbit IgG at 1:500 (Invitrogen, A31572). Sections were washed again in 
PBS with 0.1% Tween 20 and then PBS and mounted with ProLong Gold Antifade Mountant with DAPI 
(Invitrogen). Slides were imaged with a DMI8 inverted fluorescence microscope (Leica Microsystems) and 
analyzed with QuPath (v0.5.0).
Blood chemistry and inflammatory cytokines in plasma. Blood chemical analysis was performed on an Alfa 
Wasserman ACE Axcel Chemistry Analyzer. Reagent kits from Alfa Wasserman were used according to 
manufacturer’s instructions to analyze plasma: lipase (catalog SA1045), HDL-C (catalog SA2038, LDL-C 
(catalog SA1040), AST (catalog SA1053), ALT (catalog SA1052). A LEGENDPlex was utilized to analyze 
the concentrations of inflammatory cytokines (BioLegend).
Histological grading and scoring of  livers. Sections (8 μm thick) were stained. Digital image files were created 
with an Olympus VS200 Research Slide Scanner (Olympus/Evident) with a Hamamatsu ORca-Fusion camera 
(Hamamatsu Photonics) at ×40 magnification. Individual images were created with the OlyVIA Viewer soft-
ware (Olympus/Evident). Scoring and grading was performed by a pathologist as previously described (48). 
Immunohistochemistry grading was informed by age-matched WT controls. In age-matched WT controls, 
CD3+ immune cells were seen scattered without distinct aggregate formation nor associated tissue reaction. In 
an ×400 field, we observed up to 25 CD3+ immune cells scattered in an even distribution, with rare events of up 
to 10 periductal CD3+ immune cells but with no associated ductal or parenchymal reaction. A score of 1 was 
given to samples with one focus in which more than 10 periductal CD3+ lymphocytes are found in an ×200 field, 
suggesting mild periductal inflammation. Furthermore, a score of 2 corresponds to 2 to 5 instances of more than 
10 periductal CD3+ immune cells in an ×200 field. Any sample exceeding this threshold was scored a 3.
Statistics. Statistical analysis and plotting of data were performed using Prism 10.0.2 (GraphPad), as indi-
cated in figure legends. One-way ANOVA with Tukey’s, Brown-Forsythe, and Welch’s (if standard deviations 
[SDs] were significantly different), or Kruskal-Wallis post hoc test (if data were not normally distributed) were 
used for multiple comparisons. Bartlett’s test and Brown-Forsyth test were performed to determine whether 
assumption of equal SDs was appropriate. If P was less than 0.05, Brown-Forsythe and Welch’s ANOVA tests 
were performed assuming different SDs. Normality analysis was done by Shapiro-Wilk test. An unpaired Stu-
dent’s t test was used for pairwise comparisons. Welch’s t test was used if SDs were significantly different. If  
data were not normally distributed, determined by Shapiro-Wilk normality test, a Mann-Whitney test was used.
Study approval. All protocols used in this study were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use 
Committee of the University of Chicago.
