Structural dynamics of the 
transaminase active site revealed 
by the crystal structure of a co-
factor free omega-transaminase 
from Vibrio fluvialis JS17
Young-Cheul Shin1, Hyungdon Yun2 & Hyun Ho Park3
Omega (ω)-transaminase catalyzes the transfer of an amino group from a non-α position amino acid, or 
an amine compound with no carboxylic group, to an amino acceptor, and has been studied intensively 
because of its high potential utility in industry and pharmatheutics. The ω-transaminase from Vibrio 
fluvialis JS17 (Vfat) is an amine:pyruvate transaminase capable of the stereo-selective transamination 
of arylic chiral amines. This enzyme exhibits extraordinary enantio-selectivity, and has a rapid reaction 
rate for chiral amine substrates. In this study, we report the crystal structure of the apo form of Vfat. 
The overall structure of Vfat was typical of other class III aminotransferase exhibiting an N-terminal 
helical domain, a small domain, and a large domain. Interestingly, the two subunits of apo Vfat in the 
asymmetric unit had different structures. A comparison of the overall structure to other transaminases, 
revealed that the structures of the N-terminal helical domain and the large domain can be affected by 
cofactor occupancy, but the structural rearrangement in these regions can occur independently.
Transaminases (also called aminotransferases) are a large group of enzymes that can remove the amino group 
from amino acids, transferring it to an α -keto acid, thereby producing an amino acid product. Transaminases 
therefore play an important role in amino-acid metabolism
1,2. All transaminases use pyridoxal 5ʹ -phosphate 
(PLP) as a cofactor for catalysis. The catalytic mechanism of a transaminase can be divided into two steps; first 
the PLP cofactor changes from the aldehyde form (PLP) to the amino form (PMP). This is accomplished by the 
amino acid substrate donating its amine group to the PLP cofactor in the enzyme to produce E-PMP and the cor-
responding keto acid. In the second part of the reaction, the amino acceptor takes the amino group from E-PMP 
to produce the corresponding amino acid, thereby regenerating E-PLP
3,4.
Transaminases can be classified into α- or ω-transaminase based on the relative position of the amino group to 
be transferred5,6. The family of ω-transaminase, which use ω-amino acids, include pyruvate transaminase, ornith-
ine transaminase, 4-aminobutyrate transaminase, and acetylornithine transaminase, all of which transfer amino 
groups on non-α positions7,8. On the other hand, α-transaminase act only on the α-amino groups on α-amino 
acids. Based on sequence similarity, transaminases can also be divided into four subgroups and ω-transaminase 
belongs to subgroup II2. Among the ω-transaminases, only ω-amino acid:pyruvate transaminase has a catalytic 
activity towards primary amines and aliphatic amines that lack carboxyl groups6,9,10. ω-transaminases are particu-
larly interesting and have been studied intensively because of their industrial application as biocatalysts for the 
production of various amino acids and chiral amines of high enantioselective purity
11–14.
The ω-transaminase from Vibrio fluvialis JS17 (Vfat) is an unique PLP-containing enzyme that catalyzes the 
reversible amino group transfer reaction from an amine to a keto acid10. Vfat is an amine:pyruvate transaminase 
capable of the stereo-selective transamination of arylic chiral amines that is highly suitable for the production 
of chiral amines due to its strict enantio-selectivity and its broad specificity for chiral amine amino donors

Interestingly, Vfat showed narrow substrate specificity toward aliphatic amines, although it has high substrate 
specificity for chiral aromatic amines and enantio-selectivity for the (S)-enantiomer of chiral amines3. To improve 
the activity and substrate specificity of Vfat, rational protein design by modeling and direct enzyme evolution 
have been attempted
15–20. In the present study, we report the crystal structure of the PLP free apo Vfat. Although 
the overall structure of the cofactor free Vfat was similar to that of the recently solved PLP-bound Vfat 17, the 
two subunits of the cofactor free Vfat in the asymmetric unit showed different structures. Based on the current 
structural study, we found that the structures of the N-terminal helical domain and the large domain of Vfat 
can be altered by cofactor occupancy in the PLP binding site. In addition, we discovered that the two regional 
rearrangements of the structure that occur upon cofactor binding occur independently. A model of activation 
and inactivation of transaminase by PLP-substrate dissociation, enzyme stability and stoichiometric changes has 
been suggested recently
21–23. Our findings with structure of dimeric, PLP-free form of apo Vfat provide a better 
understanding of structural alternation and stability of transaminase without cofactor
Results
Structure of the apo state of ω -transaminase from Vibrio fluvialis  JS17 (Vfat).  The crys -
tal structure of ω -transaminase from Vibrio fluvialis  JS17 (Vfat) was determined at a resolution of 2.0 Å using 
the coordinates of the previously solved Class III aminotransferase (PDB ID: 3GJU) 24 as the search model for 
molecular replacement. The structure was refined to an Rwork = 18.7% and Rfree = 23.7%. The crystallographic 
and refinement statistics are summarized in Table 1. Several residues with poor electron density were excluded 
from the final model. Two molecules, subunit A and subunit B, were detected in the asymmetric unit (Fig. 1A). 
Interestingly, the two subunits did not contain any cofactor such as PMP or PLP based on the electron density 
map (Supplementary Fig. 1A,B). As the dimeric form of the current structure might be coincidently formed 
during crystal packing, we confirmed the stoichiometry of the apo-state of Vfat in solution by multi-angle light 
scattering (MALS), which measures the absolute molecular mass of the target protein in solution. The theoretical 
molecular mass of Vfat, including the His-tag was 52.79 kDa, whereas the measured mass was 103.72 kDa (0.89% 
fitting error), indicating that the apo-state of Vfat also forms a dimer in solution (Fig. 1B).
The overall structure of apo Vfat shows the typical transaminase fold, which is comprised of two major 
domains, the small domain and the large domain (Fig.  2A). The large domain (residues 91–313) forms a 
Rossmann-like fold, which is composed of a seven-stranded parallel β  sheet (Fig. 2A). All the β strands except 
β11 were parallel with the strand order β5-β11-β10-β9-β8-β6-β7 (Fig. 2A,B). The small domain can be divided 
into two lobes, the N-terminal lobe (residues 31–79) and the C-terminal lobe (residues 327–452). The two lobes 
are connected laterally by three backbone hydrogen bonds formed between residues 50–52 from the N-terminal 
lobe and residues 411–413 from the C-terminal lobe (Fig. 2A). The N-terminal lobe in the small domain contains 
three-stranded antiparallel β  strands which are capped by two helices, known as the additional domain α 1-α2 
helices (N-terminal helix domain). Interestingly, the electron density for this domain was poorly visible in the

24–28 in subunit B were partially disordered (Fig.  2B and Supplementary Fig. 2A). An invisible region, arising 
as a result of poor density, was also observed in the α 6-α7 helix domain of subunit B (corresponding residues 
151–163). Thus, this region was not resolved in the final model (Fig. 2B and Supplementary Fig. 2B).

Comparison with the cofactor-bound forms of Vfat. As the structures of PLP/PMP bound Vfats, 
namely the PLP-bound form (PDB: 4E3R) and the PMP-bound form (PDB: 4E3Q), are available17, we compared 
our structure with PLP/PMP bound Vfats. The structure of the two PLP/PMP bound Vfats differed from our apo 
Vfat structure in that both of the two cofactor-bound forms (PLP/PMP) of Vfat had structurally stable helices in 
the α1-α2 region and the α6-α7 region (Fig. 3A) unlike the cofactor free Vfat form whose structure contained 
a disordered α 1-α2 region in subunit A and a disordered α 6-α7 in subunit B. The PLP/PMP bound Vfat had 
four symmetric molecules in the asymmetric unit
17. Next, we compared the structural differences in the active 
site between PLP-bound form, the PMP-bound form and the cofactor-free apo form of Vfat. It is well known 
that the active site lysine for PLP binding is highly conserved among all transaminases. In Vfat, the cofactor can 
bind the lysine present at residue 285 (K285), which is located between β10 and β11 (Fig. 3B). In the PLP-bound 
form (PDB ID: 4E3R), PLP forms a covalent Schiff base linking it to K285. In the PMP-bound form (PDB ID: 
4E3Q), K285 was not covalently bound to PMP , but the orientation of the side chain group of K285 in the active 
site was identical to the PLP-bound form (Fig.  3B). Interestingly, however, the two subunits in the apo form of 
Vfat showed different side chain orientation at K285 despite the backbone folding in the vicinity of the K285 in 
both subunits being structurally analogous to those of the PLP- and PMP-bound form. Specifically, the side chain 
group of K285 in subunit A showed a similar orientation to that of PMP-bound form, whereas the side chain 
group of K285 in subunit B had the opposite orientation (Fig. 3B). Generally, free residues that lose their binding 
moieties may be less structurally stable. In this regard we think that the absence of cofactor could lead to a loss of 
conformational stability of K285. Differences in secondary structure in several regions were also observed, and 
are summarized in Supplementary Fig. 3. A cofactor-induced structural change in the active site has also been 
reported in a previous structural study of the ω -transaminase from Chromobacterium violaceum  (Cv-ωTA)
25. 
According to this study, the structure of apo Cv-ωTA and PLP-bound Cv-ωTA were different and PLP binding 
induced a structural change in Cv-ωTA, which is similar to our observations in this study.
Conformational diversity in the substrate pocket.  As mentioned above, the apo Vfat subunits are 
structurally different to the PLP/PMP-bound form of Vfat, especially in the catalytic region. Although the K285 is 
not bound to its cofactor, subunit A appeared to be stabilized in the catalytic region. In addition, the α6-α7 helix 
domain in subunit A of apo Vfat was also structurally stable, unlike subunit B, which led us to think that the two 
subunits were not in the same state. Thus, we further explored the possibility that a molecule may be occupying a 
space in the vicinity of the catalytic region in the two subunits of our apo Vfat. After careful analysis of the struc-
ture, and by lowering the contours of the Fo-Fc map, we discovered a small volume of electron density around 
the substrate pocket of subunit A. After several rounds of restrained refinement with Refmac5, we determined 
the electron density for the small molecule to be around the substrate pocket in subunit A (Fig.  4A). Four resi-
dues (Y165, A228, and R415 from subunit A, and H319 from subunit B) were found within 3.5 Å of this electron 
density and form a small inside cavity which is similar to the binding pocket for substrates in other transami-
nases (Fig. 4B). The size and shape of this unidentified density is similar with ethylene glycol. However, since no 
ethylene glycol was added in the crystallization buffer, it might be an impurity. To our knowledge, however, this 
pocket seems to be unnatural because the volume was significantly smaller than the general substrate pocket 
which has been observed in other transaminases
12,25,26. In addition, a small molecule in the apo state of Cv-ωTA

was not found in the substrate pocket 25. In contrast to subunit A, the electron density of this molecule and the 
related substrate pocket were not observed in the corresponding region of subunit B. Our observations suggest 
that the conformational diversities between subunit A and B in our apo Vfat structure are due to the presence of 
an unidentified small molecule in the substrate pocket.
Rearranged loops at the dimer interface.  The overall structure of the two subunits in apo Vfat were 
quite different, having a root mean square deviation (RMSD) of 2.04 Å. In particular, the active sites of the 
two subunits were different. Structural differences between the four types of Vfat (the PLP-bound form, the 
PMP-bound form, and the two subunits in the apo dimer) were also observed, especially around the α1-α2 and 
α6-α7 helix domains. To obtain further insight into this structural diversity, we further compared the structures 
of the four types of Vfat. Apart from the disordered regions in the apo Vfat dimer (1–29 in subunit A and 151–163 
in subunit B), another two regions showed distinctly different conformations. These two regions were the linker 
loops which link two helices and are located on the interaction interface between two subunits (the dimer inter-
face). One linker is at residues 78–91, which links α3 helix to α4 helix (α3/α4 linker). It contains a β strand (β4 
at residues 88–90) from subunit A (colored pink in Fig. 5A), while the secondary structure of a β strand was not 
observed in the corresponding region in subunit B (colored red). In subunit A, the β4 strand was connected lat-
erally by backbone hydrogen bonds with the β1 strand from subunit B, forming a four-stranded β-sheet (Fig. 5B). 
This connection was also observed in both PMP- and PMP bound Vfats
17. In contrast, the conformation of the 
α3/α4 linker in subunit B differed from subunit A, and the secondary structure of the three residues (88–90) was 
observed as a loop (Fig. 5C). In addition, a shortened β1 strand structure was observed in subunit A compared 
with subunit B or the cofactor bound Vfats. It is concluded that the change of local motion of the α3/α4 linker in 
subunit B, structurally affected by the absence of PLP in the catalytic region, sterically interferes with the proper 
localization of the β1 strand in subunit A resulting in a shortening of the β1 strand secondary structure in subunit 
A (Supplementary Fig. 4). The change of local motion of the loop and subsequent loss of the structure were also 
observed at the dimer interface. The linker loop at residues 312–327, which links α12 helix to α13 helix (α12/α13 
linker), had different conformations in subunit A and B (Fig. 5A). In subunit A, the α12/α13 linker loop (colored 
light blue) was shifted to the outside region, away from the center of monomer unit, and H319 interacted with 
N166 in subunit B through an aromatic n → π* interaction (Fig.  5D). In contrast, H319 in subunit B (colored 
blue) did not interact with N166 in subunit A but instead interacted with Y165 through a π-stacking interaction 
(Fig. 5E). In subunit A, Y165 and N166 were part of the α6/α7 helix, whereas the α6/α7 helix domain in subunit 
B was an unwound helix which affected crystal packing (Fig. 6A,B), differing from the symmetric tetramer unit 
of the PLP-and PMP-bound forms. Specifically, these interactions were not observed in either of the PLP- and 
PMP-bound forms of Vfat. Interestingly, Y165 in subunit A and H319 in subunit B in apo Vfat participated in the 
formation of the substrate pocket (Fig. 4A). Therefore, rearrangements in the dimer interface of apo Vfat might 
be affected by small molecules, because all subunits of PLP/PMP Vfats, which did not contain any molecule in the 
substrate pocket, had identical conformations in this region.
Discussion
Our structural study showed that subunit A had structurally stable helices (α6 to α7) in the large domain and a 
disordered structure for residues 1–29 (α1 to α2). In contrast, subunit B had structurally unstable helices in the 
α6 to α7 region, while the α1 helix (residues 7–14) had stable folding unlike subunit A. In addition, rearranged 
loops were observed at the dimer interface, and these regions were not symmetrical between subunit A and B. 
These findings were not observed in the PLP- or PMP bound forms of Vfat, indicating that the structural diversity 
in the active site and dimer interface is a unique feature of cofactor free Vfat. When our Vfat was initially purified, 
the protein contained PLP or PMP . However, the cofactor was absent from the final structure, indicating that the

cofactor was released from the protein during purification and crystallization steps by unknown reason. In this 
current dimeric apo Vfat structure that contains an unidentified small molecule in subunit A, we observed that 
the linker loops in the dimer interface and the catalytic region in subunit A was stabilized by small molecule bind-
ing. In addition, we also detected that the catalytic region in subunit B, which was affected by rearrangement of 
the adjacent region in subunit A, became extended and the conformational stability of several regions, including 
the α6-α7 helix domain in subunit B, decreased because of the loss of interaction.

The conformational stability and the flexibility of proteins is known to be altered upon ligand binding. The 
change in conformational stability or flexibility in functional regions of enzyme that occurs upon ligand binding 
depends on the protein type, and it could affect substrate specificity as well as enzyme activity. Interestingly, other 
apo states of transaminases also have rearranged (or disordered) domains around the catalytic region, similar to 
that found here for apo Vfat. After performing a structural homology search with the Dali sever
27, we found three 
class-III transaminases which also exhibit a loss of stability, or structural change upon loss of the PLP cofactor 
(Table 2). One of these is a class-III transaminase from Bacillus subtilis (Mtb DAPAS), whose structures were 
resolved in both the PLP bound form and the apo form
28. The overall structure of the PLP-bound Mtb DAPAS 
(PDB ID: 3DU4) showed a similar structure to PLP/PMP-bound Vfat. On the other hand, apo Mtb DAPAS (PDB 
ID: 3DRD) lost conformational stability in the α 6-α7 helix domain (residues at 144–172), indicating that the 
conformational stability of the catalytic region is reduced when the cofactor is absent (Fig. 7A). Another case was 
the catabolic N-succinylornithine transaminase (AstC) from Escherichia coli . Subunit B of apo AstC (PDB ID: 
4ADEb) lost conformational stability in the α1-α2, α6-α7 helix domain, and the linker loop at the dimer inter-
face, whereas subunit A (PDB ID: 4ADEa) had a similar overall structure to PLP-bound AstC (PDB ID: 4ADE), 
having a stable structure in all these regions (Fig. 7B)
29. The structural differences between the two subunits of apo 
AstC indicate that the stability of apo transaminase could be diverse in one asymmetric unit, which is the same as 
the case seen here for apo Vfat. The last example was a transaminase from Chromobacterium violaceum (Cv-ωTA) 
which showed ordered- or disordered structures in different regions of the two subunits from one asymmetric 
unit
25. In apo Cv-ωTA and PLP Cv-ωTA (PDB ID: 4A6U and 4A6T, respectively), ordered- or disordered regions 
were similar to Mtb DAPAS and AstC. However, two different forms of Cv-ωTA (PDB ID: 4A72), apo dimer and 
PLP-bound dimer, were found in one asymmetric unit
25. Interestingly, the apo Cv-ωTA dimer (subunit A and B) 
showed similar patterns in the disordered region to our apo Vfat. In particular, one subunit showed a disordered 
region in the α1-α2 helix domain, while other subunit had a structurally stable folding of the α 1 helix but lost 
its conformation in the α6-α7 helix domain. Because two more structures of apo form of class III transaminases 
(PDB ID: 3HMU and 3N5M) are available
30,31, we compared our structure to them. Although these structures 
are apo-form, they contain sulfate ion at the PLP binding site. Interestingly, sulfate ion binds to active site K285 
reside, which is important for the stability of active site, and contributes to the stability of α 1- α2 helixes and 
α6-α7 (Supplemtary Fig. S5). Based on the crystal structure of the apo state of Vfat, and comparison with other 
apo proteins, we conclude that the absence of a cofactor can affect the conformational stability and flexibility of 
the dimer interface, including the catalytic region. Dissociation of cofactor followed by monomerization and 
structural instability has been also suggested by studying of amine transaminase
21–23. Our apo Vfat structure is 
the first in which the linker loops at dimer interface lose their balance. With the recently suggested activation

mechanism of transaminase by PLP-substrate dissociation, enzyme stability alternation, and stoichiometric 
changes21–23, our findings with structure of dimeric, PLP-free form of apo Vfat provides a better understanding of 
structural alteration and instability of transaminase without cofactor.
Methods
Protein expression and purification. The expression and purification methods used in this study have been 
described elsewhere in detail32. In summary, the coding region of Vfat was amplified by PCR and inserted into the 
vector pET24ma. The pET24ma vector (constructed by Dr. David Sourdive, Pasteur Institute, France) contains a 
p15A replication origin. The plasmid was transformed into BL21 (DE3) E. coli competent cells, and protein expres-
sion was induced by treating bacterial cultures with 0.5 mM isopropyl β-D-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) overnight 
at 20 °C. The bacterial cells expressing Vfat were pelleted by centrifugation, resuspended, and lysed by sonication. 
The lysate was then centrifuged, after which the supernatant fractions were applied to a gravity-flow column (Bio-
Rad) packed with Ni-NTA affinity resin (Qiagen). The C-terminal His-tagged Vfat was eluted from the column 
using elution buffer (20 mM Tris buffer pH 7.9, 500 mM NaCl and 250 mM imidazole). The elution fractions were 
collected, combined and concentrated to 20–25 mg mL
−1 using a concentration kit (Millipore). The concentrated 
protein was then applied to a Superdex 200 gel filtration column 10/30 (GE healthcare) that had been pre-equili-
brated with a solution of 20 mM Tris at pH 8.0 and 150 mM NaCl. The protein that eluted at around 14.5 mL upon 
gel-filtration chromatography was collected and concentrated to 10~12 mg/mL for crystallization.
MALS. The absolute molar mass of Vfat was determined by multi angle light scattering (MALS). The tar -
get protein was loaded onto a Superdex 200 HR 10/30 gel-filtration column (GE Healthcare) that had been 
pre-equilibrated in a buffer containing 20 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0 and 150 mM NaCl. The AKTA chromatography 
system (GE Healthcare) was coupled to a MALS detector (miniDAWM TREOS) and a refractive index detector 
(Optilab DSP) (Wyatt Technology).
Crystallization and data collection. Crystallization was conducted at 20 °C by the hanging drop 
vapor-diffusion method using various screening kits. Initial crystals were grown on the plates by equilibrating a 
mixture containing 1 μl of protein solution (10–12 mg/ml protein in 20 mM Tris at pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl) and 
1 μl of a reservoir solution from number 3 of Wizard III (20% PEG 3350 and 0.2 M Magnesium formate) against 
0.4 ml of reservoir solution. Crystallization was further optimized by searching over a range of concentrations of 
protein, PEG 3350, magnesium formate. Crystals appeared within two days and grew to a maximum dimension 
of 0.2 × 0.2 × 0.1 mm in the presence of 22% PEG 3350, 0.4 M magnesium formate and 0.1 M sodium citrate pH 
6.2. A 2.0 Å native dataset was collected at the BL-4A beamline at Pohang Accelerator Laboratory (PAL), Republic 
of Korea. Data processing and scaling was carried out using HKL2000.
Structure determination and analysis. The structure was determined by the molecular replacement 
phasing method using Phaser 33. The previously solved putative aminotransferase structure (PDB code: 3GJU), 
which shares 33% sequence identity with that of the Vfat, was used as a search model. Model building and refine-
ment were performed in COOT
34 and Refmac535, respectively. Water molecules were added automatically with 
the ARP/wARP function in Refmac5 and then examined manually for reasonable hydrogen bonding possibilities. 
The quality of the model was checked using PROCHECK
36 and was found to be reasonable. A total of 95.47% of 
the residues were shown to be located in the most favorable region, while the additional 4.53% were in allowed 
regions of the Ramachandran plot. The data collection and refinement statistics are summarized in Table  1. 
Ribbon diagrams and molecular surface representations were generated using Pymol
37.
Protein Data Bank accession codes. Coordinates and structural factors were deposited in the Protein 
Data Bank under PDB ID code 5ZTX.
