Abstract: Candida sp. infections are a threat to global health, with high morbidity and mortality rates
due to drug resistance, especially in immunocompromised people. For this reason, the search for new
alternatives is urgent, and in recent years, a combined therapy with natural compounds has been
proposed. Considering the biological potential of isoespintanol (ISO) and continuing its study, the
objective of this research was to assess the effect of ISO in combination with the antifungals fluconazole
(FLZ), amphotericin B (AFB) and caspofungin (CASP) against clinical isolates of C. tropicalis and
to evaluate the cytotoxic effect of this compound in the acute phase (days 0 and 14) and chronic
phase (days 0, 14, 28, 42, 56, 70 and 84) in female mice ( Mus musculus) of the Balb/c lineage. The
results show that ISO can potentiate the effect of FLZ, AFB and CASP , showing synergism with
these antifungals. An evaluation of the mice via direct observation showed no behavioral changes or
variations in weight during treatment; furthermore, an analysis of the cytokines IFN-γ and TNF in
plasma, peritoneal cavity lavage (PCL) and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) indicated that there was no
inflammation process. In addition, histopathological studies of the lungs, liver and kidneys showed
no signs of toxicity caused by ISO. This was consistent with an analysis of oxaloacetic transaminases
(GOT) and pyruvic transaminases (GPT), which remained in the standard range. These findings
indicate that ISO does not have a cytotoxic effect at the doses evaluated, placing it as a monoterpene
of interest in the search for compounds with pharmacological potential.

1. Introduction
The adaptive capacity of Candida spp. in hospital environments—together with the
expression of various virulence factors, the poor availability of antifungal drugs and ex-
pressed drug resistance—represents a significant challenge in medical practice. Natural
compounds, especially those from plants, play a primary role as a source of specialized
metabolites with recognized medicinal properties. Owing to their wide chemical diversity,

these metabolites can be directly used as bioactive compounds, drug prototypes or phar-
macological tools for different targets [1–3]. Furthermore, potential efficacy and minimal
side effects are the key advantages of plant-based products, making them appropriate tools
in therapeutic treatments [4]. They are also an inspiration for synthesizing non-natural
molecules and provide important clues for identifying and developing synergistic drugs [5].
Combination therapy is an interesting area in the development of new therapeutic
strategies against fungal infections, and its advantages include the following: (i) a po-
tential increase in effectiveness and the degree of elimination for these pathogens; (ii) a
broader spectrum of activity directed at potentially resistant pathogens; (iii) preventing
the emergence of resistance; and (iv) potentially reduced doses of individual antifungal
drugs that may minimize toxicity [ 6,7]. The great efficacy of antifungal drugs such as
fluconazole (FLZ), amphotericin B (AFB), nystatin and caspofungin (CASP) in combination
with monoterpene phenols against Candida auris has been demonstrated [8]. Furthermore,
the synergism of Ocimum sanctum essential oils with FLZ and ketoconazole (KZL) against
different candida isolates, including both susceptible and resistant strains [9], has also been
reported; likewise, the potentiation of AFB’s antifungal action through the essential oil of
Thymus vulgaris has been indicated [10]. In monoterpenes such as thymol, a synergistic
effect has been demonstrated in combination with antifungals such as nystatin against
Candida spp. in oral cavity infection [ 11]; likewise, thymol and carvacrol have been doc-
umented with synergistic action with FLZ [12,13]. The combined therapy of thymol and
carvacrol with caprylic acid (CA) and its mechanism of action against Candida spp. has also
been documented [13]. Thymol has also shown synergy with FLZ against the planktonic
growth mode and biofilms of resistant C. albicans and C. tropicalis strains; however, its
synergy with AFB has only been evidenced in the planktonic cells of Candida [14]. Other
interaction studies on azoles with Mentha piperita essential oils have shown synergistic
profiles against Candida spp., Cryptococcus neoformans and Trichophyton mentagrophytes[15].
Isoespintanol (ISO) (2-isopropyl-3,6-dimethoxy-5-methylphenol) is a monoterpene
isolated from Oxandra xylopioides (Annonaceae) that is recognized as a natural bioac-
tive compound. Its biological potential has been reported as an antioxidant [ 16], anti-
inflammatory [17], antispasmodic [18], vasodilator [19], cardioprotective [20] and cryopro-
tectant in canine semen [ 21]. Using this monoterpene as a therapeutic tool to prevent
diabetes in the early stages of its development has also been suggested [22]. In previous
works, we reported the potential of this monoterpene against human pathogens, specifi-
cally, hospital-acquired bacteria [23] and the yeasts of the Candida genus, demonstrating
its action against different cellular targets and its ability to reprogram the transcriptome of
these yeasts [24–27], as well as its cytotoxic potential against human tumor cell lines [28].
Considering the important biological potential of ISO, including its antifungal effect
against FLZ-resistant yeasts and important differences between in vitro and in vivo experi-
mental environments [28], we hypothesize that it can potentiate the effect of commercial
antifungals; furthermore, it has no significant cytotoxic effect in vivo at low concentrations.
This research evaluates the effect of ISO in combination with the antifungals FLZ, AFB and
CASP against clinical isolates of C. tropicalis and the cytotoxic effect of this compound in
female mice (Mus musculus). This will contribute to the study of this monoterpene, which
could serve as an important tool in treating and controlling infectious diseases.
2. Results
2.1. Obtaining and Identification of Isoespintanol
ISO was obtained as a crystalline amorphous solid from a petroleum benzine extract of
O. xylopioides leaves, and its structural identification was performed via GC-MS, 1H-NMR,
13C-NMR, DEPT, COSY 1H-1H, HMQC and HMBC. Information related to obtaining and
identifying this ISO was reported in our previous study [25].

2.2. Isoespintanol Action in Combination with Commercial Antifungals
Figure 1 shows that the ISO-FLZ combination had a synergistic effect against six of
the seven (107, 98, 92, 81, 74 and 03) C. tropicalis isolates evaluated; conversely, the ISO-AFB
treatment showed synergistic action against two isolates (107 and 74), and the ISO-CASP
treatment only showed a synergistic effect against one of the isolates (74). The antagonistic
activity of ISO-AFB (isolate 98) and ISO-CASP (isolates 92 and 84) was also evidenced.
Table 1 shows that the minimum inhibitory concentrations at which 90% of the yeasts were
inhibited (MIC90) in synergistic activity were substantially lower than the individual MIC90
value of the ISO and antifungals used. The MIC 90 values decreased by up to 138.5 and
2 times in FLZ, AFB and CASP .

2.3.2. Global Cell Count
Figure 2 shows the global profile of leukocytes in the blood, peritoneal cavity lavage
(PCL) and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) during the acute phase (Figure 2A–C) and chronic
phase (Figure 2D–F), referring to both the control group and the groups inoculated with
ISO. A significant reduction was observed in inoculated groups G3, G4 and G6 compared
with G1 (CTRL + water) and in G4 and G6 compared with G2 (Figure 2A). When counting
leukocytes in the PCL and BAL, the values of G3, G4, G5 and G6 compared with groups
G1 and G2 did not show significant differences in cell reduction (Figure 2B,C); however,
there was a significant increase in G5 compared with G2 in the BAL (Figure 2C). In the
chronic phase, global blood counts, PCL and BAL did not significantly differ in any group
compared with groups G1 and G2 (Figure 2D–F). Finally, the overall cell count was not
significantly affected by the ISO treatment.

3. Discussion
The increasing incidence of fungal infections, particularly in immunocompromised
people, continues to be a serious public health problem globally. Candida spp. are the
pathogens mainly involved; the wide range of pathogenicity factors expressed, the ability
to respond efficiently to environmental stress, resistance to antifungal agents and the high
mortality reported make medical practice a great challenge [29–31]. Thus, searching for
alternatives to control and treat these pathogens is urgent. In this context, the advantages
of combined therapy are an interesting alternative [6,7,15,32].
Here, we report the synergistic effect of ISO in combination with the antifungals
FLZ, AFB and CASP , highlighting the effect achieved with ISO-FLZ against clinical iso-
lates of C. tropicalis resistant to FLZ. We also report the synergistic effect of ISO-AFB and
ISO-CASP , although not in all cases. These results are consistent with the studies that
show the synergistic effect of the monoterpene thymol in combination with FLZ against
azole-resistant C. tropicalis. As a consequence of these synergistic interactions, the mito-
chondrial membrane potential was reduced, the production of mitochondrial superoxide
increased and alterations were observed in the nuclear morphology, surface and cell ultra-
structure [33]. Other studies have shown the excellent synergistic activity of monoterpenes
such as linalool, citral and citronellal combined with FLZ against strains of C. albicans
resistant to FLZ [34]. Likewise, the greater efficacy of antifungal drugs in combination with
monoterpene phenols has been reported against C. auris [8].
Molecules 2024, 29, 4417 9 of 16
Combined monoterpene and antifungal therapy has been widely documented, includ-
ing its important synergistic effect against Candida spp. The mechanisms involved in this
synergistic activity include inhibiting different stages in the fungal intracellular pathways
essential for survival, increasing the penetration of one antifungal agent due to the action
of another on the fungal cell membrane, inhibiting transporter proteins and simultaneously
inhibiting different cellular targets [11,35]. Monoterpenes such as thymol and carvacrol in
combination with FLZ have shown a synergistic effect against Candida spp. [12]; combined
thymol and nystatin therapy against Candida spp. has also been documented [11]. Using
combined thymol–FLZ treatments against biofilms and the planktonic growth of resistant
C. albicans and C. tropicalis strains has also been reported, indicating synergistic action;
likewise, thymol–AFB has demonstrated synergistic action in the planktonic growth phase
of Candida spp. [14]. Studies have reported mixed thymol–carvacrol and caprylic acid (CA)
treatments against Candida spp., revealing synergism and indicating that their mechanism
may involve membrane damage caused by CA, facilitating the entry of antifungal agents
into the cytoplasm and the inhibition of efflux pumps by CA, carvacrol or thymol. This
causes them to accumulate inside cells, causing cell death [13]. Combined essential oils and
antifungal therapies such as FLZ, KZL [9] and AFB against C. albicans [10] have also been
documented, as well as combining azoles with Mentha piperita essential oils against Candida
spp., Cryptococcus neoformans and Trichophyton mentagrophytes[15].
Azoles act against C14α-demethylase in biosynthesizing ergosterol, blocking its syn-
thesis and causing toxic sterols to accumulate, interrupting the function of ergosterol in the
cell membrane [36]. However, one of the mechanisms of resistance to azoles expressed by
these pathogens is a reduction in intracellular azole accumulation; this may occur owing
to a lack of drug penetration due to low levels of ergosterol or a possible decrease in the
ratio between phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylethanolamine in the plasma mem-
brane, which can change the barrier function of the membrane [ 37]. In previous works,
we demonstrated the damage to the membrane permeability of these yeasts as one of the
mechanisms of ISO’s antifungal action against C. tropicalis. This damage was attributed to
the inhibition of ergosterol synthesis [25,27], so we suggest that the synergistic effect of ISO
with FLZ involves substantially permeabilizing the cell membrane, enabling the greater
intracellular accumulation of ergosterol pathway intermediate sterols in addition to more
ISO and FLZ entry, creating the potential for substantial toxic effects using low doses of
ISO and FLZ. However, further studies are required to elucidate the synergy mechanism of
ISO in combination with FLZ, AFB and CASP .
On the other hand, in this study, we found that orally administering different doses
of the monoterpene ISO to female mice (Mus musculus) of the Balb/c lineage did not have
any significant toxic effects that can be attributed to ISO treatment. It does not alter the
weight of the animals in the acute phase or the chronic phase. According to the analyses
performed on the blood, BAL and PCL, only the number of eosinophils increased, mainly
in the chronic phase, which must be related to time and constant exposure to the compound
over 98 days.
Malignant or premalignant lesions at the tissue level can cause immune system cells to
infiltrate and, together with the tissue’s own cells, initiate an immune response at the local
level that can be the Th1 type (interleukin-2 (IL-2), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF- α)
and interferon-gamma (IFN-γ)) of the Th2 type (IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-9, IL-10 and IL-13) or
both [38]. We determined the patterns of IFN- γ and TNF cytokines in the plasma, BAL
and PCL of each animal treated with ISO. The results did not show statistically significant
values when G3, G4, G5 and G6 (treated with ISO) were compared with the controls G1 and
G2 (treated with water and oil, respectively). Likewise, in the chronic phase, no positive
levels of any cytokine (in pg/mL) were detected. There was no increase in the cytokines,
suggesting no inflammation process in the blood of the animals analyzed.
Generally, the histopathological studies showed non-significant changes in the samples
analyzed from the experimental groups: the kidney fragments showed few microscopic
alterations; the lung fragments showed changes such as insignificant hemorrhage, inflam-
Molecules 2024, 29, 4417 10 of 16
matory infiltrate and thickening of the alveolar septa. Most of the liver fragments presented
few perivascular infiltrates, and pyogranulomatous granulomas were identified only in
the oil control and chronic study at 200 mg. Generally, no significant signs of toxicity
were observed. This was corroborated by the biochemical findings, revealing no increase
or significant difference in the amounts of GOT or GPT in the mice to which ISO was
administered compared with the control groups in the acute phase; liver enzymes were
within the standard. In the chronic phase, there was a significant decrease in GPT levels
in G4 and G5 compared with group G2; GOT levels were not detected since they were
expressed when they were above the control group values. These findings demonstrate that
no toxicity can be attributed to ISO in the doses administered. These results are consistent
with reports [39] of in vivo experiments using two groups of hamsters (Mesocricetus auratus),
where the toxicity of the monoterpenes carvacrol and thymol (100 mg/kg) was evaluated,
indicating that they were safe and effective treatments with few side effects on the liver and
that they were very promising candidates for developing effective drugs. However, despite
the valuable biological activities of monoterpenes, some of them (α-terpinene, camphor,
citral, limonene, pulegone and thujone) have also shown a toxic character in in vitro and
in vivo studies, so their use must be closely controlled [40].
Our results position ISO as an interesting compound to continue studying. In the
future, it could be used as a therapeutic tool to control pathogenic microorganisms. It is
important to conduct further research to validate these findings in humans.

4.3. Strains
Seven clinical isolates of C. tropicalis (107, 98, 92, 84, 81, 74 and 03) were used in
this study. The isolates were cultured from blood culture and tracheal aspirate samples
Molecules 2024, 29, 4417 11 of 16
from hospitalized patients at the Salud Social S.A.S. in the city of Sincelejo, Colombia.

CHROMagar Candida medium were used to maintain the cultures until the tests were
carried out.
4.4. Isoespintanol Action in Combination with Commercial Antifungals
To obtain the fractional inhibitory concentration indices (FICIs) of the ISO in com-
bination with AFB, FLZ and CASP against C. tropicalis, we followed the methodologies
proposed by Donadu [ 41]. Serial dilutions were made in RPMI 1640 broth with 0.1%
2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride (CTT), reaching final concentrations in a range of
1000—31.25 µg/mL, 4—0.125 µg/mL, 128—4 µg/mL and 1—0.031 µg/mL for ISO, AFB,
FLZ and CASP , respectively. The assay was carried out in a total volume of 200 µL per
well distributed as follows: 50 µL ISO + 50 µL of CASP , AFB and FLZ were added until
the previously described concentrations were reached, as was 100 µL of fungal inoculum
at a concentration of 10 6 CFU/mL. Absorbance readings were measured immediately
using a Chromate 4300 ELISA reader at a wavelength of 630 nm, and measurements were
subsequently made after 24 h of incubation at 37 ◦C. The FICIs were calculated using the
following equation [42]:
FICIs = MIC90 ISO in combination
MIC90 ISO single + MIC90 antifungal in combination
MIC90 antifungal single
The results were interpreted following the approach used in [43]. The FICIs are con-
sidered to have a synergistic effect (FIC index ≤ 1.0), a commutative effect (FIC index = 1),
no interaction (1.0 < FIC index ≤ 2.0) or an antagonistic effect (FIC index > 2.0).
4.5. Preparation of Isoespintanol for Toxicity Experiments
The ISO crystals were dissolved in edible vegetable oil (used as a vehicle) at 45 ◦C
to facilitate dilution. Subsequently, a stock solution was prepared at a concentration of
40 mg/mL with the help of a vortex mixer, and from this, the ISO dilutions were prepared
at 25, 50, 100 and 200 µg/mL using the same vehicle.
4.6. Animals
The experimental design of this project was based on the recommendations of the Eth-
ical Principles of Animal Experimentation adopted by the Brazilian Society of Laboratory
Animal Science (SBCAL) and approved by the Committee on Ethics in the Use of Animals
(CEUA) of the Federal University of São Carlos (UFSCar), under opinion n◦. 4783100223.
Female mice (Mus musculus) of the Balb/c lineage weighing between 15 and 18 g were used,
supplied by ANILAB Animals De Laboratório Criação E Comercio Ltd. a. These animals
had a specific pathogen free (SPF) certificate, guaranteeing that they were free of pathogens.
All animals were kept in the vivarium of the Department of Morphology and Pathology of
the Federal University of São Carlos (DMP—UFSCar), with free access to water and food
for rodents in individual cages with air control (ALESCO).
4.7. Exposure to Isoespintanol and Experimental Groups
As shown in the experiment design (Figure 10), six experimental groups were estab-
lished; all animals were weighed (between 15 and 18 g) and randomly distributed. Each
group received oral treatment with a final volume of 100 µL. In the acute phase experi-
ments, 55 animals were used (10 for each ISO group, 7 for the water control and 8 for the
oil control); the treatment was carried out every 14 days, occurring on days 0 and 14. In the
chronic phase, 55 animals were used (10 for each ISO group, 7 for the water control and 8
for the oil control); the treatment was carried out on days 0, 14, 28, 42, 56, 70 and 84.

Animals were weighed to check for changes in body mass and behavior after expo-
sure to the compound. Weighing was always carried out in the morning and on days 0 
and 14 to study the acute phase. To study the chronic phase, they were weighed on days 
0, 14, 28, 42, 56, 70 and 84.

to the compound. Weighing was always carried out in the morning and on days 0 and 14
to study the acute phase. To study the chronic phase, they were weighed on days 0, 14, 28,

4.9. Euthanasia, Blood Cell Collection and Counting, PCL and BAL
Mice were sacrificed with xylazine and ketamine at 20 mg/kg intra-peritoneally (ip)
on day 15 (acute phase) and day 90 (chronic phase). The blood was obtained by puncturing
the left brachial vein, using EDTA as an anticoagulant at a final concentration of 0.3 M.
To obtain the BAL, 2 mL of citrated PBS (1X [phosphate-buffered saline solution: 8 g of
NaCl, 0.2 g of KCl, 1.15 g of Na 2HPO4, 0.2 g of KH 2PO4 and 1 L of distilled water] +
0.5% sodium citrate) was injected through a catheter into the tracheas of the animals. To
obtain the PCL, 3 mL of citrated PBS was used, introducing a needle into the peritoneal
cavity, from which PCL was then extracted. Global blood cell counting, BAL and PCL
were performed individually in a Neubauer chamber, and samples were added to Turk’s
solution (3% acetic acid and 1% methylene blue) at a dilution of 1:20. For differential count
and percentages of cells (eosinophils, neutrophils and mononucleated leukocytes), blood
smears and PCL slides were prepared in a Citospin centrifuge (Serocyte ® model 2400,
Molecules 2024, 29, 4417 13 of 16
Thermo Scientific™, Hampton, NH, USA), stained with rapid panoptic dye. On each slide,
100 cells were counted via optical microscopy with a final magnitude of 1000. The plasma
was subsequently stored at −20 ◦C to measure cytokines and transaminases GOT and GPT.
4.10. Histological Evaluation of Lungs, Livers and Kidneys
To analyze the possible involvement of tissues and organs due to indirect toxicity,
lungs, livers and left kidneys from animals in both the acute and chronic phases were
extracted and stored, standardizing animals 1 and 2 of each group. First, an approximately
4 cm surgical incision was made longitudinally just below the rib cage of each mouse. A
small incision was then made in the diaphragm to expose the sternum bone. Through this
incision, the thoracic bone cavity was removed for direct access and lung collection. When
removing the organs from the abdominal cavity, the same incision was used. Therefore, the
liver and kidneys were removed sequentially. After removal, the organs were washed with
1X PBS solution and dried on paper. Subsequently, fixation was carried out in buffered
formalin (4 g of NaH 2PO4, 6.5 g of Na 2HPO4, 100 mL of formaldehyde and 900 mL of
distilled water). Subsequently, they were sent to undergo the previously established specific
processes to prepare the histological slides, which were stained with hematoxylin–eosin. All
analysis of the fragments was performed using an Opticam Binocular Optical Microscope
(model O400S, São Paulo, Brazil), using a 40× objective.
4.11. GOT and GPT Dosage
The test was performed according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Labtest). Initially,
the test tubes were identified, and 100 µL of GOT substrate or GPT substrate solution was
added, which was then incubated in a water bath at 37 ◦C for 2 min. Then, 20 µL of blood
plasma from animals exposed or not exposed to the compound was added, and another
incubation was carried out in a water bath (37 ◦C) for 60 min for the GOT test and 30 min
for the GPT test. After incubation, 100 µL of color reagent (AST/GOT and ALT/GPT
Liquiform, Labtest, Lagoa Santa, MG, Brazil) was added. After 20 min at room temperature,
1 mL of NaOH solution (1.25 mol/L) was added, and we waited 5 min. Finally, 300 µL of
the samples (in triplicate) was transferred to 96-well microtiter plates, and the absorbance
reading was performed at a wavelength of 505 nm using a plate spectrophotometer (Thermo
Scientific™ Multiskan™ GO Microplate Spectrophotometer, Waltham, MA USA). In parallel
with the sample preparation, the calibration curve was prepared (according to the kit) for
subsequent calculations of the GOT and GPT levels in the analyzed samples.
4.12. Measurement of IFN-γ and TNF Cytokines in Plasma, BAL and PCL
To measure IFN-γ and TN, with a direct ELISA (OptEIATM Kit, BD Biosciences, San
Jose, CA, USA), 96-well high-affinity microtiter plates were used according to the protocol
described below. Between each step, the wells were washed with 300 µL of washing
solution (1X PBS [phosphate buffer saline: 8 g NaCl, 0.2 g KCl, 1.15 g Na 2HPO4, 0.2 g
KH2PO4 and 1 L distilled water] + 0.05% Tween 20, pH 7.4).
Initially, the plate was sensitized with 100µL/well of a solution containing the capture
antibody (1:250) diluted in 0.1 M of carbonate buffer—pH 9.5 (7.13 g of NaHCO3 and 1.59 g
of Na2CO3 in 1 L of milliwater). Plates were incubated for up to 18 h at 4 ◦C. After this
period, the supernatant was discarded, the plate was washed and non-specific binding
sites were blocked by adding 200 µL of blocking solution (1X PBS + 1% bovine serum
albumin [BSA]—Sigma). Again, the plates were incubated for 1 h at room temperature and
washed. Subsequently, different dilutions of the standard recombinant cytokine (curve)
and the samples under study (50 µL/well) were added in triplicate. After a 2 h incubation,
a new washing cycle was performed; 100 µL/well of detection antibody (biotinylated
secondary antibody, 1:250) was added to the TNF, and 100µL/well of detection antibody
(biotinyl-sided secondary antibody 1:250) was added with enzyme (1:250) to the IFN- γ.
After a new incubation of 1 h and 30 min at room temperature and a new washing cycle,
100 µL/well of the enzyme streptavidin (1:250) was added to the TNF, and after 30 min,
Molecules 2024, 29, 4417 14 of 16
the mixture was washed again, and 100 µL/well of substrate was added. For IFN-γ, after
1 h and 30 min of secondary antibody + enzyme incubation, the plate was washed again,
and 100 µL/well of substrate was added. The substrate was a 1:1 mixture of TMB Solution
A and Solution B (3,3 ′,5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine). Finally, the reaction was blocked by
adding 50 µL/well of 2 M sulfuric acid (H2SO4). Absorbance was read at a wavelength of
450 nm using a plate spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific™ Multiskan™ GO Microplate
Spectrophotometer, Waltham, MA USA), with concentrations calculated from the titration
curve of the cytokine standards. The final concentrations were expressed in pg/mL.
4.13. Statistical Analysis
The data obtained in this study were analyzed using GraphPad Prism 7.0 (San Diego,
CA, USA). The entire study was carried out at least sixfold, with the n value of the sample
varying from 6 to 10 (N = 6–10) in independent experiments. Discrepant data were identified
using Grubbs analysis, followed by the Shapiro–Wilk test to verify the parametric or non-
parametric nature of the data. To achieve this, the ANOVA test (analysis of variance) and
Tukey’s multiple comparisons post-test were applied to the parametric data (the results
are presented as the mean and standard deviation). For non-parametric data, the Kruskal–
Wallis test and Dunn’s multiple comparison post-test were used (the results are presented
as the median with the upper and lower quartiles: Me [Q1; Q3]). Statistical significance was
established at p < 0.05; the results are expressed as mean ± SEM, except for the cytokine
doses (TNF and IFN-γ)—which are expressed as mean ± SD owing to the analysis carried
out with the plasma set of animals in each group—and analyzed using GraphPad Prism,
version 9 (San Diego, CA, USA). For the analysis, the one-way ANOVA test (one-way
analysis of variance) was used, and the post-test was performed using Tukey’s method
(Tukey’s multiple comparisons test). The significance level adopted was 5%, wherep ≤ 0.05.
5. Conclusions
Herein, we report a synergistic effect of ISO in combination with the antifungals FLZ,
CASP and AFB, showing a greater effect in the combined ISO-FLZ treatment compared
with the ISO-CASP and ISO-AFB treatments in this study. Furthermore, the side effects of
ISO in female mice (Mus musculus) of the Balb/c lineage were not significant, indicating
that ISO does not exert toxic effects at the concentrations tested on these mice. These
results can serve as references for the continued study of this monoterpene, given the
important antimicrobial potential previously reported, as an interesting tool for treating
and controlling drug-resistant in-hospital pathogens.
