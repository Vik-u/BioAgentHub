Abstract
Introduction: Novel biomarkers re ﬂecting liver ﬁbrosis
and the immune microenvironment may correlate with
the risk of hepatocellular c arcinoma (HCC) recurrence.
This study aimed to evaluate the prognostic value of
serum biomarkers in predicting HCC recurrence.
Methods: Serum biomarkers, including M2BPGi, IL-6, IL-
10, CCL5, VEGF-A, soluble PD-1, PD-L1, TIM-3, and LAG-3,
were measured in 247 patie nts with HCC undergoing
surgical resection. Factors associated with recurrence-
free survival (RFS) and overall survival (OS) were eval-
uated. The ERASL-post model and IMbrave050 criteria
were used to deﬁne HCC recurrence risk groups.Results:
Serum M2BPGi levels signi ﬁcantly correlated with FIB-4
score, aspartate transaminas e-to-platelet ratio index,
ALBI score, alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), alanine transami-
n a s e ,a s p a r t a t et r a n s a m i n a s e ,I L - 1 0 ,C C L 5 ,V E G F - A ,s o l -
uble PD-1, PD-L1, TIM-3, and LAG-3 levels. M2BPGi, VEGF-
A, soluble PD-1, and TIM-3 levels signiﬁcantly correlated
with RFS. In multivariate analysis, M2BPGi >1.5 COI
(hazard ratio [HR] = 2.100, p < 0.001), tumor size >5c m
(HR = 1.859, p = 0.002), multiple tumors (HR = 2.562,p <
0.001), AFP >20 ng/mL (HR = 2.141, p < 0.001), and
microvascular invasion (HR = 1.954, p = 0.004) were
independent predictors of RFS. M2BPGi levels signi ﬁ-
cantly strati ﬁed the recurrence risk in ERASL-post and
IMbrave050 risk groups. An M2BPGi-based model could
signi ﬁcantly discriminate RFS in the overall cohort as
well as in the IMbrave050 low- and high-risk groups.
M2BPGi >1.5 COI was also an independent predictor of
OS after resection (HR = 2.707, p < 0.001). Conclusion:
Serum M2BPGi levels signi ﬁcantly correlated with sur-
rogate markers of liver ﬁbrosis, liver function, and im-
munology. M2BPGi is a signi ﬁcant predictor of HCC re-
currence and survival after resection and could be in-
corporated into recurrence-prediction models.

Introduction
Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) stands as the sixth
most frequently diagnosed cancer and the third leading
cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide [1]. As global
population ﬁgures continue to rise, a concurrent increase
in the incidence of HCC cases and related deaths is
anticipated over the next 2 decades [2]. Surgical resection
is the curative treatment of choice and leads to a higher
chance of long-term cure in well-selected candidates [3].
However, the recurrence rates, particularly within theﬁrst
2 years post-resection, remain alarmingly high, ranging
from 50% to 70% at the 5-year mark [4– 6]. Ongoing
clinical trials exploring adjuvant immunotherapy for
patients at high risk of recurrence after resection are
providing promising insights. The phase III IMbrave050
trial comparing atezolizumab plus bevacizumab versus
active surveillance in the adjuvant setting for HCC pa-
tients has demonstrated positive results, indicating re-
duced HCC recurrence at 1 year after curative treatment
[7]. In the IMbrave050 trial, high-risk features for re-
section patients include tumor size exceeding 5 cm, the
presence of more than three tumors, microvascular or
macrovascular invasion, and poor tumor differentiation.
However, these criteria solely focus on tumor-related
factors, neglecting the potential impact of tumor
markers, host factors including liver ﬁbrosis, and im-
munological factors that may also contribute to HCC
recurrence.
The tumor immune microenvironment of HCC plays a
pivotal role in both carcinogenesis and recurrence [8].
Unraveling the mechanisms and identifying predictive
biomarkers for HCC recurrence are critical imperatives.
Serum cytokines, chemokines, soluble proteins, and the
expressions of intrahepatic immune checkpoint proteins
could serve as indicators of host antitumor immunity and
may offer valuable insights into predicting the risk of
HCC recurrence. Previous studies underscore the sig-
niﬁcant impact of host immune regulators on disease
severity and treatment outcomes in chronic viral hepatitis
and HCC [9 – 12]. Serum levels of soluble immune
checkpoint targets, including PD-1, PD-L1, CTLA-4,
LAG-3, and TIM-3, have demonstrated prognostic value
and implications for immunotherapy in HCC patients
[13, 14].
Mac 2-Binding protein Gylcan Isomer (M2BPGi) is a
recently identiﬁed biomarker, which plays an important
role in the progression of liverﬁbrosis, and could be used
for assessing liver ﬁbrosis [15]. It has proven useful in
assessing liver ﬁbrosis and predicting HCC occurrence
during or after antiviral therapy in patients with chronic
hepatitis B or C [16]. Although there is suggestive evi-
dence of M2BPGi as a potential biomarker in HCC
patients, its prognostic value and correlation with other
immunological markers in this context remain unex-
plored. This study aimed to investigate the prognostic
value of M2BPGi and its correlation with various im-
munological markers in HCC patients receiving curative
resection.
Materials and Methods
Patients
Human samples from 247 patients undergoing surgical
resection for HCC, including both serum and tissue
slides, were obtained from the Biobank, Taipei Veterans
General Hospital. Patients with non-curative resection,
presence of other malignancy were excluded. The diag-
nosis of HCC was subsequently con ﬁrmed through
pathological examination post-surgical resection.
Following conﬁrmation of curative resection through
contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CECT) or
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) post-surgery, pa-
tients underwent regular follow-ups every 3 months.
These follow-ups included alpha-fetoprotein (AFP)
measurements, ultrasound examinations, and additional
CECT or MRI scans. HCC recurrence was suspected in
cases of elevated AFP levels or the detection of new
hepatic lesions through ultrasound, with conﬁrmation
through CECT or MRI.
This study adhered to the prevailing ethical guidelines
and principles outlined in the Declaration of Helsinki.
Approval for the study protocol was obtained from the
Institutional Review Board at Taipei Veterans General
Hospital (IRB number: 2023-07-011BC).
Laboratory Tests and Pathology
Clinical data were comprehensively collected from a
cohort of patients, encompassing key parameters such as
age, sex, Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) stage,
body mass index, Child-Pugh score and class, serum
albumin, total bilirubin, alanine transaminase (ALT),
aspartate transaminase (AST), creatinine, AFP levels,
complete blood counts, HBsAg, and anti-HCV. Addi-
tional calculated indices included the albumin-bilirubin
(ALBI) score, ALBI grade,ﬁbrosis-4 index (FIB-4) score,
and aspartate transaminase-to-platelet ratio index (APRI)
utilizing established methodologies [17, 18]. Histological
features, such as tumor size and number, Edmonson
histological grade, microvascular invasion, hepatic stea-
tosis, and Ishak hepatic inﬂammation andﬁbrosis scores

[19, 20] were recorded. To further categorize patients
based on their recurrence risk proﬁles, the IMbrave050
criteria [21] and ERASL-post model [22] were employed
in deﬁning distinct recurrence risk groups.
Enzyme-Linked Sorbent Assay
The concentrations of serum soluble checkpoint
proteins (sPD1, sPD-L1, sTIM3, sLAG3, sCTLA4) and
cytokines or chemokines (IL-10, IL-6, CCL5, VEGF) were
quantiﬁed using commercially available human cytokine
ELISA kits (eBioscience, San Diego, CA, USA). The
M2BPGi levels were determined using the HISCL
M2BPGi reagent (Sysmex Co., Kobe, Japan) on a fully
automated immunoanalyzer, HISCL-800 (Sysmex Co.,
Kobe, Japan). The procedures adhered to the instructions
provided by the manufacturers.
Immunohistochemistry
Parafﬁn-embedded samples were sectioned into 5-μm
slices and subsequently subjected to immunohistochem-
istry. Tumor-cell PD-L1 expression was assessed using the
PD-L1 IHC 28-8 pharmDx assay (Agilent Technologies,
Santa Clara, CA, USA), with results reported as the per-
centage of tumor cells exhibiting PD-L1 cell membrane
staining at any intensity (% TC). Intra-tumoral CD8, TIM-
3, and LAG-3 expressions were assessed using anti-CD8
(4B11, Leica Biosystems, Deer Park, IL, USA), anti-TIM-3
(D5D5R, Cell Signaling, Danvers, MA, USA), and ant-
LAG-3 (17B4, Novus Biologicals, Littleton, CO, USA).
Post-antibody incubation, adjacent sections underwent
staining with diaminobenzidine or amino-ethylcarbazide
using the Envision System (DakoCytomation). The im-
munohistochemistry double staining images were con-
verted to ﬂuorescence using Photoshop. Analysis was
conducted utilizing a Leica DM IRB inverted research
microscope (Leica Microsystems, Wetzlar, Germany). The
expressions of LAG3 and TIM-3 were generally low in this
cohort. Therefore, no further correlation analysis of LAG3
and TIM-3 was performed.
Tissue sections were initially screened at low power
(×100), and the ﬁve most representative ﬁelds were
carefully selected. To assess immune cell densities, the
respective areas of the tumor nest, peritumoral stroma,
and normal peritumoral tissue were measured at ×400
magniﬁcation. Subsequently, the target immune cells in
each area were manually counted and expressed as the
number of cells per ﬁeld. The representative ﬁgure of
immunohistochemistry staining for PD-L1 expression in
HCC tumor tissue are shown in online supplementary
Figure 1 (for all online suppl. material, see https://doi.org/
10.1159/000540802).
Statistical Analysis
Statistical analysis was conducted using IBM SPSS
Statistics V22 (IBM, Armonk, NY, USA). Descriptive
statistics were presented as mean ± standard deviation or
as median (ranges) when appropriate. Categorical vari-
ables were compared using Pearsonχ
2 analysis or the
Fisher’s exact test, while continuous variables were
compared using the Mann-Whitney U test.
The Kaplan-Meier method was employed to estimate
survival rates, and the log-rank test was utilized to
compare survival curves between different groups.
Prognostic factors were analyzed using the Cox
proportional-hazards model. Variables showing statisti-
cal signiﬁcance (p < 0.05) or those nearing signiﬁcance
(p < 0.1) in univariate analysis were included in the
multivariate analysis, performed using a forward stepwise
Cox proportional-hazards model. A two-tailedp < 0.05
was considered statistically signiﬁcant. For each bio-
marker, we tested the cutoff value using the mean, me-
dian, interquartile range, or the best cutoff for the
presence or absence of HCC recurrence based on the
receiver-operating characteristic curve (Youden index).
The most discriminative value of each biomarker was
selected for univariate and multivariate analyses. Con-
sequently, the cutoff values for IL-10 and CCL5 were
determined by the upper quartile, while the cutoff values
for other factors were determined by the Youden index.
Results
The baseline characteristics of the 247 HCC patients
who underwent surgical resection are summarized in
Table 1. The primary etiologies of HCC were HBV and
HCV infections, accounting for 43.3% and 25.1%, re-
spectively. According to the IMbrave050 criteria, 66.4% of
patients were deemed high-risk for recurrence. Based on
the ERASL-post criteria, 30% and 8.9% of patients were
classiﬁed as intermediate- and high-risk for recurrence,
respectively.
Throughout the median follow-up period of 47.4 months
(ranging from 1.3 to 128.5 months), 125 patients (50.6%)
experienced HCC recurrence after resection, and 67 patients
(27.1%) died during the follow-up period.

intra-tumoral CD8 expression>1%.
The correlations between M2BPGi and other serum
biomarkers, as well as intra-tumoral PD-L1 expression,
are illustrated in Figure 1. The serum M2BPGi level
showed signiﬁcant correlations with the FIB-4 score,
APRI, ALBI score, AFP, ALT, AST, IL-10, CCL5, VEGF-
A, soluble PD-1, PD-L1, TIM-3, and LAG-3 levels.
Furthermore, the M2BPGi level demonstrated a signiﬁ-
cant correlation with tumor PD-L1 expression (r = 0.191,
p = 0.004). As shown in online supplementary Table 2,
there were signi ﬁcant associations between ﬁbrosis
markers (FIB-4, APRI) and inﬂammation markers (ALT,
AST) with most serum immunological markers, except
for VEGF-A. Additionally, the liver function marker
ALBI score was signiﬁcantly associated with serum sol-
uble CTLA-4, LAG-3, TIM-3, and CCL5. Nevertheless,
M2BPGi exhibited the strongest correlations with these

There was a signi ﬁcant correlation between intra-
tumoral CD8 and PD-L1 expressions (r = 0.156, p =
0.020, online suppl. Fig. 2a). However, no signiﬁcant
correlation was observed between serum M2BPGi and
CD8 expression (r = 0.025,p = 0.706, online suppl. Fig. 2b).
There was no signiﬁcant correlation between M2BPGi
and tumor size (r = 0.030,p = 0.643, online suppl. Fig. 3a),
tumor number (single vs. multiple tumors: mean M2BPGi
1.51 vs. 1.41 C.O.I.,p = 0.473, online suppl. Fig. 3b), or
microvascular invasion (absence vs. presence: mean
M2BPGi 1.44 vs. 1.51 C.O.I.,p = 0.874, online suppl. Fig. 3c).
Factors Associated with Recurrence-Free Survival
Through Kaplan-Meier analysis (Fig. 2a – e), pa-
tients with elevated levels of M2BPGi, soluble TIM-3,
VEGF-A, soluble PD-1, and IL-10 exhibited signi ﬁ-
cantly poorer recurrence-free survival (RFS), whereas
tumor PD-L1 expression showed no association with
RFS (Fig. 2f). In univariate analysis, factors associated
with RFS included BCLC stage, tumor size, tumor
number, AFP, albumin, AST levels, microvascular
invasion, VEGF-A, soluble PD-1, TIM-3, and
M2BPGi levels (Table 2). In multivariate analysis,
independent predictors of RFS were identi ﬁed as
tumor size >5 cm (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.859, p =
0.002), multiple tumors (HR = 2.562, p < 0.001),
AFP >20 ng/mL (HR = 2.141, p < 0.001), microvas-
cular invasion (HR = 1.954, p = 0.004), and
M2BPGi >1.5 COI (HR = 2.100,p < 0.001). M2BPGi
could signi ﬁcantly discriminate RFS in subgroup
patients with HBV-related HCC (online suppl.
Fig. 4A), HCV-related HCC (online suppl. Fig. 4B),
and nonviral HCC (online suppl. Fig. 4C).

M2BPGi further Stratiﬁes Recurrence Risk in
ERASL-Post and IMbrave050 Risk Groups
RFS in ERASL-post low-, intermediate-, and high-
risk groups were 87.8, 23, and 4.9 months, respectively
(online suppl. Fig. 5A). Patients with M2BPGi ≤1.5
COI demonstrated improved survival in ERASL-post
low-risk (RFS 87.8 vs. 36.3 months,p =0 . 0 2 5 ,o n l i n e
suppl. Fig. 5B), intermediate-risk (RFS 26 vs. 12.6
months, p = 0.014, online suppl. Fig. 5C), and high-risk
groups (RFS 6.1 vs. 3.1 months,p = 0.124, online suppl.
Fig. 5D).
The RFS in IMbrave050 low- and high-risk groups
were 87.8 and 21.8 months, respectively (online suppl.
Fig. 6A). Patients with M2BPGi ≤1.5 COI exhibited
signiﬁcantly better survival in both IMbrave050 low-risk
(RFS 87.8 vs. 57.6 months, p = 0.046, online suppl.
Fig. 6B) and high-risk groups (RFS 29.1 vs. 11 months,p =
0.001, online suppl. Fig. 6C).
M2BPGi-Based Model further Stratiﬁes Recurrence
Risk according to IMbrave050 Criteria
Based on the identiﬁed pretreatment predictors of RFS,
a new prediction model, consisting of M2BPGi, AFP,
tumor size, multiple tumors, and microvascular invasion,
was proposed to predict RFS in patients undergoing
surgical resection (Table 3). Due to the similar HRs of
each factor, patients were assigned one point for each of
the ﬁve parameters when they fell into the adverse group,
as deﬁned by the cut-off. The risk score was deﬁned as the
sum of these points, classifying patients into low- (risk
score 0– 1), intermediate- (risk score 2– 3), or high- (risk
score 4– 5) risk groups (Table 3). Kaplan-Meier analysis
demonstrated that the new M2BPGi-based model could
signiﬁcantly discriminate RFS in the overall cohort
(Fig. 3a) as well as in the IMbrave050 low- (Fig. 3b) and
high-risk groups (Fig. 3c). The M2BPGi-based model
could also signiﬁcantly discriminate RFS in subgroup

Factors Associated with Overall Survival
In univariate analysis, factors associated with overall
survival (OS) included BCLC stage, tumor size, AFP,
albumin, ALT, AST levels, microvascular invasion, sol-
uble TIM-3, and M2BPGi levels (online suppl. Table 3).
The 5-year survival rate for patients with M2BPGi≤1.5
and >1.5 COI was 77.5% and 50.7%, respectively (p <
0.001, online suppl. Fig. 7). In multivariate analysis, in-
dependent predictors of OS were identiﬁed as tumor
size >5 cm (HR = 1.931,p = 0.021), AFP >20 ng/mL
(HR = 1.797,p = 0.034), microvascular invasion (HR =
2.143, p = 0.049), and M2BPGi>1.5 COI (HR = 2.707,p <

Discussion
In this study, we assessed the prognostic value of
various novel serum biomarkers in patients undergoing
surgical resection for HCC. Our ﬁndings revealed a
signiﬁcant correlation between serum M2BPGi and other
surrogate markers of liverﬁbrosis, liver function reserve,

and immunology. Moreover, M2BPGi emerged as a
signiﬁcant predictor of both RFS and OS following
surgical resection.
The recurrence rate of HCC remains high following
surgical resection, with multiple factors contributing to
recurrence. Tumor-related factors, including tumor size,
number, microvascular invasion, poor differentiation,
AFP, liver function, and ﬁbrosis, are well-established
clinical predictors of HCC recurrence [23]. Identifying
patients at high risk of recurrence can inform a more
vigilant post-resection monitoring strategy, and adjuvant
immunotherapy may be beneﬁcial for such individuals.
The IMbrave050 trial has demonstrated positive outcomes,
indicating a reduced risk of HCC recurrence in high-risk
patients receiving adjuvant atezolizumab plus bev-
acizumab after curative treatment. However, the IM-
brave050 criteria for high recurrence risk only incorporate
tumor size, number, microvascular invasion, and poor
differentiation, neglecting AFP and other host factors [21].
Consequently, the IMbrave050 criteria may be inadequate
in identifying high-risk patients. The ERASL-post model,
incorporating tumor size, number, microvascular invasion,
AFP, gender, and ALBI grade, could potentially offer
improved accuracy compared to the IMbrave050 criteria,
as it considers both tumor- and host-related factors [22].
Nonetheless, these clinical criteria remain imperfect, ne-
cessitating the exploration of novel biomarkers to enhance
the precision of clinical prediction models.
The tumor immune microenvironment has been
recognized as a pivotal factor in HCC carcinogenesis and
recurrence. Immunological biomarkers may provide in-
sights into the HCC immune microenvironment, offering
prognostic value for predicting HCC recurrence. In this
study, we selected several serum biomarkers implicated in
HCC carcinogenesis or associated with therapeutic po-
tential in HCC. IL-6 [24], IL-10 [25], and CCL5 [26] have
demonstrated involvement in HCC progression. Soluble
PD-1, PD-L1, CTLA-4, and VEGF-A are relevant to
currently approved systemic therapies for HCC, such as
atezolizumab plus bevacizumab, durvalumab plus
tremelizumab, nivolumab plus ipilimumab, and pem-
brolizumab [6]. TIM-3 and LAG-3 are also novel targets
of immune-checkpoint inhibitors under investigation in
HCC [27]. Tumor PD-L1 expression is a crucial marker
in the era of immunotherapy, demonstrating correlation
with HCC aggressiveness [28]. M2BPGi has proven useful
as a marker for predicting liverﬁbrosis and HCC risk in
patients with chronic liver disease across various etiol-
ogies [29– 33].
In this study, we assessed the correlation between M2BPGi
and other serum biomarkers, as well as tumor PD-L1 ex-
pression. Intriguingly, we observed a signiﬁcant correlation
between M2BPGi and surrogate markers of liverﬁbrosis
(FIB-4 score, APRI), liver function reserve (ALBI score), liver
inﬂammation (ALT, AST), tumor marker (AFP), angio-
genesis (VEGF-A), and nearly all measured immunological
biomarkers (IL-10, CCL5, soluble PD-1, PD-L1, TIM-3, and
LAG-3). AFP represents not only a marker of tumor burden
but also correlates with liver inﬂammation, ﬁbrosis, and
tumor biology. In contrast, there was no signi ﬁcant

correlation between M2BPGi and tumor factors such as
tumor size, tumor number, and microvascular invasion
[20, 34].
M2BPGi has been clinically applied as a diagnostic
marker for liverﬁbrosis over the past decade. However, its
role in patients with chronic liver disease and HCC is not
completely elucidated. In patients with chronic hepatitis,
including hepatitis B, hepatitis C, and metabolic
dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease, several pro-
inﬂammatory molecules (such as CCL5) and immuno-
suppressive molecules (such as IL-10, PD-1, TIM-3, and
LAG-3) contribute to the pathogenesis of chronic hepatic
inﬂammation [35]. Chronic hepatic inﬂammation further
induces the secretion of M2BPGi from hepatic stellate
cells, driving the progression of liverﬁbrosis [36].
In this study, M2BPGi showed signiﬁcant correlations
with several immunological markers, as well as markers
of liver ﬁbrosis, inﬂammation, and liver function. Al-
though these immunological markers also had signiﬁcant
correlations with liver function markers, M2BPGi
showed stronger correlations with these liver function
markers than other immunological markers, suggesting
that M2BPGi may play a signiﬁcant role in representing
the tumor microenvironment of HCC. Additionally,
M2BPGi shows the highest correlation with most serum
immunological biomarkers compared to FIB-4 and APRI.
These ﬁndings suggest that M2BPGi serves not only as a
marker of hepatic ﬁbrosis but also as an indicator of
hepatic inﬂammation. M2BPGi may be associated with
multiple aspects of the tumor immune microenviron-
ment in HCC, independent of tumor factors.
Tumor-inﬁltrating CD8
+ T cells are crucial in mod-
ulating antitumor responses. Our study revealed a sig-
niﬁcant correlation between CD8 and PD-L1 expression.
However, no signiﬁcant correlation was found between
tumor CD8 expression and M2BPGi, RFS, or OS. This
indicates the need for a more in-depth analysis of the
functional role of CD8 + T cells to determine their
prognostic value in HCC.
Our study demonstrated signiﬁcant correlations between
M2BPGi, VEGF-A, soluble PD-1, and TIM-3 levels with RFS,
indicating their prognostic potential in HCC patients. In
multivariate analysis, M2BPGi emerged as a robust predictor
of RFS, independent of other well-known clinical factors
associated with RFS. M2BPGi levels were effective in further
stratifying the recurrence risk within each risk group deﬁned
by the ERASL-post model or IMbrave050 criteria. We pro-
posed an M2BPGi-based model by incorporatingﬁve inde-
pendent predictors of RFS identiﬁed through multivariate
analysis. This novel model demonstrated enhanced dis-
crimination of recurrence risk in both IMbrave050 low- and
high-risk groups. M2BPGi andt h eM 2 B P G i - b a s e dm o d e l
may also discriminate RFS in patients with HBV-related
HCC, HCV-related HCC, and nonviral HCC using the
same cutoff value of M2BPGi, suggesting that M2BPGi can be
broadly applied across various HCC etiologies. Improved
accuracy in predicting recurrence risk could facilitate the
selection of patients who would beneﬁtf r o ma d j u v a n ti m -
munotherapy following surgical resection.
This study has some limitations. First, it is a single-
center study, and further external validation is required to
conﬁrm the prognostic role of M2BPGi. Second, while
M2BPGi can identify patients at high risk of recurrence,
its role in predicting the response to adjuvant immu-
notherapy remains unclear. Additional studies are war-
ranted to explore the correlation between M2BPGi and
the efﬁcacy of immunotherapy.
In conclusion, serum M2BPGi levels were signiﬁcantly
correlated with surrogate markers of liverﬁbrosis, liver
function, and immunology. M2BPGi emerged as a sig-
niﬁcant predictor of HCC recurrence and survival after
resection, suggesting its potential incorporation into
recurrence-prediction models.
