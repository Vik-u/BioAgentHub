ABSTRACT
Abdominal surgery such as ovariectomy is a traumatic event that can cause oxidative stress. 
The aim of the present study was to evaluate the concentration of serotonin in relation to 
ovariectomy-induced oxidative stress in dogs undergoing general anesthesia. Thirty-two female 
dogs, under general anesthesia, received meloxicam before surgery (0.2 mgkg −1 SC) and after 
surgery (0.1 mgkg −1 OS every 24 h). The physiological, hematological, and biochemical 
parameters: glycemia, aspartate transaminase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), total 
protein, albumin and BUN were evaluated. Oxidative stress was determined by malondialdehyde 
(MDA) assay, catalase (CAT), superoxide dismutase (SOD), myeloperoxidase (MPO) and 
butyrylcholinesterase (BuChe) at baseline, 36 and 48 h after the last administration of 
meloxicam. Serotonin (5-HT) concentration was also evaluated at baseline, 36 and 48 h after 
the last administration of meloxicam. Responses to surgical stimulus were evaluated. 
Physiological and hematological parameters they fell within the normal ranges for anesthetized 
dogs. Glycemia increased, albumin levels decreased after surgery. No rescue analgesia was 
required. MDA and 5-HT concentrations significantly increased from the baseline at 36 and 
48 h after surgery ( p < .001). 5-HT levels could be used as an indicator for oxidative stress 
induced by surgery and it might be employed for objectively quantifying the well-being of the 
surgical patient.
1.  Introduction
Many environmental, social and clinical conditions 
can increase oxidative stress in animals, especially 
when occur pathological and painful diseases. Trauma 
and surgical injury can also delay recovery after sur -
gery, through the induction of cell apoptosis and tis -
sue necrosis (Senoner et  al. 2019). Surgical stress in 
animals can be reported using a variety of markers, 
including cortisol and serotonin hormones, oxidative 
stress markers and behavioral analysis (Szczubial 
et  al. 2015; Srithunyarat et  al. 2016; Bruschetta et  al. 
2024). The use of a balanced anesthetic protocol 
could reduce the anesthetics dose with an effective 
reduction in the side effects induced by surgical 
stress (Beloeil and Nouette-Gaulain 2012). Drugs use -
ful in the management of perioperative pain in dogs 
include opioids, α2-adrenergic receptor agonists, 
local anesthetics, and non-steroidal anti-inflamma -
tory drugs (NSAID) (Mwangi et  al. 2018). Propofol 
was an anesthetic with a chemical structure similar 
to tocopherol with high antioxidant power and it has 
low side effects. It was administered intravenously to 
induce and maintain general anesthesia in dogs 
(Interlandi et  al. 2022; Costa et  al. 2023; Costa et  al. 
2023). Sevoflurane was a halogenated anesthetic that 
was rapidly removed from the respiratory system and 
has low side cardiorespiratory effects, low solubility 
and it was widely used in clinical practice, especially 
for its neuroprotective and anti-inflammatory effects, 
that promote rapid recovery of the patient (Tsuchiya 
et  al. 2010; Lee 2012; Liang et  al. 2021).
The combination of the two anesthetics allows to 
obtain a protocol of general anesthesia, already used 
in humans and in dogs undergoing surgery (Lee 
2012; Interlandi et  al. 2022).
The use of Meloxicam, a non-steroidal anti-inflam -
matory drug (NSAID), combined with propofol and 
sevoflurane enhances the anti-inflammatory and 
analgesic properties of the anesthetic protocol. 
Meloxicam selectively inhibits the inducible cycloox -
ygenase 2 (COX-2), which mediates the inflammatory 
response as a function of the inflammatory stimulus 
induced by an external or internal stimulus. 
Furthermore, trauma or surgical injury also induce 
the release of the same inflammatory mediators pro -
duced by the constitutive COX-1 isoform located in 
every cell. Like traditional NSAIDs used in humans, 
Meloxicam also has antipyretic activity and improved 
gastrointestinal tolerability, making it suitable for the

management of various pathologies (Xu et  al. 2014; 
Farmacologia Veterinaria - II Edizione 2021).
Serotonin or 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) was a 
biogenic monoamine known as the ‘happiness hor -
mone’ . The 5-hydroxytryptamine was a neurotrans -
mitter derived from the amino acid tryptophan, 
which at the level of the Central Nervous System was 
responsible for regulating mood and temperature, as 
well as appetite and sleep (Nichols and Nichols 
2008). In the peripheral nervous system, serotonin 
was involved in vasoconstriction, gastrointestinal 
motility, bone homeostasis, inflammation, and lacta -
tion (Matsuda et  al. 2004; Bertrand 2006).
Serotonin was synthesized from the amino acid 
L-tryptophan by initial hydroxylation to 5-hydroxy -
tryptophan (5-HTP) by the enzyme tryptophan 
hydroxylase (TPH), which limits the rate of serotonin 
synthesis. There were two genetically distinct 
expressed isoforms of this enzyme: TPH1 was 
peripherally expressed into the pineal body and the 
digestive tract, whereas TPH2 was centrally localized 
in the brain (Grahame-Smith 1964; Walther 
et  al. 2003).
The produced serotonin was released as a neu -
rotransmitter from the presynaptic neurons into the 
synaptic space under an appropriate stimulus to 
ensure interaction with the specific receptor on the 
plasma membrane of the postsynaptic neuron. The 
released serotonin was taken back into the synaptic 
cleft by the presynaptic neuron through a reuptake 
system operated by the serotonin transporter (SERT).
Surgical oxidative stress can cause an increase in 
serotonin and enzymes such as superoxide dismutase 
(SOD), catalase (CAT), glutathione peroxidase (GPx) 
and glutathione reductase (GSR), which were involved 
in the antioxidant process (Balaban et  al. 2005; 
Szczubial et  al. 2015; Srithunyarat et  al. 2016; 
Hydbring-Sandberg et  al. 2021). Salavati et  al. 
revealed that serotonin levels decreased in castrated 
dogs (Salavati et  al. 2018). However, acute stress can 
induce increases or decreases in serotonin concentra -
tions (Bruschetta et  al. 2024).
The oxidative imbalance resulting from surgery 
determines the production of peroxides and free 
radicals, which can cause damage to all cellular 
components such as proteins, lipids, and DNA. The 
damage was mostly indirect, caused by the reactive 
oxygen species generated, such as superoxide anion 
(O2
−) and hydroxyl radical (OH) (Giles et  al. 2017; Ali 
et  al. 2020). Lipid peroxidation processes affecting 
biological membranes and inflammatory processes 
determine an increase in malondialdehyde (MDA), 
which it was used in biomedical research as a 
marker of lipid peroxidation. Its quantification by 
the TBARS assay were demonstrated in human 
serum, low-density lipoprotein, and other cell 
lysates (Ayala et  al. 2014).
General anesthesia allows surgery to be performed 
without the perception of pain, awareness and mem -
ory, movement, while maintaining the vital parame -
ters of the subject involved both the spinal cord with 
analgesia and suppression of movement (Yang et  al. 
2009) and the brain with amnesia and loss of con -
sciousness (LOC) (Franks 2008). In line with the com -
mon perception that general anesthesia induces 
sleep, it was useful to establish a correlation between 
the awakening from sleep, which was determined by 
hormonal circadian rhythms or by stimuli, and the 
awakening from anesthesia, which was a recovery 
from a drug-induced coma. Natural sleep and gen -
eral anesthesia may function similarly after sleep 
deprivation (Tung et  al. 2002; Tung et  al. 2004).
According to previous studies in rats, propofol-in -
duced anesthesia leads to natural sleep, such as 
deep sleep, which results in increased slow-wave 
sleep time (SWS) and rapid eye movement sleep 
(REMS) (Tung et  al. 2004). On the other hand, sevo -
flurane appears to reduce SWS only, but even with 
other volatile anesthetics such as isoflurane, REMS 
has not been reduced by anesthesia (Mashour et  al. 
2010; Pal et  al. 2011; Pick et  al. 2011).
The aim of this study was to evaluate the oxida -
tive stress in relation to serotonin during ovariec -
tomy in dogs. The hypothesis of the study was to 
identify a positive or negative correlation between 
the malondialdehyde concentration (MDA) and sero -
tonin during surgery.
2.  Materials and methods
The clinical study was approved by the Review Board 
for Animals Care of the University of Parma, project 
No. 03/CESA/2023, according to regulation (EU) no. 
536/2014. (22A01712) (GU General Series n.65 of 
18-03-2022), European law (O.J. of E.C. L 358/1 
12/18/1986), and US laws (Animal Welfare Assurance 
No. A5594-01, Department of Health and Human 
Services, USA). G Power 3.1 software was used, with 
an effect size (f ) of 0.5, a significance level (α) of 
0.05, a power (1-β) of 0.80 and only one group, in 
order to adequately determine the sample size for ‘a 
priori’ X 2 tests (goodness-of-fit tests: contingency 
tables). The owners signed a voluntary informed con -
sent form prior to the dogs’ enrolment in the study. 
Thirty-two female dogs, aged 2 ± 0.5 years and weigh -
ing 18 ± 0.7 kg were enrolled for bilateral ovariectomy. 
The inclusion criterion of the patients was necessary 
ovariectomy. The exclusion criterion was not belong -
ing to the ASA I class.
2.1.  Drug administration and anesthesia
Preoperative oral intake of fluids and water can be 
safely consumed up to 2 h while the food was 
allowed up to 6 h prior to anaesthesia administra -
tion. The dogs also received 0.2 mg kg −1 meloxicam 
subcutaneous (SC) (Metacam 2% Boehringer 
Ingelheim, Italy) and 0.03 mg kg −1 atropine sulphate 
intramuscular (IM) (atropine sulphate 0.1% A.T.I., 
Italy). A 20 G × 32 mm catheter (DELTA VEN) was 
placed in the cephalic vein for the administration of 
5 mlkgh −1 of Ringer’s lactate for the whole proce -
dure. Twenty minutes after premedication, general 
VETERINARY  QUARTERLY 3
anesthesia was induced with propofol (Proposure 
1% Merial, Italy) and endotracheal intubation was 
performed with a Magill cuff tube. Sevoflurane 
(Sevoflo, Zoetis Italy) in 100% oxygen via a rebreath -
ing circuit was administred for general anesthesia. 
Ventilation was performed using a pressurimeter 
ventilator (SIMV) (GE Datex Ohmeda Avance 
Ultramed, Italy) with the following parameters: 
respiratory rate 12 breaths min −1, positive end-inspi -
ratory pressure (PEEP) 4 cm H 2O, inspiration/expira -
tion ratio (I:E) 1:7 and airway pressure 12 cm H 2O. 
Meloxicam 0.1 mg kg −1 was administered orally 
every 24 h after surgery.
2.2.  Physiological and anesthetic variables
After a 30-minute acclimatization period in the surgi -
cal preparation room: heart rate (HR, beats per min -
ute) was taken over using a stethoscope. Respiratory 
rate (RR, breaths per minute) was taken over by 
counting thoracic wall excursions, non-invasive arte -
rial pressure (mmHg) (systolic, SAP; mean, MAP; dia -
stolic, DAP) measured using a cuff (10-18cm in 
circumference) placed at arm level. Body tempera -
ture (TC°) was detected placing the thermometer in 
the rectum, end-tidal carbon dioxide tension (EtCO 2, 
mmHg), arterial hemoglobin oxygen saturation (SpO 2, 
%) and the concentration of inspired and expired 
isoflurane (CSI/CSE) were measured using a monitor 
(GE Datex-Ohmeda Avance multiparametric monitor 
for anesthesia Ultramed, Italy). These parameters 
were recorded at the T0 baseline, at 20 min after pre -
medication (P) (except EtCO 2 and the concentration 
of inspired and expired isoflurane), after the induc -
tion of general anesthesia (A), at skin incision (SI), at 
laparotomy (L), during traction and removal of the 
first ovarian and second ovarian (TPI, TPII), and at 
skin suturing (SC).
2.3.  Assessment of intra- and post-operative 
response to surgical stimulus
The intraoperative response to the surgical stimulus 
was assessed using a cumulative pain scale (CPS). A 
score from 0 to 4 was assigned to the percentage 
change in RR, HR and SAP values recorded after 
anesthesia (A), according to the following scheme: 
0 ≤ 0%; 1 = variation ≤ 10%; 2 = variation > 10% but 
≤ 20%; 3 = variation > 20% but ≤ 30%; and 4 = vari-
ation > 30%. A total 10 score, corresponding to the 
20% increase of the three parameters considered 
was the cut-off point for the rescue analgesia: 2 mcg 
kg−1 of fentanyl (Fentadon, Dechra, Italy) (Costa 
et  al. 2019). A canine acute pain scale (Colorado 
State University Veterinary Medical Center), was 
used to evaluate postoperative pain by assigning a 
0-4 score, from waking up every 6 h–24 h post-sur -
gery. Score 2, corresponding to moderate to mild 
pain, was the cut-off point for the administration of 
the rescue analgesia: methadone 0.2 mg kg −1 IM 
(Semfortan, Dechra, Italy).
2.4.  Hematological, biochemical parameters, 
oxidative parameters and 5-hydroxytryptamine 
assay
The same operator collected five ml blood samples 
from the cephalic vein, after the previous measure -
ments. Each sample was divided into aliquots, one of 
which was placed in a vacuum serum isolation tube 
(serum clot activator Z, Vacuette®, Greiner Bio-One, 
Kremsmünster, Austria) and used to assess biochem -
ical parameters such as glycemia, aspartate transam -
inase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), total 
protein, albumin, and urea. Another aliquot was used 
to assess oxidative stress levels by measuring lipid 
peroxidation, catalase (CAT), superoxide dismutase 
(SOD), myeloperoxidase (MPO) and butyrylcholines -
terase (BuChe).
An additional volume of blood was placed in a 
vacuum tube containing K3-EDTA (Vacuette®, Greiner 
Bio-One, Kremsmünster, Austria) for assessment of 
the blood hemogram at baseline only. Both sets of 
tubes were immediately refrigerated at 4 °C, and after 
3 h only the sample in the serum tube was centri -
fuged at 1500 rpg for 15 min to obtain the serum 
aliquot.
An UV-Vis spectrophotometer (A560, Fulltech, 
Italy) was used to evaluate AST and ALT parameters 
at 37 °C using kinetic methods (Medica et  al., 2018a, 
2018b). Glucose, albumin, total protein and blood 
urea were measured by glucose oxidase/peroxidase, 
bromocresol green, biuret, and peroxidase/phenylala -
nine methods, respectively.
Biochemical data were obtained from samples 
taken at baseline and 12 h after the end of surgery. 
Oxidative status was measured at baseline, 36 and 
48 h after the end of surgery.
The malondialdehyde (MDA) assay required thio -
barbituric acid (TBA) from Fluka (Buchs, Switzerland), 
phosphoric acid (85%, 15 mol/1), sodium hydroxide, 
SDS (8.1%) and sodium chloride from Merck 
(Darmstadt, Germany). All reagents were of the high -
est available grade. The MDA standard was prepared 
by hydrolysis of TMB. TBA reagent used for the 
0.11 mol/l assay: 800 mg TBA dissolved in 50 ml NaOH 
0.1 mol/1. Plasma was replaced with 200 μl of MDA 
standard solution to detect the amount of TBARS. 
MDA stock solutions were prepared by hydrolyzing 
50 μl of TMP (10 mmol/l) in 10 ml of 0.01 M hydro -
chloric acid for 10 min at room temperature. To 
obtain different concentrations of MDA standards, 
the MDA stock solution was diluted with ultrapure 
water. Plasma calibration was performed by adding 
200 μl of phosphoric acid containing different 
amounts of MDA to the pooled plasma samples. The 
tubes were incubated at 90 °C in a water bath after 
the samples were added to the reaction mixture. 
Lipid peroxidation in blood serum samples was 
assessed by measuring MDA production after reac -
tion with thiobarbituric glacial acetic acid for 1 h. The 
tubes were placed on ice to stop the reaction and, 
after cooling, 100 μl of standards and samples were 
added to a 96-well microplate. Absorbance was read 
4 G. BRUSCHETTA ET AL.
at 535 nm and 572 nm to adjust baseline absorbance 
using a multititer plate reader. TBARS were quantified 
by measuring the optical density difference between 
the two wavelengths using appropriate calibration 
curves. The determination of catalase (CAT) activity 
was achieved by an enzymatic H 2O2 reaction. All 
reagents were allowed to equilibrate at room tem -
perature prior the assay. Each well contained a final 
test volume of 240 μL. The Catalase sample buffer 
(1X) and the diluted test buffer were used to assay 
samples and standards in duplicate. Absorbance was 
measured at 540 nm using a BIORAD 680 microplate 
reader (BIORAD Laboratories, Italy) (Wheeler et  al. 
1990). The superoxide dismutases (SODs) were metal -
loenzymes which catalyse the dismutation of super -
oxide anion to molecular oxygen and hydrogen 
peroxide. The final volume for each duplicated well 
was 230 μL and all reagents, were used at 25 °C prior 
to the start of the assay. The absorbance was moni -
tored between 440 and 460 nm using the BIORAD 
680 plate reader (BIORAD Laboratories, Italy) (Maier 
and Chan 2002). MPO activity was measured using 
the dianisidine-H70 method on a 96-well plate. 
Samples were added in triplicate to a mixture con -
taining 0.53 mM o-dianisidine hydrochloride, 0.15 mM 
hydrogen peroxide, and 50 mM potassium phosphate 
buffer (pH 6.0). The reaction was incubated for 5 min 
at 25 °C, blocked with 30% sodium azide and the 
absorbance measured at 460 nm (BIORAD 680 plate 
reader, BIORAD Laboratories, Italy) (Dhiman et  al. 
2009). In the BuChE assay, the substrate was hydro -
lysed to form thiocholine, which reacts with 2-nitro -
benzoic acid dissolved in 625 µl of the BuChE assay 
buffer. The absorbance was measured at 412 nm and 
25 °C using a BIORAD 680 plate reader (BIORAD 
Laboratories, Italy) (Jasiecki et  al. 2021). To assess 
plasma 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) levels, 2 ml of 
each 5 ml aliquot was filled into an EDTA Vacutainer 
tube (K3-EDTA, Vacuette, Greiner Bio-One, 
Kremsmünster, Austria), immediately stored at 4 °C 
and then (within 2-3 h) centrifuged at 4500 Rpm, 4 °C 
for 10 min to obtain a 98% free platelet-poor plasma 
(PPP) fraction (Bruschetta et  al. 2017; Bruschetta 
et  al. 2018). PPP samples were stored at −20 °C for 
5-HT analysis.
The concentration of 5-HT in the platelet-poor 
plasma (PPP) fraction was measured using a com -
mercially available enzyme-linked immunosorbent 
assay (ELISA) kit (DEE5900, Demeditec Diagnostic 
GmbH, Germany). Serotonin standards and plasma 
samples were processed according to the kit proto -
col (Medica et  al. 2020). The absorption values were 
determined at the wavelength of 450 nm (reference 
wavelength at 630 nm) using a microplate reader 
BIO-RAD 680 (BIO-RAD Laboratories, Italy). Standard 
absorbance values were used to obtain the calibra -
tion curve, from which the plasma 5-HT concentra -
tions of the samples could be estimated. 5-HT 
concentration values were expressed in ng/ml. The 
sensitivity of the assay was 0.5 ng/ml. The average 
intra- and inter-assay coefficients of variation were 
6.2% and 9.1%, respectively.
2.5.  Statistical analysis
Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS version 
27.1 (IBM, Italy). The data were analyzed for normality 
using the Shapiro-Wilk test and reported as the 
mean ± SD or median (range) as appropriate. Differences 
along the timeline were analyzed with a t-test or the 
Wilcoxon test as appropriate. Inter-observer agreement 
for the quality of postoperative analgesia was analyzed 
using Kendall’s coefficient of concordance W. The cor -
relation between MDA and serotonin levels were eval -
uated by Pearson’s correlation. The differences were 
considered significant at p ≤ .05.
3.  Results
The total number of subjects involved in the research 
study was 32, with an effective power of 0.80 and a 
high intra-observer agreement of W = 1. Heart rate 
increases, compared to baseline, along the time line 
after general anesthesia p = .000. Systolic arterial 
pressure decreases along the entire time line p = .000. 
Median and diastolic arterial pressure showed no sig -
nificant differences from baseline SPO 2 was 96/100%, 
ETCO2 showed a significant reduction during anes -
thesia p = .000.
Body temperature was 39/37.9 C°, showing a 
non-statistically significant reduction.
Inspired concentrations of sevoflurane decreased 
along the time line after skin incision p = .001. Expired 
concentrations of sevoflurane was reduced compared 
to induction under general anesthesia during skin 
suturing p = .001 (Table 1 ). The CPS scores were 0–6 
(Table 2).
The canine acute pain scale score assigned was 
zero. Glycemia significantly increased at 36 h after 
surgery ( p = .000). Albumin significantly decreased at 
36 h after surgery ( p = .000). Aspartate transaminase 
(AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), total protein, 
and blood urea nitrogen were normal at baseline 
and at 36 h after meloxicam discontinuation ( Table 3).  
MDA levels significantly increased at 36 and 48 h 
after surgery ( p < .000). Serotonin levels significantly 
increased at 36 and 48 h after surgery ( p < .001). The 
Pearson’s correlation between the MDA and the 5-HT 
concentration showed a perfect positive linear rela -
tionship of 1 ( p = .005) ( Table 4 ). The levels of SOD, 
CAT, BuChE and MPO showed no significant changes 
(p = .05) (Table 4).
4.  Discussion
The results of the study confirmed a perfect positive 
linear correlation between the concentrations of 5-HT 
and MDA ( p = .005). Therefore, it was likely that a 
painful stimulus induced by surgery stimulates the 
body to release serotonin to counteract inflamma -
tory oxidative stress. The present anesthetic protocol 
with meloxicam, propofol and sevoflurane was effec -
tive and free of clinically diagnosable side effects. 
Optimal homeostasis was observed because vital

signs remaining within physiological ranges for dogs 
under general anesthesia.
In fact, SPO 2 was 96/100%; ETCO 2 decreased along 
the timeline from 45 to 36/38 mmHg, showing good 
adaptation of the patient to the pressurimetric 
ventilator and a good anesthetic plan. This was 
essential for the anesthetic management of the 
patient and the rapid attainment of the surgical level 
of anesthesia. Furthermore, it reduces operating 
times and improves analgesic efficacy, with immedi -
ate synergistic effects between halogenated drugs 
and NSAIDs due to the poor solubility of sevoflurane 
in the blood, which was also rapidly eliminated by 
the respiratory system (Lu et  al. 2014).
The pain score was 0-6 throughout surgery and 0 
for the entire post-operative period. However, even 
though the perioperative management of pain was 
clinically adequate, the surgery resulted in a pro-in -
flammatory oxidative stress, as indicated by decreased 
level of albumin ( p = .000), increased concentration of 
blood glucose ( p = .000) and serum MDA ( p = .000). 
This was confirmed by the perfect positive correla -
tion between serotonin and MDA after meloxicam 
withdrawal. Unfortunately, most of the studies pres -
ent in the literature limit themselves to evaluating 
and comparing different surgical techniques, for the 
execution of ovariectomy without carrying out objec -
tive evaluations such as toxicological and biochemi -
cal studies (Leonardi et  al. 2020). The inflammation 
enhances capillary permeability with consequent 
leakage of serum albumin, promoting the onset of 
hypoalbuminemic conditions, as a biomarker of oxi -
dative stress or wellness associated with surgery 
(Soeters et  al. 2019).
Glycemic evaluation of animals during the periop -
erative period does not appear to be a common 
practice; however hyperglycemic conditions can lead 
to numerous postoperative complications. Human 
clinical studies have shown that increasing glucose 
levels after surgery did not result in a lower rate of 
complications in healthy people, unlike people with 
diabetes. In fact, the incidence of postoperative com -
plications in patients with hyperglycemia was 26% 
and 14% in normoglycemic patients (Kalogeris et  al. 
2016). Independently of perioperative pain manage -
ment, oxidative stress plays a fundamental role in 
the development of many postoperative pathologies 
since the surgical procedure itself determines an

oxidative burst that leads to a transient organ isch -
emia and reperfusion (Kalogeris et  al. 2016). An 
increase in stress following ovariectomy was shown 
in women and female laboratory animals. However, 
there was limited information available to assess the 
inflammatory and oxidative stress consequent to 
ovariectomy in dog. In a study, the evaluation of oxi -
dative stress induced by ovariectomy in female dogs 
was performed with the determination of plasma 
concentrations of glutathione peroxidase (GPX), 
superoxide dismutase (SOD), thiobarbituric acid reac -
tive substance (TBARS), cationic radicals N, N-diethyl-
paraphenylene diamine (RC-DEPPD) and on protein 
peroxidation (SH sulphide groups, bityrosine and 
formylkynurenine). The results of the study showed 
that there was a significant increase in GPX at 14 days 
after surgery, a significant increase in TBARS of bity -
rosine, formylkynurenine and a significant reduction 
in SH groups at 30 days after surgery. This shows that 
there may be late post-operative oxidative stress. 
However, in our study, we found an increase in MDA 
that indicates oxidative stress at 36 and 48 h after 
surgery ( p = .000). Similar results were obtained in 
dogs undergoing ovariectomy and anesthetized with 
ketamine and xylazine, in fact, a significant increase 
in MDA was observed at 24 h after the end of sur -
gery (Prajwalita et  al. 2013). Therefore, a method of 
preventing pathology associated with ovariectomy in 
the dog was certainly the identification of oxidative 
status (Szczubial et  al. 2015).
Serotonin was produced independently in the 
mammalian brain and peripheral areas since it does 
not cross the blood-brain barrier. Outside the Central 
Nervous System (CNS), most of the serotonin synthe -
sis was largely confined to intestinal enterocromaffin 
cells and platelets, the latter with a smaller percent -
age of production. Platelets were an important stor -
age site for 5-HT, and the most notable 5-HT 
concentration was found in the peripheral circula -
tion, mainly in the platelets, and less in the blood. 
On the contrary, in the CNS serotonin was synthe -
sized and stored in presynaptic cells (Mohammad-
Zadeh et  al. 2008). The function of each specific 5-HT 
receptor was related to its morphology, which was 
essential for the signaling pathway modulation 
involved. As a hormone, 5-HT has many different 
functions, sometimes with opposite effects, and this 
was due to the presence of seven different heteroge -
neous receptor classes for 5-HT, which were widely 
expressed throughout the body. Each receptor class 
has further subclasses, making a total of 13 (Hoyer 
et  al. 1994). Six of these were G protein-coupled 
receptors, but only the 5-HT3 receptor involves a 
ligand-gated Na +/K+ ion channel). In the CNS, the cell 
bodies of serotonergic neurons were in the nine 
raphe nuclei, which were in the brainstem to develop 
extensive projections to the forebrain, hindbrain, and 
spinal cord (Gaspar and Lillesaar 2012). The mole -
cules of interest, such as opioids (e.g. tramadol and 
butorphanol) or alpha-2 agonists (e.g. medetomidine, 
dexmedetomidine, romifidine and xylazine), act pre -
cisely on G-membrane proteins. Therefore, the 
combination of these drugs in an anesthetic protocol 
allows to reduce the relative doses of each drug and 
above all their side effects (Interlandi et  al. 2017).
The large number of receptor types suggests 
that 5-HT has clinically relevant functions in the 
CNS in the control of psychological disorders such 
as depression and anxiety, targeted by many classes 
of drugs, including antidepressants and antipsy -
chotics, designed to the serotonergic system (Marin 
et al. 2012). In several body areas, 5-HT was involved 
in the modulation of intestinal and gastric motility, 
vasoconstriction, enhancement of platelet aggrega -
tion and, above all, in wound healing (Sarrouilhe 
and Mesnil 2019). In fact, this point was essential 
for perioperative pain management carried out by 
the analgesic administration, and it was closely 
linked to the possibility that pain may have multi -
ple effects on the organism’s homeostasis. Stress 
increases the release of vasoactive catecholamines, 
which induce tachycardia and hypertension, cou -
pled with cortisol, which leads to an increase in 
glucagon synthesis. The anabolic effect of pain was 
accompanied by catabolic effects resulting in 
delayed healing, pulmonary atelectasis, hypotrophy 
of the intestinal villi with consequent activation of 
lipolysis and production of ketone bodies (Viñuela-
Fernández et  al. 2007).
The future perspective is to evaluate surgical 
stress with lipid peroxidation and serotonin concen -
trations in order to compare surgical techniques and 
anesthetic protocols.
5.  Conclusions
In this study, the increase in MDA level was related 
to the increase in serotonin level. It was likely that 
the body, subjected to a painful stimulus induced by 
surgery, released serotonin to counteract inflamma -
tory oxidative stress. Therefore, the determination of 
serotonin levels may represent a method for objec -
tively quantifying the well-being of the surgical 
patient, and could be a biomarker for oxidative stress 
induced by surgery.
