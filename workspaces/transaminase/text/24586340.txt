Abstract
Elevated plasma concentrations of asymmetric (ADMA) and symmetric (SDMA) dimethylarginine have repeatedly been
linked to adverse clinical outcomes. Both methylarginines are substrates of alanine-glyoxylate aminotransferase 2 (AGXT2). It
was the aim of the present study to simultaneously investigate the functional relevance and relative contributions of
common AGXT2 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) to plasma and urinary concentrations of methylarginines as well as
b-aminoisobutyrate (BAIB), a prototypic substrate of AGXT2. In a cohort of 400 healthy volunteers ADMA, SDMA and BAIB
concentrations were determined in plasma and urine using HPLC-MS/MS and were related to the codingAGXT2 SNPs
rs37369 (p.Val140Ile) and rs16899974 (p.Val498Leu). Volunteers heterozygous or homozygous for theAGXT2 SNP rs37369
had higher SDMA plasma concentrations by 5% and 20% (p = 0.002) as well as higher BAIB concentrations by 54% and
146%, respectively, in plasma and 237% and 1661%, respectively, in urine (both p,0.001). ADMA concentrations were not
affected by both SNPs. A haplotype analysis revealed that the second investigatedAGXT2 SNP rs16899974, which was not
significantly linked to the otherAGXT2 SNP, further aggravates the effect of rs37369 with respect to BAIB concentrations in
plasma and urine. To investigate the impact of the amino acid exchange p.Val140Ile, we established human embryonic
kidney cell lines stably overexpressing wild-type or mutant (p.Val140Ile) AGXT2 protein and assessed enzyme activity using
BAIB and stable-isotope labeled [
2H6]-SDMA as substrate.In vitro, the amino acid exchange of the mutant protein resulted in
a significantly lower enzyme activity compared to wild-type AGXT2 (p,0.05). In silico modeling of the SNPs indicated
reduced enzyme stability and substrate binding. In conclusion, SNPs ofAGXT2 affect plasma as well as urinary BAIB and
SDMA concentrations linking methylarginine metabolism to the common genetic trait of hyper-b-aminoisobutyric aciduria.

Introduction
In various clinical studies elevated plasma concentrations of
endogenously formed symmetric (SDMA) and asymmetric
(ADMA) dimethylarginine were identified as prospective and
independent risk markers of cardiovascular diseases and mortality
[1–3]. Largely based on animal experiments, an active role in
disease progression and/or development has been suggested [4,5].
Interference with L-arginine metabolism and signaling is com-
monly considered a (if not the) key mechanism. In addition, it was
shown that both dimethylarginines compete with L-arginine for
uptake into the cell by cationic amino acid transporter 1 (CAT1)
[6] and that ADMA acts as an endogenous inhibitor of nitric oxide
synthases [7,8]. However, it has repeatedly been speculated that
the interference of methylarginines with L-arginine metabolism
and signaling may not be the only mechanism linking methylargi-
nines with human disease [9]. Elevation of methylarginine
concentrations may simply indicate structural or functional
deficiencies of the metabolizing enzyme(s) dimethylarginine
dimethylaminohydrolase (DDAH1 and DDAH2, which degrade
ADMA) and alanine-glyoxylate aminotransferase 2 (AGXT2,
which degrades ADMA and SDMA). These enzymes have further
substrates (as detailed below) [10] and may be involved in
alternative regulatory mechanisms [11]. Therefore, it is possible
(but poorly investigated, so far), that these alternative substrates

and functions may explain some of the adverse effects currently
attributed to methylarginines.
In 1986 Ogawa and coworkers [12] showed for the first time in
rats that Agxt2 metabolizes both dimethylarginines. A recent study
linked SDMA plasma concentrations in humans with polymor-
phisms within theAGXT2 gene [13]. Recently, further data were
published indicating that a knockout ofAgxt2 in mice is associated
with elevation of ADMA and SDMA plasma concentrations and
that the AGXT2 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs37369
(c.418G.A, p.Val140Ile) is associated with hypertension in
humans [14]. However, ADMA and SDMA are not the only
known substrates of AGXT2 resulting in two isomers of
(dimethylguanidino)valeric acid (DMGV and DM’GV). In 1993,
Agxt2 was found to be identical with an enzyme called ‘‘D-3-
aminoisobutyrate-pyruvate aminotransferase’’ [10].b-Aminoiso-
butyrate (BAIB), an end product of the pyrimidine metabolism, is
an additional substrate of Agxt2. This was confirmed in a genome-
wide association study published by Suhre et al. [15] linking the
coding AGXT2 SNP rs37369 with a higher urinary excretion of
BAIB (hyper-BAIB aciduria), a heritable trait which first was
described in 1951 [16].
So far, the functional role of AGXT2 has been investigated
either with a focus on methylarginines or BAIB. It was the aim of
the present study to shed more light on the interrelation of these
analytes and their metabolism by AGXT2. Furthermore, the
impact of AGXT2 SNPs on BAIB plasma concentrations was not
known. We therefore determined methylarginines and BAIB
concentrations in plasma and urine of 400 healthy volunteers and
related these to both investigated SNPs in the AGXT2 gene
(rs37369 and rs16899974: c.1492G.T, p.Val498Leu). Thein vivo
studies were complemented byin silicostudies regarding both SNPs
as well asin vitro studies for theAGXT2 SNP rs37369.
Materials and Methods
3.1 Study Protocol and Participants
The KPE19 (Klinische Pharmakologie Erlangen 19) study was
initiated, organized and performed at the Institute of Experimental
and Clinical Pharmacology and Toxicology, Friedrich-Alexander-
Universita¨t Erlangen-Nu¨rnberg (Germany). Four hundred healthy
volunteers were included in the study. The main study aim was the
identification of subjects with genetic or phenotypic variants for
subsequent pharmacogenetic and pharmacokinetic studies. The
secondary aim was the correlation of concentrations of endoge-
nous substances in blood or urine with genetic variants. The study
was approved by the Ethics committee of the Friedrich-Alexander-
Universita¨t Erlangen-Nu¨rnberg and all participants provided
written informed consent. Healthy male and female volunteers
between 18 and 60 years were eligible for inclusion. Excluded
from participation were subjects with drug or alcohol abuse,
concomitant use of medication (except for thyroid hormone
substitution or hormonal contraception), excessive alcohol or
caffeine consumption, intake of grapefruit or grapefruit juice
within the last 2 days, excessive work-out within the last 10 days,
pregnancy, a history of cancer within the last 5 years, current
relevant disease, impaired kidney or liver function, blood loss$
400 ml within the last 21 days or participants dependent on one of
the investigators. A physician took a complete medical history
from each participant. The mean6SD/median (25–75% percen-
tile) fasting time prior to blood and urine sampling was 5.765.1/
3.0 (2.0–11.0) h, respectively. Blood samples for DNA extraction
were available from 400 subjects and were stored at220uC until
extraction. Plasma and serum samples were available from 395
and 390 subjects, respectively, and were stored at220uC until
analysis. Mid-stream urine was stored at 280uC until analysis.
Urine samples were available from 400 subjects.
3.2 Chemicals
[2H7]-Labeled ADMA hydrochloride und [ 2H7]-labeled L-
arginine hydrochloride were obtained from EURISO-TOP (Saint-
Aubin, France). The isotope labeled BAIB standard ([
2H6]-BAIB)
was a kind gift of Dr. Ute Hofmann (Dr. Margarete Fischer-Bosch-
Institute of Clinical Pharmacology, Stuttgart, Germany) [17]. The
isotope labeled SDMA ([2H6]-SDMA) was obtained from Toronto
Research Chemicals Inc. (Toronto, Canada). ADMA dihydro-
chloride and SDMA dihydrochloride were purchased from Enzo
Life Sciences GmbH (Lo ¨rrach, Germany). L-Arginine was
purchased from Sigma-Aldrich Chemie GmbH (Steinheim,
Germany). Acetonitrile hypergrade for LC-MS and SUPRAPURH
formic acid (98%) were obtained from Merck (Darmstadt,
Germany), and Baker Analyzed LC-MS-Reagent Water was from
Mallinckrodt Baker B.V. (Deventer, Netherland). The AGXT2-
dependent metabolite DM’GV was synthesized as described in
detail in the figure S1.
3.3 Measurement of AGXT2 Substrate Concentrations via
HPLC-MS/MS
L-Arginine, L-ADMA and L-SDMA concentrations were
measured in plasma and urine of volunteers by HPLC-MS/MS
(Agilent 1100 HPLC System [Agilent Technologies, Waldbronn,
Germany]; API 4000 mass spectrometer [Applied Biosystems,
Darmstadt, Germany]) as previously described with minor
modifications [18,19]. Separation was performed by using an
EC 100/2 NUCLEOSHELL HILIC 2.7
mm column (Machery-
Nagel, Du¨ren, Germany). BAIB was measured in plasma and
urine of volunteers as well as human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK)
cell lysates by HPLC-MS/MS as previously described [20].
Creatinine measurement was performed at the central laboratory
of Erlangen university hospital by use of the modified Jaffe ´
method.
Peak area of [
2H6]-DM’GV and DM’GV was determined by
means of HPLC-MS/MS. For sample preparation a solution of
approximately 10 mmol/L DM’GV was prepared in acetonitrile.
50 ml of this solution was mixed with 20ml of the sample and 2ml
water. After centrifugation the supernatant was diluted 1:10 with
the eluent (20% water, 80% acetonitrile, 0.05% ammonium
formiate; pH 4). Injection volume was 50
ml. For separation an
EC 100/2 NUCLEODUR HILIC 2.7 mm column (Macherey-
Nagel) combined with a guard column (EC4/2) was used.
Chromatography was carried out isocratically at a flow rate of
0.4 ml/min. The mass transitions were m/z 202.1 to 71.10 for
DM’GV and m/z 208.10 to 77.10 for [
2H6]-DM’GV. The results
were approved by the qualifiers m/z 202.1 to 70.10 for DM’GV
and 208.10 to 70.10 for [
2H6]-DM’GV.
3.4 Genotyping ofAGXT2 SNPs via TaqMan-based Real-
time PCR Assay
DNA was extracted using the chemagic DNA Blood Kit
(Chemagen Chemie, Baesweiler, Germany) according to the
manufacturer’s instructions by the Institute of Human Genetics,
Erlangen university hospital. Both probes for genotyping (rs37369
and rs16899974) were purchased from Applied Biosystems
(Darmstadt, Germany). Quantitative real-time PCR was carried
out using the ABI 7900HT system from Applied Biosystems
according to the manufacturer’s instructions. For each sample
20 ng DNA was added to 3
ml of Taqman GTXpress MasterMix
(Applied Biosystems), 1.85 ml RNase-free water and 0.15 ml

Impact of AGXT2 Polymorphisms in Healthy Humans
TaqMan probe (406). The cycle conditions for PCR were 95uC
for 5 min, followed by 45 cycles of 95uC for 15 s and 60uC for
30 s.
3.5 Generation of Human Embryonic Kidney 293 Cell
Lines Stably Overexpressing Human Wild-type and
Mutant AGXT2
The humanAGXT2 cDNA (NM_031900) was cloned by a RT-
PCR-based approach using kidney total RNA (ClonTech,
Heidelberg, Germany) as template for single-strand cDNA
synthesis via iScript Select cDNA Synthesis Kit (Bio-Rad, Munich,
Germany). For amplification of full-length AGXT2 cDNA, the
following primer pair was used: forward 59-TGA GTG GGA
GAA ATG ACT CTA AT-39 and reverse 59-CTG ACA ATG
TTA CTT AGC TCT TC-39. The amplified fragment was cloned
into the pCR2.1-TOPO vector via TOPO TA PCR Cloning Kit
(Invitrogen, Karlsruhe, Germany) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions.
Following sequencing by AGOWA (Berlin, Germany), base pair
exchanges in comparison to the reference sequence (NM_031900)
resulting in amino acid exchanges were corrected using the
QuikChange Multi Site Directed Mutagenesis Kit (Agilent
Technologies, Waldbronn, Germany). The corrected cDNA was
subcloned into the expression vector pcDNA3.1(+) leading to the
plasmid pAGXT2-WT.31. This plasmid was also used for cloning
the mutant AGXT2 cDNA containing the single-nucleotide
polymorphism rs37369 (NM_031900.3). For the base pair
exchange (c.418G .A) the QuikChange Multi Site Directed
Mutagenesis Kit (Agilent Technologies, Waldbronn, Germany)
was used leading to the plasmid pAGXT2-MUTrs37369.
Correctness and orientation of the wild-type and mutant cDNA
were verified by sequencing (AGOWA, Berlin, Germany).
HEK cells were then stably transfected with the empty
expression vector pcDNA3.1( +) as control and with the two
cloned plasmids pAGXT2-WT.31 and pAGXT2-MUTrs37369
using the Effectene Transfection Reagent Kit according to the
manufacturer’s instructions (QIAGEN, Hilden, Germany).
AGXT2 expression was determined in all three cell lines (HEK
VC as vector control, HEK AGXT2 WT and HEK AGXT2
rs37369) using immunoblot analysis and immunofluorescence.
3.6 Immunoblot Analysis
For determination of AGXT2 protein expression in HEK cells
(VC, AGXT2 WT and AGXT2 rs37369) immunoblot analysis
was performed as described before with minor modifications [20].
Samples (5–20 mg of total protein) of cell lysates were prepared
and separated by SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions on 10%
polyacrylamide gels. Proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose
membranes (Protran Nitrocellulose Transfer Membrane; What-
man, Dassel, Germany) using a tank blotting system from Bio-Rad
(Munich, Germany) and probed with a rabbit polyclonal anti-
human AGXT2 antibody (HPA037382; Sigma-Aldrich, Munich,
Germany) at a dilution of 1:500. For detection a horseradish
peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibody (Sigma Aldrich,
Munich, Germany) was used at a dilution of 1:10000 and
immunoreactive bands were visualized using ECL Western
Blotting Detection Reagents from Amersham (GE Healthcare,
Buckinghamshire, UK) and a Chemidoc XRS imaging system
(Bio-Rad, Munich, Germany). To control sample loading,
membranes were stripped and reprobed with a mouse monoclonal
anti-human b-actin antibody (Sigma Aldrich, Munich, Germany)
at a dilution of 1:500. As secondary antibody a horseradish
peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse antibody (Dianova, Ham-
burg, Germany) was used at a dilution of 1:10000.
To compare protein expression of AGXT2 between the cell
lines a densitometric analysis was performed. After detection of
AGXT2 andb-actin via immunoblot analysis the density average
of every band was calculated using the Quantity One Software
(Bio-Rad, Munich, Germany). The AGXT2 protein expression
was normalized tob-actin. To figure out which concentration of
the cell lysates results in the best signal for AGXT2 andb-actin
within the linear detection range, different amounts of lysates
(1
mg, 2.5mg, 5mg, 7.5mg, 10mg and 12.5mg) of an overexpress-
ing cell line were also separated by SDS-PAGE. Investigation of
the immunoreactive bands after immunoblot analysis and creation
of a calibration curve (total protein concentration versus density
average of every band) indicated that the loading of 5mg total
protein of the cell lysates results in the best signal for AGXT2 as
well as b-actin.
3.7 Immunofluorescence Microscopy
Expression and cellular localization of AGXT2 was analyzed in
HEK cells (VC, AGXT2 WT and AGXT2 rs37369) using
immunofluorescence staining. Cells were seeded and grown on
coverslips (46105 cells/coverslip) placed in cell culture plates.
AGXT2 expression was induced 24 h after seeding with 10 mM
sodium butyrate. After additional 24 h cells were incubated with
50 nM MitoTracker Red CMXRos (Molecular Probes, Eugene,
OR, USA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The
human AGXT2 protein was detected using a rabbit polyclonal
anti-human antibody (HPA037382; Sigma-Aldrich, Munich,
Germany) at a dilution of 1:400 followed by incubation with an
Alexa Fluor 488 conjugated secondary antibody (Molecular
Probes, Eugene, OR, USA) at a dilution of 1:1000. For
visualization the confocal microscope Axiovert 100 M (Carl Zeiss,
Jena, Germany) and the Zeiss LSM Image Browser version
4.2.0.121 were used.
3.8 Enzyme Activity Assay
Cells were cultured as previously described [6]. Assays were
performed on HEK cell lysates to measure differences between
wild-type and mutant AGXT2 enzyme activity. Cells were grown
in minimal essential medium (MEM) containing 10% heat-
inactivated fetal bovine serum, 500mg/ml geneticin, 100 U/ml
penicillin and 100mg/ml streptomycin at 37uC and 5% CO2. All
cell culture supplements were purchased from Invitrogen (Karls-
ruhe, Germany). After 24 h AGXT2 expression was induced by
10 mM sodium butyrate and cells were incubated for additional
24 h. Cells were detached using trypsin (0.05%)-EDTA (0.02%),
washed with PBS and resuspended in PBS containing 1 mM
sodium pyruvate and 1 mM sodium glyoxylate as amino group
acceptor, 0.1 mM pyridoxal-phosphate as co-factor for activation
and 15 mM Tris buffer (pH 9.0). Cells were kept on ice and lysed
via sonification (Sonifier B-12, Branson Sonic Power Company,
Danbury, CT, USA). Protein concentrations of cell lysates were
determined using a standard assay (BCA Protein Assay Reagent;
Rockford, USA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. To
samples of 1mg/ml protein 100mM D,L-BAIB or 0.5mM[ 2H6]-
SDMA was added in a volume of 500ml. Half of each sample
(baseline of [2H6]-SDMA, [2H6]-DM’GV and D,L-BAIB concen-
trations) was heated at 95uC for 5 min to stop enzyme activity and
stored at 220uC. The other half of each sample was incubated
over night at 37uC and 500 rpm for 12 h, then heated at 95uC for
5 min and stored at220uC. In each sample D,L-BAIB or [2H6]-
SDMA and [2H6]-DM’GV concentrations were determined using
HPLC-MS/MS.

3.9 In silico Modeling of the 3D Structures of theAGXT2
Variants V140I (rs37369) and V498L (rs16899974)
The three-dimensional structure of AGXT2 was modeled based
on the crystal structure of the homologous dialkylglycine
decarboxylase (PDB code 1D7S) [21] using the program Modeller
9.9 [22]. The resulting model of the structure of wild-type AGXT2
exhibited a good local geometry and no steric hindrance. The
V140I and V498L mutations were introduced into the structure
using the program DeepView [23] by selecting the lowest-energy
side chain rotamer. Clashes in the protein were analyzed with
WhatCheck [24], and RasMol [25] was used for graphical
presentation.
3.10 Statistical Analysis
Significant differences between analyte concentrations deter-
mined in plasma and urine of volunteers and different genotypes
were analyzed by Kruskal-Wallis test (Dunn’s post-test) and
Jonckheere-Terpstra trend-test. Independence and interactions of
AGXT2 rs37369 and rs16899974 with respect to plasma and
urinary concentrations of the analytes were analyzed by two-way
ANOVA using log transformed data. When a two-way ANOVA
identified both SNPs as significant corresponding nested ANOVAs
were calculated to assess the effect of a SNP in the respective
subgroups of the other SNP (to adjust for repeated testing in this
case the significance level was lowered to,0.025 for the analysis
of the subgroups). For correlation between ADMA, SDMA, BAIB
and creatinine concentrations Spearman’s test was used. Com-
parison of AGXT2 expression and enzyme activity was performed
using the unpaired 2-tailed Student’s t test. Unless stated
otherwise, statistical significance was defined as a p value,0.05.
Values are reported as mean 6SD and/or median (25–75%
percentile). For the calculations, Prism 5 software (ver. 5.00 for
Windows; GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA), STATA 12
(StataCorp LP, TX, USA) and SPSS Statistics (ver. 21; IBM,
Ehningen, Germany) were used as appropriate. Linkage disequi-
librium between AGXT2 rs37369 and rs16899974 was analyzed
via Haploview 4.2 (Broad Institute, Cambridge, MA, USA).

4.2 AGXT2 SNPs - genotypes and Biochemical Correlates
Genotyping of the 400 KPE19 volunteers for theAGXT2 SNP
rs37369 (c.418G .A, p.Val140Ile) revealed a minor allele
frequency (MAF) of 0.07 (table 3 and table S1). The AGXT2
SNP rs37369 was associated with significantly higher plasma
SDMA as well as plasma and urinary BAIB concentrations (table 3
and figure 1). Plasma SDMA concentrations were higher by 5%
and 20% (Kruskal-Wallis test: p = 0.002), respectively, in volun-
teers heterozygous or homozygous for the minor allele of the
AGXT2 SNP rs37369, while the urinary SDMA concentrations
were not significantly different. BAIB concentrations were higher
by 54% and 146%, respectively, in plasma and by 237% and
1661%, respectively, in urine of volunteers heterozygous or
homozygous for the minor allele (Kruskal-Wallis test: both p,
0.001). Plasma and urinary concentrations of ADMA and L-
arginine were not significantly affected by this SNP (table 3).

Genotyping of the AGXT2 SNP rs16899974 (c.1492G .T;
p.Val498Leu) revealed a MAF of 0.22 (table 3 and table S1). In
subjects heterozygous or homozygous for the minor allele BAIB
concentrations were significantly higher by 19% and 47%,
respectively, in plasma and by 40% and 166%, respectively, in
urine (Kruskal-Wallis test: both p,0.001; table 3 and figure 1).
However, the amino acid exchange p.Val498Leu was not
associated with differences in plasma or urinary SDMA (table 3
and figure 1), ADMA or L-arginine concentrations (table 3).
4.3 AGXT2 Haplotype Analysis and Additive Effects of the
SNPs
For both AGXT2 SNPs, allele frequencies did not significantly
deviate from the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (rs37369x2 = 2.21
[p,0.05]; rs16899974 x2 = 0.34 [p,0.05]). Haplotype analysis
revealed also that bothAGXT2 SNPs, which have a distance of
approximately 38 kbp on chromosome 5, are not significantly
linked to each other (D’: 0.311; LOD: 2.20; r
2:0.026). This result
was similar to the data of the International HapMap Project (D’:
0.452; LOD: 3.02; r2:0.072) based on the analysis of the CEU
panel (Utah residents with Northern and Western European
ancestry from the CEPH [Centre d’Etude du Polymorphisme
Humain] collection).
Our data indicate an independent and additive effect of both
AGXT2 SNPs with respect of accumulation of BAIB in plasma and
urine. In two-way ANOVA models of log-transformed data both
SNPs were independently associated with BAIB concentrations
while the rs37369*rs16899974 interaction term was not significant
(p,0.001, p = 0.0198 and p = 0.665, respectively, for rs37369,
rs16899974 and the rs37369*rs16899974 interaction for BAIB in
plasma, and p,0.001, p,0.001 and p = 0.376, respectively, for
rs37369, rs16899974 and the rs37369*rs16899974 interaction for
creatinine-indexed BAIB in urine). The increase of the number of
minor alleles of either AGXT2 SNP resulted in additional and
significant accumulation of BAIB in plasma and urine (table 4).
For SDMA only rs37369 was retained as significant in the two-way
analyses. The two-way models for ADMA and L-arginine were not
significant for either SNP.
4.4 Correlation of ADMA, SDMA, BAIB and Creatinine
Concentrations
In blood as well as in urine, SDMA concentrations were
strongly and positively correlated to BAIB and creatinine
concentrations (table 5). In case of plasma and urinary ADMA
concentrations, the correlation with BAIB concentrations in
plasma and urine was weaker but still significant, while no
significant correlation was observed for plasma ADMA and
creatinine concentrations in serum or urine.
4.5 In vitro Evidence that AGXT2 rs37369 Results in
Reduced Enzyme Activity
Cell lines stably overexpressing wild-type and mutant AGXT2
protein were established to determine functional consequences of
the amino acid exchange p.Val140Ile resulting fromAGXT2 SNP
rs37369, which was associated with the largest differences in BAIB
and SDMA plasma concentrations in vivo. Immunoblot analysis
confirmed that protein expression of cell lines overexpressing wild-
type or mutant protein (p.Val140Ile) was similar to each other
(arbitrary units: 9.760.2 versus 10.561.2, respectively, normal-
ized to b-actin expression; p .0.05) as shown in figure 2A.
Immunofluorescence analysis indicated intracellular localization of
AGXT2 to mitochondria [26] in both cell lines (figure 2B). Cells
transfected with the empty vector were used as negative control.
In order to assess the enzyme activity, samples of cell lysates
from HEK cells overexpressing wild-type AGXT2, mutant
AGXT2 or the empty vector were incubated with BAIB or
[2H6]-SDMA. In preliminary experiments lysates of cells trans-
fected with the empty vector indicated almost no enzyme activity
with regard to the degradation of BAIB or [2H6]-SDMA as well as
the formation of the AGXT2-dependent metabolite [ 2H6]-
DM’GV compared to lysates of cells overexpressing wild-type
AGXT2.
When comparing activity of wild-type and mutant AGXT2 a
significant reduction of enzyme activity was observed (figure 2C–
E). Degradation of the AGXT2 substrate [2H6]-SDMA (figure 2C)
and formation of the metabolite [2H6]-DM’GV (figure 2D) were
significantly reduced by 20% (t test: p,0.05) and 16% (t test: p,
0.001), respectively, in lysates of cells overexpressing mutant
protein compared to wild-type. Moreover, degradation of BAIB
was decreased by 43% as compared to wild type enzyme (figure 2E,
t test: p,0.05).
4.6 In silico Modeling of AGXT2 SNPs Revealed Reduced
AGXT2 Stability and Substrate Binding
To find a structural explanation of the experimentally observed
effects of the V140I ( AGXT2 rs37369) and V498L ( AGXT2
rs16899974) mutations, 3D molecular models were constructed for
wild-type and mutant AGTX2. Residue 140 is located in a loop of
the protein that is close to the substrate binding site (figure 3A). In
the wild-type protein, this residue forms tight interactions with an
adjacent glutamine (Q83) of the second subunit. Due to the larger
side chain in the V140I mutant, clashes are observed between I140
and Q83 (figure 3B). This I140-Q83 clash is predicted to have an
effect on dimer stability and on substrate access to the active site
and thereby offers an explanation for the experimentally observed
reduced enzymatic activity.
V498 is located in a helix in the C-terminal part of AGXT2
(figure 3C). As a consequence of the V498L mutation, the larger
L498 side chain forms steric clashes with the methylene groups of
the K417 side chain. This is expected to result in local structural
rearrangement and might also cause a decreased stability of the
enzyme. In line with its location far apart from the active site, the
experimentally observed changes in enzymatic activity are less
pronounced than those detected for the V140I mutation.
Discussion
Based on data from 400 healthy volunteers as well asin vitro and
in silicoexperiments the present study provides strong evidence that

metabolism of SDMA and BAIB is intra-individually affected by
the same coding SNPs of AGXT2 which underlie the common
metabolic trait of hyper-b-aminoisobutyric aciduria.
In 2011 an association of theAGXT2 SNP rs37369 with plasma
SDMA concentrations [27] and urinary BAIB excretion [15,28]
was noted in three independent genome-wide association studies
(GWAS)-based investigations. Furthermore, during finalization of
this manuscript another codingAGXT2 SNP (rs37370) was linked
to elevated plasma BAIB concentrations in the Framingham Heart
Study (FHS) [29] and some years ago to elevated urinary BAIB
concentrations in a human metabolome study [28] indicating that
AGXT2 SNPs can result in BAIB accumulation. The present study
now connects and extends these different lines of evidence by
showing that SDMA and BAIB metabolism are intra-individually
linked to the same amino acid exchange (p.Val140Ile) in the
AGXT2 protein which results in decreased enzyme activity. In

several cohorts it could be demonstrated that 40% of the Asian
population are high BAIB excretors with an underlying genetic
background [30,31]. Given the similar prevalence ofAGXT2 SNP
rs37369 in several Asian populations (MAF: 0.57) we propose that
this SNP is responsible for the BAIB accumulation [10]. In
addition we show that a secondAGXT2 SNP (rs16899974) may
aggravate the effect of rs37369. The additive effect on BAIB
concentrations, the different MAF as well as haplotype analysis
indicate that the two polymorphisms seem not to be linked to each
other as haplotype. In a previous study Kontani and colleagues
[10] determined a 50-fold lower Km value of rat Agxt2 using BAIB
as substrate compared to SDMA. The clear accumulation of BAIB
in plasma (146%) and urine (1661%) associated with theAGXT2
SNP rs37369 suggests that in humans BAIB is mainly metabolized
by AGXT2. If AGXT2 is indeed the main enzyme in degrading
BAIB and possesses high affinity to BAIB as substrate, elevated
BAIB concentrations could function as a good indicator for
AGXT2 enzyme activity.
It has been speculated that SDMA could serve as a sensitive
marker of renal function as its plasma concentrations increases in a
similar fashion as serum creatinine when renal function is
impaired [7,32]. Our data indeed show a strong correlation of
plasma SDMA and creatinine in relatively young healthy
volunteers which is comparable to that previously observed in
older adults [33]. Impaired renal function is a well established risk
factor for cardiovascular events and total mortality. Therefore, it
was and is tempting to attribute the association of SDMA and
mortality to the fact that SDMA simply serves as an indicator of
impaired renal function. This cannot explain, however, why
SDMA remains a predictor of mortality when adjusting for renal
function [34,35]. It is possible that SDMA itself can act as an
uremic toxin via inhibition of L-arginine uptake [6] or activation
of store-operated Ca
2+-channels [36]. Here, the present data
indicate that metabolism of SDMA may not be as negligible as
frequently assumed. Especially, when renal function is within the
healthy range common AGXT2 SNPs should be taken into
account, too. This brings the attention to the fact that AGXT2 has
several other substrates besides SDMA including BAIB. Particu-
larly the link to hyper-BAIB aciduria may offer alternative
explanations for the association of SDMA and mortality. The
long term prognostic significance of hyper-BAIB aciduria and the
corresponding AGXT2 SNPs is currently under investigation.
Caplin et al. [14] observed elevated ADMA and SDMA plasma
concentrations in Agxt2 deficient mice. We could show that BAIB
infusion inhibits AGXT2-mediated degradation of SDMA and
ADMA in mice [20]. However, in contrast to the studies in rodents
[12,14,20] and patients with kidney transplants [14] our data
suggest that in healthy humans the impact of AGXT2 activity on
plasma concentrations may be more limited for ADMA than for
SDMA. This may be explained by the fact that ADMA (in contrast
to SDMA) can also be metabolized by DDAH1 which may be able
to compensate deficient metabolism by AGXT2. However, the
significant correlation of ADMA and BAIB we observed in plasma
and urine still suggests shared routes of elimination (i.e.
metabolism and transport). This finding may be of relevance for
the interpretation of recent GWAS data showing an association of
AGXT2 and hypertension [14] as well as heart rate variability
[37]. Caplin et al. [14] also reported that Agxt2 KO mice are
associated with a significant increase in blood pressure (,50%)
suggesting a possible role for AGXT2 in cardiovascular diseases.
Relying on the observations in mice the association was largely
attributed to a possible impact of the AGXT2 SNP as data on
plasma concentrations of ADMA and SDMA were not available
for that study. Based on the data of the current study ADMA-
related impairment of nitric oxide synthases has become an
unlikely (but still not impossible) explanation and alternative
AGXT2 substrates should be explored as possible mediators of
hypertension associated withAGXT2 SNPs.
Very recent GWAS data connecting AGXT2 SNPs to homo-
arginine serum concentrations [38] may offer yet another
explanation as homoarginine has been identified as an indepen-
dent risk marker for mortality, which may also be related to NO
generation. However, in our cohort we did not observe any
significant association ofAGXT2 SNPs with homoarginine plasma
concentrations (data not shown).
In conclusion, this study shows for the first time that theAGXT2
SNP rs37369 (p.Val140Ile), which results in hyper-BAIB aciduria,
is associated with elevated plasma concentrations of BAIB and
SDMA in healthy humans. Considering that plasma SDMA
concentrations are linked to adverse events in cardiovascular
diseases and renal failure polymorphisms within theAGXT2 gene
could have further implications in disease progression and require
further investigations.
