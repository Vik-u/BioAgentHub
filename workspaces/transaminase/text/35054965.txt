Abstract: Amine transaminases (ATAs) are pyridoxal-5′-phosphate (PLP)-dependent enzymes that
catalyze the transfer of an amino group from an amino donor to an aldehyde and/or ketone. In the
past decade, the enzymatic reductive amination of prochiral ketones catalyzed by ATAs has attracted
the attention of researchers, and more traditional chemical routes were replaced by enzymatic ones in
industrial manufacturing. In the present work, the inﬂuence of the presence of an α,β-unsaturated
system in a methylketone model substrate was investigated, using a set of ﬁve wild-type ATAs,
the (R)-selective from Aspergillus terreus (Atr-TA) and Mycobacterium vanbaalenii (Mva-TA), the (S)-
selective from Chromobacterium violaceum (Cvi-TA), Ruegeria pomeroyi (Rpo-TA), V . ﬂuvialis(Vﬂ-TA)
and an engineered variant of V . ﬂuvialis(ATA-256 from Codexis). The high conversion rate (80
to 99%) and optical purity (78 to 99% ee) of both ( R)- and ( S)-ATAs for the substrate 1-phenyl-3-
butanone, using isopropylamine (IPA) as an amino donor, were observed. However, the double bond
in the α,β-position of 4-phenylbut-3-en-2-one dramatically reduced wild-type ATA reactivity, leading
to conversions of <10% (without affecting the enantioselectivity). In contrast, the commercially
engineered V . ﬂuvialisvariant, ATA-256, still enabled an 87% conversion, yielding a corresponding
amine with >99% ee. Computational docking simulations showed the differences in orientation
and intermolecular interactions in the active sites, providing insights to rationalize the observed
experimental results.

1. Introduction
Optically pure amines and their derivatives play an important role in the chemical,
agrochemical, and pharmaceutical industries, being key building blocks for the synthesis
of pharmaceuticals and pesticides [ 1–4]. Their synthesis through classical approaches
generally employs transition metal catalysis, which should be avoided, if possible, due
to the scarcity of the metal resources and their toxicity [ 5]. An alternative for metal-
catalysis is biocatalysis, using enzymes for chemical transformations [6]. This approach
is advantageous since enzymes generally act under mild reaction conditions, typically
display high chemo-, regio- and stereoselectivity, originate from renewable resources, and
are biocompatible, biodegradable, and rarely present toxicity [5,7,8].
Among the biocatalytic approaches to synthesizing optically pure amines, one very
attractive option is the use of amine transaminases (ATAs). These enzymes are pyridoxal-5′-
phosphate (PLP)-dependent enzymes and belong to the PLP-fold classes I and IV [9]. They

catalyze the transfer of an amino group from an amine donor to an aldehyde or ketone
and can be (R)- or (S)-selective [10–12]. The reaction can be classiﬁed as a neutral redox
reaction, consisting of two half-reactions: the ﬁrst step is an oxidative deamination of the
amino donor, converting the PLP9—bound in the active site of the enzyme—to its reduced
form, PMP , followed by the reductive amination of the amino acceptor, when the PMP is
again oxidized to PLP [11,12]. As the cofactor is regenerated, it is required only in catalytic
amounts [13].
Amine transaminases can be employed in the synthesis of chiral amines through the
kinetic resolution of a racemic mixture of amines, asymmetric synthesis using prochiral
ketones, or via the deracemization of racemic amines [14]. Herein, we focused on the asym-
metric synthesis of chiral amines, which can achieve a theoretical yield of 100%. One major
drawback of this methodology is the thermodynamically disadvantageous equilibrium
of the reaction [15]. For ideal asymmetric synthesis, amino donors and acceptors must be
more reactive than their respective co-products, thus making the reaction equilibrium more
favorable. In addition, the use of an excess of an amino donor is perhaps the easiest way to
shift the equilibrium toward product formation [12–14]. In the last few decades, a number
of academic and industrial examples using ATAs for chiral amine production have been
reported in the literature [16–23].
Nevertheless, there is no general rule for substrate acceptance by the transaminases
and, sometimes, even small differences in the chemical structure of the substrate, such as
the presence or absence of an α,β-unsaturation adjacent to the carbonyl function, can lead
to different enzymatic reactivities [24]. Therefore, better comprehension of the relationship
of substrate structure and enzyme interaction is helpful and necessary when planning
synthetic routes.
In this paper, we aim to contribute to the understanding of the substrate scope of
some (R)- and (S)-selective wild-type ATAs, and an (S)-selective engineered amine transam-
inase variant toward the asymmetric synthesis of chiral amines, using a conformationally
restricted α,β-unsaturated model ketone and its saturated analog, via experimental and
docking approaches.
2. Results and Discussion
Initially, 4-phenylbutan-2-one (1a) was employed as a model substrate and isopropy-
lamine (IPA) was chosen as an amino donor since moderate yields for this transformation
have been already reported [24]. Different (S)- and (R)-selective enzymes were chosen and
analyzed for conversion and enantiomeric excess (Table 1).
The transamination reaction, using 1a as a substrate mediated by Chromobacterium
violaceum ATA, led to good conversions and excellent selectivity (Entry 1, Table 1). A
similar approach has been reported by Kroutil and co-workers, using L-Ala as an amino
donor, achieving poor to good conversions (16% and 86%) depending on the recycling
system, respectively, LDH/GDH and AlaDH/FDH, without affecting the enantiomeric
excess (~50% ee) [25]. Reports of the R. pomeroyi ATA reaction in the presence of IPA
afforded the desired product in moderate yields (67 to 75%), as shown by Bornscheuer
and co-workers [26] but, under the conditions studied herein, complete conversion and
enantiomeric excess of > 99% ee could be achieved (Entry 2, Table 1).
The (R)-selective transaminase from Aspergillus terreus (Entry 3, Table 1) has also been
investigated by several groups, always delivering very good selectivity (> 99% ee) for the
desired transformation but with poor conversion results when IPA was used as the amino
donor (46%), as reported by Strohmeier and co-workers [27]. Another (R)-selective ATA
from Mycobacterium vanbaaleni was also evaluated (Entry 4, Table 1) and, to the best of our
knowledge, there are no previous reports on the reaction between 1a and IPA as an amino
donor. The work of Bornscheuer and co-workers is the only one to evaluate its reactivity
when D-Ala was used as the amino donor, with an LDH/GDH recycling system [28]. It
is worth mentioning that the use of (R)-selective transaminases is far less prevalent than
Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2022, 23, 777 3 of 12
using the (S)-selective ones and it is of the utmost importance to identify novel (R)-selective
transaminase to produce optically pure enantio-complementary amine compounds [29,30].
The V . ﬂuvialistransaminase has also been used with moderate results in terms of
conversion and selectivity but only when using L-Ala as the amino donor; in our case, the
use of IPA as the amino donor led to the desired chiral amine with good conversions and
selectivity (Entry 5, Table 1) [31–33]. The ATA-256 from Codexis is an engineered variant
of V . ﬂuvialisthat has ﬁve mutations [34]. Results in terms of conversion, when using IPA
as the amino donor and compound 1a with ATA-256, were the same compared to the V .
ﬂuvialis wild-type enzyme; however, enantioselectivity with the engineered enzyme was
signiﬁcantly higher (Entry 6, Table 1). To the best of our knowledge, there are no data in
the literature regarding the use of ATA-256 to convert1a.

Conditions: 20 mM 1a, 300 mM IPA, 1% DMSO, 1 mM PLP , 1.5 mL crude cell lysate, 30◦C, 24 h. Conversions were
determined via gas chromatography (GC-FID). The enantiomeric excess was determined via chiral GC analysis
using a Hydrodex® β-3P column (25 m ×0.25 mm ×0.25 µm; Macherey-Nagel). The ‘*’ represents an asymmetric
carbon which its absolute conﬁguration could be R or S depending on the used enzyme.
Taking a closer look at the literature, searching for similar substrates to 1a, it is
interesting to note that most substrates have saturated alkyl chains; the only exception
is the planar 4-phenylbut-3-yn-2-one, for which good results have been reported using
the (S)-selective Chromobacterium violaceum transaminase [35]. The α,β-unsaturated ketone
4-phenylbut-3-en-2-one (2a) has been studied by Gotor-Fernandez and co-workers, where
moderate to good conversions and optical purity could be obtained only with commercially
available Codexis enzymes, such as the ( R)-selective ATA-024, ATA-033 and ATA-415
and the (S)-selective ATA-254, ATA-256 and ATA-260 [36]. The fact that the reaction of
the α,β-unsaturated ketone (E)-4-phenylbut-3-en-2-one (2a) as a substrate and IPA as an
amino donor, catalyzed by Chromobacterium violaceum, Arthrobacter citreus, and Arthrobacter
sp. wild-type transaminases, resulted in conversions of <1%, and that some genetically
modiﬁed (R)- and (S)-selective transaminases resulted in conversions ranging from 24 to
57% and an optical purity varying from 84 to >99% ee, has drawn our attention [ 36–38].
Thus, we decided to evaluate the ability of the abovementioned enzymes concerning the
transaminase reaction between (E)-4-phenylbut-3-en-2-one (2a) and IPA as an amino donor
regarding the synthesis of this unsaturated chiral amine (Table 2).

The ﬁrst experiments, where C. violaceum, R. pomeroyi, A. terreus, M. vanbaalenii and
V . ﬂuvialiswere used, reminded us of the unsatisfactory results for the desired substrate
when using wild-type transaminases. Conversions were poor, although they did have
excellent selectivity. As reported by Gotor-Fernandez and co-workers, the ATA-256 from
Codexis was the best transaminase capable of converting 4-phenylbut-3-en-2-one (2a) into
the desired chiral amine ( 2b) with a reasonable conversion rate [ 36]. The difference in
reactivity of this α,β-unsaturated ketone has drawn our attention, to try to understand
what the differences in the active site of the ATAs could be that could drive the reaction in
the direction of chiral amine synthesis.
Modeling studies were carried out, with a two-fold objective: ﬁrst, to evaluate possible
structural differences favoring the conversion of 2a (Figure 1B) when using wild-type (S)-
and (R)-selective transaminases; second, to characterize and compare the ligand-protein
interactions of 2a, with a homology model of ATA-256 and its respective template fromV .
ﬂuvialis (PDB code 4E3Q) (Figure 1C,D).
Molecular docking runs were performed to study the binding mode of the considered
compounds in the active site of the transaminases. Figure 1 shows a comparison of binding
modes of compound 2a in V . ﬂuvialisand ATA-256; both are ( S)-selective enzymes. It
is important to note that ATA-256 has ﬁve amino acid mutations, leading to signiﬁcant
changes in the binding site (Figure 1B). The hydrophobic amino acids, V153 and A323,
from V . ﬂuvialisare replaced by polar amino acids in ATA-256 (S153 and T323); charged and
polar amino acids (K163 and S284) are replaced by hydrophobic residues (L163 and A284).
We hypothesize that these changes in amino acid properties are the main ones responsible
for the different recognition by ATA-256. Compound 2a seems to bind to ATA-256 in an
orientation that favors the reaction, with a relatively small distance to the nitrogen atom of
K285 (2.5 Å). For the wild-type protein, this distance is about 4.0 Å.
Furthermore, the interactions between this compound and the amino acids of the active
site of ATA-256 seem to be more complementary, compared to the wild-type interactions.
More speciﬁcally, 2a can make more hydrogen bonds and Van der Waals interactions with
ATA-256 compared to the wild-type form ofV . ﬂuvialis(Figure 1B,C and Supplementary
Table S3). With the Cvi-ATA, substrate2a showed no conversion to the respective amine,
whereas its structural analog 1a resulted in an 80% conversion. This difference in the
conversion of 2a in relation to 1a may indicate that the presence of the double bond had
a negative inﬂuence on the activity of this enzyme. The best pose of molecular docking
Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2022, 23, 777 5 of 12
showed that compound 2a had fewer hydrogen-bond interactions with the binding site
compared to compound 1a (Figure 2A and Supplementary Table S4), probably due to the
decrease in ﬂexibility of the molecule promoted by the double bond.

3. Materials and Methods
3.1. Materials
The ketones 4-phenylbutan-2-one and (E)-4-phenylbut-3-en-2-one, titanium (IV) iso-
propoxide, ammonia solution 2.0 M in ethanol, pyridoxal 5 ′-phosphate hydrate, and
isopropylamine are commercially available from Sigma–Aldrich®, Saint Louis, MO, USA.
Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectra were recorded on a Bruker Fourier 300 (B0
7.1 T) spectrometer, at operating frequencies of 75 MHz for 13C NMR- and 300 MHz for 1H
NMR-spectroscopy. The chemical shifts (δ) are reported in parts per million (ppm), using,
as an internal reference, tetramethylsilane (TMS, δ= 0.0) and, in the scale relative to CDCl3,
7.24 ppm for 1H NMR and 77.23 for 13C NMR. The coupling constants (J) were measured
in Hertz (Hz) and were characterized as doublet (d), double doublet (dd), multiplet (m),
singlet (s), broad singlet (bs), sextet (st), and triplet (t).
Infrared (IR) spectra were recorded on an FTIR spectrophotometer (Vertex 70—Bruker),
equipped with attenuated total reﬂectance (ATR), operating at 400–4000 cm−1.
3.2. Analytical Methods
For puriﬁcation by dry silica chromatography (DSC), silica 230–400 mesh from Macherey-
Nagel was used. For puriﬁcation by preparative thin-layer chromatography, Kieselgel DF
silica from Riedel-deHaën at 0.75 mm, on glass plates of 20 cm ×20 cm, was used.
Analyses by gas chromatography (GC) for measuring the conversion and enantiomeric
excess were performed using a Shimadzu GC-2010 Plus chromatograph, equipped with
an autosampler AOC-20i and ﬂame ionization detector (FID), and an Agilent 7890B gas
chromatograph, coupled with a mass spectrometer, model 5977A. The column used for de-
termining conversion was a Restek Rtx®-5 (30 m ×0.25 mm ×0.25 µm, diphenyl dimethyl
polysiloxane) for the GC-FID, or a HP-5ms (30 m ×0.25 mm ×0.25 µm, (5%-Phenyl)-
methylpolysiloxane) for the GC-MS. Enantiomeric excess was determined on a chiral col-
umn Hydrodex® β-3P (25 m×0.25 mm ×0.25 µm; Macherey-Nagel, Darmstadt, Germany).
Method 1 (RTX-5) parameters: injector: 260 ◦C; detector: 300 ◦C; constant ﬂow
1.22 mL/min; 80 ◦C/hold 3 min, 80–300 ◦C/rate 30 ◦C/min; 280 ◦C hold 3 min.
Method 2 (Hydrodex 1b) parameters: injector: 180 ◦C; detector: 180 ◦C; constant ﬂow
0.9 mL/min; 155–175 ◦C/rate 1 ◦C/min, 175–185 ◦C/rate 10 ◦C/min, 180 ◦C/hold 10 min.
Method 3 (Hydrodex 2b) parameters: injector: 180 ◦C; detector: 180 ◦C; constant ﬂow
0.9 mL/min; 170 ◦C/hold 5 min, 170–180 ◦C/rate 5 ◦C/min, 180 ◦C/hold 10 min.
3.3. Expression and Production of Cell-Free Extracts Containing ATAs
E. coli BL21(DE3) pLysS cells were used for the recombinant expression of the pro-
teins. The plasmids containing synthetic genes encoding amine transaminases from
Aspergillus terreus, Mycobacterium vanbaalenii , Ruegeria pomeroyi , Vibrio ﬂuvialis, and
Chromobacterium violaceum were constructed in pET and pGASTON vectors.
For the transformation, approximately 50 ng of the plasmids were added to 100 µL of
competent cells. The cells were kept on ice for 30 min, followed by 2 min at 42 ◦C, then
were incubated again on ice for 2 min. After that, 1 mL of SOC medium was added to
the cells and they were incubated at 37 ◦C for 1 h, under orbital stirring (300 rpm). The
growing cells were inoculated on LB (lysogenic broth) medium plates, supplemented with
kanamycin or ampicillin, depending on the resistance antibiotic, and the plates were kept
at 37 ◦C overnight.
For protein expression, 30 mL of an overnight culture was inoculated in 600 mL of LB
medium, supplemented with the resistance antibiotic. Firstly, the culture was incubated
at 37 ◦C and 130 rpm until an OD600 of 0.7 was achieved. Then, IPTG was added (ﬁnal
concentration 0.1 mM) for C. violaceum, V . ﬂuvialisand R. pomeroyi ATAs, or rhamnose (0.2%
w/v) for A. terreus and M. vanbaalenii ATAs. The time and temperature of induction varied,
depending on the enzyme expressed. The induction occurred overnight for all the enzymes,
with the exception of the R. pomeroyi ATA, where induction took 6 h. The temperature was
Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2022, 23, 777 8 of 12
set to 20 ◦C (A. terreus and M. vanbaalenii) or 30 ◦C (C. violaceum, V . ﬂuvialisand R. pomeroyi).
After expression, the cells were harvested by centrifugation (10 min, 15,000×g, 20 ◦C).
The cell pellets were resuspended in cold lysis buffer (sodium phosphate buffer,pH 7.0,
20 mM, 20 µM PLP , 2 mM EDTA, 1 mM PMSF, 5% glycerol). They were then disrupted by
sonication (Bandelin Sonopuls HD-2070), with 30–40% of the maximum power, in 9 cycles
of 30 s, in continuous mode, with rest breaks of 1 min between cycles. All the procedures
were conducted in an ice bath. The cell suspension was centrifuged (20 min, 20,000 ×g,
4 ◦C) to remove cell debris. The supernatant was pre-puriﬁed by dialysis, in cellulose tubes
(pores of 14,000 Da), for 24 h at 4 ◦C. For every 8 mL of cell-free extract, 250 mL of dialysis
buffer was used (sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, 50 mM, 20 µM PLP). At the end of the
process, aliquots were prepared, containing 1.0 mL of enzyme extract and 0.5 mL of 20%
glycerol, and the cell-free extracts were stored in the freezer at −20 ◦C.
3.4. Bradford Assay
The Bradford reagent was made using 25 mg of Coomassie brilliant blue G-250,
dissolved in 25 mL 95% ethanol [39]. To this solution were added 50 mL of 85% H 3PO4.
The resulting solution was added to 425 mL of distilled water and stored in a refrigerator.
For the analytical curve (see Supplementary Figure S1), a solution of 1 mg/mL of
bovine serum albumin (BSA) was prepared, which was successively diluted to 0.5, 0.125,
0.062, 0.031, and 0.015 mg/mL. Samples were made by taking 20 µL of the BSA solution,
1.58 mL of Milli-Q water, and 0.4 mL of Bradford reagent, which were incubated at room
temperature for 10 min. After the incubation period, the absorbance was measured at
595 nm. Analyses were performed in triplicate. For the negative control, 1.6 mL of Milli-Q
water and 0.4 mL of Bradford reagent were mixed. For quantiﬁcation of the enzymes, 20 µL
of the crude cell lysate (post-dialysis) was used. The concentrations of the total proteins in
crude cell lysates were: C. violaceum (0.426 mg mL−1), A. terreus (not quantiﬁed, below the
range of the analytical curve), V . ﬂuvialis(0.345 mg mL−1), M. vanbaalenii (0.033 mg mL−1),
R. pomeroyi (0.247 mg mL−1).
3.5. General Procedure for Reactions with the Crude Cell Lysate
Into a 2 mL Eppendorf tube, 20 mM of the ketone was added, solubilized in 15 µL
of DMSO (1% vv−1), followed by the addition of 1 mM of PLP and 300 mM of isopropy-
lamine (prepared in sodium phosphate buffer, 100 mM, pH 7.5). After that, the crude cell
lysate (1.5 mL) was added, and the pH was corrected to 7. The reaction was kept under
orbital stirring (850 rpm) at 30 ◦C for 24 h. The reaction was quenched by the addition of
NaOH (10 M) until a pH of 10–12 was reached, followed by extraction with ethyl acetate
(2 ×1.5 mL). The organic phases were combined, then dried with anhydrous magnesium
sulfate, and the solvent was evaporated.
3.6. General Procedure for Reactions with ATA-256
Into a 1.5 mL Eppendorf tube, 10 mM of the ketone was added, solubilized in 25 µL of
DMSO (2.5% vv−1), followed by the addition of 1 mM of PLP and 1 M of isopropylamine
(prepared in sodium phosphate buffer, 100 mM, pH 7.5). After that, the pH was corrected
to 7, then the enzyme was added with the remaining buffer (total volume of 1 mL). The
reaction was kept under orbital stirring (850 rpm) at 45 ◦C for 24 h. The reaction was
quenched by the addition of NaOH (10 M) until a pH of 10–12 was reached, followed by
extraction with ethyl acetate (2 ×1.5 mL). The organic phases were combined, then dried
with anhydrous magnesium sulfate, and the solvent was evaporated.
3.7. Reductive Amination for the Synthesis of the Racemic Amines
Then, under an N 2 atmosphere, to 0.5 mmol of the ketone substrate, 1 mmol of
titanium isopropoxide (0.3 mL) and 2.5 mmol (1.25 mL) of ammonia in ethanol 2 M were
added [40]. The reaction system was stirred at room temperature in an inert atmosphere
for 6 h. Then, 0.75 mmol (28 mg) sodium borohydride was added and the reaction system
Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2022, 23, 777 9 of 12
was kept under stirring for 3 h. The reaction was quenched by the addition of 2 mL of
ammonium hydroxide 2 M. The inorganic precipitate was ﬁltered under reduced pressure
and was abundantly washed with ethyl acetate. The aqueous phase was extracted with
ethyl acetate (2 ×5 mL) and the organic phases were combined, washed with brine, dried
with anhydrous magnesium sulfate, and the solvent was evaporated. See supporting
information for NMR spectra and GC-FID and HPLC chromatograms.

and 6.83 min (S).
3.8. General Procedure for the Acetylation of Amines
To 1.0 mL of ethyl acetate, 1 mg of the amine, 10 µL acetic anhydride, and a small
crystal of DMAP were added. The system was stirred for 10 min, and after that the
organic phase was washed with NaOH (2 M), dried with anhydrous magnesium sulfate,
and analyzed.
3.9. General Procedure for in Silico Studies
Molecular structures of ligands were prepared using Avogadro and the energy was
minimized using the PM3 semi-empirical method available in the Gaussian 09 package. The
3D structures of the proteinsA. terreus (PDB 4CE5 [41], 1.63 Å resolution), C. violaceum (PDB
4A67 [42], 1.80 Å resolution), V . ﬂuvialis(PDB 4E3Q [43], 1.90 Å resolution) and R. pomeroyi
(PDB 3HMU, 1.56 Å resolution) were taken from their respective crystal structures, then
prepared by removing the water molecules and adding the missing atoms. The protonation
states of the amino acids were assigned according to a pH value of 7. For ATA-256 [34], no
crystal structure was available, and a 3D model was built using homology modeling. For
this purpose, a search for suitable templates was carried out using BLAST on the NCBI
server (see Supplementary Table S1). The chosen template was the aminotransferase from
Vibrio ﬂuvialis (PDB 4E3Q). The model was constructed using the SwissModel server [44].
The stereochemical quality of the model was assessed by the Ramachandran plot on the
MolProbity server [45], and z-score on the Prosa-web server [46].
3.10. Molecular Docking
The parameters for docking were determined by an analysis of poses obtained by
redocking, where the quality criterion was the root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) value
(see Supplementary Table S2). The docking of ligands in transaminase from A. terreus
was performed via the ChemPLP scoring function, and the binding site radius was set to
20.0 Å around the nitrogen atom (ID2862) of Lys180. Twenty runs of the genetic algorithm
were performed for each molecule. However, the same set of parameters did not perform
Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2022, 23, 777 10 of 12
well when docking the ligands in the cavity of the transaminases from C. violaceum and
R. pomeroyi. In such cases, the Chemscore function and a radius of 10 Å around Lys288
(PDB 4A6T) and Lys290 (PDB 3HMU) were used. The optimal parameters for docking on
V . ﬂuvialiswere the ChemPLP scoring function and a radius of 10 Å around the nitrogen
(ID 4385) of Lys285. Figures 2 and 3 were prepared using PyMOL version 2.4.0a0 [47] and
the BIOVIA Discovery Studio Visualizer v.16.1.0.15350 [48]. The GOLD software v.2020.1
was used in the docking studies [49].
4. Conclusions
These molecular docking simulations shed light on experimental data and helped
rationalize the generally lower conversion rates and optical purities found for the less
ﬂexible α,β-unsaturated ketone 2a, compared to 1a. The high conversions (80 to 99%) and
enantioselectivities (78 to 99% ee) for 1a, with IPA as an amino donor, were far superior
to those observed for the α,β-unsaturated substrate 2a, no matter whether the ( R)- or
(S)-selective wild-type ATAs or the engineered ATA-256 were used because there are more
favorable intermolecular interactions in the active site, due to the higher ﬂexibility of
compound 1a compared to 2a.
Most importantly, the difference in conversions of2a with the (S)-selective wild-type
transaminases from V . ﬂuvialiscompared to its engineered variant ATA-256 from Codexis
could be rationalized. Molecular docking simulations suggested that the four mutations,
V153S, K163L, S284A, and A323T, in the engineered ATA-256 variant are the main ones
responsible for changes in the transaminase active site, resulting in more possibilities for
intermolecular interactions and favorable distances, leading to observed differences in
higher conversion rates and optical purities for2a when using the commercially engineered
V . ﬂuvialisvariant ATA-256 (87% conversion, >99%ee), whereas the wild type afforded only
a 5% conversion with 90% ee.
