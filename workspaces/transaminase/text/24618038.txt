During the last decade the use of transaminases for the production of
pharmaceutical and ﬁne chemical intermediates has attracted a great deal
of attention. Transaminases are versatile biocatalysts for the efﬁcient pro-
duction of amine intermediates and many have ( S)-enantiospeciﬁcity.
Transaminases with (R)-speciﬁcity are needed to expand the applications of
these enzymes in biocatalysis. In this work we have identiﬁed a fungal
putative (R)-speciﬁc transaminase from the EurotiomycetesNectria haema-
tococca, cloned a synthetic version of this gene, demonstrated (R)-selective
deamination of several substrates including (R)-a-methylbenzylamine, as
well as production of (R)-amines, and determined its crystal structure. The
crystal structures of the holoenzyme and the complex with an inhibitor
gabaculine offer the ﬁrst detailed insight into the structural basis for sub-
strate speciﬁcity and enantioselectivity of the industrially important class of
(R)-selective amine : pyruvate transaminases.

Introduction
Transaminase (TAm; aminotransferase; EC 2.6.1 .)
enzymes catalyse the reversible transfer of an amino
group from an amino substrate onto a ketone or alde-
hyde, producing a chiral amine in the case of a keto-
acceptor [1– 4]. TAms are involved in the metabolism
of most of the 20 naturally occurring proteinogenic
amino acids and many other amine-containing com-
pounds. TAm enzymes with sufﬁciently relaxed sub-
strate range are useful tools in the synthesis of chiral
amino acid analogues [5– 7], e.g. tert-leucine [8], hom-
ophenylalanine [9], and glutamate analogues for the
study of neuronal receptors [10].
TAms use the cofactor pyridoxal 5
0-phosphate
(PLP), the biologically active form of vitamin B6
[11,12] which normally covalently binds to an active
site lysine via a Schiff base (internal aldimine;
Scheme 1). The TAm mechanism is made up of two
half-reactions. In the ﬁrst half-reaction the donor sub-
strate forms a Schiff base with the cofactor and after
further intermediate steps, including an a-proton
abstraction step, transfers its amino group to the co-
factor (external aldimine), resulting in a keto acid and
enzyme-bound pyridoxamine 5
0-phosphate (PMP). In
the second half-reaction the amino group is transferred
from PMP to an acceptor ketone or aldehyde restoring
the PLP internal aldimine and producing a chiral
amino group if the acceptor was a ketone or a primary
amine if the acceptor was an aldehyde.a-ketoglutarate
is a common amino acceptor substrate of TAms, but
some use pyruvate as an amino group acceptor and
are called in such cases substrate : pyruvate TAms,
e.g. serine : pyruvate TAm fromSulfolobus solfataricus
from TAm class V [13,14].
TAms are currently of key interest to biotechnology
for both the asymmetric synthesis and resolution of
chiral amines. Within the many types of TAm
enzymes, speciﬁcally interesting for industry are the
(S)- and (R)-selective TAms which can catalyse the
transfer of an amino group from substrates containing
an amino group distal to the carboxyl group (xATms
[15]) or no carboxyl group (amine transaminases [16]).
Several of these enzymes have been biochemically
characterized. In particular the xTAms from Vibrio
ﬂuvialis [16] and Chromobacterium violaceum [17] have
been studied as potential biocatalysts in the production
of chiral amines in a stereoselective fashion. These

C. Sayeret al. (R)-selective transaminase structure and speciﬁcity
enzymes all belong to the Pfam class III of transamin-
ases [18] and have a PLP type I protein structure fold.
They show activity towards (S)-a-methylbenzylamine
[(S)-MBA] and have varying activities towards other
amines such as b-alanine and other aliphatic amines.
They also use pyruvate and many other ketones and
aldehydes as the amino group acceptor [17].
To date enzymes capable of catalysing the (R)-selec-
tive transamination of x-substituted amines have not
been widely studied but the production of such chiral
amines remains very challenging synthetically.
Recently a collaboration between Codexis and Merck
resulted in the production of a mutant ( R)-speciﬁc
transaminase from Arthrobacter sp. (ArRMut11) to
aminate sterically demanding 1,3-ketoamides and gen-
erate an (R)-chiral amine used in the manufacture of
sitagliptin, which is used in the treatment of type II
diabetes [19]. The mutant ArRMut11 has also been
reported to transaminate bicyclic ketones such as tetr-
alone [20,21]. Most transaminases (such as the ( S)-
xTAms) belong to PLP type I fold and are all speciﬁc
towards the (S)-enantiomer of their substrates. Inter-
estingly, enzymes which belong to Pfam TAm class IV
and have PLP type IV fold can catalyse transamina-
tion of either
D-amino acids or branched chain
L-amino acids. Unlike most of the other PLP enzymes
the catalysis in these enzymes occurs on there side of
the cofactor. Since both (S)- and (R)-enantiomers can
be accommodated within one architectural fold
depending on the speciﬁc sequences of the enzymes,
this class of TAms potentially contains enzymes
capable of transamination to give x-substituted
amines. H€ohne et al. [22] analysed sequences of a large
group of TAms of this Pfam class and found a
ﬁngerprint sequence for enzymes potentially capable of
(R)- xTAm activity. Several of these enzymes
demonstrated high enantioselective activities towards
R-a-methylbenzylamine [(R)-MBA], (2R)-aminohexane
and (2R)-amino-4-phenylbutane. Several three-dimen-
sional structures of ( S)-speciﬁc TAms have been
elucidated [23,24]. Recently the crystallization of an
(R)-TAm has been reported [25]; however, to date no
structure is available.
Gabaculine (5-amino-1,3-cyclohexadienylcarboxylic
acid) is a common suicide inhibitor of botha- and x-
transaminases. Gabaculine binds to the TAm enzyme
to form a Schiff base with the PLP cofactor. The com-
plex then undergoes a number of bond rearrangements
to form an unstable intermediate, which is spontane-
ously converted to m-carboxyphenylpyridoxamine
phosphate (mCPP). This compound results in an irre-
versible aromatic modiﬁcation of the cofactor where
the Schiff base formed between gabaculine and PLP
becomes a non-hydrolysable single bond [26], which
binds tightly to the active sites of TAms. The forma-
tion of this complex can aid our understanding of the
active site conformation adopted for determining
substrate speciﬁcity and enzymatic turnover [13,24].
In this paper we describe the substrate speciﬁcity for
an (R)-speciﬁc xTAm from Nectria haematococca and
its three-dimensional structures in both the PLP and
gabaculine-bound forms.
Results
(R)-selective TAm design, cloning and initial
assays
Previous sequence structure studies on both D-amino
acid TAms (DATAs) and branched chain TAms
(BCATs; class IV [14]) indicated that there was a possi-
bility that these types of TAms might be able to perform
(R)-selective transamination. A
BLAST search for class IV
TAms was performed and several fungal branched chain
enzymes were identiﬁed and aligned using
CLUSTALW
(http://embnet.vital-it.ch/software/ClustalW.html) fol-
lowed by the creation of an unrooted tree. From one of
the subgroups of this unrooted tree, four amino acid
sequences were selected and these were later shown to
match TAms reported to have (R)-selective activity [i.e.
accepting (R)-compounds such as (R)-MBA or
D-ala-
nine] [22]. A detailed analysis of the retrieved sequences
led us in 2009 to the identiﬁcation of a TAm belonging
to N. haematococca, also known by its asexual name
Fusarium solani[27,28], as a new TAm whose properties
had not been previously reported.
The Nectria TAm protein sequence was used to
design a synthetic gene using optimal codons for
Escherichia coli. The synthetic genes were designed to
contain three ﬂanking restriction sites, NdeI, HindIII
and XhoI, which were used to create a wild-type (wt)
and a His-tagged version of theNectria TAm synthetic
gene respectively (Fig. S1). The gene was cloned into
the pET29a vector and overexpressed in E. coli in a
soluble form.
The amino acid sequence of the Nectria TAm is
shown in Fig. 1 highlighting the two motifs identiﬁed
by H€ohne et al. [22] as being responsible for (R)-selec-
tive transamination.
Preliminary enzyme activity from small scale cul-
tures indicated that crude lysate from constructs
pQR1022 (wt) and pQR1023 (His-tagged) produced
acetophenone when using (R)-MBA plus pyruvate as
substrate pairs (Fig. S2). However, no signiﬁcant activ-
ity was noted when using (S)-MBA (crude lysate or
resuspended pellets).

(R)-selective transaminase structure and speciﬁcity C. Sayeret al.
Nectria TAm substrate speciﬁcity and the
production of (R)-amines
Based on the analysis of the primary amino acid
sequence and the preliminary assay data the Nectria
TAm was believed to be (R)-selective. The substrate
speciﬁcity and the enantioselectivity of the transami-
nase were then investigated in detail using a
colorimetric assay previously described by Hopwood
et al. [29] (Scheme 2). The speciﬁc and relative
activities of the Nectria TAm in the deamination of
various racemic (rac) and single isomer amines (1–7)
are summarized in Table 1. In general, the Nectria
TAm accepted a number of aromatic and cyclic
amines with different activities. The highest speciﬁc
activity was determined to be in the oxidative deami-
nation of (R)-MBA (R)-1, while (R)-1-cyclohexylethyl-
amine (R)-2,( R)-4-chloro-a-methylbenzylamine (R)-3
and (rac)-1-methyl-3-phenylpropylamine 6 were con-
verted with good speciﬁc activities as well (25%– 62%
relative activity). With the amines 1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-
1-naphthylamine 4 and a-ethylbenzylamine 5 only a
low activity could be detected, and no conversion of
cyclohexylamine 7 to cyclohexanone was detected at
all.
Interestingly, when considering the structures of the
substrates and the speciﬁc activities obtained it seems
that the position of the amino group relative to the
ring is a crucial parameter. While (R)-1 was converted
with excellent activity, the use of (rac)-a-ethylbenzyl-
amine 5 incorporating one further carbon in the side
chain led to a signiﬁcant decrease in activity (9% rela-
tive activity). However, a longer carbon chain between
the ring and the amine, with the amine still in thea-
position to a methyl group as in ( rac)-6, led to
decreased activity as well, but this was still approxi-
mately threefold higher than for (rac)-5. These results
indicate that a methyl groupa to the amine seems to
be beneﬁcial with respect to the speciﬁc activity of the
Nectria TAm.
The results from the colorimetric assay (Scheme 2,
Table 1) using enantiopure and racemic amines also
conﬁrmed the (R)-selectivity of the Nectria TAm. In
particular, the activities observed in the conversions of
1 and 2 to the corresponding amines, where both e-
nantiomers were available, clearly demonstrated the
enzyme preference for the (R)-enantiomer.
To further conﬁrm the enantiopreference of the
enzyme, its selectivity in the reverse reaction (reductive
amination) was also carried out, as shown in
Scheme 3, using lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) for
pyruvate co-product removal as previously reported
[21,30].

C. Sayeret al. (R)-selective transaminase structure and speciﬁcity
ophenone 5a to 1, 3 and 5, respectively, were analysed
by chiral HPLC. For all three ketones the (R)-amine
was the sole reaction product indicating an enantio-
meric excess > 98%, by comparison with HPLC data
for the racemic and single isomer standards available
(see Table S1 for chiral HPLC details). This provided
additional support for the (R)-selectivity of theNectria
TAm.
Structure of theNectria TAm
The native (internal aldimine form) Nectria TAm
structure and its complex with the inhibitor mCPP
(gabaculine-PLP adduct) were solved and reﬁned to
resolutions of 1.68 and 1.50/C23A respectively. The result-
ing R factors for the native and complex structures
were 15.8% and 15.3% withR
free values of 18.8% and
18.0%, respectively (Table 2). TheG factors calculated
for each model conﬁrmed that the structures have
acceptable stereochemical properties [31]. There are no
residues in thecis conﬁguration.
All amino acid residues of the Nectria TAm were
modelled into the electron density of both structures
along with the ﬁrst two amino acids of the C-terminal
His-tag. An MES buffer molecule was modelled with
occupancy 0.8 in the active site of the native enzyme.
The protein eluted from the gel ﬁltration column at
a volume consistent with it forming a dimer in solu-
tion. The asymmetric unit of the holoenzyme contains
the catalytic dimeric molecule of the Nectria Tam
(Fig. 2A). The gabaculine complex crystals contain
only one subunit of TAm, with two subunits of the
molecular dimer related by the crystallographic dyad.
Most of the related DATAs and BCATs are dimeric,
although a signiﬁcant number of BCATs are hexamer-
ic, being built as a trimer of catalytic dimers.
The Nectria TAm belongs to the fold-type IV class
of PLP-dependent enzymes and is built up of two
domains of a/b type (Fig. 2B). It is similar to known
structures of BCATs and DATAs, with the closest
structural homologue being Thermus thermophilus
BCAT (PDB code
1WRV; 26% sequence identity).

Domain 1 consists of residues 1– 145 and 315– 320 in
an antiparallel seven-stranded b-sheet with topology
/C01, +4x, +1, /C02x, /C01, +4x. The second PLP binding

gle eight-stranded b-sheet of mixed type with topology
/C01x, /C01, +5, +1, +1, /C03, /C01 and direction/C0 +++ /C0
+ /C0. Residues 43– 45 from each subunit of the dimer
form a two-stranded antiparallelb-sheet. A long N-ter-
minal a-helix appears to be a feature of fungal (R)-spe-
ciﬁc amine : pyruvate TAms.
The conformations of the two subunits in the native
structure are very close with rmsd of their Ca posi-
tions of only 0.13/C23A over all residues. The rmsd of Ca
positions between the mCPP complex structure and
the native structure over all residues is only 0.21/C23A.
This is smaller than the rmsd between subunits within
a single structure of many other PLP enzymes. This
suggests that the high rigidity of this enzyme may be a
consequence of the requirement to maintain a high e-
nantioselectivity within the protein scaffold for both
(R) and (S) stereoselective activities.
Active site
The active site is formed by residues from both the
N-terminal and the PLP binding domains of one sub-
unit of the Nectria TAm and the N-terminal domain
from the adjacent subunit. The PLP cofactor in the
holoenzyme structure is bound at the bottom of the
active site pocket with there side of the pyridine ring
exposed to solvent and thesi side resting on the side
chain of Leu234. It is covalently bound to Lys179
via a Schiff base. The PLP phosphate group is
anchored by a salt bridge to the side chain of Arg77
and H-bonds with the main chain nitrogen atoms of
Ile237 and Thr238 and the side chain oxygens of
Thr238 and Thr274. The PLP pyridine nitrogen is
coordinated by the carboxyl group of Glu212. H€ohne
et al. [22] describe two pockets for the active sites of
Pfam class IV TAms with two binding sites for
groups of the incoming substrates (methyl and phenyl
groups in MBA) referred to as S (small) and L
(large) pockets.
mCPP adduct binding
In order to analyse the active site binding pockets
adjacent to the cofactor the Nectria TAm was co-
crystallized with the inhibitor gabaculine, which forms
the mCPP adduct with PLP in the enzyme active site.
The mCPP adduct is positioned centrally in the active
site in close proximity (< 4.5 /C23A) to the S pocket out-
lined by the side chains of residues Phe113, Val60
and Glu115 but does not ﬁt into it (Fig. 3A). This
site is responsible for binding of the methyl group of
MBA. On the opposite side of the active site the L
pocket outlined by residues Tyr58, Leu181, Trp183
and His53 from the adjacent subunit forms a much
larger cavity which can bind the phenyl group of sub-
strates such as (R)-MBA. Thus the relative position-
ing of the small restrictive pocket and the large
pocket gives the enzyme its ( R)-enantioselectivity
towards x-amines. The formation of the mCPP
adduct causes the rotation of the PLP pyridine ring
by ~ 35° in relation to its position in the holoenzyme
structure; the positions of the PLP phosphate and
pyridine nitrogen remain ﬁxed. This angle of rotation
matches those observed between the holoenzyme
structure and complexes in both Bacillus sp. DATA
[32] and E. coli BCAT [33]. The carboxyl group of
the mCPP adduct is disordered due to its clash with
Phe113, which is also partially displaced to a differ-
ent, strained conformer not observed in the native
Nectria TAm structure (Fig. 3B).

C. Sayeret al. (R)-selective transaminase structure and speciﬁcity
Determinants of the enzyme stereoselectivity
To explain this enantioselectivity of theNectria TAm
the mCPP complex was used as a template to manu-
ally position the ( R)-MBA-PLP external aldimine
adduct in the active site for catalysis. The adduct was
modelled so that orientation of the PLP pyridine ring
was the same as in the mCPP complex. The (R)-MBA
part of the adduct was positioned so that the hydrogen
on the chiral carbon was normal to the plane of the
PLP pyridine ring and pointing towards the NZ of the
catalytic Lys179, according to the Dunathan hypothe-
sis [34] requirement for catalysis. This positions the
methyl group of MBA in the S pocket as described by
H€ohne et al.[22] and the phenyl ring in the opposite L
pocket (Fig. 4), where both groups ﬁt nicely. If the
(S)-MBA-PLP adduct is positioned for catalysis in the
same manner for potential amine transfer, its phenyl
group points towards the S pocket. Manual modelling
of this enantiomer into the Nectria TAm structure
revealed that the phenyl group would not ﬁt in this S
pocket due to clashes with both the side chains and
main chain atoms of residues Thr273 and Thr274 and
the side chain of the Ala275 (Fig. 4). The limitation in
space within the S pocket ensures that the Nectria
TAm has (R)-amine substrate speciﬁcity.
Substrate speciﬁcity
In the same manner in which this S pocket restricts
the stereospeciﬁcity of the enzyme it also regulates the
size and regioselectivity of the substrates. The enzyme
shows optimal activity for (R)-MBA (relative activity
100%, see Table 1); however, in the case ofa-ethylb-
enzylamine when the ethyl group is positioned in the S
pocket the relative activity is reduced to 9%. Model-
ling of this substrate into the active site reveals that
when the ethyl group ofa-ethylbenzylamine goes into
the S pocket it is restricted by the side chain of
Thr273. This would put the substrate-PLP external
aldimine adduct in a less favourable position for pro-
ton abstraction by Lys179, accounting for a 10-fold
reduction in activity.
In the case of the substrate (rac)-1-methyl-3-phenyl-
propylamine 6, which has an additional carbon atom
between the phenyl and amine groups compared with
(R)-MBA, a fourfold reduction in activity was
observed. Positioning this substrate ( R-isomer) into
the active site reveals that the L pocket can accommo-
date this larger group while the methyl group neatly
ﬁts into the S pocket as observed for MBA. Whilst
this larger substrate ﬁts in the L pocket, its movement
is signiﬁcantly more restricted than that observed for
(R)-MBA with the phenyl group being positioned
close to the edge of the pocket and sandwiched
between the side chains of Phe113, Glu115, Tyr58,
Val60 and His53. This steric hindrance could slow
down the binding of ( R)-1-methyl-3-phenylpropyl-
amine to the active site and release of the subsequent
product. It could also affect the attack of Lys179 onto
the external aldimine adduct which would account for
the fourfold reduction in activity. Generally, it
appears that the S pocket is more limiting in control-

from this sequence similarity that the Nectria TAm

Relationship between the (R)-speciﬁc amine TAm
signature motifs and its structure
While the main scaffold of Pfam class IV TAms is sim-
ilar between BCATs, DATAs and ( R)-selective
amine : pyruvate TAms, different residues in speciﬁc
positions enable the required substrate activities. The
BCATs transfer the amino group of branched chain
L-amino acids onto the a-ketoglutarate acceptor to
produce the corresponding ketoacid and L-glutamate.
The DATAs transfer the amino group fromD-amino
acids onto thea-ketoglutarate to produce the ketoacid
and D-glutamate. The ( R)-selective amine : pyruvate
TAms transfer the substrate amino group onto pyru-
vate to produce the ketone/aldehyde and
D-alanine.
H€ohne et al. [22] identiﬁed two signature motifs which
allow the (R)-speciﬁc amine : pyruvate TAms to be
distinguished from a multitude of sequence related
DATAs and BCATs. These motifs are highlighted in
Fig. 1 for theNectria TAm sequence.
The enzymatic mechanisms of both the Bacillus
DATA [32] and theE. coli BCAT [33] have been thor-
oughly investigated and many structures of enzyme
complexes containing reaction intermediates are avail-
able. The comparison of theNectria TAm with struc-
tures of these other enzymes allows a greater
understanding of the relationship between their
sequence and enzyme activities. The conserved residues
His53, Tyr58 and Val60 from theNectria TAm from
the ﬁrst sequence motif and Phe113 from the second
motif contribute to the formation of the L and S sub-
strate pockets conferring speciﬁcity for the (R)-amine
binding. The pair of residues, Ser62 from the ﬁrst sig-
nature motif and Glu115 from the second motif, rule
out the BCAT activity for theNectria TAm enzyme.
In the BCATs the equivalent residues Arg40 and
Arg97 are involved in binding the substrates a-car-
boxyl and thec-carboxyl groups respectively.
The loop 122– 135 inNectria TAm which contains the
four residues Val125, Arg126, Gly127 and Ala128 of the
second signature motif folds into a 3
10 helix. The con-
formation of the loop is signiﬁcantly different from that
observed for the same regions of BCAT and DATA
(Fig. 5). This results in a displacement of Arg126 away
from the active site in relation to the equivalent Arg98
of DATA which binds thea-carboxyl group of
D-ala-
nine. Inability of the Arg126 ofNectria TAm to bind
the substrate carboxyl group is one of the reasons for its
negligible DATA activity [22].
Amongst TAm enzymes, carboxylated substrates are
typically coordinated by one or two arginine residues.
In the PLP fold I type TAms these arginines are highly
conserved. However, in the PLP fold type IV enzymes
containing BCATs, DATAs and (R)-amine : pyruvate
TAms, the arginine residues which could bind the sub-
strate carboxyl groups are not conserved between the
different enzyme activities, with the Nectria TAm
enzyme having no arginines in the active site. It
appears that theN. haemotococca enzyme has no ﬁxed
carboxyl binding position for amino acids, as was ear-
lier predicted by H€ohne et al. [22]. Thus the signature
sequences for the (R)-selective amine TAms appear to
specify a narrow S pocket, a hydrophobic L pocket
and the absence of charged carboxyl binding residues
thereby favouring binding of aliphatic and aromatic
amines and ketones.

positioned for catalysis based on the structure of the mCPP complex and the requirement for the scissile Ca-H bond to be normal to the
plane of the pyridine ring of PLP. The (S)-MBA enantiomer in this position is pointing into the S pocket where it is sterically hindered by
residues Thr273-Ala275.

Conclusion
In this work we have identiﬁed a fungal (R)-speciﬁc
TAm from the Eurotiomycetes N. haematococca, and
the protein sequence has been used to design a wild-
type and a His-tagged version of the synthetic gene
using optimal codons forE. coli. Cloning and expres-
sion gave an xTAm that demonstrated (R)-enantiose-
lectivity towards (R)-MBA (R)-1. The use of other
chiral amines (2– 6) conﬁrmed the (R)-enantioselective
behaviour of the Nectria TAm. Three ketone sub-
strates (1a, 3a, 5a) were selected and the (R)-amines
were formed by the Nectria TAm with simultaneous
co-product removal using LDH and glucose dehydro-
genase and NAD
+ as a cofactor. The crystal struc-
tures of the holoenzyme of this ( R)-selective TAm
from N. haematococcaand the complex with an inhibi-
tor gabaculine were determined, which offers a
detailed insight into the structural basis for substrate
speciﬁcity and enantioselectivity. Notably, the side
chains of Phe113, Val60 and Glu115 line an S pocket,
and on the opposite side of the active site the L pocket
is lined by residues Tyr58, Leu181, His53 and Trp183.
Furthermore modelling of substrates1, 5 and 6 in the
active site of the TAm was able to rationalise the rela-
tive speciﬁc activities and enantioselectivities that have
been observed for this enzyme. This work highlights
how the use of detailed structural information can help
to understand the enantioselectivity and substrate spec-
iﬁcity of this Nectria TAm enzyme. The information
obtained will aid the use of rationally directed muta-
genesis of this and other industrially important trans-
aminases.
Materials and methods
Gene design, cloning and expression ofNectria
TAm
A BLAST search [35] was used to screen for class IV TAms and
the Nectria TAm protein was selected. The protein sequence
was used to design a synthetic gene using theDNA 2.0 software
optimized for expression inE. coli and synthesized byDNA
2.0 (Menlo Park, CA, USA). The two restriction digested ver-
sions of the gene (NdeI– HindIII and NdeI– XhoI) were then
ligated into the expression vector pET29a+ and transformed
into BL21(DE3) pLysS, creating the pQR1022 (wt) and
pQR1023 (6x-His-tag) constructs respectively (Fig. S1).
Preliminary expression of the Nectria TAm for
biochemical assays
A 5 mL overnight culture of the BL21(DE3) pLysS con-
taining pQR1022 (no His tag) was grown in tryptone-yeast
(TY) medium for 16 h at 37°C, 220 r.p.m. The non-His-
tagged version was used initially to assess enzyme activity
in case the His-tag inhibited activity. The His-tag was
found to have no effect on activity and later puriﬁcation
and work was carried out with the His-tagged enzyme. To
initiate the overexpression, the overnight cultures were
diluted 1 : 100 into 20 mL of TY fresh medium containing
both kanamycin (0.05 mg /C1mL
/C01) and chloramphenicol
(0.03 mg/C1mL/C01) and incubated until anA600 nm of 0.7– 0.8
was reached at 37°C, 220 r.p.m. Then isopropyl thio-b-D-
galactoside (IPTG; 0.5 mM) was added and the culture was
left for a further 5 h at 30°C, 220 r.p.m. Cells were har-
vested after 5 h and centrifuged for 10 min at 14 000g; the
cell pellet was then re-suspended in lysis buffer (100 mM
Fig. 5. A stereo diagram showing the superposition of the dimericNectria TAm structure (subunits are shown as green and red cartoons)
with the Bacillus sp. DATA structure (magenta and cyan cartoons). This is viewed from the solvent region into the active site cavity. The
Arg98 binds thea-carboxyl group of the substrate in DATA as shown for the complex with the reaction intermediate analogue pyridoxyl-D-
alanine (PDD; PDB code 3DAA). In BCAT this arginine is not conserved, although the equivalent loop retains similar conformation (not
shown). In the Nectria TAm the corresponding loop 122– 136, which contains four residues of the second ﬁngerprint sequence motif,
accepts a distinct conformation with part of it folding into 310 helix. This results in signiﬁcant displacement of conserved Arg126, which is
unable to bind the substrate analogue mCPP carboxyl group since it is too remote. The ligands and the residues are shown as stick models.

per 10 s (on/off) protocol at 12lm. The resulting material
was centrifuged and separated into crude lysate or resus-
pended pellet and stored at/C020 °C.
Optimized expression for enzyme
characterization
A 5 mL overnight culture of the BL21(DE3) pLysS contain-
ing pQR1023 (6x-His-tag) was grown in LB medium contain-
ing kanamycin (0.05 mg/C1mL
/C01) for 16 h at 37°C, 220 r.p.m.
The overnight cultures were used to inoculate fresh LB med-
ium (20 mL) containing kanamycin (0.05 mg/C1mL
/C01) to give a
ﬁnal 0.05A600 nm of 0.05. Cultures were grown at 37°C and
120 r.p.m. until anA600 nm of 0.7– 0.8 was reached, IPTG
(0.5 mM) was added and the temperature was reduced to
25 °C and the cultures incubated for 20 h. The cells were har-
vested by centrifugation for 10 min at 6000g and stored at
/C020 °C until further use. For the disruption of the cells a
10% (w/v) solution was prepared using an equilibration buf-
fer (100 m
M HEPES pH8, containing 0.5 mM PLP and
20 mM imidazole). The cells were disrupted by sonication
(10 9 15 s on ice, 0.10 output), and after each cycle the cells
were kept on ice for 1 min. The resulting material was centri-
fuged at 13 000 r.p.m., and the supernatant was used in the
puriﬁcation procedure. For puriﬁcation the crude extract was
loaded onto a column (PD10; GE Healthcare, Little
Chalfont, UK) containing 2 mL of Ni-nitrilotriacetic acid
material. After binding, the column was washed with three
volumes of equilibration buffer, and eluted with the same buf-
fer but containing 200 m
M imidazole. For desalting a PD10
desalting column (GE Healthcare) was used and 10 mM HE-
PES buffer at pH 8. This puriﬁcation protocol provides
enzyme preparations that are optimal for biocatalysis.
Overexpression and puriﬁcation of theNectria
TAm for crystallization
Plasmid pQR1023 was transformed intoE. coli BL21(DE3)
pLysS and cultured overnight in LB medium containing
kanamycin (0.05 mg /C1mL/C01). ZYM-5052 [36] medium
(500 mL) was inoculated using the overnight cultures and
incubated at 20 °C for 2 days with shaking at 250 r.p.m.
The cells were then harvested at 4700 g and 4 °C for
20 min. The pellet was re-suspended in 50 m
M Tris/HCl pH
7.5. Cells were disrupted by sonication at 10lm (Soniprep
150; MSE (UK) Ltd, Lower Sydenham, UK) on ice for
2 min and the cell debris was removed by centrifugation at
15 000 g and 4°C for 30 min.
The protein was puriﬁed using the 6x-His-tag using a
1 mL His-Trap FF crude column (GE Healthcare) using a
gradient up to 500 m
M imidazole in 50 mM Tris/HCl pH
7.5. The enzyme was then applied to a Superdex 200
HiLoad 16/60 gel ﬁltration column (column volume
120 mL) and was eluted with 1 column volume in 50 m
M
Tris/HCl, 0.1 M NaCl pH 7.5 at 1.0 mL/C1min/C01. This puriﬁ-
cation protocol gives enzyme material that can readily crys-
tallize (see section on Crystallization).
Determination of theNectria TAm
stereoselectivity using the acetophenone
production assay
(R)- or (S)-selectivity of crude lysates/resuspended pellets
from pQR1022 and pQR1023 were tested using 5 mM of
the substrate pairs (R)- or (S)-MBA and pyruvate. Reac-
tions were carried out in 1 mL reaction buffer (100 mM
HEPES buffer, 0.4 mM PLP, pH 8), where 20% of that
ﬁnal volume corresponded to either crude lysate or resus-
pended pellet from pQR1022 or pQR1023, respectively.
Sample reactions were taken and quenched after 1, 2 and
17 h by mixing 1 : 1 (v/v) of reaction mix with 0.2% triﬂu-
oroacetic acid solution. Production of acetophenone was
followed using an HPLC C18 column at 210 nm. (R)- or
(S)-selectivity of the enzyme was assessed by the production
of acetophenone from (R)- or (S)-MBA.
Determination of TAm substrate speciﬁcity
The transaminase activity of the Nectria TAm against
selected substrates1– 7 was determined using the spectropho-
tometric assay previously described by Hopwoodet al. [29].
A volume of 10lL of the puriﬁedNectria TAm (pQR1023)
was added to 190lL of assay solution in a microtitre plate.
The assay solution contained substrate (5 m M), sodium
pyruvate (0.2 mg/C1mL/C01), pyrogallol red (0.1 mg /C1mL/C01),
PLP (0.05 mg/C1mL/C01), amino acid oxidase (1.2 U/C1mL/C01) and
horseradish peroxidise (12.5 U/C1mL/C01) in sodium phosphate
buffer (100 mM, pH 8). Absorbance at 510 nm was followed
over a period of 30 min, and the linear slope was used to
determine initial rates of the enzyme activity using the
extinction coefﬁcient (19.533 m
M).
Stereoselective formation of chiral amines from
acetophenone
The stereoselectivity of theNectria TAm in the asymmetric
amination of different ketones was performed with simulta-
neous co-product removal to shift the equilibrium of the
TAm reaction towards the desired amine product. Puriﬁed
TAm (0.2 mg) was added to a sodium phosphate buffer
solution (1 mL, 100 m
M, pH 8) containing the substrate
(20 mM), the co-substratesD-alanine (100 mM), b-D-glucose
(60 mM), the cofactors PLP (1 mM), NAD+ (0.5 mM) and
the co-product removal system (lactate dehydrogenase and
glucose dehydrogenase, both 5 U/C1mL
/C01). The reaction was
incubated at 30 °C and 800 r.p.m in an Eppendorf
Thermomixer (Hamburg, Germany). After 72 h the reaction

was stopped by the addition of 1 mL of acetonitrile contain-
ing 0.1% triﬂuoroacetic acid and the protein was removed
by centrifugation (5 min, 13 000 g). The enantiomeric
excesses were determined (within the limits of detection) by
analysis of the supernatants by HPLC (Agilent, Santa
Clara, CA, USA) equipped with a CROWNPAK
/C210 CR(+)
column (150 9 4m m 9 5 lm; Daicel, Illkirch, France)
with UV detection at 254 nm. The conditions used for the
detection of the different amines are given in Table S1.
Crystallization
The Nectria TAm was concentrated to 10 mg/C1mL/C01 using a
10 kDa membrane Vivaspin (Vivascience, MA, USA) and
microbatch crystallization trials were set up using an Oryx 6
crystallization robot (Douglas Instruments, Hungerford,
Berks, UK) using the JCSG+ and Morpheus screens (Molec-
ular Dimensions, Newmarket, Suffolk, UK). The droplet
contained a 50 : 50 ratio of protein solution to precipitant
ratio and was covered with a 50 : 50 mix of silicon and par-
afﬁn oils.
Crystals of the holoenzyme were grown in condition D1
from the Morpheus screen containing 30% PEG 550MME
and PEG 20K. Protein prepared in the presence of 5 m
M
gabaculine was co-crystallized in 0.1M MgCl2,5 0m M Na
HEPES pH 7.5 and 15% v/v PEG 400.
Data were collected on beamlines I04 and I04-1 at the
Diamond Synchrotron light source (Oxford, UK) under
cryo conditions (100 K in a stream of gaseous nitrogen).
Data were processed using
XDS [37] in the Xia2 [38] pipe-
line. All further data and model manipulation was carried
out using the
CCP4 suite of programs [39].
Data collection and structure determination
The structure of holoenzyme was solved by molecular
replacement (MR) using the program
MOLREP [40]. The
functional dimer of T. thermophilus BCAT (PDB code
1WRV) was modiﬁed to match theNectria TAm sequence
and was used as a search model. The rotation function was
calculated at 3/C23A resolution and the translation search was
conducted at 4 /C23A resolution. The rotation solution peak
height was 6.6r and the correlation of translational solu-
tion was 0.183. The resulting MR solution was subjected to
rigid body and subsequent restrained reﬁnement in
REF-
MAC5 [41]. The reﬁned model was submitted to automated
reﬁnement using theARP/WARP version 7.0.1 [42]. The model
was manually rebuilt in COOT [43] and reﬁned with REF-
MAC5. The gabaculine complex, which crystallized in a dif-
ferent space group, was solved by MR using the
coordinates of the reﬁned holoenzyme structure. The statis-
tics of the data processing and reﬁnement are given in
Table 2. After reﬁnement the quality of the model was
checked using the program
PROCHECK [31]. Images were cre-
ated using the molecular graphics programPYMOL [44].
