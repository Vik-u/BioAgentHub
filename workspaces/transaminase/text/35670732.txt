ABSTRACT: Propargylic alcohols and amines are versatile building blocks in organic synthesis. We demonstrate a straightforward
enzymatic cascade to synthesize enantiomerically pure propargylic alcohols and amines from readily available racemic starting
materials. In the ﬁrst step, the peroxygenase from Agrocybe aegerita converted the racemic propargylic alcohols into the
corresponding ketones, which then were converted into the enantiomerically pure alcohols using the ( R)-selective alcohol
dehydrogenase from Lactobacillus kefir or the (S)-selective alcohol dehydrogenase fromThermoanaerobacter brokii. Moreover, an
enzymatic Mitsunobu-type conversion of the racemic alcohols into enantiomerically enriched propargylic amines using (R)-selective
amine transaminase fromAspergillus terreus or (S)-selective amine transaminase fromChromobacterium violaceum was established.
The one-pot two-step cascade reaction yielded a broad range of enantioenriched alcohol and amine products in 70−99% yield.
F
unctionalized alkynes, such as propargylic alcohols and
amines, are versatile building blocks in organic chem-
istry.1−3 The presence of at least two functional groups
predestines these compounds for a broad variety of chemical
transformations, explaining their importance as building blocks
in pharmaceutical and agrochemical chemistry. The natural
antifungal agent Capillin, for example, is chemically synthe-
sized via carbonyl oxidation of its pendant propargylic
alcohols.
4 Levonorgestrel and ethinylestradiol are common
therapeutic hormones containing propargylic alcohols.5 Prop-
argylic amines such as the monoamine oxidase-B inhibitors
Pargyline6 and Rasagyline 7 are used in the treatment of
Parkinson’s disease and are of comparable importance.
Especially for the synthesis of APIs andﬁne chemicals, the
optical purity of propargylic alcohols and amines is crucial.
Therefore, it is not astonishing that a range of enantioselective
syntheses starting from aldehydes8−11 or imines12,13 have been
reported. Though conceptually elegant, these methods suﬀer
from the need for comparably high (transition) metal catalyst
loadings, posing a signi ﬁcant economic and environmental
challenge. Very recently, Arnold and co-workers proposed a
biocatalytic route to enantiomerically pure propargylic
amines.
14
Enantioselective reduction of propargylic ketones has been
reported already in 2001 by Mü ller and co-workers.21 Using
enantiocomplementary alcohol dehydrogenases, the authors
demonstrated the synthesis of both enantiomers of propargylic
alcohols. As racemic propargylic alcohols are more readily
accessible, synthesis routes starting from racemic propargylic
alcohols are desirable. Kinetic resolution approaches appear to
be a practical route to enantiomerically pure products.
15−17
Compared to the kinetic resolution strategy, deracemization
(or dynamic kinetic resolution) intrinsically bears the
advantage of theoretically yielding excellent conversion of the
starting material into the desired product isomer (Scheme 1).
Chemoenzymatic approach es utilizing vanadium
18 or
TEMPO19 catalysts to enable the conversion of the racemic
staring materials have been reported. The group around
Lavandera and Gotor-Ferná ndez, for example, used a laccase-
TEMPO oxidation system to oxidize racemic propargylic

alcohols into the corresponding ketones followed by
enantioselective ADH-catalyzed reduction into the corre-
sponding enantioenriched products. 19 Unfortunately
TEMPO, despite its popularity, is not a very eﬃcient oxidation
reagent, and catalyst loadings of up to 30 mol % are necessary
in order to attain complete conversion of the alcohols to the
corresponding ketones. Furthermore, the pH incompatibility of
both reaction steps necessi tated an intermittent bu ﬀer
exchange.
Therefore, we set out to evaluate if peroxygenases may be
more eﬃcient catalysts for the ﬁrst oxidation step. Though
peroxygenases are mostly used for the oxyfunctionalization of
(nonactivated) C−H-bonds
20,21 recent experiments in our
laboratories indicated that also the oxidation of alcohols to
aldehydes/ketones may be an interesting application for
peroxygenase catalysis.
As peroxygenase catalyst we chose the recombinant, evolved
peroxygenase from Agrocybe aegerita (rAaeUPO, PaDa-I),
22,23
which we recently produced on pilot scale.24 In a ﬁrst set of
experiments, we investigated the applicability of rAaeUPO for
the complete oxidation of racemic 4-(4-ﬂuorophenyl)but-3-yn-
2-ol (1a, Figure 1). Previously, rAaeUPO has been reported as
a highly enantioselective catalyst, especially for the hydrox-
ylation of benzylic C−H-bonds;
25−27 also the hydroxylation of
but-1-yn-1-ylbenzene proceeded enantioselectively (85% ee).
We therefore expected the rAaeUPO-catalyzed oxidation of
racemic alcohol (1a) to result in a kinetic resolution and were
very surprised observing that the oxidation of rac-(1a)
occurred with low enantioselectivity (E-value of 3.6)
28 (Figure
1), essentially converting both enantiomers.
To gain further insight into this unexpected low stereo-
selectivity of r AaeUPO toward the racemic alcohol, we
modeled both enantiomers individually into the active site of
rAaeUPO (Figure S1).
29,30 It turned out that the binding
aﬃnity of both enantiomers was very similar, diﬀering by only
approximately 0.1 kcal × mol−1, suggesting that both
enantiomers may be converted by rAaeUPO with comparable
eﬃciency, thereby explaining the low enantioselectivity.
Complete oxidation of1a into 1b was achieved within 5 h
using 2μMo frAaeUPO at a H2O2 addition rate of 2 mM h−1
(Figure S2). Control reactions in the absence of the biocatalyst
under otherwise identical conditions did not yield in detectable
conversion of any of these starting materials.
This procedure was extended to the oxidation of a range of
racemic derivatives (Figure 2). With the exception of the
substrates (12a−14a), all propargylic alcohols tested were
oxidized into the corresponding ketones in good to excellent
yields.
Having established the rAaeUPO-catalyzed oxidation, we
next investigated the enantioselective reduction of the ketone
intermediate. For this, we chose the ( R)-selective alcohol

dehydrogenase from Lactobacillus kefir DSM 20587
(LkADH) 31 as well as the ( S)-selective ADH from
Thermoanaerobacter brokii (TbADH).32 Both enzymes were
prepared by recombinant expression in recombinantE. coliand
used as lysed cells (obtained by treating the cell pellets with
lysozyme and DNase I, see theSI for further details). Treating
1b with TbADH or LkADH (in the presence of 5% v/v
isopropanol for in situ regeneration of NADPH) gave the
expected (R)-1a and (S)-1a, respectively, in high enantiomeric
purity (Figure S3).
We therefore proceeded combining both reaction steps to
attain the desired deracemization procedure. Preliminary
experiments performing the cascade in a one-pot one-step
fashion were not successful, resulting in a painfully slow
deracemization of 1a: after 7 h reaction time, the ee-value of
(R)-1a had increased from 0% to 5.7%. Possibly catalase
present in the ADH preparation (being a crude cell extract of
the E. coliexpression system) competed with rAaeUPO for the
H
2O2 added and thereby signiﬁcantly decreased the oxidation
rate of theﬁrst cascade step. Therefore, we drew our attention
to a one-pot two-step procedure in which the r AaeUPO-
catalyzed oxidation of racemic propargylic alcohols was
followed by the enantioselective, ADH-catalyzed reduction. A
representative time course is shown inFigure 3.
Almost complete conversion of the racemic starting material
(1a) into the ketone (1b) was achieved within 5 h. After
addition of, e.g.,LkADH and 5% (v/v) of isopropanol (serving
as sacriﬁcial reductant for the LkADH-catalyzed reduction
reaction), smooth reduction into (R)-1a (94% yield and 99%
ee) was observed. Similarly, usingTbADH the corresponding
(S)-1a was obtained in 77% yield and 98% ee (Figure S4−S6).
Encouraged by these results, we further synthesized a range
of racemic propargylic alcohols ( Figure S7 −S45)a n d
subjected them to the bienzymatic deracemization cascade
(Figure 4). Depending on the substitution pattern of the
starting material, the deracemization reaction proceeded
between mediocre to excellent yields and optical purities of
the products (Figure S46−S75). The ADH-selectivities were as
expected with the notable exception of theTbADH-catalyzed
reduction of 10b, which resulted in the formation of the (R)-
alcohol (R)-10a instead of the expected (S)-10a.
Overall, the bienzymatic deracemization of a range of
propargylic alcohols was established. The catalytic perform-
ance of the individual catalysts in terms of turnover numbers
(TON, [product]
final × [catalysts]−1) was calculated to be
2500, 80, and 190 for r Aae UPO, LkADH, TbADH,
respectively. The concentration of the nicotinamide cofactor
(endogenously contained in theE. coli crude extract) can be
estimated using a NADP content of approximately 0.51μmol
× g
wet E. coli
−1 to be around 51 μM,33,34 translating into an
approximate TONNADP around 100.
Next, we enlarged the bienzymatic deracemization concept
with a reductive amination step yielding an enantioselective,
biocatalytic variant of the Mitsunobu reaction.
35−37 For this,
we simply substituted the previously used ADHs in the
sequential cascade by the (R)-selective amine transaminase
from Aspergillus terreus (AtATA)
38 or the (S)-selective amine
transaminase from Chromobacterium violaceum DSM30191
(CvATA).39 Again, the reaction was realized as one-pot two-
step procedure ( Figure 5 ). A representative time course
converting rac-6a into (R)-6c is shown inFigure S76. Under
partially optimized reaction conditions (Figure S77−S79)a
range of enantiomerically pure ( R)- and ( S)-propargylic
amines could be obtained in reasonable to excellent yields
and enantiomeric excess from the corresponding racemic
alcohols (see experimental details in theSI, Figures S80−S100
and Figures S101−S108). The TONs observed forAtATA and
CvATA were 62 and 122.
Figure 3. Representative time course of a one-pot two-step
deracemization (1a (black ◆), 1b (red ●), (R)-1a (blue ◆)). The
rAaeUPO-catalyzed oxidation step was performedﬁrst, followed by
addition of the ADH, isopropanol after 5 h. Conditions: [1a] = 5 mM,
[rAaeUPO] = 2μM; [H2O2]final = 10 mM added at 2 mM h−1 (for 5
h), [LkADH] = 60 μM, NaPi buﬀer (100 mM, pH 8), 30% (v/v)
MeCN, 5% isopropanol, [lysozyme] = 1 mg mL−1, [DNase I] = 6 U
mL−1,3 0 °C, 800 rpm.

Finally, we performed a semipreparative scale synthesis.
Both propargylic alcohol and amine were performed at 3 mmol
scale (20 mM of1a in 150 mL a representative time course is
shown in Figure S109). The peroxygenase enabled complete
oxidation of 1a in the ﬁrst step. The overall cascade reaction
gave (S)-1a and (R)-1c in 76% (91.1% ee) and 19.5% (>99%
ee) isolated yield, respectively (Figure S110−115). The low
isolated yield of ( R)-1c was due to issues with the
chromatographic puriﬁcation.
In summary, we have established a catalytic platform
transforming readily accessible racemic propargylic alcohols
into enantiomerically pure propargylic alcohols and amines.
We are convinced that the simplicity of the procedure will
provide preparative organic and medicinal chemists with a
practical tool for their synthesis planning. Apparently, the
catalytic performance of the enzymes used has to be increased
considerably to attain economic feasibility. We are, however,
convinced that further reaction engineering measures can
increase the TONs considerably. For example, external
addition of the ADH-cofactor may accelerate the ADH-
catalyzed reduction reaction. Also the e ﬃciency of the
reductive amination can be improved upon application of
suitable coupled reactions to shift the equilibrium.
40 Eﬀorts
broadening the substrate scope (e.g., for starting materials
12a−14a) via engineered rAaeUPO variants, expanding the
amine product scope and increasing the substrate loading to
preparatively relevant scales, are currently ongoing in our
laboratories.
