ABSTRACT: ω-Transaminases (ω-TA) are attractive biocatalysts
for the production of chiral amines from prochiral ketones via
asymmetric synthesis. However, the substrate scope ofω-TAs is
usually limited due to steric hindrance at the active site pockets.
We explored a protein engineering strategy using computational
design to expand the substrate scope of an (S)-selective ω-TA
from Pseudomonas jessenii (PjTA-R6) toward the production of
bulky amines. PjTA-R6 is attractive for use in applied biocatalysis
due to its thermostability, tolerance to organic solvents, and
acceptance of high concentrations of isopropylamine as amino
donor. PjTA-R6 showed no detectable activity for the synthesis of
six bicyclic or bulky amines targeted in this study. Six small
libraries composed of 7−18 variants each were separately designed
via computational methods and tested in the laboratory for ketone
to amine conversion. In each library, the vast majority of the variants displayed the desired activity, and of the 40 diﬀerent designs,
38 produced the target amine in good yield with >99% enantiomeric excess. This shows that the substrate scope and
enantioselectivity of PjTA mutants could be predictedin silico with high accuracy. The single mutant W58G showed the best
performance in the synthesis ofﬁve structurally similar bulky amines containing the indan and tetralin moieties. The best variant for
the other bulky amine, 1-phenylbutylamine, was the triple mutant W58M + F86L + R417L, indicating that Trp58 is a key residue in
the large binding pocket forPjTA-R6 redesign. Crystal structures of the two best variants conﬁrmed the computationally predicted
structures. The results show that computational design can be an eﬃcient approach to rapidly expand the substrate scope ofω-TAs
to produce enantiopure bulky amines.

■ INTRODUCTION
Transaminases are attractive biocatalysts for the synthesis of
chiral amines, which are used as building blocks in the
pharmaceutical industry.
1 In the transamination reaction, an
amino group is transferred from a donor (usually an amine or
amino acid) to an acceptor (a ketone, keto acid, or aldehyde)
with the enzyme acting as a molecular shuttle through its
cofactor, the pyridoxal 5 ′-phosphate (PLP) group.
2 The
transaminases are very diverse, both in terms of the fold type
and substrate range. The termω-transaminase (ω-TA) is used
for enzymes acting on aminoalkanoic acids with the amino and
carboxylate groups on the opposite ends of an alkyl group.
Most of theω-TAs also act as general amine transaminases and
do not require a carboxylate group in the amino donor or
acceptor. Accordingly, such enzymes can be used to convert
ketones to the corresponding amines, which is of synthetic
importance if the products are enantiopure.
3
The overall catalytic cycle of transaminases consists of two
half-reactions, each composed of several reversible steps
(Scheme 1).
4 In the ﬁrst half-reaction, the conserved lysine
that forms a Schiﬀ base with the PLP in the native protein
(internal aldimine, E-PLP) is displaced by the amino donor,
resulting in the formation of an external aldimine. Then,via
formation of quinonoid and ketimine intermediates and imine
hydrolysis, the amino group is transferred to PLP, forming the
aminated cofactor pyridoxamine 5 ′-phosphate (PMP) −

enzyme complex (E:PMP). The deaminated donor is released
as a ketone, aldehyde, or keto acid. For the second half-
reaction, the E:PMP enzyme binds the amino acceptor to
regenerate the E-PLP via ketimine, quinonoid, and external
aldimine intermediates, after which the product is released as
an amine or amino acid. In the case of non-symmetric ketones,
ω-TAs convert the substrate to a chiral amine, oﬀering an
attractive catalytic route for the asymmetric synthesis of chiral
amines.
As with most enzymes, the substrate scope of ω-TAs is
rather restricted, often due to steric hindrance in the active
site.
5 Most ω-TAs are homodimeric fold-type I PLP proteins,
with two identical active sites located at the interface of the
monomers. Each active site of these class III transaminases has
both a large and small binding pocket to accommodate
substituents of the carbonyl (or amino-bound) central carbon
atom.
5 While the small binding pocket can seldom
accommodate anything larger than a methyl group, the large
binding pocket is generally capable of accepting an aryl or alkyl
group. To expand the substrate range ofω-TAs, the binding
pockets need to be engineered to accept larger groups. The
main strategies forﬁnding enzyme variants capable of a desired
conversion are directed evolution, rational redesign based on
structure analysis, and computational redesign. 6 Several
examples of engineering the selectivity ofω-TAs by directed
evolution have been reported.7−9 A prominent case is the
stepwise evolution of the (R)-selective ω-TA (a tetrameric
PLP fold-type IV enzyme) fromArthrobacter sp. to obtain a
variant that can be used for the synthesis of the anti-diabetic
drug sitagliptin from prositagliptin ketone.8 Steric constraints
in the small binding pocket and potentially undesired
interactions in the large binding pocket prevent the
prositagliptin ketone from being accepted by the wild-type
enzyme. An enzyme variant with 27 mutations suitable for
sitagliptin production was obtained after 11 rounds of stepwise
evolution. Such a directed evolution campaign requires a
considerable screening e ﬀort and multiple iterations of
mutagenesis, sequencing, and testing.
Examination of crystal structures or homology models ofω-
TAs can be used to identify target sites for mutagenesis and
reduce the amount of screening required forﬁnding desired
variants.
10 This approach of rational design based on structural
analysis was employed to redesign an ω-TA from Chromo-
bacterium violaceum(CvTA) (PDB 4A6T) to obtain derivatives
that are more suitable for the kinetic resolution of 1,2-
diphenylethylamine. 11 T h ea c t i v es i t ea r c h i t e c t u r ew a s
investigated, and two positions in the small binding pocket
were identiﬁed as potential targets for mutagenesis. A double
mutant with 30-fold higher activity than the wild-type enzyme
was identiﬁed. Another case is the redesign of an (S)-selective
ω-TA from Ruegeria sp. TM1040 (PDB 3FCR) to produce
diﬀerent bulky amines.
12,13 After mutagenesis of residues
around the active site, the best variants exhibited improved
conversion while maintaining excellent enantioselectivity. An
ω-TA from Vibrio ﬂuvialis (Vf TA) was engineered for the
synthesis of bulky amines by analysis of the X-ray structure
(PDB 4E3Q) combined with structure-based bioinformatic
analysis.
14 Seven residues in the active site were targeted, and

variants with high conversion and high enantioselectivity
toward four amines were found.15
The use of computational techniques in protein engineering
is becoming an attractive option, in part due to the
development of better energy functions and search algo-
rithms.
16 The caveat of using computational design is that the
methodology is case-speciﬁc, and the choice of a good strategy
is dependent on the enzyme family, the type of reaction, the
type of substrate, and the limiting catalytic step. Forω-TAs,
computational methods forﬁnding mutations that modify the
substrate scope typically include docking of a modeled reaction
intermediate
17 and molecular dynamics simulations 17 or
quantum mechanical modeling 18 of such an intermediate.
Docking is the fastest amongst these methods, but explicit
water molecules are generally not included to avoid a drastic
increase in the search space. Water may play an important role
in both the catalytic mechanism and shaping the binding site of
ω-TAs.
18,19 Diﬀerent reaction steps have been computationally
modeled for the redesign ofω-TAs; hence, diﬀerent ligands,
that is, the ketone that acts as an amine acceptor,17,20,21 the
amine product,22,23 the quinonoid intermediate, 12 and the
external aldimine intermediate 24 have been examined. An
advantage of using a reaction intermediate is that the search
space for the conformation of the ligand is smaller since the
positions of the PLP cofactor atoms can be consideredﬁxed.
However, working directly on a reaction intermediate
implicitly assumes that the enzyme is capable of forming the
Michaelis complex with the substrate (ketone or amine) and
converting it to that intermediate and thus would neglect
mutations that inﬂuence the entry of the substrates or their
accommodation in a reactive orientation.
In computational predictions based on structural modeling,
docking, and molecular dynamics simulations, mutations are
usually chosen manually and investigated on a one-by-one
basis, which seriously limits the accessible sequence space and
complicates the prediction of variants with multiple sub-
stitutions. Alternatively, mutations can be generated in a single
dock-and-design step from a user-deﬁned search space. This
way of discovering new enzyme variants without preselecting
individual mutations is o ﬀered by design algorithms,
25 as
implemented in, for example, Rosetta enzyme design
software.26 Often used forde novo protein and enzyme design,
Rosetta can also be employed to modify the activity of existing
enzymes.
27,28 Rosetta uses a Monte Carlo search algorithm
that randomly mutates selected positions and searches for low-
energy solutions by varying residue identities, protein residue
rotamers, and ligand conformations.29 Calculations are very
fast, and the search space can be deﬁned in terms of target
positions, allowed mutations, and rotamer library density of
target residues and ligands. Local backbone changes are
allowed, and good numbers of primary designs carrying
multiple mutations can be generated in a single dock-and-
design step. The CASCO protocol employs Rosetta in
combination with MD simulations for ranking.
30 In the
current work, we present a design strategy that uses Rosetta
and employs the Rosetta interface energy as the main metric
for the ranking of primary design mutants, obviating the need
for more expensive MD simulations in the initial ranking
phase. The strategy beneﬁts from the target ligands having
hydrophobic and rigid substituents;
31 hydrophobic groups do
not form hydrogen bonding networks involving water
molecules, which are typically absent in docking approaches.
Furthermore, we use docking with the target substrates
covalently bound to the PLP in the form of the external
aldimine intermediate, which greatly reduces the degrees of
freedom of the binding poses and thereby the search space.
As the target enzyme, we have chosen a recently reported
stabilized variant of the (S)-selective ω-TA from Pseudomonas
jessenii (PjTA-R6, T
m
app 85 °C).32 The enzyme was engineered
for increased stability by computational redesign of the subunit
interface and catalyzed enantioselective production of (S)-1-
phenylethylamine at high substrate concentration [100 mM
acetophenone, 1 M isopropylamine (IPA)] and in the presence
of 20% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) at 56°C. In view of the
excellent performance ofPjTA-R6 under these harsh reaction
conditions, we considered PjTA-R6 to be a good template

enzyme to broaden the catalytic scope toward the production
of enantiopure bulky and cyclic primary amines. As target
products, we chose six diﬀerent bulky (S)-amines (Scheme 2),
with structures that are quite di ﬀerent from the accepted
substrate ( S)-1-phenylethylamine. First, ( S)-1-phenylbutyl-
amine (1b) was chosen in view of the bulkiness of the propyl
group that should be accommodated in the small binding
pocket of PjTA-R6. Moreover, ( S)-1-phenylbutylamine has
been the target of previous transaminase engineering
eﬀorts.
12,17,21,22,33 Two other target amines were (S)-(+)-1-
aminoindan ( 2b) and ( S)-(+)-1-aminotetralin ( 3b). The
activity of PjTA-R6 for these compounds is undetectable; the
same is observed with most otherω-TAs.22,23,34−36 The last
three selected bulky amines [( S)-5-methoxytetralin-1-amine
(4b), (S)-6-methoxytetralin-1-amine (5b), and (S)-7-methox-
ytetralin-1-amine (6b)] have not yet been synthesized byω-
TAs and possess an even more bulky group than3b to be
accommodated in the large binding pocket. The corresponding
ketones used as substrates are butyrophenone ( 1a), 1-
indanone (2a), 1-tetralone (3a), 5-methoxy-1-tetralone (4a),
6-methoxy-1-tetralone (5a), and 7-methoxy-1-tetralone (6a)
(Scheme 2).
The employed strategy aims to produce, in a single Rosetta
dock-and-design step, enzyme variants with mutations that
facilitate the accommodation of the external aldimine
intermediate of the target reactions. The search space included
multiple residues around the active site (Table S1), and the
resulting small mutant libraries selected for experimental
veriﬁcation contained mutations at eight positions of PjTA-
R6 (Scheme 3). The ability of the Rosetta-generated variants
to accommodate the intended intermediates was evaluated by
the Rosetta interface energy (docking score).
37 The results
showed that there is a correlation between the interface energy
and the experimental yield, which can aid in narrowing down
the search in future mutagenesis e ﬀorts. Experimental
veriﬁcation showed that the majority (97%) of the mutants
gave better reactivity than the initial scaﬀold, which was not
able to produce any of the six targeted amines. All mutants
showed excellent enantioselectivity for the production of the
(S)-amine.
■ MATERIALS AND METHODS
Computational Library Design.The crystal structure of
PjTA-R6 (PDB 6TB1) served as a scaﬀold for docking of the
target ligands. The scaﬀold was prepared by explicitly adding
hydrogen atoms to the crystal structure ofPjTA-R6 using an
automatic Yasara procedure (the CleanAll and OptHydAll
functions).38 All crystallized water molecules and ions were
deleted from the structure. The modeled ligands are the
external aldimines of 1a−6a, named, respectively, as 1EA−
6EA in this manuscript (Figure S1). Structures of1EA−6EA
were prepared by adding a covalent bond between the PLP
C4′ atom and the corresponding amino substrate (1b−6b)t o
form the respective Schiﬀ base. Geometry optimization of the
resulting external aldimine structures was performed with the
semiempirical AM1 method using the COSMO implicit
solvent model.
39 Partial charges were derived using the
AM1/BCC procedure.40 Rotamer libraries for ligands 1EA
and 4EA−6EA were generated by random perturbation of
non-hydrogen atom dihedrals (SampleDih Yasara routine)
(Figure S1 ). Atoms originally belonging to the pyridoxal
cofactor were kept ﬁxed. Ligands 2EA and 3EA were
represented by a single rotamer. The ligands ( 1EA−6EA)
were initially aligned to the cofactor atoms originally found in
the crystal structure. This initial conformation along with the
rotamer library served as input for Rosetta design to generate
the enzyme complexes containing the external aldimine
ligands.
26 For this computational design, we used Rosetta
build number 57,849, and for comparing experimental
activities with interface energies, we used Rosetta build
number 60,072, which outputs energies in kcal/mol. The
following command line arguments were used for Rosetta
docking: -enzdes, -cst_predock, -cst_design, -cut1 0.0 -cut2
0.0, -cut3 8.0, -cut4 10.0, -cst_min, -chi_min, -bb_min,
-packing:use_input_sc, -packing:soft_rep_design, -design_-
min_cycles 3, -ex1:level 4, -ex2:level 4, -ex1aro:level 4, and
-ex2aro:level 4. All residues within 10 Å of any ligand non-
hydrogen atom were set to repackable, but residues 152, 225,
258, 119, 118, 324, 292, 59, 287, and 87 were set to NATRO
(NATural ROtamer). Multiple runs were performed for each
substrate, and varying combinations of residues were allowed
to mutate ( Table S1 ). For each run, 1000 decoys were
generated, and the resulting mutants were ranked by their
Rosetta interface energy. Figures representing Rosetta designs
were created with VMD (https://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Research/
vmd/).
In general, ranking mutants by the interface energy of the
external aldimine complex proved to be a good target function
to guide mutagenesis (see theResults section). However, as an
extra step to explain some outliers, the water displacement that
would accompany substrate binding was estimated using MD
simulations. These simulations were performed with enzyme−
cofactor and enzyme−ligand complexes generated by Rosetta
docking using GROMACS 2020 software and the AM-
BER99SB force ﬁeld. Details are given in the Supporting
Information.

and cultivation was continued at 24°C for 16 h. Cells were
harvested by centrifugation, washed, and lysed by sonication in
20 mM potassium phosphate, pH 7.5, containing 500 mM
NaCl and 20 μM PLP. Centrifugation (36,000×g, 45 min, 4
°C) gave cell-free extract, loaded on a 5 mL HisTrap column.
Elution with a linear gradient of 0−500 mM imidazole in 20
mM potassium phosphate, pH 7.5, containing 500 mM NaCl
and 20μM PLP, followed by desalting with Econo-Pac 10DG
columns (Bio-Rad) gave puriﬁed enzymes. Protein concen-
trations were determined with the Bradford assay, and puriﬁed
enzymes were stored in aliquots at −80 °Ci n5 0m M
potassium phosphate, pH 8.0, with 20μM PLP.
Thermal Shift Assays. Apparent melting temperatures
(T
m
app) were measured by a ﬂuorescence-based thermal shift
assay (Thermoﬂuor).41 Speciﬁcally, in the wells of an IQ 96-
well PCR plate (Bio-Rad), enzyme samples of 20μL (0.5 mg/
mL protein in 50 mM potassium phosphate buﬀer, pH 8.0)
were mixed with 5μL of 50-fold diluted SYPRO Orange. The
plates were sealed with the Microseal B adhesive sealer (Bio-
Rad) and heated from 20 to 99°C in a MyiQ real-time PCR
machine (Bio-Rad) at a heating rate of 1 °C/min. The
temperature at which the rate ofﬂuorescence change (-dRFU/
dT) was highest was taken asT
m
app.42 For determining stability
under harsh conditions, enzyme samples for thermal shift
assays were prepared in 50 mM phosphate buﬀer containing 1
M IPA, 20% DMSO, or both of these. The pH was set at 8.0.
Reagents. IPA, ketones (1a−6a), (S)-amines (1b−6b),
and ( R)-amines ( 1c−6c) (except 4b and 4c due to
unavailability) ( Figure S2 ) were purchased from Sigma-
Aldrich. Synthesis of compounds 4b and 4c was attempted
by redesignedPjTA-R6 variants; only a single enantiomer was
obtained, and its identity was conﬁrmed by gas chromatog-
raphy mass spectrometry (GC−MS). PLP was purchased from
Fisher Scientiﬁc. The purity of reagents was higher than 95%.
Enzyme Reactions. Transaminase-catalyzed amination
reactions were performed at 1 mL scale in sealed glass vials
at 56 °C using 50 mM potassium phosphate buﬀer, pH 8.0,
containing 1 M IPA, 20 mM one of the ketones1a−6a, 20%
DMSO (or 2% DMSO in the case of2a and 15% in the case of
3a), 0.5 mM PLP, and 1 mg of puriﬁed enzyme. For analysis,
100 μL samples were quenched by adding 20 μLo f1 0M
NaOH, centrifuged, and extracted twice with 300μL of ethyl
acetate. The combined extracts were treated with anhydrous
magnesium sulfate to remove water, and a total of 200μLo f
each sample was used for GC analysis. Because of the
instability of amines4b, 5b, and 6b, they were derivatized to
the acetamide before GC analysis.
35 For this, 200μL samples
of the extracted products were mixed with 300μL of acetic
anhydride and 5 mg of 4-dimethylaminopyridine (DMAP).
After 1 h reaction time (450 rpm, room temperature), samples
were treated with 500μL of water, and the organic layers were
dried with anhydrous magnesium sulfate. The dried samples
were used for GC analysis.
Kinetic parameters of transaminase reactions were deter-
mined by measuring depletion of aromatic ketones in the 96-
well microplate format. The reaction mixtures (1 mL)
contained 1 M IPA, varying concentrations (0−16 mM) of
ketones (1a−6a), 0.05 mM PLP, and 0.05 mg/mL puriﬁed
enzyme in 50 mM potassium phosphate bu ﬀer, pH 8.0.
Reactions were performed at 56°C and started by addition of
the enzyme. At diﬀerent times (1 min, 2 min, 4 min, and 8
min), 200 μL samples were quenched by adding 50μL of 0.2
M NaOH. After centrifugation, 200 μLs a m p l e sw e r e
transferred to a 96-well microplate, and the absorbance was
measured in a plate reader. Samples from reaction mixtures
with 2 −16 mM ketone were diluted 2 −16-fold before
measurement. The depletion of ketones 1a, 2a, and 3a−6a
was detected at 290, 310, and 320 nm, respectively, and initial
rates were calculated using calibration curves (0−1 mM).
GC Analysis. The concentration and enantiopurity of
amines 1b−6b were determined by chiral GC. Calibration was
done with mixtures of racemic amines and the corresponding
ketones (0.2, 2, and 20 mM) dissolved in the standard reaction
system but without addition of the enzyme. Peaks for ketone,
(S)-amine, and (R)-amine were identiﬁed with commercial
standards. Because of the structural similarity to5b and 6b, 4b
was quantiﬁed using the same GC response curve. For details,
see Supporting Information Figures S3−S9.
Crystal Structures. Before crystallization, PjTA variants
W58G and W58M + F86L + R417L were further puriﬁed
using a Superdex 200 13/300 column (GE Healthcare),
equilibrated with 20 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 100 mM NaCl, and
20 μM PLP. Proteins were concentrated to∼8 mg/mL using a
Vivaspin Turbo 4 10Kﬁlter unit (Sartorius) and crystallized
using hanging drop vapor diﬀusion in 24-well LINBRO plates
(Molecular Dimensions Ltd). Per well, 1 μL of protein
solution was mixed with 1μL of reservoir solution containing
0.7−1.0 M sodium succinate, pH 7.6, as in our previous work
on the thermostable parentPjTA-R6.32 Crystals ofPjTA-R6 +
W58G appeared after two days and grew to an average size of
0.4 × 0.3 × 0.3 mm
3. Their yellow color indicated that PLP
was bound. Large yellow crystals were also obtained forPjTA-
R6 + W58M + F86L + R417L, with an average size of 0.3×
0.3 × 0.2 mm3. Attempts to obtain structural information on
the binding mode of the external aldimine included several
soaking experiments with the amino donor IPA, the ketones1a
and 2a, or the amines 1b and 2b for variants PjTA-R6 +
W58M + F86L + R417L and PjTA-R6 + W58G. X-ray
diﬀraction data were collected at beamlines I24 and I04 at
Diamond Light Source (Oxford, UK). The diﬀraction data
were indexed and integrated using xia2/Dials
43 and then scaled
and merged with Aimless44 from the CCP4 software suite.45
The crystals of PjTA-R6 + W58G andPjTA-R6 + W58M +
F86L + R417L belonged to the same space group asPjTA-R6,
with nearly identical unit cell dimensions, allowing thePjTA-
R6 structure (PDB 6TB1) to be used for initial reﬁnement and
electron density map calculations. Subsequently, the structures
were adjusted by model building to replace the side chains of
the mutated residues. After a few cycles of reﬁnement with
RefMac5
46 followed by model building and water placement
with Coot,47 the structure was completed. A summary of data
collection is provided in Table S3. Figures showing crystal
structures were produced with PyMOL.48

any of the ketones1a−6a as substrates for transamination to
1b−6b, respectively.
Derivatives with an expanded substrate acceptance were
predicted using Rosetta in a single dock-and-design step.49
Rosetta design calculations were performed for each of the
substrates 1a−6a by optimizing the active site for binding of
the corresponding external aldimine intermediates1EA−6EA
(Figure S1). Reshaping the binding pocket of PjTA-R6 was
mainly aimed at alleviating steric hindrance caused by the
bulky hydrophobic substituent on the carbonyl carbon of the
substrate. Based on structural inspection of the crystallographic
structure of the external aldimine formed from 6-amino-
hexanoic acid by PjTA (PDB 6G4E), the search space
comprised residues near the binding site (Table S1).
For each ligand, 3 −5 independent dock-and-design runs
were performed, and in each run, 4−6 active site residues were
allowed to mutate. The number of runs and the identity of the
residues selected for mutagenesis were case-speciﬁc for each
compound (Table S1).
The runs generated approximately 100−400 unique primary
designs per ligand. These designs were ranked on the basis of
their Rosetta interface energy, and the top 10−20 enzyme
variants were selected. The resulting designed libraries
contained mutations on positions Met54, Leu57, Trp58,

dataset. In total, 70 Rosetta designs were selected, which
included 40 designs with diﬀerent sequences because some
designs for diﬀerent substrates had the same sequence.
Experimental Veriﬁcation of Amine Synthesis.All 40
unique designed mutants were constructed by site-directed
mutagenesis. They expressed well in the soluble form inE. coli
and were puri ﬁed (Table 1). All but two of the mutant
enzymes showed the desired catalytic activity and displayed
high enantioselectivity (ee > 99%) for the production of chiral
amines 1b−6b. Amine yields in these asymmetric trans-
formation reactions varied from 1−86%, the latter value being
similar to what was obtained withPjTA-R6 in the synthesis of
(S)-1-phenylethylamine from its preferred substrate acetophe-
none. Reactions were done with 1 M IPA in the presence of
20% DMSO, indicating that the robustness that was
engineered previously intoPjTA-R6 was well maintained.
Gratifyingly, there was reasonable agreement between the
docking results and yields in amine synthesis (Figure 1). In
general, better Rosetta interface energies of the external
aldimines 1EA−6EA correlated with higher yields in amination
reactions. The best variant for the synthesis of amines1b−6b
either was the top-ranking variant (for compounds2, 4, and5)
or occurred among the top-ranking variants (compounds1, 3,
and 6) based on the interface energy (Table 1). This indicates
that the computed Rosetta interface energies can be helpful to
distinguish the best-performing variants among the larger
numbers of primary designs generated using the Rosetta search
algorithm.
The trend between these docking scores and experimental
yields was not followed by all redesignedPjTA-R6 derivatives.
A possible cause could be that underperforming variants are
less stable and inactivated under the harsh conditions of the
amination reactions (56°C, 1 M IPA, 2−20% DMSO). Since
the selection of designs for experimental veriﬁcation was based
on scoring of Rosetta interface energies and did not consider
possible eﬀects of mutations on stability, we examined the
thermostability of all the designedPjTA-R6 variants (Table 1).
Only 3 out of 40 variants had substantially lower thermo-
stability than PjTA-R6 (mutants 19, 32, and 33;ΔT
m
app from
−34 to −32 °C). Of the other 37 designs, 22 had a modest
reduction of thermostability (ΔTm
app from −2t o −11 °C),
whereas 12 variants showed the same or slight increase in
stability.
The loss of thermostability of variants 19, 32, and 33 was
indeed accompanied by a detrimental eﬀect on the yield of
amine 4b under the harsh conditions of the reactions (56°C,
1M IPA, 2−20% DMSO) in comparison to variants that were
designed for the same product and showed higher stability
(variants 15−18) (Table 1). Nevertheless, the three unstable
variants still gave a higher yield of amine4b than the parent
PjTA-R6 enzyme, which may be due to some initial activity,
followed by inactivation under turnover conditions. Mutant 20
(ΔT
m
app = −8 °C) also was less thermostable than the parent
and gave a lower yield than expected from the trends shown in
Figure 1 (5EA).
To further examine the role of enzyme stability under
reaction conditions, three variants with di ﬀerent thermo-
stabilities were used to test the eﬀect of DMSO and/or IPA in
thermal shift assays, (i.e., variant 8, variant 19, and variant 20)
(Table S2). Variant 8 (Tm
app =8 0°C), which followed the trend
between yield and Rosetta interface energy (Figure 1, 4EA),
had normal stability in the presence of DMSO or IPA. It was
partially inactivated and showed reduced stability only after
prolonged incubation under reaction conditions. The less-
thermostable variant 19 (T
m
app =5 1°C) was partially unfolded
and very sensitive to a high concentration of IPA or DMSO, as
indicated by a further reduction of Tm
app (Table S2). Initial
ketone conversion activities in the presence of IPA and DMSO
were also determined, using a ketone concentration of 20 mM.
According to the Rosetta interface energies, variant 19 was
expected to be about half as active as variant 2, but its activity
with ketone 4a in the presence of DMSO and IPA (0.06 U/

mg) was more than 10-fold lower than with variant 2 (Tm
app =
85 °C), which had retained stability and activity under these
conditions (0.7 U/mg). In the presence of 20% DMSO and 1
M IPA, the initial rate of conversion of5a by variant 20 (Tm
app =
77 °C) was rather low (0.04 U/mg), and the yield of amine
was also lower than expected from the Rosetta interface energy
calculated for 5EA (Figure 1). These results indicate that the
reduced stability found with some variants was detrimental for
amination reactions due to the harsh reaction conditions and
explains some of the outliers in Figure 1. Besides loss of
stability, a possible cause of deviations from the relationship
between interface energy and performance in synthesis is the
occurrence of a structure unsuitable for catalysis (see below).
Causes and Eﬀects of Reduced Thermostabilities.A
closer inspection of mutants 32 and 33 revealed that a single
mutation is responsible for the drastic reduction in thermo-
stability. While mutants M54T + W58G + R417[L/I] showed
excellent yields in the production of4b, introducing mutation
F86[S/L] substantially lowered amine production and
decreased the Tm
app by more than 30 °C. The mutations
F86[L/S] were intended to alleviate steric clashes of Phe86
with the tetralin moiety (Figure S10). The structural models
showed that Phe86 has π−π interactions with Tyr20 and
Arg417. The latter in turn interacts with Asn87, which was
previously introduced by an S87N substitution that enhances
thermostability. Most other mutants carrying a substitution on
position F86 showed a small reduction in thermostability [25
F86X mutants showed decreased thermostability, whereas six
were more thermostable (cutoﬀ of 1 °C)]. In variants 5 and
26, which maintained Phe86, mutation of Tyr151 led to a
reduction in thermostability, which we attribute to the loss of
an interaction via a water molecule with the phosphate of the
PLP group (Figure S11).50 Overall, we found the template
PjTA-R6 to be robust enough to accept the majority of the
proposed mutations with no substantial decrease inTm
app, but
the eﬀect of some of the mutations on the thermostability of
the enzyme was diﬃcult to predict. This especially holds for
variants carrying multiple mutations that remove and create
interactions that contribute to stability.
Rationalization of the Observed Activities.To examine
if the observed activities of the Rosetta designs can be
rationalized, we inspected the predicted structures (Figure 2).
Variant PjTA-R6 + W58M + F86L + R417L was the best-
performing mutant for the asymmetric synthesis of1b, giving
an amine yield of 72%. In this and other designs optimized for
1b, mutation of Trp58 to Met turned out to be better for
accommodating 1EA than mutation W58G, which also
occurred frequently ( e.g., PjTA-R6 + W58G + F86L +
R417L; 49% yield). While mutation W58G only eliminates
steric hindrance, mutation W58M maintains a more hydro-
phobic binding site in addition to eliminating protein−ligand
steric clashes ( Figure S11 ). This should lead to better
hydrophobic contacts with the propyl substituent on the
carbonyl carbon of1b. The larger cavity produced by mutation
W58G will require more water molecules to be displaced upon
substrate binding than the smaller cavity left by mutation
W58M and oﬀers fewer stabilizing van der Waals interactions.
In further engineering eﬀorts of PjTA-R6 aimed at improving
activity with substrates where the large substituent is a phenyl
group, the mutation W58M should be considered.
Ketones containing the indane (2a) or tetralin (3a−6a)
group required a PjTA-R6 variant with mutation W58G to
function as an amino acceptor. In the external aldimine form,
the aromatic ring of indane or tetralin must bind in the large
binding pocket for production of the (S)-enantiomer of the
amine. Unlike the aromatic ring in1EA, the indane and tetralin
bicyclic structures of 2EA−6EA allow no rotational mobility
for the aromatic ring, causing steric hindrance with Trp58. The

W58G single mutation was enough to alleviate this steric
hindrance, and the PjTA-R6 + W58G mutant produced
enantiopure (S)-amines 2b−6b in yields ranging from 29 to
86% (Table 1). Additional mutations on top of W58G also
gave active variants for conversion of ketones2a−6a to amines
but did not have a further beneﬁcial eﬀect, which was reﬂected
in both the Rosetta interface energy and the experimental data.
All variants carrying multiple mutations remained active and
highly enantioselective.
From the experimentally tested mutant library of 40 unique
variants (70 diﬀerent enzyme−ligand combinations), only two
variant−ligand combinations did not exhibit catalytic activity
toward the intended compound. The L57D + Y151F (mutant
6) and L57E + W58G + Y151F + R417K (mutant 26)
derivatives of PjAT-R6 were inactive on 2a (Figure 1), and
neither was capable of accommodating2EA in a catalytic pose,
as conﬁrmed by visual inspection of the designed structure
(Figure S12). In variant PjTA-R6 + L57D + Y151F, the
aromatic ring of the bicyclic indane group of2EA cannot be
accommodated due to steric clashes with Trp58, which the
mutations L57D + Y151F did not alleviate. Thus, no catalytic
pose was obtained in the docking procedure, rendering the
calculated Rosetta interface energy for this mutant irrelevant
for predicting catalytic potential. Furthermore, mutation L57D
introduced a hydrogen bond between the side chains of Asp57
and Thr324, which might cause the mutant to be inactive even
if the steric clashes with Trp58 were to be alleviated. Residue
Thr324 is believed to assist Lys287 in catalysis by forming a
hydrogen bonding network.
19 Glu57 in variant PjTA-R6 +
L57E + W58G + Y151F + R417K can be disruptive for the
very same reasons. Additionally, the formation of a salt bridge
between Glu57 and Lys417 may prevent free movement of
Glu57 upon substrate binding, causing steric clashes with the
indane moiety, rendering the enzyme inactive (Figure S12).
The steric clashes were reﬂected in the poor interface energy of
mutant PjTA-R6 + L57E + W58G + Y151F + R417K (Table 1
and Figure 1). Thus, for the two designs, we propose a
combination of steric hindrance and disruption of catalytic
conformations as the cause of inactivity in the production of
2b.
The computational framework also yielded PjTA-R6
mutants suitable for the production of3b. Due to the bicycle
rigidity, the aromatic ring of the tetralin moiety has steric
clashes with Trp58 of PjTA-R6 ( Figure 2 ), which were
eliminated by mutation W58G. The tetralin diﬀers from the
native substrate 6-aminohexanoic acid in that the latter is
ﬂexible and points outward into the tunnel where it forms a
salt bridge with Arg417, thus avoiding steric clashes with
Trp58 (Figure S13). In fact, the best variant for the production
of 3b was the single mutantPjTA-R6 + W58G, and additional
mutations did not improve the yield. Furthermore, a design
run in which Trp58 was not allowed to mutate did not result in
designs with a good docking score (Table S1).
The diﬀerent positions of the methoxy group attached to the
tetralin moiety in intermediates4EA, 5EA, and 6EA created
distinctive trends. Most of the mutants designed to
accommodate 4EA showed higher yields than designs for
5EA or 6EA. This di ﬀerence can be rationalized by the
position of the methoxy group in the tetralin moiety. The 5-
methoxy substituent on the phenyl group of 4EA points
toward the binding site entrance, making it easier toﬁt 4EA in
the large pocket (Figures 2D and S14) than 5EA or 6EA.I n
other variants, the position of the methoxy group could act in
favor of6EA; the mutation R417Q was found to be beneﬁcial
for accommodating6EA, increasing the product yield from 4%
(mutant 34) to 11% (mutant 39) (Table 1). The side chain
−NH
2 of Gln417 can form a hydrogen bond with the oxygen
lone pairs of−OMet (O−H distance of 2.0 Å) in the case of
6EA, but such a hydrogen bond would not form with4EA as
the −OMet is too far away (>5Å) (Figure S14B). Accordingly,
in the series M54T + W58G + R417X, where X = L, I, and Q,
the product yields decreased from 78 to 1% (Table 1). It must
be noted that the abovementioned rationalization only
considers protein −ligand binding interactions of catalytic
conformations of the complex but not the intrinsic ligand
reactivities as the cause for diﬀerences in the observed reaction
yields.
Eﬀect of Mutations on the Hydrophobicity of the
Binding Site.As mentioned above, most mutants with better
Rosetta interface energy scores were better at converting
ketones 1a−6a to the corresponding amines, and some variants
deviating from this trend had a reduced thermostability. To
explain a few outliers that dot not have a decreased
thermostability, that is, red circles in the3EA, 4EA,o r 5EA
datasets (Figure 1), we examined if the number of water
molecules that would need to be displaced for the tetralin
moiety to ﬁt in the binding pocket could play a role (Figure
S15). A large displacement of water molecules may
signiﬁcantly impact the binding energy of ligands.
51,52 We
used ns-scale MD simulations to quantify the diﬀerence in the
water-accessible volumes of the Rosetta-generated structures
(Figure S16). Although this approach did not explain the
outliers of 3EA, 4EA,o r 5EA, when considering all variants
(outliers or not), we did see a weak trend in the plot of the
average diﬀerence in the number of water molecules between
the enzyme−PMP complex and the enzyme−external aldimine
complex against the experimental yield ( Figure S17). The
trend is weak, but it might be worth considering in further
studies because water displacement upon substrate binding
may contribute to a larger energy barrier that is not accounted
for in the Rosetta calculations.
53
Crystal Structures Conﬁrm Local Changes that Create
Space. To further examine the structural basis of the activity
with bulky amines and the accuracy of the Rosetta predictions,
we determined crystal structures of thePjTA-R6 + W58G and
PjTA-R6 + W58M + F86L + R417L variants. Crystallization
conditions were as reported earlier.
32 Only structures with the
PLP- or PMP-bound enzyme were obtained; attempts to
obtain structures of PjTA-R6 variants with bound external
aldimines by brieﬂy soaking crystals with substrates failed. The
crystal structures for the two best variants were reﬁned to 1.7 Å
resolution with anR-factor of 0.173 (R
free = 0.191) forPjTA-
R6 + W58G and to 1.9 Å resolution with anR-factor of 0.177
(Rfree = 0.207) forPjTA-R6 + W58M + F86L + R417L (Table
S3).
The PjTA-R6 + W58G structure contains the PLP cofactor
as internal aldimine with PLP covalently linked to Lys287,
while the PjTA-R6 + W58M + F86L + R417L structure
contains PMP as a result of the soaking with1b. Similar to
what was found in previous work,19 the inserted mutations did
not aﬀect the overall backbone conformation of thesePjTA-R6
mutants in comparison to thePjTA-R6 structure. All mutated
residues showed well-de ﬁned electron density, allowing
unambiguous assignment of their side chain conformations.
The PjTA-R6-W58G crystal structure was in agreement with
the Rosetta-predicted structure (RMSD = 0.31 Å) and showed

no deviations from thePjTA-R6 structure beyond the aﬀected
residues (Figure 3). Residue Trp58 is located deep in each
subunit, above Lys287 and the PLP cofactor, and participates
in the formation of the large binding pocket. By enlarging this
pocket, mutation W58G contributes to an increase in the
active site volume from 669 Å
3 in PjTA-R6 to 768 Å3 in the
PjTA-R6 + W58G variant, as calculated with PyVOL54 (PLP-
omitted). This reduces the steric hindrance that interferes with
the binding of bulky aromatic substrates. The mutation thus
facilitates accommodation of the bicyclic structure of the
external aldimine formed with compound3a.
The PjTA-R6 + W58M + F86L + R417L structure is also in
agreement with the Rosetta prediction (RMSD = 0.32 Å), with
negligible diﬀerences in side chain orientations (not shown).
The mutations increased the active site volume (PLP omitted)
from 669 Å
3 to 1187 Å 3. Superimposition of the crystal
structure with Rosetta-docked poses for1EA showed that the
substrate’s phenyl ring is oriented toward the additional space
in the large binding pocket obtained by replacement of Trp58
with a methionine. The propyl group is placed in the small
binding pocket, which shows a slight increase in volume due to
mutation F86L (Figure 4C). Mutation R417L further increases
the active site volume by removing a constriction to the large
binding pocket (Figure 4D). Thus, the W58M, F86L, and
R417L mutations reshape the active site and reduce steric
hindrance, which is necessary for accommodating intermediate
1EA and enables amine synthesis.
Yields in Amine Synthesis. In agreement with the
purpose of the computational design work, the designed
mutants gave higher yields of amines 1b−6b in IPA-driven
transamination reactions thanPjTA-R6. However, yields were
still modest in most cases. For example, only up to 29% yield
was achieved in the synthesis of 5b (Table 1). Reaction
progress curves showed that under standard conditions
(Scheme 2), accumulation of amine in the reaction mixtures
did not increase after 24 h even for the best substrate−mutant
combinations (Figure 5A). Furthermore, even over theﬁrst 1−
4 h reaction time, amination activities were lower than
expected from kinetic parameters determined under initial rate
conditions (Table 2).
To identify the cause of partial conversion and low reaction
rates and to ﬁnd possible remedies, diﬀerent measures were
examined. We tested if improvement of yield could be
achieved by extending reaction times after addition of fresh
enzyme (1 mg), PLP (0.5 mM) or IPA (0.5 M). Also doubling
the amount of enzyme added at the beginning and removing
acetone by performing the reactions under low air pressure (40
kPa) during the ﬁrst 24 h incubation time were attempted.
However, neither of these measures had an eﬀect on the yield.
The pH of the reaction mixtures remained constant. In
contrast, when ketones (20 mM) were added again after 24 h
reaction time, production of amines continued with all six
substrates (Figure 5B, Table 2). The increase in amine product
concentration after ketone addition suggests that the 24 h
reactions had reached thermodynamic equilibrium.

here, [Am] and [Ac] are the concentrations of amine and
acetone, respectively, and [K] and [IPA] are the remaining
concentrations of ketone and IPA, respectively. [IPA]
0 and
[K]0 are the added concentrations of IPA and ketones,
respectively. KQ values were calculated assuming [Ac] = [Am],
[IPA] = [IPA]0 − [Am], and [K] = [K]0 − [Am]. Since KQ
values at 24 h were higher than at 48 h (Table 2), only the
former can represent equilibrium. Possibly, the enzyme loses
activity in the 24−48 h interval, where the enzyme is exposed
to a higher concentration (>20 mM) of the substrate. The
results suggest that the 24 h yields reported inTable 1for each
substrate are not limited by catalytic activity but by the
reaction mixtures approaching thermodynamic equilibrium.
■ DISCUSSION
The aim of this work was to explore the use of computational
design with the Rosetta search algorithm for broadening the
substrate scope of a transaminase. For this, we usedPjTA-R6
as the template because its engineered stability should result in
high mutability.
32 The protocol avoided multiple iterations and
manual selection of mutations by employing Rosetta enzyme
design to obtain, in a single step, variants that catalyze
amination of structurally demanding ketones. The presented
methodology for broadening the substrate scope showed a
high hit rate (68 out of 70 designs were successful) and good
predictive power ( Figure 1). The screening framework is
computationally inexpensive ( ∼2 CPU hours per enzyme
variant using the HP workstation Z4 with an Intel Xeon W-
2135 processor) and can easily be parallelized using multiple
cores for high-throughput screening. Another attractive feature
of the protocol is that combinations of mutations can be found
using the Rosetta search algorithm, without the need to
preselect them by rational inspection; only the search space
needs to be deﬁned. Other useful methodologies for predicting
the catalytic potential of ω-TA variants (using a di ﬀerent
intermediate) are computationally more expensive (e.g., ∼60
CPU hours per enzyme variant in the methodology described
by Vosset al.
17) or make use of coarser categorizations such as
active vs inactive in the work of Sirinet al.18 and high-vs low-
reactivity grouping used by Hanet al.21 A study in which the
activity toward 2-acetylbiphenyl ketone was engineered in
Vf TA followed an approach in which mutations were added in
a stepwise manner, without predicting activity for a large
number of variants as a ranking tool.
20
We chose the external aldimine as the ligand for the docking
calculations because its conversion to the geminal diamine
intermediate in the amine synthesis half-reaction involves a
high-energy transition state.
19 Thus, we hypothesized that
mutations that increase the stability of the external aldimine
complex would have an observable e ﬀect on product
formation.37 An added advantage of using a ligand covalently
bound to a rigid cofactor is that the position of the reactive
atom (C
α) is known beforehand, which reduces both the
docking search space and the number of variants that need to
be screened toﬁnd a good mutant. Although the methodology
described in this paper shows promising results for engineering
the ω-TA activity, special attention must be paid to the identity

of the substrates. The selected substrates are highly hydro-
phobic, which means modest direct participation from water
molecules, which are typically deleted before docking. The
substrates are also rigid, which, on one hand, further reduced
the necessary search space and, on the other hand, made
ﬁnding better variants more challenging. For substrates with
high ﬂexibility and high hydrogen-bonding potential, attention
should be paid to both correct modeling of implicit or explicit
water and including a good diversity of rotamers in the search
space. However, this remains a serious challenge, especially due
to the complexity of describing the behavior of water
molecules.
56
The design algorithm repeatedly suggested the replacement
of Trp58 and Phe86 of PjTA-R6 to smaller hydrophobic
residues (Table 1). In view of the sequence similarities of
Vf TA (PDB 4E3Q, 41% identity withPjTA-R6), CvTA (PDB
4A6T, 40% identity with PjTA-R6), and ω-TA from
Ochrobactrum anthropi (OaTA, PDB 5GHF, 64% identity
with PjTA-R6), it is not surprising that the equivalent positions
also strongly inﬂuenced activity when tested in these enzymes.
The best variant of OaTA possessed mutation W58A and
displayed a 105-fold higher activity in the synthesis of1b than
its parent, that is, 90 mU/mg.21 Although the curves inFigure
5 indicate that amine synthesis rates drop during conversion,
the initial rates of amine formation we summarize inTable 2
are higher or comparable to this value.
In OaTA variants designed for2a and 3a, mutation W58L
relieved steric hindrance in the large binding pocket and gave a
760-fold increase in activity with2a (3 mU/mg) and 210-fold
increase in activity with 3a (0.7 mU/mg) compared to the
parent.23 Replacing Trp58 of OaTA also promoted activity
with other aliphatic and aromatic ketones, as seen with
mutants W58L and W58A.
23,57 In Vf TA, the corresponding
Trp57 was mutated to Phe or Cys in several designs for the
synthesis of hydrophobic bulky amines.
15,20 In the redesign of
Vf TA for asymmetric synthesis of (1 S)-1-(1,1′-biphenyl-2-
yl)ethanamine, the best variant-containing mutation W57F
exhibited 1716-fold higher activity in comparison to the wild-
type Vf TA.20 Mutation W57G was beneﬁcial for the activity of
Vf TA toward diﬀerent aliphatic amines,58 while W57F gave
improved activity with diﬀerent aliphatic aldehydes and (R)-
ethyl 5-methyl 3-oxooctanoate. 18,59,60 The corresponding
position in CvTA is Trp60, and mutation W60C improved
the activity in the deamination of (S)-1-phenylethylamine and
the amination of a series of ketones.61 ω-TA mutants in which
the position equivalent to Phe86 ofPjTA is mutated have been
reported as well. Phe86 ﬂanks the small binding pocket and
was mutated to Leu to produce several variants of CvTA
(F88L) and Vf TA (F85L) that have higher activity with1a
and gave higher yield of1b.17,33 Replacement of Phe86 to the
smaller Leu was enough to create room for the propyl group of
1b in the small binding pocket. WhenVf TA was engineered to
produce 1b, the best variant-containing mutation F85L gave
53% yield. Similarly, the best variant ofCvTA possessed the
corresponding mutation F88L and exhibited 99% conversion
in the synthesis of 1b. Other small residues that improved
activity in the synthesis of bulky amines when replacing Phe86
are Ala
11,18,60 and Val.15
The computational approach presented in this work avoids
multiple design iterations and instead uses the Rosetta energy
function in a single dock-and-design step. Rosetta found
solutions that overlap with rational design approaches, pointing
at the conserved Trp and Phe residues in the large and small
binding pocket, respectively, as hotspots for selectivity
engineering of the well-studied fold type Iω-TAs. The results
show that it is possible to rapidly design transaminase variants
with improved activity in the production of bulky amines. The
structures predicted by Rosetta design calculations are in
agreement with experimental 3D structures as determined by
protein crystallography and explain the observed changes in
activity. We advocate that active site redesign by covalent
docking of external aldimines with simultaneous sequence
optimization o ﬀers a cheap and straightforward design
methodology that can be applied to broaden the substrate
scope of transaminases.
