ABSTRACT
Objective: Mitochondrial pyruvate is a critical intermediary metabolite in gluconeogenesis, lipogenesis, and NADH production. As a result, the
mitochondrial pyruvate carrier (MPC) complex has emerged as a promising therapeutic target in metabolic diseases. Clinical trials are currently
underway. However, recentin vitro data indicate that MPC inhibition diverts glutamine/glutamate away from glutathione synthesis and toward
glutaminolysis to compensate for loss of pyruvate oxidation, possibly sensitizing cells to oxidative insult. Here, we explored thisin vivousing the
clinically relevant acetaminophen (APAP) overdose model of acute liver injury, which is driven by oxidative stress.
Methods: We used pharmacological and genetic approaches to inhibit MPC2 and alanine aminotransferase 2 (ALT2), individually and
concomitantly, in mice and cell culture models and determined the effects on APAP hepatotoxicity.
Results: We found that MPC inhibition sensitizes the liver to APAP-induced injuryin vivoonly with concomitant loss of alanine aminotransferase
2 (ALT2). Pharmacological and genetic manipulation of neither MPC2 nor ALT2 alone affected APAP toxicity, but liver-speciﬁc double knockout
(DKO) signiﬁcantly worsened APAP-induced liver damage. Further investigation indicated that DKO impaired glutathione synthesis and increased
urea cycle ﬂux, consistent with increased glutaminolysis, and these results were reproduciblein vitro. Finally, induction of ALT2 and post-
treatment with dichloroacetate both reduced APAP-induced liver injury, suggesting new therapeutic avenues.
Conclusions: Increased susceptibility to APAP toxicity requires loss of both the MPC and ALT2in vivo, indicating that MPC inhibition alone is
insufﬁcient to disrupt redox balance. Furthermore, the results from ALT2 induction and dichloroacetate in the APAP model suggest new metabolic
approaches to the treatment of liver damage.

1. INTRODUCTION
Acetaminophen (APAP; a.k.a. paracetamol) is one of the most widely
used antipyretic and analgesic drugs in the world. In a cross-sectional
survey of the US population, for example,>20% of both adults and
children reported use of APAP at least once in the preceding seven
days [1,2] and similar data have been published from other countries
[3e5]. However, APAP overdose can cause severe liver injury leading
to acute liver failure (ALF) and death [6].
Oxidative stress is believed to be the central driver of APAP hepato-
toxicity [ 7e9]. Cytochrome P450 enzymes (P450s), particularly
CYP2E1, convert APAP to the reactive intermediate N-acetyl-p-ben-
zoquinone imine (NAPQI) [ 10,11] which depletes the antioxidant
glutathione and then binds to mitochondrial proteins [7,12e14]. The
mitochondrial protein alkylation coincides with and likely causes
reduced respiration [15] and an increase in mitochondrial reactive
oxygen species (ROS) production [7,16]. The redox imbalance that
results from combined glutathione depletion and increased ROS rapidly
promotes phosphorylation and activation of the c-Jun N-terminal ki-
nases (JNK) 1/2 [17,18], which translocate to mitochondria and further
reduce mitochondrial respiration via SHP1-mediated inhibition of Src
[19,20]. Other kinases are also activated by the oxidative stress and

may exacerbate the injury [ 21e23]. Eventually, the mitochondrial
membrane permeability transition occurs [24], mitochondria swell, and
their membranes rupture [25]. The latter releases intermembrane and
matrix proteins into the cytosol, including endonucleases which then
cleave nuclear DNA [26]. Ultimately, the damaged hepatocytes die by
necrosis [27,28]. Thus, anything that upsets mitochondrial metabolism
or cellular redox regulation would be expected to alter APAP toxicity.
The carbon backbone of pyruvate can enter the mitochondrial TCA
cycle via either pyruvate carboxylation or oxidation and is an important
substrate for gluconeogenesis, lipid synthesis, and NADH generation
for the electron transport chain (ETC) [29]. Most pyruvate is produced
in the cytosol as a product of glycolysis or conversion from lactate and
is taken up by mitochondria via the mitochondrial pyruvate carrier
(MPC) complex. Interestingly, in cultured cells and in hepatic tumors,
genetic deletion of the MPC or pharmacological MPC inhibition not only
blocks pyruvate oxidation [ 30,31], but also decreases glutathione
synthesis and disrupts redox balance [32,33]. Thus, due to the role of
mitochondrial dysfunction in APAP-induced liver injury and the critical
importance of glutathione as a nucleophile and antioxidant in resis-
tance to APAP, we hypothesized that preventing mitochondrial pyru-
vate uptake by disrupting the MPC would worsen mitochondrial
damage and oxidative stress after APAP overdose and therefore
exacerbate APAP toxicity.
2. MATERIALS AND METHODS
2.1. Animals
WT male C57BL/6J mice between the ages of 7 e8 weeks were
purchased from the Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME, USA) and
used for experiments at 8e10 weeks of age. The generation of mice
harboring aﬂoxed allele of the gene encoding ALT2 (Gpt2) derived from
Gpt2 germline KO mice generated by the Knockout Mouse Project
Repository (KOMP) (project ID CSD24977) has recently been described
[34]. Similarly, the generation of Mpc2 ﬂoxed mice using ES cells
obtained from the European Conditional Mouse Mutagenesis Program
(EUCOMM) (International Knockout Mouse Consortium [IKMC] project
89918, catalog no. MAE-1900) has been described [35]. Transgenic
mice expressing Cre under control of the albumin promoter (B6.Cg-
Speer6-ps1
Tg(Alb-cre)21Mgn/J; Jackson Laboratory stock number:
003574) were bred with these animals to create liver-speciﬁc KO mice.
Combined liver-speciﬁc Gpt2/Mpc2 double KO (DKO) mice were then
generated by intercrossing the two liver-speciﬁc single gene knock-
outs. Littermate mice not expressing Cre (ﬂ/ﬂ mice) were used as
controls. Male mice were used in all experiments because female mice
are resistant to APAP hepatotoxicity [36]. All MPC2 KO and DKO mice
and their WT littermate controls were used at 10e16 weeks of age. All
Gpt2 (ALT2) KO mice were used between 14 and 28 weeks of age.
Animals were kept in a temperature-controlled 12 h light/dark-cycle
room with ad libitum access to food and water. For BCLA time
course and doseeresponse experiments, fed WT mice were treated
with BCLA dissolved in 1/C2 phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) at the
indicated doses or PBS alone and liver tissue was collected at the
indicated time points. For APAP experiments, mice were fasted over-
night, then treated i.p. with 300 mg APAP per kg body mass (mg/kg)
dissolved in PBS. Some WT mice were pre-treated i.p. with the
speciﬁed doses of BCLA or PBS or with 100 mg/kg dexamethasone
(Dex) for the indicated times before APAP. Others received 30 mg/kg
MSDC, 318 mg/kg NAC, or appropriate vehicle 2 h after APAP. NAC and
NAC vehicle (0.9% saline) were administered i.v. All other treatments
were given i.p. Blood and liver tissue were collected at 6 h post-APAP.
Some liver pieces wereﬁxed in 10% phosphate-buffered formalin for
histology, while others wereﬂash-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored
at /C0 80
/C14 C until biochemical analyses. All study protocols were
approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees of the
University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences and Washington University
in St. Louis. The Animal Research: Reporting of In Vivo Experiments
(ARRIVE) guidelines were consulted during manuscript preparation and
we have attempted to conform to those recommendations.
2.2. Biochemistry
Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) was measured in serum using a kit
from MedTest Dx, Inc. (Canton, MI, USA), according to the manufac-
turer’s instructions. Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) was measured in
serum as previously described [37]. For hepatic ALT activity, frozen
liver tissue was homogenized in 25 mM HEPES buffer with 5 mM EDTA
(pH 7.4), 0.1% CHAPS, and protease inhibitors using a bead homog-
enizer (Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc, Waltham, MA). After centrifugation at
10,000/C2 g and 4
/C14 C for 5 min, ALT was measured in the supernatant
using the MedTest kit mentioned above. Protein concentration in the
lysates was measured using the bicinchoninic acid (BCA) assay and
was used to normalize hepatic ALT activity. Ketones were measured
using the EnzyChrom Ketone Body Assay (BioAssay Systems, Hayward,
CA USA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
2.3. Cell culture
Primary mouse hepatocytes were isolated from WT mice using a
collagenase perfusion technique, as previously described [38], and
used in experiments no more than 24 h after isolation. HepG2 cells
overexpressing CYP2E1 were purchased from Hera Biolabs (Lexington,
KY USA) and grown in Williams’ Medium E with 5% fetal bovine serum,
glutamate, penicillin/streptomycin, and insulin. Regular HepG2 cells
were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas,
VA USA) and grown in the same medium. Cells were treated as
described in the results section.
2.4. Histology
Formalin-ﬁxed tissue was embedded in parafﬁn wax and 5
mm sec-
tions were mounted on glass slides for hematoxylin and eosin (H&E)
staining. H&E staining was performed using a standard protocol. Ne-
crosis was quantiﬁed by two independent, blinded, fellowship-trained
hepatobiliary pathologists. Slides were imaged using a Labomed
Lx400 microscope with a 16 MP Atlas digital camera and Pixel Pro
software (Labo America, Fremont, CA USA).
2.5. Western blotting
Western blotting was performed as we previously described [39]. The
primary antibodies against phospho-JNK (Cat. No. 4668), JNK (Cat. No.
9252), and MPC2 (Cat. No. 46141) were purchased from Cell Signaling
Technology (Danvers, MA, USA) and used at 1:1,000 dilution in TBS-T
with 5% milk. The Cyp2e1 antibody was purchased from Proteintech
(Rosemont, IL, USA) (Cat. No. 19937-1-AP). The ALT2 antibody was
from Sigma (St. Louis, MO, USA) (Cat. No. HPA051514). Secondary
antibodies were purchased from Li-Cor Biotechnology (Lincoln, NE,
USA) and Cell Signaling Technology. Total protein was stained with
Coomassie blue. All blots were imaged using a Li-Cor Odyssey in-
strument (phospho-JNK and JNK) or an Invitrogen iBright FL1500 (all
other blots and protein images).
2.6. Plasma metabolomics for amino acids and pyruvate
Amino acids were extracted from 20
mL of plasma with 200 mLo f
methanol containing Try-d8 (1600 ng), Phe-d8 (160 ng), Tyr-d4
(160 ng), Leu-d3 (320 ng), Ile-13C6,15N (160 ng), Met-d3 (160 ng),

(400 ng), Lys-d8 (400 ng), and pyruvic acid-13C5 (80 ng) as the in-
ternal standards for Try, Phe, Tyr, Leu, Ile, Met, Val, Glu, Thr, Ser, Asp,
Ala, Asn, Gly, Gln, Pro, Cit, His, Arg, Orn, Lys, and pyruvic acid (Pyr)
respectively. The sample aliquots for pyruvic acid were derivatized with
o-phenylenediamine to improve mass spectrometric sensitivity. Quality
control (QC) samples were prepared by pooling aliquots of study
samples and injected after every four study samples to monitor in-
strument performance throughout these analyses.
The analysis was performed on a Shimadzu 20AD HPLC system and a
SIL-20AC autosampler coupled to 4000Qtrap mass spectrometer (AB
Sciex) operated in positive multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) mode.
Data processing was conducted with Analyst 1.6.3 (Applied Bio-
systems). The relative quantiﬁcation data for all analytes were pre-
sented as the peak ratio of each analyte to the internal standard. The
Metabolomics Facility of Washington University School of Medicine
performed the analysis.
2.7. qPCR
RNA was extracted from liver tissue using the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen,
Vinlo, Netherlands). mRNA levels forGclc (Fwd, 5

GCC TCA ATT TCT) were measured by real-time quantitative PCR using
the Applied Biosystems PowerSYBR Green PCR Master Mix (Thermo
Fisher, Waltham, MA USA) according to the manufacturer ’s in-
structions. The data were normalized to Gapdh and expressed as
arbitrary units (AU) relative to the appropriate control group.
2.8. Statistical analyses
Sample sizes for the pharmacologic treatment experiments were
determined a prioriand are indicated in the caption for eachﬁgure. In
each case, the difference in serum ALT between the vehicle control
and drug-treated groups was the primary comparison of interest and
the experiments were designed to achieve a minimum of 80% power
at
a ¼ 0.05 using our historical ALT data to predict variation. Sample
sizes for the KO and DKO animals were determined by litter size,
frequency, and availability for this project. Secondary analyses were
carried out on the same samples. Statistical signiﬁcance was assessed
using either Student’s t-test or one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA)
with post-hoc Dunn’s test or Tukey’s test. For non-normally distributed
data, the ManneWhitney U-test or the KruskaleWallis test were used.
All statistical analyses were performed using SigmaPlot 12.5 (Systat,
San Jose, CA, USA) or Prism 10.0 (GraphPad, Boston, MA, USA). P-
values are indicated in theﬁgures or ﬁgure captions.
3. RESULTS
3.1. MPC inhibition and deletion have no effect on APAP
hepatotoxicity
Prior work has suggested that enhanced hepatic pyruvate metabolism
after APAP overdose may have hepatoprotective effects. For example,
genetic deletion of pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4 (PDK4), which
inhibits mitochondrial pyruvate oxidation, protected mice from APAP-
induced injury [40]. To further test the effects of enhancing pyruvate
oxidation, we post-treated mice with either vehicle or the PDK inhibitor
dichloroacetate (DCA) 2 h after APAP in order to increase pyruvateﬂux
through the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDHC). Consistent with
the prior work using PDK4 KO mice, DCA reduced APAP hepatotoxicity
as indicated by serum ALT (Figure 1A). Given thisﬁnding, one might
predict that loss of mitochondrial pyruvate metabolism would exac-
erbate APAP-induced liver injury. The mitochondrial pyruvate carrier
(MPC) catalyzes the transport of pyruvate into the mitochondrial matrix
and is composed of two proteins (MPC1 and MPC2) that form a het-
erodimeric complex in the inner mitochondrial membrane [29]. Thus,
we treated liver-speci ﬁc MPC2 KO mice with APAP to determine
whether loss of mitochondrial pyruvate metabolism might affect the
response to APAP mediated hepatotoxicity. Consistent with prior re-
ports [35,41], MPC2 deletion resulted in instability and degradation of
MPC1 (Figure 1B), effectively leading to complete loss of the MPC
complex. However, MPC deﬁciency had no effect on APAP hepato-
toxicity at 6 h after treatment, within the timeframe when mitochon-
drial metabolism is most critical [ 7,8]. There were no signi ﬁcant
differences in serum ALT or hepatic necrosis, total glutathione,
oxidized glutathione, APAP-protein binding, or JNK activation between
MPC2 KO mice and WT littermate controls (Figure 1CeK).
Although uptake via the MPC is the primary source of mitochondrial
pyruvate, we have previously shown that cytosolic and mitochondrial
alanine-pyruvate cycling catalyzed by alanine transaminase enzymes
can partially circumvent the loss of MPC activity [35]. Indeed, shRNA-
mediated knockdown of alanine transaminase 2 (ALT2), which cata-
lyzes the transamination of alanine and
a-ketoglutarate to form pyru-
vate and glutamate in the mitochondrial matrix, further attenuates
mitochondrial pyruvateﬂux in MPC2-deﬁcient hepatocytes [35]. In the
present study, we found that ALT2 protein abundance was 1.9/C6 0.2-
fold greater in livers from MPC2 KO mice compared to WT mice after
APAP treatment ( Figure 1B and I), suggesting that mitochondrial
alanine-pyruvate cycling might be compensating for loss of the MPC
during APAP hepatotoxicity as well. Though we cannot rule out that
injury may have also contributed to ALT2 induction at this point, the data
induction of ALT2 in APAP toxicity may have been protective either way.
3.2. ALT2 inhibition and deletion have no effect on APAP
hepatotoxicity
The idea that increased ALT2 might have prevented increased injury in
the MPC2 KO mice led us to determine if increasing mitochondrial
alanine ﬂux is protective against APAP-induced injury more generally.
We pre-treated WT mice for 24 h with a large dose of dexamethasone
(Dex) followed by APAP. Large doses of Dex are known to strongly
induce ALT2 expression in the liver [ 42,43]. Importantly, western
blotting conﬁrmed an increase in hepatic ALT2 with Dex treatment and
the gold-standard for injury, histology, revealed that Dex administration
was indeed protective (Figure 2AeC).
We next used a pharmacological approach to suppress mitochondrial
alanine metabolism.
b-chloro-l-alanine (BCLA) is an alanine analog
that inhibits the enzyme’s activity [44]. Although it has been exten-
sively used in studies in vitro, we are not aware of any data in the
literature characterizing the doseeresponse and kinetics of BCLA in-
hibition of ALT activity in the liverin vivo. Thus, we ﬁrst performed
timing and doseeresponse studies to optimize dosing. The results
revealed that BCLA can inhibit ALT activity in the liver in mice, that the
effect is greater at 24 h post-BCLA treatment than an earlier time point,
and that /C21 50% inhibition can be achieved with a dose of 100 mg/kg
(Suppl. Fig. 1). Based on these data, we adopted a 24 h single-dose
(Figure 2 DeH) and 48 h two-dose pre-treatment regimen with
100 mg/kg BCLA to study the role of ALT in APAP toxicity. Consistent

with its action as an ALT inhibitor, BCLA reduced both serum and
hepatic ALT activity after APAP overdose (Figure 2D and E). However,
like MPC2 deletion, BCLA had no effect on injury as indicated by the
alternative serum liver injury biomarker LDH and by hepatic necrosis
(Figure 2FeH). Results from the two-dose 48 h BCLA pre-treatment
regimen were nearly identical (data not shown).
BCLA did not completely block hepatic ALT activity (Figure 2E). In
addition, it is possible that the drug cannot reach ALT2 within the
mitochondrial matrix. Thus, to ensure complete inhibition of ALT2, we
next used liver-speciﬁc ALT2 KO mice (Figure 2I). However, like MPC2
KO, there was no signiﬁcant effect of ALT2 deletion on APAP-induced
liver injury, as indicated by serum ALT (Figure 2J) and LDH (Figure 2K)
and by hepatic necrosis (Figure 2L,M). Although it may seem surprising
that ALT2 KO itself did not reduce serum ALT activity, this observation
is consistent with reports that ALT1 is the dominant isoform released
into serum [45e47], accounting for/C21 90% of ALT activity in circulation
after injury [47]. Thus, we continued to use serum ALT as our primary
measure of liver injury. We also conﬁrmed all ALT results with histo-
logical analysis. Altogether, these data indicate that neither MPC2
deletion nor ALT2 deﬁciency alone alters APAP hepatotoxicity but do
not rule out the possibility of complementary effects.
3.3. Combined MPC2/ALT2 deﬁciency worsens APAP-induced liver
injury
To determine if deletion of both MPC2 and ALT2 worsened APAP hep-
atotoxicity, we generated liver-speciﬁc ALT2/MPC2 double KO (DKO)
mice (Suppl. Fig. 2). In contrast to mice with only single deletion of MPC2
or ALT2, DKO mice had greater serum ALT activity and hepatic necrosis
after APAP overdose (Figure 3AeC). Importantly, they also had lower
total hepatic glutathione levels (Figure 3D). Glutathione reaches its nadir
with nearly complete loss by approximately 0.5 h post-APAP and then
recovers over the following 6 h [12]. Thus, these 6 h data suggest
impaired glutathione re-synthesis, possibly due to the diversion of
glutamate to
a-ketoglutarate (aKG) and away from glutathione synthesis
as we had initially hypothesized would happen with MPC inhibition.
Furthermore, these effects occurred despite less APAP-protein binding in
the DKO mice (Figure 3E). Because protein alkylation is the initiating
event in APAP hepatotoxicity, even greater injury may have been
observed had the level of protein binding been the same as in WT. Indeed,
when we normalized serum ALT to hepatic APAP-protein adducts, the
difference in means was even greater with a 4.9/C6 0.2-fold increase in
ALT in the DKO animals (mean/C6 SE) (Figure 3F).
The reason for the reduced adducts in DKO animals may have been
depletion of NADPH, which is necessary for the P450 catalysis that
produces NAPQI because the P450 catalytic cycle uses electrons from
NAPDH transferred via the enzyme P450 reductase. The protein levels
of CYP2E1e the primary enzyme that converts APAP to NAPQI [48] e
were the same between genotypes (Fig. G,H), demonstrating that the
lower NAPQI production and protein binding was not due to altered
CYP2E1 expression. Furthermore, lower NADPH levels have been re-
ported in MPC1-deﬁcient cells in vitro [33] and we observed NADPH
depletion in our DKO animals after APAP overdose as well (Figure 3I,J).
3.4. The mechanism of exacerbated injury in DKO mice may be
related to diversion of glutamate away from glutathione
Compensatory glutaminolysis at the expense of glutathione synthesis
has been previously reported in MPC1-deﬁcient hepatocytes in vitro
[32] and in other conditions in which mitochondrial pyruvate meta-
bolism was impaired [49]. Thus, we compared basal total hepatic
glutathione between DKO and WT mice and between HepG2 cells
treated with the combination of another MPC inhibitor, UK-5099, and
BCLA or vehicle to mimic combined MPC and ALT2 KO. Interestingly,
glutathione was 22/C6 5% (mean/C6 SE) lower in liver tissue from DKO
animals (Figure 4A) and almost undetectable in the UK/BCLA co-
treated cells ( Figure 4 B). Targeted plasma metabolomics also
revealed elevated urea cycle intermediates (citrulline, arginine, and
ornithine) in the untreated DKO mice (Table 1). While steady state
metabolite concentration is not equivalent to metabolicﬂux, the results
are consistent with increased disposal of ammonia from glutamate and
other amino acids that are being utilized to compensate for loss of
pyruvate and alanine entry into the TCA cycle. Unfortunately, urea,
potentially a more direct endpoint for urea cycle activity, could not be
measured in these samples because APAP overdose also causes
kidney damage, resulting in blood urea concentrations 2-3-fold greater
than control values [50]. It would be difﬁcult to disentangle the con-
tributions of the urea cycle and kidney damage to elevated urea levels.
Alternatively or in addition to increased ammonia disposal, altered
expression of glutathione synthesizing or metabolizing enzymes could
explain glutathione depletion in the DKO animals. To address these
possibilities, we measured mRNA for glutamate cysteine ligase (Gcl),
the rate-limiting enzyme in glutathione synthesis, and for glutathione
reductase (Gsr) in liver tissue from WT, MPC2 KO, ALT2 KO, and DKO
mice. Importantly, there were no differences in the expression of either
between any of the genotypes (Suppl. Fig. 3).
Importantly, post-treatment of cells with UK/BCLA after glutathione
depletion with buthionine sulfoximine (BSO) completely prevented
glutathione re-synthesis over the next 24 h (Figure 4C). Treatment with
500
mM BSO for 24 h almost fully depleted glutathione. Cells post-treated
with Veh control for an additional 24 h after removal of BSO recovered
approximately 30% of control glutathione content, but cells post-treated
with the combination of 25mM UK-5099 and 250mM BCLA instead of
vehicle failed to re-synthesize any (Figure 4C). Furthermore, APAP
toxicity was dramatically increased in HepG2 cells overexpressing
CYP2E1 when APAP was co-administered with UK and BCLA
(Figure 4 D,E), similar to the DKO mice. Importantly, CYP2E1-
overexpressing HepG2 cells were previously validated for the study of
APAP hepatotoxicity, with formation of APAP-protein adducts, mito-
chondrial damage, and cell death occurring similar to primary mouse and
human hepatocytes [51], and our preliminary doseeresponse and time
course data were consistent with those earlier results (Suppl. Fig. 5).
Collectively, the data presented are consistent with increased conversion
of glutamate and other amino acids to
a-keto acids to feed the TCA cycle,
leading to reduced glutamate availability for glutathione synthesis.
3.5. NAC still protects in MPC2 KO and DKO mice
NAC is currently the standard-of-care treatment for APAP overdose in
humans. It is generally believed to protect against APAP hepatotoxicity
by providing cysteine for re-synthesis of glutathione which can then
scavenge NAPQI and ROS. However, the doses of NAC given to APAP
overdose patients (140 mg/kg loading, followed by additional lower
doses) greatly exceed those required to replenish glutathione. In
addition, it has been reported that similar doses can increase ﬂux
through the PDHC in mice [52]. It has therefore been proposed that
large doses of NAC like those administered clinically protect against
APAP in part by increasing pyruvate oxidation [52,53] e an effect that
would require the MPC. To test this hypothesis more directly than in
prior work, we examined NAC protection in DKO mice and WT litter-
mate controls. Interestingly, NAC protected equally well in the two
genotypes (Figure 5A), despite using the same large dose (318 mg/kg)
employed in the prior work [53]. To our surprise, NAC also supported
glutathione re-synthesis in the DKO mice similar to the WT animals
(Figure 5B). These data suggest that while excess NAC may or may not

increase PDHC ﬂux, this is not required for NAC-mediated protection
after APAP hepatotoxicity.
4. DISCUSSION
There is much interest in the development of MPC-targeted drugs to
treat metabolic conditions in humans, including diabetes and liver dis-
ease [54,55], with some early-stage clinical trials completed [56]a n da
phase 3 trial currently underway (ClinicalTrials.gov ID: NCT03970031).
Because pyruvate can be converted to glucose through a series of steps
that begins with conversion to oxaloacetate within mitochondria,
inhibiting mitochondrial pyruvate uptake could reduce hyperglycemia
and its downstream adverse effects. Indeed, obesity- and
streptozotocin-induced hyperglycemia is attenuated in mice with liver-
speciﬁc MPC KO and after MPC inhibitor treatment [35,57]. MPC in-
hibitors also hold promise in treating nonalcoholic steatohepatitis
(NASH), as MPC deletion or inhibition protects mice from liver injury and
ﬁbrosis in preclinical NASH models [57e59]. However, given the central

importance of pyruvate in mitochondrial intermediary metabolism, there
are valid concerns regarding the safety of MPC inhibition.
For example, alterations in glutathione synthesis and redox status that
have been observed in cell culture studies [32,33] could predispose
patients to oxidative insults [55]. The cause of these changes in gluta-
thione during MPC inhibition appears to be an increase in glutaminolysis
(conversion of glutamine toa-KG through glutamate). Entry of amino
acids, particularly alanine and glutamine/glutamate, into the TCA cycle
can compensate for MPC deﬁciency [35,60e62]. However, increased
TCA ﬂux of glutamine and glutamate could also lead to decreased
glutamate availability for glutathione synthesis, which could be detri-
mental in some contexts. Indeed, two recent studies have demonstrated
that MPC inhibition leads to impaired glutathione synthesis and recycling
of oxidized glutathione in cultured cells [32,33]. Interestingly, however,
these effects were not observed in liver tissue from MPC1 KO mice
in vivo [32]. Based on our data, the explanation for this discrepancy
between cells and mice is likely compensation for loss of MPC activity by
ALT2 in the animals. ALT2 was roughly 2-fold elevated in our MPC2 KO
mice and there was no evidence of worsened glutathione depletion in
those animals after APAP overdose. However, when both MPC2 and
ALT2 were absent, hepatic glutathione decreased at baseline compared
to WT mice and re-synthesis after APAP-induced depletion was severely
impaired. Furthermore, the phenotype we observed in cells treated with
both UK-5099 and the ALT inhibitor BCLA was much more severe than in
prior studies using the MPC inhibitor alone. Altogether, our results
suggest that loss of both the MPC and ALT2 is required to alter
glutathione synthesis in hepatocytesin vivo. Thus, MPC inhibitors are
likely insufﬁcient to sensitize patients to oxidative insults, except possibly
in rare cases of individuals with one of several recessiveGpt2 poly-
morphisms that drastically reduce enzyme activity [63,64].
Although one might think fatty acid oxidation (FAO) can serve as a
source of acetyl-CoA for the TCA cycle and potentially also compensate
for MPC loss, FAO is inhibited in APAP toxicity [65e68] resulting in
lower ketones (Suppl. Fig. 6) among other effects and there was no
difference in serum ketones between DKO and WT mice in the present
study (Suppl. Fig. 6). Furthermore, FAO cannot serve as an anaplerotic
substrate for the TCA cycle to support anabolic functions like lipo-
genesis or gluconeogenesis. It is therefore unlikely that FAO can fully
compensate for impaired mitochondrial pyruvate and alanine meta-
bolism during APAP-induced injury.
Another novel ﬁnding from our study is that inducing expression of
ALT2 with a large dose of dexamethasone can reduce APAP-induced
liver injury. The mechanism of protection with ALT2 induction could be
enhanced glutathione re-synthesis due to the glutamate/glutamine-
sparing effect of pyruvate, as similar large doses of other glucocor-
ticoids have been shown to increase hepatic glutathione [ 69].
Although treatment of liver damage was not the focus of this study
and 24 h pre-treatment with Dex is not clinically feasible in the context
of acute APAP overdose, this result adds to a growing body of liter-
ature indicating that improving pyruvate entry and ﬂux in the TCA
cycle is protective against liver injury. For example, it was recently
demonstrated that mice deﬁcient in PDK4, which phosphorylates and
inhibits the PDHC, had much lower liver injury and oxidative stress
after APAP overdose than WT controls [40]. This ﬁnding is consistent
with the present data showing that a chemical inhibitor of PDK ac-
tivity, DCA, also reduced liver injury after APAP. Importantly, greater
glutathione re-synthesis was observed in the PDK4-de ﬁcient mice
[40], which is consistent with a glutathione-sparing effect of
increased pyruvate oxidation. Another group reported that exogenous
pyruvate and ethyl pyruvate are also protective against APAP and
NAPQI toxicity in mice and HepG2 cells, respectively [ 70]. Thus,

targeting pyruvate metabolism may be a promising novel approach to
treat APAP overdose in patients in combination with NAC.
The primary mechanism by which NAC protects against APAP hepa-
totoxicity is providing cysteine for the rapid re-synthesis of glutathione
[14,71,72]. However, it is often claimed that NAC is beneﬁcial in APAP
overdose patients even when administered late after overdose, when
APAP bioactivation and ROS production have already occurred [73,74].
There is also modest evidence that NAC is beneﬁcial for patients with
non-APAP acute liver damage, presumably unaccompanied by gluta-
thione depletion [75]. An alternative hypothesis to explain how NAC
protects in these scenarios is via increased pyruvate oxidation. For
example, Zwingmann and Bilodeau demonstrated that NAC increases
glucose ﬂux through the PDHC and TCA cycle and protects against
oxidative stress even in glutathione-replete mice [52]. The mechanism
by which NAC had this effect was unclear from their study but could
have been conversion of the excess cysteine to pyruvate. It was later
demonstrated that when equimolar doses of NAC and the tripeptide
glutathione were administered to mice separately after APAP overdose,
glutathione was more effective than NAC at reducing liver injury and it
increased TCA cycle ﬂux to a greater degree [ 53]. Furthermore,
increasing the NAC dose 3-fold to provide the same number of amino
acids as glutathione equalized their effects [53]. Based on this, it was
concluded instead that amino acids derived from NAC are used to
synthesize TCA cycle substrates which then enhance TCA cycleﬂux
[53]. This latter hypothesis is consistent with our observation that the
same large dose of NAC used in those studies protected equally well in
WT and DKO mice that cannot use cytosolic cysteine-derived pyruvate.
In addition, the fact that NAC also restored hepatic glutathione in DKO
mice is consistent with the possibility that some excess cysteine was
instead converted to glutamate, which could then be used in both
glutathione re-synthesis and the TCA cycle. However, a de ﬁnitive
mechanism by which NAC protects late after APAP overdose or in
glutathione-replete subjects cannot be determined from our data and
additional experiments are needed.
Finally, it is notable that ALT activity has been the primary serum
biomarker of liver injury since 1955 [76,77] but its metabolic and
physiological roles in liver injury and disease are rarely considered, even
though it is an important metabolic enzyme within the tissue [77].
Interestingly, it was recently reported that hepatic ALT1 and ALT2
contribute to hyperglycemia in diabetic mice by converting alanine to
pyruvate which is then used in gluconeogenesis [34,78], providing
possibly theﬁrst evidence that ALT2 has pathophysiological signiﬁcance
in liver-related metabolic diseases. The current study adds to our
emerging awareness that ALT is more than a passive biomarker of injury
by demonstrating its complementary role with the MPC in maintenance
of mitochondrial intermediary metabolism and preservation of redox
balance.
5. CONCLUSIONS
Overall, our data suggest that hepatocytes have metabolic
redundancies to preserve TCA cycleﬂux and defend against oxidative
stress even in the context of impaired mitochondrial pyruvate
metabolism (see Graphical Abstract), which is an important metabolic
substrate of the TCA cycle. However, if all sources of mitochondrial
pyruvate are impeded, hepatocytes switch to metabolism of amino
acids to maintain ﬂux at the cost of reduced synthesis of the anti-
oxidant glutathione. As the amino acid glutamate is shunted into the
TCA cycle, less is available for glutathione synthesis, rendering he-
patocytes more susceptible to oxidative insult. Conversely, stimula-
tion of mitochondrial pyruvate ﬂux was protective. These ﬁndings
have implications for the safety and future development of MPC in-
hibitors to treat metabolic diseases and for future treatment of APAP
hepatotoxicity.
