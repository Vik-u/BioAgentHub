Abstract
This study aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of three dosing regimens of
JMT103 in patients with bone metastases from solid tumors. Eligible patients were
randomly assigned to receive JMT103 subcutaneously, 120 mg every 4 weeks
(Cohort 1), 120 mg every 8 weeks (Cohort 2), or 180 mg every 8 weeks (Cohort 3)
for up to 49 weeks. The primary endpoint was change from baseline to Week 13 in
creatinine-adjusted urinary N-telopeptide (uNTx/Cr). Two hundred and ninety-five
patients were randomized, and 293 received at least one dose of JMT103, of whom
96 were assigned to Cohort 1, 97 were assigned to Cohort 2, and 100 were assigned
to Cohort 3. The median (interquartile range) percentage reduction in uNTx/Cr at
Ran Ran, Hongtao Li and Tao Sun contributed equally to this work.

Week 13 was 80.0% (49.9%, 93.4%) in Cohort 1, 73.0% (34.5%, 94.0%) in Cohort
2, and 75.7% (40.4%, 92.0%) in Cohort 3, respectively. On-study skeletal-related
events were reported by 3.1% of patients in Cohort 1, 6.2% in Cohort 2, and 7.0% in
Cohort 3. Treatment-emergent adverse events occurred in 289 patients, 162 of
whom were deemed treatment-related. The most common treatment-related adverse
events were hypocalcemia (23.2%), hypophosphatemia (22.9%), and increased aspar-
tate transaminase (11.9%). JMT103 demonstrated a good safety and a strong sup-
pression of the bone turnover markers.

What's New?
Bone metastases are common in a variety of cancer types, causing increased pain and worse
outcomes. Suppression of bone turnover, such as with the monoclonal antibody denosumab,
results in fewer skeletal complications and improved prognosis. Here, the authors demonstrate
the safety and efficacy of a similar antibody, JMT103. Like denosumab, JMT103 targets the
receptor activator of nuclear factor-kB ligand (RANKL). In patients with bone metastases, subcu-
taneous JMT103 was well tolerated and strongly suppressed bone turnover markers.
1 | INTRODUCTION
The bone is one of the most common sites of cancer metastases.1 The
incidence of bone metastases ranged from 5% to 95% and was partic-
ularly high in patients with breast cancer, prostate cancer, and mye-
loma.
2,3 Bone metastases are associated with serious skeletal
complications, such as pain, hypercalcemia, fracture, and spinal cord
compression, bringing a tremendous burden and causing poorer prog-
nosis in cancer patients.
4
The primary mechanism of bone metastases is interference with
bone turnovers and can be classified as osteolytic, osteoblastic, or
mixed.
5 Osteolytic metastases are the most common type of bone
metastases, characterized by increased bone resorption and lytic
(destructive) lesions.6 The receptor activator of nuclear factor-kB
(RANK) and RANK ligand (RANKL) signaling pathway is essential in
osteoclast function and formation. In the tumor environment, RANKL
was hypersecreted by osteoblasts and stromal cells to promote osteo-
clastogenesis and osteolytic lesions.
7 Inhibiting the RANK and RANKL
pathway could significantly suppress bone resorption and relieve bone
metastasis symptoms.8
The current standard of treatment for bone metastasis includes
surgery, radiotherapy, and bone-modifying agents (such as bispho-
sphonates and denosumab).9 Denosumab is an IgG2 fully human
monoclonal antibody against RANKL. Previous studies have demon-
strated that denosumab could correct elevated bone turnover
markers, reduce the risk of skeletal-related events (SREs), and
decrease bone pain effectively,
10–12 and was superior to zoledronic
acid in the prevention of SREs.13 However, previous studies have
reported disulfide scramble in human IgG2 monoclonal antibody,14,15
which could contribute to product heterogeneity during therapeutic
monoclonal antibody product development.16 JMT103 is a novel, fully
humanized monoclonal anti-RANKL antibody that shares the same
Fab arms as denosumab but with Fc end switches from IgG2 to IgG4.
IgG4 possesses unique properties that prevent the formation of large
complexes and the activation of effector functions to act as a safe
“blocking antibody.”
17,18
The previous Phase I study of JMT103 showed robust and sus-
tained suppression of bone resorption biomarkers with good safety
results.
19 In our Phase Ib trial, we aimed to evaluate the efficacy and
safety of JMT103 in patients with bone metastases from solid tumors
and establish a recommended dose for further Phase III study.
2 | PATIENTS AND METHODS
2.1 | Study design and patients
In this randomized, multi-center, open-label, Phase Ib study, eligible
patients were randomly assigned to one of the three dose cohorts:
120 mg every 4 weeks (Q4W, Cohort 1), 120 mg every 8 weeks
(Q8W, Cohort 2), or 180 mg Q8W (Cohort 3) using an interactive web
response system. The randomization schedule was prepared by an
individual independent of the study team. Randomization was strati-
fied by cancer type (breast cancer, prostate cancer, or other solid
tumors) and prior use of bisphosphonates (yes or no).
Eligible patients were aged 18 years or older with histologically or
cytologically confirmed solid tumors and had radiographic evidence
(by x-ray, computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, or pos-
itron emission tomography-computed tomography) of at least one
bone metastasis within 3 months prior to randomization. Additional
RAN ET AL. 2179
inclusion criteria were adequate organ function, albumin-adjusted
serum calcium concentration ≥ the lower limit of normal, Eastern
Cooperative Oncology Group performance status 0 –2, and a life
expectancy of at least 6 months. Main exclusion criteria were current
or previous osteonecrosis or osteomyelitis of the jaw; unhealed dental
or oral surgery wounds; acute dental or jaw disease requiring surgery
or scheduled invasive dental surgery during the study period; planned
radiation or surgery to bone; untreated, symptomatic, or actively pro-
gressing central nervous system metastases; bone metabolic diseases
(such as Paget's disease, Cushing's syndrome, and hyperprolactine-
mia); rheumatoid arthritis; parathyroid disorders; and previous use of
anti-RANKL antibodies. The full list of inclusion and exclusion criteria
is provided in the supplemental methods.
2.2 | Procedures
Patients received subcutaneous injections of JMT103 120 mg Q4W
(Cohort 1), 120 mg Q8W (Cohort 2), or 180 mg Q8W (Cohort 3) for
up to 49 weeks. Patients in Cohort 1 received a total of 13 doses, and
those in Cohort 2 and Cohort 3 received a total of seven doses. Dose
adjustments were not allowed. In addition, daily supplements of vita-
min D (at least 400 International Unit (IU)) and calcium (500 mg) were
given to all patients.
The dose selection of JMT103 was based on the results of the
Phase I study, which demonstrated that JMT103 was safe at
1.0–3.0 mg/kg and provided effective suppression of bone turn-
over markers to a level similar to that previously reported for
denosumab.
19
Blood samples for pharmacokinetic analysis were collected post-
dose on study Day 1 and pre-dose on Weeks 9, 17, 25, 33, 41, and
90 days after the last dose or withdrawal. Blood samples for bio-
marker analysis were collected pre-dose on study Day 1, at Weeks
5, 13, 25, 37, 49, and 90 days after the last dose or withdrawal. Blood
samples for immunogenicity analysis were collected pre-dose on
study Day 1, at Week 5 (for Cohort 1) or at Week 9 (for Cohort 2 and
3), and 90 days after the last dose or withdrawal. Urine samples for
biomarker analysis were collected pre-dose on study Day 1, on Weeks
5, 9, 13, 17, 21, 25, 37, 49, and 90 days after the last dose or
withdrawal.
Skeletal assessments by radiographic imaging (x-ray, computed
tomography, or magnetic resonance imaging) were scheduled at base-
line and every 3 months thereafter to assess the bone metastatic
sites, pathological fractures, and spinal cord compression; unsched-
uled imaging was allowed if the attending physician indicated.
Oral examinations were performed at baseline, Weeks 25 and
90, days after the last dose or withdrawal. The pain severity within
the past 24 h was assessed on study Days 1 and 15, at Weeks 13, 25,
37, 49, and 90 days after the last dose or withdrawal, using the Brief
Pain Inventory-Short Form (BPI-SF). Pain severity was rated on an
11-point scale (0, no pain; 1–4, mild pain; 5–6, moderate pain; and
7–10, severe pain). A minimal 2-point change from the baseline
BPI-SF score was considered a clinically meaningful reduction.
20
Laboratory assessments, physical examination, on-study SREs,
treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs), and concomitant dedica-
tion were recorded throughout the study period. Adverse events were
coded using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (version
25.1), and the severity of adverse events was graded according to the
Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (version 5.0).
2.3 | Endpoints
The primary endpoint was the percentage change from baseline to
Week 13 in creatinine-adjusted urinary N-telopeptide (uNTx/Cr). The
secondary endpoints included the occurrence of on-study SREs,
the change of pain severity as per BPI-SF, the change from baseline in
serum C-telopeptide of crosslinked collagen type I (sCTX-I) and bone
alkaline phosphatase (bALP), the presence of anti-JMT103 antibody,
and safety.
2.4 | Statistical analysis
The sample size for this study was not determined from power analy-
sis. Assuming the response rate was more than 50%19 (response was
defined as achieving a more than 65% reduction in uNTx/Cr21 from
baseline to Week 13), 95 patients per cohort (285 patients in total)
could provide a relatively tight range of 95% Confidence Interval (CI)
of the primary endpoint (±10%), considering a relatively large standard
deviation for the primary endpoint.
The full analysis set (FAS) included all patients who underwent
randomization, received at least one dose of JMT103 and had at least
one available post-baseline endpoint result. Safety analysis set
(SS) included all patients who received at least one dose of JMT103.
The baseline characteristics, bone turnover biomarkers, and efficacy
were analyzed in the FAS. The safety outcomes were analyzed in
the SS.
Descriptive statistics (such as count, percentage, mean, standard
deviation, median, minimum, and maximum) were used to measure
demographic parameters, baseline characteristics parameters, Phar-
macokinetics (PK) parameters, and safety outcomes as appropriate.
The Kaplan–Meier method was used for time-to-event endpoints, and
95% CIs were estimated for each group. Hazard ratios (using Cohort
3 as a reference) and the corresponding 95% CIs were estimated using
a stratified Cox regression model. All statistical analyses were done by
SAS software (version 9.4) unless otherwise stated.
3 | RESULTS
3.1 | Patient disposition
Between November 3, 2020, and March 31, 2023, a total of
423 patients were screened; 295 were randomized; and 293 received
at least one dose of JMT103. The distribution of patients between
2180 RAN ET AL.
the groups was cohort 1: n = 96, cohort 2: n = 97, and cohort 3:
n = 100. As of March 31, 2023, of the patients who underwent ran-
domization, 148 (50.2%) completed the study, and 147 (49.8%) dis-
continued it (Figure1).
The demographic and baseline characteristics were generally balanced
among the three dose cohorts (Table1). A total of 63.5% of the patients
were female, and the mean (standard deviation [SD]) age was 57.9 (10.7)
years, with a mean (SD) Body Mass Index (BMI) of 23.9 (3.5) kg/m2.T h e
most common tumor types were breast cancer (49.5%) and prostate cancer
(15.0%). And 186 (63.5%) had previously used bisphosphonates.
3.2 | Efficacy
3.2.1 | Bone metabolism
The change in uNTx/Cr by study week in all patients and patients with
breast cancer and prostate cancer is shown in Figures 2 and S1.
Reduction in uNTx/Cr was observed in all three cohorts as early as
study Week 5 (the 1st assessment) and well-maintained through
Week 49. The median percent reduction in uNTx/Cr from baseline to
Week 13 was 80.0% (interquartile range [IQR]:49.9%, 93.4%) in
Cohort 1, 73.0% (IQR: 34.5%, 94.0%) in Cohort 2, and 75.7% (IQR:
40.4%, 92.0%) in Cohort 3, respectively. For patients with breast can-
cer, the median percent reduction in uNTx/Cr from baseline to Week
13 was 79.5% (IQR: 40.7%, 93.1%) in Cohort 1, 69.7% (IQR: 34.1%,
89.5%) in Cohort 2, and 74.6% (IQR: 41.6%, 89.7%) in Cohort 3; for
patients with prostate cancer, the median percent reduction in uNTx/
Cr from baseline to Week 13 was 85.0% (IQR: 42.4%, 95.1%) in
Cohort 1, 72.8% (IQR: 66.2%, 94.8%) in Cohort 2, and 92.3% (IQR:
59.4%, 97.2%) in Cohort 3, respectively.
Overall, 58.3% of patients in cohort 1 achieved a more than 65%
reduction in uNTx/Cr from baseline to Week 13, compared with
50.5% of patients in cohort 2 and 51.0% of patients in cohort 3.
Similar reductions were also observed in other bone turnover
markers, sCTX-I and bALP (Figures
S2 and S3). At study Week
13, levels of sCTX-I decreased by a median of 81.7% (IQR: 60.3%,
94.1%) in Cohort 1, 81.6% (IQR: 48.5%, 92.8%) in Cohort 2 and 77.5%
(IQR: 29.8%, 94.4%) in Cohort 3; and bALP decreased by 27.1% (IQR:
3.4%, 45.9%) in Cohort 1, 26.4% (IQR: 7.0%, 50.7%) in Cohort 2, and
18.7% (IQR: 2.9%, 35.4%) in Cohort 3, respectively.
3.2.2 | Skeletal-related events
During the 49-week treatment period, the percentage of patients
experiencing an on-study SRE was 3.1% (3 out of 96) in Cohort
1, 6.2% (6 out of 97) in Cohort 2, and 7.0% (7 out of 100) in
Cohort 3. The most common SRE was fracture (Table
S1), and the
median time to the first on-study SRE was not estimable.
3.2.3 | Pain severity
The percentage of patients with meaningful improvement (a decrease
≥2 points) in the worst pain score was similar among the three dose
cohorts throughout the study (Figure3). Among the patients with a
baseline BPI-SF pain score ≥2 points, 22 (61.1%) in Cohort

1, 17 (45.9%) in Cohort 2, and 22 (53.7%) in Cohort 3 already had a
clinically meaningful improvement in pain score on the first visit on
Day 15. Ameliorating pain severity was also similar among the three
cohorts (Figure
S4). The proportion of patients with no pain increased
from 52.6% at baseline to 79.1% at Week 49 in Cohort 1, 45.7% to
61.9% in Cohort 2, and 47.4% to 58.5% in Cohort 3.
3.3 | Safety
Two hundred ninety-three patients who received at least one dose
of JMT103 were included in the safety analysis (96 patients in
Cohort 1, 97 in Cohort 2, and 100in Cohort 3). The median of the
total exposure of JMT103 was 1440 (IQR: 720, 1560) mg in Cohort
1, 720 (IQR: 360, 840) mg in Cohort 2, and 1260 (IQR: 720, 1260)
mg in Cohort 3.
In total, 289 (98.6%) of 293 patients reported at least one TEAE,
of whom 157 patients reported grade≥3 TEAEs and 82 reported seri-
ous TEAEs (Table
2). A summary of TEAEs with a frequency of≥10% in
at least one cohort is provided in Table3. The incidence of all-grade or
grade ≥3 TEAEs was similar across all cohorts (Table3). The most com-
mon TEAEs (all grades) were white blood cell count decreased (n = 132,
45.1%), anemia (n = 125, 42.7%), neutrophil count decreased (n = 120,
41.0%), hypocalcemia ( n = 83, 28.3%), aspartate aminotransferase
increase (n = 82, 28.0%), and hypophosphatemia (n = 79, 27.0%). The
percentage of patients reporting hypocalcemia was numerically lower in
Cohort 1. Hypocalcemia was reported by 22 (22.9%) patients in Cohort
1, 31 (32.0%) in Cohort 2, and 30 (30.0%) in Cohort 3. The incidence of
grade ≥3 hypocalcemia was low: 0 in Cohort 1, 3 (3.1%) in Cohort
2, and 3 (3.0%) in Cohort 3.
Treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs) were experienced by
162 patients. No apparent differences were observed for the

incidence of TRAEs across different dose cohorts (TableS2). The most
common TRAEs were hypocalcemia (n = 68, 23.2%), hypophosphate-
mia ( n = 67, 22.9%), increased aspartate transaminase ( n = 35,
11.9%), increased alanine aminotransferase ( n = 29, 9.9%), and
increased gamma-glutamyl transferase (n = 24, 8.2%).
Overall, serious treatment-emergent adverse events (SAEs)
occurred in 82 (28.0%) patients, including 27 (28.1%) in Cohort
1, 33 (34.0%) in Cohort 2, and 22 (22.0%) in Cohort 3 (Table
S3). No
apparent dose dependency was observed. Four SAEs were judged as
being possibly related to the study drug, including infective pneumo-
nia (n = 1, 0.3%) and blood creatine phosphokinase increased (n = 1,
0.3%) in Cohort 1, anemia (n = 1, 0.3%) in Cohort 2, osteomyelitis
(n = 1, 0.3%) in Cohort 3.
At database lock, a total of 40 (13.7%) deaths occurred within
90 days of the last dose of JMT103; 20 (6.8%) were due to unknown
causes, 14 (4.8%) were due to disease progression, and 6 (2.0%) were
due to TEAEs, of which one case in Cohort 1 was attributed to a
treatment-related SAE (infective pneumonia).

In total, 268 patients were tested for anti-drug antibody (ADA) at
baseline and after administration of JMT103. Only one (1%) patient in
Cohort 2 tested negative at baseline but turned positive after having
JMT103.
4 | DISCUSSION
In this randomized, multi-center, open-label, Phase Ib study of
293 cancer patients with bone metastasis, JMT103 showed strong
suppression of bone turnover markers and a comparable safety profile
to denosumab.
As demonstrated in previous studies,
21–24 suppression of bone
turnover, which correlates with inhibition of osteoclast function, was
predictive of fewer skeletal complications and a better prognosis in
patients with bone metastasis. In the previous studies of denosumab
in patients with bone metastasis, the median change of uNTx/Cr from
baseline to Week 13 ranged from 40% to 78%.
11,21,24 The study of
QL1206, a denosumab biosimilar, also showed a similar reduction in
uNTx/Cr in Chinese patients, with a median change of uNTx/Cr from
baseline to Week 13 of/C075%.25 The median reduction in uNTx/Cr at
Week 13 was numerically greater with 120 mg Q4W (80.0%) versus
120 mg Q8W (73.0%) and 180 mg Q8W (75.7%). Since no relation-
ship analysis between the pharmacokinetic of JMT103 and uNTx/Cr
was planned in our study, we could only make the assumption that
the difference in the reduction in uNTx/Cr for these three cohorts
might be attributed to lower trough concentration of JMT103 in
120 mg Q8W and 180 mg Q8W.
A summarized report by Lipton and colleagues showed that the
pooled incidence was 32.6% (934 out of 2862) from three Phase III
trials of denosumab in patients with bone metastases, with a median
time to first on-study SRE of 27.6 months.
26 In our study, only 16 on-
study SREs occurred, and fewer patients in 120 mg Q4W cohort
(3/96) had on-study SREs compared with those in the 120 mg Q8W
(6/97) and 180 mg Q8W cohorts (7/100). The median time to first
on-study SRE was not estimable. A previous study has confirmed that
there was a positive correlation between decreased uNTx levels and
reduced risk of SREs in patients with bone metastases,
27 which seems
to be consistent with our findings. The relatively short study period
may result in inadequate capture of the SREs, so a more extended
follow-up period will be helpful for further elucidating the benefits of
preventing SREs.
In addition to preventing SREs, pain relief or delaying pain wors-
ening is especially important for maintaining quality of life in patients
with bone metastases. In our study, more patients in the 120 mg
Q4W cohort (79.1%) achieved no pain at Week 49 compared with
those in the 120 mg Q8W (61.9%) and 180 mg Q8W cohorts (58.5%).
The greater effect on pain of JMT103 120 mg Q4W over 120 mg
Q8W and 180 mg Q8W was consistent with its reduction in bone
turnover markers, which may be explained by its ability to suppress
cancer-induced bone destruction. In the patients who had moderate
or severe pain at baseline, the median time to meaningful improve-
ment in the worst pain score was 0.5 month (IQR 0.5, 5.5) in patients
in the 120 mg Q4W cohort. It is anticipated that additional pain-
related indicators, including the time to pain worsening and the time
to first use of opioid-type analgesic drugs, will be examined to assess
the effect of JMT103 on pain palliation in future research.
In the pooled safety analysis of the three Phase III trials of deno-
sumab (at 120 mg Q4W),
26 96.2% of patients reported at least one
TEAE. The most common TEAEs of Denosumab were nausea (30.8%),
anemia (27.1%), fatigue (27.1%), back pain (25.3%), and decreased
appetite (23.1%). The incidence of≥ grade 3 hypocalcemia was 3.1%,
and osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ) was 1.8%. In our study, the inci-
dence of any-grade TEAEs was similar to that of denosumab, and the
incidence of nausea (8.2%), back pain (6.5%), and decreased appetite
(8.2%) was all numerically low, as well as the≥ grade 3 hypocalcemia.
The incidence of≥ grade 3 hypocalcemia was as low as 2.0% in our
study, with zero incidence in Cohort 1 (at 120 mg Q4W). No ONJ and
no injection site reactions were reported. The potential reasons for no
ONJ observed might be as follows: firstly, since the presence of
delayed healing following invasive dental procedures was identified as
a potential risk factor for the development of ONJ. Therefore, we
excluded those patients based on their dental examination findings;
secondly, previous studies
28,29 showed that the incidence rate of ONJ
increased with denosumab therapy duration: the incidence of
ONJ under denosumab was 0.9% in the first year, 6.2% in the second,
13.6% in the third, and 16.2% in subsequent years. JMT103 might
have a lower risk of ONJ based on the 2-year results in this study.
Long-term data are warranted to confirm these findings. The occur-
rence of ADA was also low after having JMT103, indicating a low
immunogenicity. Overall, JMT103 was well tolerated in patients,
which was consistent with findings from our preliminary Phase I
study.
19
Theoretically, besides the presence of disulfide scramble in
IgG2,14,15 IgG4 also exhibits unique characteristics that prevent the
formation of large complexes and the activation of effector func-
tions.17,18 Despite the lack of observed safety advantages of JMT103
in our study, conducting investigations with an expanded sample size
and an extended study period are warranted to find out its potential
safety benefits.
In summary, the percentage of reduction in bone turnover
marker, uNTx/Cr, was numerically greater when administered at
120 mg Q4W (80.0%) compared to 120 mg Q8W (73.0%) and 180 mg
Q8W (75.7%). Additionally, the response rate of uNTx/Cr throughout
the study was numerically higher with 120 mg Q4W versus 120 mg
Q8W and 180 mg Q8W. Despite similar overall safety profiles among
the three dosing regimens of JMT103, the incidence of hypocalcemia
was numerically lower with 120 mg Q4W versus 120 mg Q8W and
180 mg Q8W. After assessing the benefit–risk evaluation of the three
dose levels of JMT103, 120 mg Q4W was determined as the
recommended dose.
Our study presented a few limitations, including the relatively
short study period, which is too short to evaluate the full impact on
SREs. A further limitation relates to statistical methods; no specific
hypothesis testing was used to compare cohorts. In addition, this
study did not include a standard of care as a control, so the
RAN ET AL. 2185
interpretation of the treatment effects should be cautious. A large,
Phase III, randomized controlled study (NCT06221072) is ongoing to
compare JMT103 120 mg Q4W and zoledronic acid in patients with
advanced solid tumors bone metastases.
In conclusion, JMT103 demonstrated robust suppression in bone
turnover markers and a good safety profile in patients with
bone metastases from solid tumors. The recommended dose was
120 mg Q4W.
