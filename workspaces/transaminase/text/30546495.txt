Transaminase-Catalyzed Racemization with Potential for
Dynamic Kinetic Resolutions
Federica Ruggieri, [a, b] Luuk M. van Langen, [c] Derek T. Logan, [b] Bjo¨ rn Walse, [b] and
Per Berglund* [a]
Dynamic kinetic resolution (DKR) reactions in which a stereo-
selective enzyme and a racemization step are coupled in one
pot would represent powerful tools for the production of
enantiopure amines through enantioconvergence of racemates.
The exploitation of DKR strategies is currently hampered by the
lack of effective, enzyme-compatible and scalable racemization
strategies for amines. In the present work, the proof of concept
of a fully biocatalytic method for amine racemization is
presented. Both enantiomers of the model compound 1-
methyl-3-phenylpropylamine could be racemized in water and
at room temperature using a couple of wild-type, non-
proprietary, enantiocomplementary amine transaminases and a
minimum amount of pyruvate/alanine as a co-substrate couple.
The biocatalytic simultaneous parallel cascade reaction pre-
sented here poses itself as a customizable amine racemization
system with potential for the chemical industry in competition
with traditional transition-metal catalysis.
Introduction
Enantiomers of a drug are known to exert different physiolog-
ical effects. Regulatory agencies have therefore progressively
tightened the requirements for the approval and the commerci-
alization of chiral drugs,
[1] and this trend is likely to continue in
the future. For this reason, chiral amines used as resolving
agents, chiral auxiliaries or synthons in the synthesis of
pharmaceutical compounds are particularly interesting from
the commercial point of view. [2–3] Over the last 20 years, several
biocatalytic routes for the synthesis of valuable chiral amines
have been investigated with the purpose of establishing more
environmentally friendly and affordable routes than the tradi-
tional racemate resolution via formation of diastereoisomeric
salts.
[3–5] Several biocatalytic approaches for the synthesis of
enantiopure chiral amines have also been reported, mostly
involving hydrolases, oxygenases, dehydrogenases and trans-
ferases in kinetic resolution (KR), dynamic kinetic resolution
(DKR) and asymmetric synthesis (AS) reactions. [3–6] Among these
methods, DKR, in which a highly enantioselective enzyme is
combined in one pot with a compatible racemization system, is
of particular interest since it would allow the synthesis of
valuable enantiopure amines with yields close to 100 % from
more readily accessible racemates.
The applicability of DKR to amines is limited by the
scarcity of reported efficient enzyme-compatible racemiza-
tion methods,
[7] which usually require expensive transition-
metal chemo-catalysts [7–9] (mostly Raney-Ni, [8,10] Shvo-
type,[11–15] palladium- [10,15–19] or ruthenium based [20]), expensive
non-selective reducing agents such as ammonia borane [21]
and/or harsh conditions [3,22] that are not suitable for large-
scale application or in combina tion with enzymatic steps.
The best-known example of a successful DKR on a laboratory
scale was reported by Reetz and Schimossek in 1996. In this
work, the substrate ( R,S)-1-phenylethylamine was successfully
converted into its ( R)-acylated form to final 64 % yield in 8
days using a lipase as resolving catalyst and Pd on charcoal
as racemization catalyst. [23] Extensive research on the combi-
nation of lipases and heteroge neous racemization catalysts
in DKRs has followed this first report. [24]
Amine transaminases (EC 2.6.1.-) are biocatalysts of special
interest for the obtainment of chiral amines. This is not only
because both ( R)- and ( S)-selective amine transaminases with
varying substrate scopes and operational optima are
known.[25–26] Also the reversibility of the reaction they catalyze,
i. e. the stereoselective transfer of an amino group from a chiral
amino donor substrate to a prochiral carbonyl amino acceptor
co-substrate, makes them suitable for both the kinetic
resolution and asymmetric synthesis of chiral amines. [27] Limi-
tations such as unfavorable thermodynamic equilibrium in
asymmetric synthesis and substrate- and product inhibition
phenomena
[6,28] have been often overcome by reaction- [3,27,29–35]
and/or enzyme engineering approaches. [27,29]

One of the most interesting applications of transaminases
in biocatalysis consists of a racemization reaction intended for
use in DKRs. Koszelewski et al. designed a one-pot cascade
involving a pair of known, robust enantiocomplementary amine
transaminases coupled via catalytic amounts of a non-readily-
available and rather expensive achiral amino donor/acceptor
co-substrate system.
[36] In this approach, the selection of
appropriate pairs of catalysts is complicated by the natural
narrow substrate specificity overlap between ( R)- and ( S)-
transaminases and by the need to use accepted achiral co-
substrates that must also both be commercially available and
show a readily reversible transamination equilibrium with the
substrate in order to be used in catalytic amounts. The difficulty
to meet all these requirements at once has limited further
practical applications of the system.
In the present paper, the proof of concept of a more
accessible transaminase-catalyzed racemization reaction is pre-
sented, in which the use of the broadly accepted alanine/
pyruvate co-substrate system increases the chances to identify
a couple of non-proprietary enantiocomplementary catalysts
and limits the goal of engineering, when necessary, to only one
of the two substrates participating in the reaction. Our results
show that both enantiomers of the model compound 1-methyl-
3-phenylpropylamine ( 1a,b) could be racemized to a final
<10 % ee using two non-proprietary enantiocomplementary
amine transaminases selected from a panel of only 10 enzymes
(7 ( R)-selective and 3 ( S)-selective) and using a variant of the
simple and inexpensive UV-based acetophenone assay. Purified
enzymes (50 mU) were used in water, at pH 7.5, at atmospheric
pressure, in the presence of the enantiopure substrate 1a,( S)-
enantiomer, or 1b ,( R)-enantiomer, (15 mM) and minimal
amounts of enantiopure alanine of opposite configuration than
that of the target amine ( 3a, L-alanine, or 3b, D-alanine)
(Scheme 1). In this setup the catalytic activity of the two
enzymes is coupled via continuous production and consump-
tion of the amino acceptor pyruvate 4, which is added to the
reaction in limited amounts. Although distant from the metrics
necessary for industrial application, the approach presented
here represents a promising novel, tunable and optimizable
enzyme-compatible racemization system for amines with
potential for DKR processes.
Results and Discussion
Selection and Production of Catalysts and Choice of the
Operational pH
Suitable catalysts were selected among a collection of enzymes
including those commercially offered in the ACS-ATA-KIT
(Enzymicals AG, Table S1) and the Chromobacterium violaceum
(S)-ATA [Cv-(S)-ATA] in its wild-type [37] and W60C variants. [38] The
enzymes were screened for the acceptance of ketone 2 in the
variant of the acetophenone assay [39] shown in Figure S1. The
Aspergillus oryzae (R)-ATA [ Ao-(R)-ATA] and the Cv-(S)-ATA
showed the highest initial catalytic rates and were therefore
selected for use in the racemization reaction, which was
performed at pH 7.5 to allow for sufficient enzyme activity [26,40]
and better ( S)-ATA stability.[41] Both the Ao-(R)-ATA and the Cv-
(S)-ATA were then recombinantly expressed in E. coliBL21 (DE3)
and used in the racemization of 1a and 1b in their pure form
to avoid the occurrence of side reactions and to have a tight
control over the relative amounts of the two catalysts, which is
a key parameter in the early-stage optimization of any multi-
enzymatic reaction. While the Cv-(S)-ATA was expressed and
purified from the strain previously described in the literature
[42]
following established procedures, [38,42] the catalytically active C-
terminal His-tagged Ao-(R)-ATA was successfully over-expressed
(Figures S3 and S4, Supporting Information) and purified by
IMAC for the first time with yields around 70 mg/L. Removal of
imidazole resulted in fast and irreversible protein precipitation,
suggesting a stabilizing role of imidazole for Ao-(R)-ATA. Flash-
freezing in liquid nitrogen and storage at /C080 8C proved
optimal for the long-term storage of both enzymes as it
prevented loss of activity even over repeated cycles of freeze-
thawing. The concentration of catalytically active protein
[43] in
the final enzyme preparations was assessed using a standard
UV-based activity assay in the presence of a known amount of
purified protein.
[39] The calculated specific activity values,
corresponding to 103 mU/mg for Cv-(S)-ATA and 169 mU/mg
for Ao-(R)-ATA (Figure S1, Supporting Information), account for
Scheme 1.Investigated racemizations of 1a (A) and 1b (B) (15 mM). The
reactions were performed using purified Cv-(S)-ATA and Ao-(R)-ATA (50 mU
each) as catalysts in presence of limiting amounts of amino acceptor 4
(4.5 mM) and amino donor 3b (A) or 3a (B) (10 mM) in HEPES pH 7.5
(50 mM), glycerol (20 % v/v) and PLP (0.1 mM) at room temperature in the
dark for four days.

the presence of inactive forms of the enzymes in the protein
preparation and enable a tight control over the actual amount
of catalysts added to the reaction.
Transaminase-Catalyzed Racemization of 1a and 1b
Racemization of the model amine compounds 1a and 1b was
achieved employing Cv-(S)-ATA and Ao-(R)-ATA (50 mU each) in a
one-step reaction in the absence of excess amino donor or
additional equilibrium-displacement systems (Scheme 1). The two
enantiomers 1a and 1b of the target 1-methyl-3-phenylpropyl-
amine (15 mM) were independently racemized in aqueous
solution in the presence of minimal amounts of amino acceptor
pyruvate 4 (4.5 mM, 0.3 eq.), amino donor alanine 3a or 3b
(10 mM, 0.7 eq.) and PLP (0.1 mM) over a reaction time of 4 days,
which corresponds to the chemoca talyzed racemization time for
this compound reported in previous work. [3,17] The chosen
quantities ensure that racemization can only be the outcome of
the catalytic coupling of the two transaminases, since only the
enzyme-catalyzed replenishment of the otherwise limiting amino-
acceptor pyruvate 4 (0.3 eq.) can sustain the racemization cycle.
For each reaction mixture, opposite enantiomers of 1-methyl-3-
phenylpropylamine ( 1a , b) and alanine ( 3a , b)w e r eu s e da s
substrate and amino donor co-substrate, respectively. Although
the addition of an enantiopure amino donor cannot be avoided
due to the strict enantioselectivities of the enzymes, our results
show that, in contrast to other reported transaminase-based
systems, only a minimal amount of amino donor (0.67 eq.) suffices
to sustain the asymmetric synthesis half-reaction, with a positive
impact on the overall atom economy of the racemization reaction
(Table 1). The obtained data demonstrate that racemization of
1a , bcould be achieved to final ee <10 % in the described bi-
enzymatic reaction, regardless of the starting enantiomer of 1,
with absolute concentrations of ketone 2 (4-phenyl-2-butanone)
above 20 % of the initial substrate concentration ( >3m M ) . T h e
presence of trapped intermediate ketone, i. e. ketone accumulated
during the course of the reaction a nd not further converted to its
corresponding amine, is inherent to this type of racemization
reaction
[44] to an extent that depends on the position of the
equilibrium. The coupling to a kine tic resolution step in a dynamic
kinetic resolution system is expected to contribute to a reduction
of the amount of trapped ketone. PLP (0.4 mmol) was supple-
mented daily to the reaction to ensure continuous cofactor
availability. This cofactor addition pattern proved both unneces-
sary for the purpose of racemization and undesirable with respect
to both product ee and amount of trapped ketone intermediate.
The control reaction including substrate 1b supplemented with a
minimal amount of PLP only at time 0 (0.6 mmol) shows both
better ee value and a lower concentration of ketone. We suspect
that PLP could interfere stoichio metrically in the reaction by
removing amino groups from the system in the form of PMP and
that this phenomenon might be relevant for the accumulation of
ketone when excess PLP is used in combination with enzymes
that, like Cv-(S)-ATA, show low affinity for the cofactor moiety.
[43]
Based on the presented results, we believe that the
described approach should be further investigated for different
types of substrate amines for DKR purposes. Appropriate
system- and substrate-dependent optimizations are expected
to be needed. The attractiveness of a fully enzyme-compatible
and renewable system for racemization of primary amines
justifies, in the context of what is currently available, further
efforts in this direction.
Racemization Kinetics
The success of dynamic kinetic reso lution (DKR) reactions strictly
depends on both the selectivity of the enzyme catalyzing the
kinetic resolution step and the racemization rate of the slow-
reacting enantiomer, which should ideally be at least ten-fold
faster than the kinetic resolution step.
[22,24] The kinetics of the
transaminase-catalyzed racemization of 1a and 1b were inves-
tigated by monitoring the change in the relative concentrations of
the two enantiomers over time ( Figure 1) in reaction setups
identical to those already des cribed in which PLP (0.1 mM) was
exclusively added at time 0. Samples of the reactions were
collected and immediately derivatized for analysis at 0.5, 1, 2.5 and
24 hours. Both reactions using either 1a or 1b as substrates show
similar progress curves, with a slower increase of the relative
concentrations of the two enantiomers as the racemization
equilibrium is approached. The initial time points (0.5, 1 and
2.5 hours) describe the systems far from racemization equilibrium,
i. e. when one of the two amine enantiomers is present in large
excess. This situation resembles the one encountered in dynamic
kinetic resolutions, in which the kinetic resolution step selectively
and continuously removes one of the enantiomers from the
equilibrium. The 24-hours sample, on the other hand, can provide
some indication about long-term differences in the two thermody-

namically identical racemization reactions, which can be assumed
to arise exclusively from events th at alter the catalytic activity of
the systems. By virtue of the enan tioselectivity of the catalysts
involved, different structural stabilities of the enzymes, sensitivities
to inhibition phenomena and propensities to cofactor leakage will
affect the racemization reactions differently depending on the
chirality of the starting (exces s) enantiomer. In this case the
concentration ratio between the t wo enantiomers after 24 hours
of reaction is significantly different and we think that this might
be due to a combination of the aforementioned events. This
phenomenon was nonetheless not investigated further since for
the intended application of the reaction under study, i. e. DKR, the
behavior of the system far from th e racemization equilibrium and
in presence of sufficiently stab le enzymes is of interest. The
racemization times (t
rac) of the systems, herein defined as the time
that would be required to achieve complete racemization of an
enantiopure substrate when the initial catalytic rate is held
constant, correspond to 13.6 hours for substrate 1b and
19.8 hours for substrate 1a (see Supplementary Information). This
value could be further reduced by increasing the amount of
catalysts. The racemization time t
rac also represents the time that
would be required to complete a DKR reaction when the kinetic
resolution step is not the rat e-limiting reaction and the
racemization proceeds at its fastest rate.
Conclusions
In the present paper a novel biocatalytic method for the
racemization of primary amines is presented that relies on the
use of two wild-type, non-proprietary, enantiocomplementary
amine transaminases and that is sustained by internal formation
and consumption of the amino acceptor pyruvate. The system
enabled the one-pot racemization of the model amine sub-
strate 1-methyl-3-phenylpropylamine starting from either one
of its enantiomers and using only minimal amounts of
enantiopure D- or L-alanine as amino-donor co-substrate. The
system, which shows reduced complexity and better atom
economy when compared to previous reports, represents a
potentially flexible racemization tool, optimizable to meet
substrate- and process requirements. We believe that the
described racemization system, being it performed under mild
reaction conditions that well match the requirements of other
biocatalysts, could be exploited in DKR reactions for deracem-
ization applications.
Experimental Section
Materials
All chemicals were purchased from Sigma Aldrich at analytical
grade with the exceptions of HEPES (buffer grade), D-alanine
(Fluka), imidazole (buffer grade), (R)- and (S)-1-methyl-3-phenyl-
propylamine (ACROS Organics), isopropyl-ether (stabilized with
BHT, TCI), 2-propanol (Roth), n-heptane (Fisher Scientific) and
anhydrous sodium sulfate (Merck). All solvents used were of
analytical grade. Pyruvate and pyridoxal-5 ’-phosphate were also
purchased from Sigma Aldrich, as sodium salt and monohydrate
form, respectively.
For protein purification procedures syringe filters (0.45 and
0.22 mm) were purchased from Corning, centrifugal filter units
(Amicon Ultra-15, 30 kDa and 50 kDa) from Merck Millipore, Ni-NTA
affinity chromatography pre-packed cartridges for affinity chroma-
tography (5 ml) from Nordic Biosite and Sephadex G-25 PD-10
desalting columns (2.5 ml) from GE-Healthcare.
Catalyst Selection
Catalysts were selected among the panel of enzymes commercially
offered by Enzymicals AG in the ACS-ATA-KIT and those kindly
made available by the KTH biocatalysis group. The variant of the
acetophenone assay
[39] shown in Figure S1 aided the identification
of suitable candidate catalysts by direct comparison of the
detected initial catalytic rates. Enzyme solutions of all available
catalysts (1 mg/ml, whole-cell lyophilizate or purified lyophilized
enzyme) were prepared in HEPES pH 7.5 (50 mM) supplemented
with PLP (0.1 mM). The substrate solution was prepared dissolving
the amino acceptor 4-phenyl-2-butanone (5 mM) and the acceptor
methylbenzylamine (5 mM) (either as ( R)- or ( S)-enantiomer) in
HEPES pH 7.5 (50 mM). The assay solutions were prepared mixing
buffer (495 ml), enzyme solution (5 ml) and substrate solution
(500 ml) in clean quartz cuvettes. Formation of acetophenone was
monitored following the increase of A
245nm over 10 minutes. Initial
activities were estimated from the linear regression of the first data
points. The enzymes showing highest initial catalytic rates
(Aspergillus oryzae (R)-ATA and Chromobaterium violaceum (S)-ATA)
were selected for further investigations.

purified catalysts (50 mU each). The reactions (1 ml) were run in HEPES
pH 7.5 (50 mM) at room temperature and in the dark under mild agitation.
Cofactor PLP (0.1 mM) was only added at the beginning of the reaction.

Design of Expression Plasmids and Production of
Catalysts-Producing Bacterial Strains
Aspergillus Oryzae (R)-ATA (Ao-(R)-ATA)
The Ao-(R)-ATA coding sequence was retrieved from the results of a
default BLAST search in which the Aspergillus fumigatus (R)-ATA
sequence (UniProt KB ID: Q4WNL4) was used as query. Two
sequences from Aspergillus oryzae were retrieved, both sharing
73 % identity with the query and differing by only 4 amino acid
residues (L/V 7, M/I 53, A/V 248 and K/E 293). The variant LMAK
(GenBank: EIT82926.1) was reverse-translated using the tool
available on www.bioinformatics.org/sms2. The nucleotide se-
quence was then codon-optimized for E.coli and supplemented
with NdeI and XhoI terminal restriction sites. Gene synthesis,
restriction and ligation in pET-29b were purchased from GenScript/C24.
The final Ao-(R)-ATA construct included a C-terminal LE insertion
between the enzyme sequence and the hexahistidine tag. The
plasmid was transformed into electrocompetent E. coli BL21 (DE3)
cells using a Bio-Rad Gene Pulser II. A single colony growing on LB
agar plates supplemented with kanamycin was inoculated into
sterile liquid LB medium (15 ml) supplemented with kanamycin
(50 mg/L) and incubated overnight at 37 8C and 200 rpm agitation.
This preculture (5 ml) was subsequently inoculated in sterile LB
medium (50 ml) supplemented with antibiotic. Growth was carried
out at 37 8C and 200 rpm agitation until OD600 =0.56. Glycerol
stocks were prepared in 40 % v/v glycerol, frozen in liquid nitrogen
and kept at /C0808C for long term storage.
Chromobacterium Violaceum (S)-ATA (Cv-(S)-ATA)
The E. coli BL21 (DE3) expressing strain was made available by the
KTH biocatalysis group in the form of a glycerol stock. [42] The
pET28a expression vector carried the Chromobacterium violaceum
(S)-TA ( Cv-(S)-TA) coding sequence in fusion with an N-terminal
hexahistidine tag.
Heterologous Expression of Catalysts
Aspergillus Oryzae (R)-ATA
Liquid sterile LB medium (15 ml) supplemented with kanamycin
(50 mg/L) was inoculated with cells from the glycerol stock. After
overnight growth at 37 8C and 200 rpm agitation the preculture
(1 ml) was used as inoculum in sterile TB medium (1 L) supple-
mented with kanamycin (50 mg/L). Cultivation was performed in 5-
liter baffled flasks at 37 8C and 180 rpm agitation. Cells were
induced with IPTG (0.3 mM) at values of OD600 ranging from 0.6 to
0.8. Expression was carried out for 20 hours at 20 8C in the dark.
Cells were harvested by centrifugation (4000 g for 20 minutes at
4 8C) and the resulting pellets were stored at /C020 8C until
purification.
Chromobacterium Violaceum (S)-ATA
All steps of cultivation, induction, harvest and storage were
performed following the same protocol optimized for Ao-(R)-RATA.
Purification of Catalysts
Aspergillus Oryzae (R)-ATA
The Ao-(R)-ATA was purified by IMAC. Cell pellets were resuspended
and lysed on ice in 50 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 0.2 M NaCl, 5 % v/v
glycerol, 10 mM imidazole using a Branson Sonifier 250 equipped
with a 3 mm probe. Three sonication cycles of seven minutes each
were performed (40 % duty cycle, output level 4.5). After
sedimentation of the cell debris by centrifugation at 40000 g for
30 minutes at 4 8C the soluble fraction was further filtered (cut-off
0.22 mm) to ensure complete removal of particulate matter. The
resulting sample was loaded onto a pre-equilibrated 5 ml Ni-NTA
column (Nordic Biosite) and washed at a flow rate of 2 ml/min with
increasing concentrations of imidazole (10 mM, 50 mM, 250 mM,
three column volumes for each concentration). A linear gradient to
final 500 mM imidazole was then used to elute the target (duration
of the gradient 30 minutes, flow rate 2 ml/min). The PLP-saturated
protein eluted as a single symmetric peak at 290 mM imidazole.
Attempts to remove the imidazole resulted in protein precipitation.
The protein was therefore concentrated to 15 mg/ml in 50 mM
HEPES pH 7.5, 0.2 M NaCl, 5 % v/v glycerol, 290 mM imidazole using
Amicon Ultra centrifugal filter units (cut-off 30 kDa), flash frozen
and stored at /C080 8C.
Chromobacterium Violaceum (S)-ATA
Cell pellets were resuspended and lysed in 50 mM HEPES pH 7.5,
10 mM imidazole following the same protocol described for Ao-(R)-
ATA. Clarification and loading onto the affinity column (Nordic
Biosite, 5 ml) also followed the same procedures reported for Ao-
(R)-ATA. After washing with five column volumes of buffer, the
target was eluted in a linear gradient to 500 mM imidazole in
30 minutes, flow rate 2 ml/min. The protein eluted in a single
symmetric peak at 350 mM imidazole. The fractions corresponding
to the peak were collected, merged and concentrated by ultra-
filtration using Amicon Ultra centrifugal filter units (cut-off 50 kDa).
The imidazole was removed by desalting using a PD-10 column (GE
Healthcare). After a final concentration step to 37.5 mg/ml the
protein was flash frozen and stored at /C080 8C.
Activity Estimation
Enzyme activity was estimated in the variant of the acetophenone
assay shown in Figure S1 (Supporting Information) using UV-clear
disposable cuvettes and a Cary 3000 spectrophotometer. The final
assay solution was obtained mixing 1 ml substrate solution (5 mM
4-phenyl-2-butanone, 5 mM ( R)- or ( S)-methylbenzylamine) and 50
mg purified enzyme, added as 5 ml of a 10 mg/ml enzyme dilution
prepared from the frozen stocks, whose real enzyme content was
estimated on a NanoDrop spectrophotometer (ThermoFisher
Scientific) using the molar extinction coefficients calculated in
ProtParam
[45] (E 0.1 % =1.560 and 1.239 for Cv-(S)-ATA and Ao-(R)-
ATA, respectively). The increase of A 245nm, corresponding to the
absorption maximum of the ketone product acetophenone, was
monitored over an assay time of three minutes. The averaged
values of the slopes obtained from the assay performed in triplicate
were taken as reliable values for the initial enzymatic rates. From
these values, using the molar extinction coefficient of acetophe-
none
[46] (e =12 mM /C01 cm/C01), the enzyme concentration could be
expressed in [mU/mg] (103 mU/mg for Cv-(S)-ATA and 169 mU/mg
for Ao-(R)-ATA).
Racemization Reaction Setup
All reactions and controls (1 ml) were performed in HEPES pH 7.5
(50 mM) supplemented with glycerol (20 % v/v) in sealed 1.5 ml
glass vials kept in the dark under mild agitation at room temper-
ature for 4 days. The racemization of the model compound 1-
methyl-3-phenylpropylamine (15 mM) was tested starting from
each one of its pure enantiomers 1a and 1b (purchased from

ACROS organics) in the presence of the opposite alanine
enantiomer 3b or 3a (10 mM) as amino donor for the asymmetric
synthesis half-reaction and pyruvate 4 (4.5 mM) as amino acceptor
in the kinetic resolution half-reaction (Figure 1). PLP (0.1 mM) was
also added to reactions and controls at time zero. Additional
cofactor (0.4 mmol) was supplemented daily to all mixtures with the
exception of one control racemization reaction (containing 1b as
substrate) in which no additional PLP was added after time zero.
The reactions were started upon simultaneous addition of Ao-(R)-
ATA and Cv-(S)-ATA (50 mU each) to the reaction mixtures. The
corresponding volume in buffer was added to each control
mixture.
Reaction Workup and Analytics
Samples for analysis (200 ml) were transferred to clean tubes and
basified adding 1 M NaOH (20 ml). Ethyl acetate (220 ml) was then
used to perform extraction. Phase separation was achieved by
centrifugation.
GC Quantitative Analysis of 4-phenyl-2-butanone
GC quantitative analysis of 4-phenyl-2-butanone was performed on
a Varian Star 3400 CX equipped with an Agilent DB-5 ms Ultra Inert
column (30 m /C148 0.25 mm /C148 0.25 mm) and a FID detector using N
2 as
carrier. A calibration curve for the target 4-phenyl-2-butanone (R 2 =
98.5 %) was obtained in the concentration range 2–8 mM using
acetophenone (15 mM in anhydrous ethyl acetate) as external
standard. For the sample analysis, the acetate phase obtained from
the extraction (90 ml) was dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate and
a small amount (38 ml) was mixed with the external standard (10 ml)
in a clean tube. After 1 : 2 dilution in anhydrous ethyl acetate, 1 ml
of sample was manually injected for analysis. The GC method
consisted in a linear temperature gradient (10 8C/min) from 50 8C
(initial time 2 min) to 250 8C. Retention times were 9.5 min for the
external standard acetophenone and 11.79 min for the target
compound 4-phenyl-2-butanone. The values of the peak integrals
have been automatically assigned by the program Varian Work-
Station Version 6.41 Multi Instrument using default integration
parameters.
HPLC Qualitative Analysis of
N-acetyl-(R,S)-1-methyl-3-phenylpropylamine and Estimation
of V0 and trac
Qualitative chiral analysis of the final 1-methyl-3-phenylpropyl-
amine mixture was performed after acetylation of the primary
amino group. Derivatization was performed adding acetic
anhydride (5 ml) to the ethyl acetate phase obtained from the
reaction workup (100 ml). The organic phase was washed with
0.1 M NaOH (100 ml) and dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate.
The ethyl acetate was then evaporated. In the case of the
racemization samples (Table 1), 5 ml of the final amide mixture
redissolved in hexane:isopropanol (90 : 10) was used for analysis.
Separation of the two amide enantiomers was achieved on a
Chiracel OD/C0H column using isocratic elution in hexane:isopro-
panol (90 : 10) at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. Retention times were
12.2 min and 14.5 min for the ( R)- and ( S)-enantiomers,
respectively. In the case of the samples used for the determi-
nation of the racemization kinetics (Figure 1), the final amide
mixture redissolved in isopropyl-ether (10 ml) was injected into
a Chiralpak AD /C0H column (250 mm, analytical scale). Isocratic
elution in n-heptane : 2-propanol (98 : 2) at a flow-rate of 0.75 ml/
min gave good separation, with retention times 28 and 30
minutes for the ( R)- and ( S)-enantiomers, respectively. Peak
integrals were calculated using OpenChrom (Alder, Community
Edition v 1.2.0). The ratios of the enantiomers in the mixtures
were calculated by dividing the integral of the newly formed
enantiomer by the integral of the starting enantiomer. The
values obtained were plotted in Excel and the slopes of the
linear interpolations of the first two points were defined as the
V
0 of the racemization reactions. t rac was then defined as the
abscissa value of the intersection point between the linear
interpolation and y =1, corresponding to a ratio of the
enantiomers of 1, i. e. a racemate (Figure S5 and S6).
