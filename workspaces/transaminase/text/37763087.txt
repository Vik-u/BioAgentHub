Abstract: Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is often accompanied with metabolic disturbances
attributed to androgen excess and obesity, but the contribution of each has not been deﬁned, and the
occurrence of metabolic disturbances is usually not investigated. Ninety-nine women with PCOS
and forty-one without PCOS were evaluated. The clinical biomarkers of alterations related to glucose
(glucose, insulin, and clamp-derived glucose disposal − M), liver (aspartate aminotransferase, ala-
nine aminotransferase, and gamma-glutamyl transferase), and endothelium (arginine, asymmetric
dymethylarginine, carotid intima-media thickness, and ﬂow-mediated dilation) metabolism were
measured; participants were categorized into four groups according to their obesity (OB) and hy-
perandrogenemia (HA) status as follows: Healthy (no-HA, lean), HA (HA, lean), OB (no-HA, OB),
and HAOB (HA, OB). Metabolic disturbances were very frequent in women with PCOS ( ≈70%).
BMI correlated with all biomarkers, whereas free testosterone (FT) correlated with only glucose- and
liver-related indicators. Although insulin sensitivity and liver enzymes were associated with FT,
women with obesity showed lower M (coef = 8.56 − 0.080(FT) − 3.71(Ob); p < 0.001) and higher
aspartate aminotransferase (coef = 26.27 + 0.532 (FT) + 8.08 (Ob); p = 0.015) than lean women with the
same level of FT. Women with obesity showed a higher risk of metabolic disorders than lean women,
independent of hyperandrogenemia. Clinicians are compelled to look for metabolic alterations in
women with PCOS. Obesity should be treated in all cases, but hyperandrogenemia should also be
monitored in those with glucose-or liver-related disturbances.
Keywords: polycystic ovary syndrome; obesity-related metabolic disorders; hyperandrogenemia
1. Introduction
Many challenges remain in understanding the basis and lack of therapeutic success in
the treatment of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), a clinically heterogeneous condition
characterized by ovarian dysfunction, hyperandrogenism, and multiple ovarian cysts [1,2].
This is partly because there are still gaps in knowledge about the pathophysiology of
the syndrome, but also because patients with PCOS often seek medical attention only
if they experience severe clinical manifestations or for reproductive reasons and, conse-
quently, treatment is frequently tailored to ameliorate speciﬁc manifestations or to meet
requirements of individual needs. Thus, the existence of metabolic conditions commonly
associated with the syndrome, such as diabetes, dyslipidemia, and cardiovascular and hep-
atic diseases [2,3] are usually not investigated. Scientiﬁc evidence suggests that androgen
excess plays a critical role in the pathophysiology of metabolic disturbances [ 3,4], but it
J. Pers. Med. 2023, 13, 1319. https://doi.org/10.3390/jpm13091319 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/jpm
J. Pers. Med. 2023, 13, 1319 2 of 12
is unclear whether these disturbances are related to obesity, as PCOS often coexists with
this phenotype. Identifying the contribution of obesity and hyperandrogenemia to the
risk of clinical metabolic conditions and recognizing the importance of identifying early
metabolic alterations is a priority, as this would allow us to take prompt actions to delineate
the appropriate therapeutic approach to modify the natural history of the syndrome.
The metabolic morbidity associated with PCOS, including insulin resistance, diabetes,
dyslipidemia, and endothelial disturbances that lead to cardiovascular disease, has been
extensively evaluated in population-based studies and in several meta-analyses [ 5–10].
Although studies agree that patients with PCOS are at risk for metabolic disorders, almost
none of them identify the isolated contribution of androgen excess or obesity. Few studies
have made some approximations eliminating the effect of obesity by comparing lean with
lean-control PCOS patients [ 5] or adjusting for nutritional status [ 6,10], but the results
remain inconsistent.
From a clinical perspective, this information is relevant for choosing the appropriate
medical treatment. However, to properly assign the detrimental effect to obesity or hy-
perandrogenemia, it is essential to exclude the inﬂuence of other factors also involved in
the development of metabolic conditions, such as age, sedentary lifestyles, dyslipidemia,
smoking, and the type of lipid intake in the diet [3,11–13]. Nevertheless, this is not an easy
task, because most of these factors are interrelated.
Under the hypothesis that androgen excess is the main contributor of metabolic alter-
ations in patients with PCOS, in the present study we aimed to separate the contribution of
androgen excess and obesity on the susceptibility to develop metabolic disorders in women
with PCOS. The contribution of hyperandrogenemia and obesity to the risk of developing
metabolic disturbances related to glucose, lipids, endothelium, and liver, was analyzed,
considering the inﬂuence of important confounders. The frequency of metabolic disorders
was compared between women with or without hyperandrogenemia and women with or
without obesity.
2. Materials and Methods
2.1. Design
A cross-sectional study was conducted on patients with PCOS and unrelated controls
at hospitals of the Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social (IMSS) in Mexico City. Partici-
pants were enrolled between September 2018 and January 2020. Patients diagnosed with
PCOS were recruited at the Department of Reproductive Medicine of a gynecological
hospital, the research procedures were carried out at the Medical Nutrition Research
Unit, and ultrasound measurements were performed at the Department of Research and
Health Education of a cardiology hospital. Women without PCOS were recruited in
the waiting rooms of the participating hospitals. The protocol was authorized by the
IMSS National Committee for Scientiﬁc Research (R-2018-785-101). Written informed con-
sent was obtained from all participants. The study adheres to the STROBE reporting
guidelines (https://www.equator-network.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/STROBE_
checklist_v4_cross-sectional.pdf. (accessed on 8 August 2023)).
Women with or without PCOS according to the Rotterdam criteria [1] were enrolled.
Body mass index (BMI) above 30 kg/m 2 or below 25 kg/m2 was used to deﬁne obesity
and normal weight, respectively. For sampling, women diagnosed with PCOS, with or
without obesity, were recruited and, in parallel, an intentional search was performed
for women with or without obesity but without the syndrome. Selected women were
between 18 and 38 years old, who did not take medication, hormones, or supplements,
who were non-smokers, and who did not have diabetes, hypertension, or any known
cardiovascular disease. Women without PCOS who were relatives of a patient with PCOS
were excluded. Field workers were trained and standardized for all study procedures.
The ﬁrst appointment was arranged to explain the protocol procedures, measure blood
pressure and anthropometry, and sign the informed consent form. The second appoint-
ment was scheduled within a week at 7:00 am to measure ultrasound variables, apply
J. Pers. Med. 2023, 13, 1319 3 of 12
a 24 h recall questionnaire, and perform a hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp. All the
women underwent a pregnancy test before starting the clamp. Fasting blood samples
were obtained, centrifuged at 3000 rpm, and serum aliquots were reserved at −20 ◦C until
biochemical determinations.
2.2. Measurements
To determine the common carotid intima-media thickness (CIMT), women were placed
in a supine position with the neck extended and rotated 45 degrees. The transducer was posi-
tioned at an inclination of 45–50 degrees (Samsung Medison, Sonoace R3 model7.0–13 MHz
linear transducer, Seoul, Korea). The measurement point was set in the proximal carotid
at 3–4 cm from the bulb with the ultrasound beam directed perpendicularly to the carotid
to identify the intima-media. CIMT was measured from the intima-blood interface to the
adventitia-media interface [14]. The right and left sides were measured, and the highest
value was used for analysis. To determine the flow-mediated dilation (FMD) of the brachial
artery , women were placed on their left side with the right arm extended. Blood pressure
was measured with a manual sphygmomanometer (Check A Teck by Hergom, B2_D model),
the ultrasound transducer was positioned on the right arm, the brachial artery was identified,
and the diameter was recorded. Immediately after, the sphygmomanometer cuff was placed
2 cm above the antecubital fold and insufflated for 5 min at 50 mmHg above the systolic
blood pressure taken at the beginning. After 60 s of cuff deflation, the artery diameter was
measured again. FMD was calculated using the formula: D1−D0/D0 × 100 (where D0 and
D1 are the first and second diameters measured) [15].
Multiple-pass 24 h recall questionnaires were collected once to obtain dietary intake
information [16]. Nutrient quantiﬁcation was performed with Food Processor software
(v11.7, 2000, ESHA Research Inc., Salem, OR, USA). Energy and nutrient intakes were
expressed as absolute values and as the percentage of recommendations [ 17–19]. The
women were asked if they were involved in any structured exercise routine, and the
expected response was yes or no. If the answer was yes, the time in minutes was registered.
Clamps were conducted as proposed by DeFronzo [20] at 8:00 am after 10 h of fasting.
An antecubital venous catheter was placed to administer glucose and insulin infusions. A
second retrograde catheter was placed in the opposite hand for sample collection while
the hand was kept in a warming device at a temperature of 50–65 ◦C (Moist Heating Pad,
®BesMed: HT-00257, Mexico City, Mexico). Blood samples were drawn at 5 min intervals
for glucose determinations (0.5 mL). Insulin infusion started at 80 mU/m2 body surface
area (BSA) for 10 min, followed by a constant infusion of 40 mU/m2 BSA. A 20% glucose
solution was administered at a variable rate to maintain plasma glucose at 90 mg/dL. The
mean glucose infusion rate (M, mg/kg/min) was assessed during the last 30 min when the
steady state (glucose concentration at 90 ± 3 mg/dL) was reached (Figure S1).
Serum glucose, alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST),
gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT), triglycerides, total cholesterol, HDL, and VLDL (Spin-
react. Sant Esteve D’en Bas, Spain) were determined via enzymatic analysis (YSI 2300 Stat
Plus Glucose Analyzer, YSI Inc., Yellow Springs, OH, USA). LDL was estimated using
the Friedewald method [21]. Insulin and steroid hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) were
measured via chemiluminescence (Immulite, Siemens; Cambridge, UK), arginine, and
asymmetric dimethyl arginine (ADMA) using high-performance liquid chromatography
(Waters, ACQUITY UPLC system; Milford, MA, USA), and total testosterone (TT) via
UPLC-MS/MS (Waters Xevo TQD Acquity UPLC H; Milford, MA, USA). Free testosterone
(FT) was calculated using the Vermeulen method [ 22]. The coefﬁcients of variation in
biochemical assays ranged from 5–10%.
2.3. Diagnosis of Metabolic Disorders
The cut-off points used for diagnosis were as follows: M < 5.7 mg/kg/min for insulin
resistance [23]; fasting glucose > 100 mg/dL for prediabetes [24]; ADMA > 0.88µmol/L [25];
CIMT > 0.5 mm [14] or FMD < 10% [15] for endothelial dysfunction; ALT > 30 U/L [26] or
J. Pers. Med. 2023, 13, 1319 4 of 12
AST: ALT ratio < 1.0 for liver damage [27]; non-HDL > 144 mg/dL for dyslipidemia [13];
and blood pressure > 120/80 for hypertension [28]. FT > 5.6 pg/mL was used to identify
hyperandrogenemia [29] and women were classiﬁed with obesity if BMI ≥ 30 kg/m2, or
without obesity if BMI ≤ 25 kg/m2 [30].
2.4. Statistical Analysis
To calculate the sample size, we used the information reported by Pradisi et al. [31],
who evaluated lipid proﬁle, insulin, and endothelial function in women with and without
PCOS with obesity. A correlation coefﬁcient between leg blood ﬂow and free testosterone
−0.52, 80% beta, 0.05 alpha, as well as a mean lipoprotein difference of 8 mg/dL between
overweight women with and without PCOS were used. The calculated sample size was
51 women with PCOS and 51 without PCOS. Forty women were added to conduct a
stratiﬁed analysis according to obesity and hyperandrogenemia status. The estimated
sample size was 142 women.
The Minitab statistical package (v19, State College, PA, USA) was used for the analysis.
A p-value ≤ 0.05 was considered statistically signiﬁcant. Quantitative variables were
expressed as means, standard errors (SEM) or 95% conﬁdence intervals (95%CI), and
qualitative variables as proportions. The equality of variances was analyzed using Levene’s
test. Differences between two independent groups (PCOS vs. non-PCOS) were analyzed
using the Student t-test. Pearson correlation analyses were carried out to identify univariate
associations between biomarkers. Associations among qualitative variables were evaluated
via χ2 analyses.
For multiple analyses, regression models were carried out considering metabolic
biomarkers as dependent variables, BMI and FT as predictors, and age and dietary lipids
(total lipids, saturated fat, trans, ω-3, and 6 fatty acids) intake as confounders; the presence
of PCOS and dyslipidemia were introduced as covariates. The General Linear Model
approach was used to examine the ﬁxed effects of obesity and hyperandrogenemia on
metabolic markers, and Bonferroni post hoc test and interactions were evaluated. The
variance inﬂation factor was used to evaluate collinearity. In another statistical approach,
multiple regression analyses were conducted to explore the association between FT and
biomarkers, introducing obesity as a covariate.
To separate the influence of obesity (OB) and hyperandrogenemia (HA) on the metabolic
disorders studied, women were categorized into four groups: Healthy (no-HA, lean), HA
(HA, lean), OB (no-HA, OB) and HAOB (HA and OB). The risk of glucose-, lipid-,endothelial-,
and liver-related disorders was assessed via logistic regression analysis, introducing the
stratiﬁed groups as predictors. Models were adjusted for age, dyslipidemia, and dietary
lipids (total lipids, saturated fat, trans, ω-3, and 6 fatty acids).
3. Results
3.1. General Characteristics
We studied 140 women aged 29 ± 5.4 years, with a BMI of 30.4 ± 6.4 kg/m2. Daily
energy intake was 2163 ± 80 kcal, sugar 88 ± 5 g/d, total lipids 71 ± 4 g/d, saturated
fat 22 ± 1 g/d, and omega-3 fatty acids 0.9 ± 0.1 g/d (Table S1: Dietary intake). None of
the women reported a structured exercise routine. As expected, signiﬁcant interrelations
were observed between the variables studied in the simple correlation analyses (Table S2:
Univariate correlations). Ninety-nine women met the diagnostic criteria for PCOS.
The average of most measurements in patients with PCOS was different from that of
controls and was outside the reference limits (Table S3: Clinical and biochemical character-
istics of women with or without PCOS). The frequency of insulin resistance (68% vs. 22%),
dyslipidemia (32% vs. 12%), endothelial dysfunction (79% vs. 61%), carotid intima-media
thickening (58% vs. 39%), and biomarkers of hepatic disturbances (89% vs. 63%) were
signiﬁcantly higher in the groups of women with PCOS than in those without PCOS. Mean
(±SE) BMI (31.77 ± 0.59 vs. 27.18 ± 1.0 kg/m2, p < 0.001) and free testosterone (8.2 ± 0.60
vs. 4.6 ± 0.63 pg/mL, p < 0.001) were also higher in women with PCOS than in those

without the syndrome. Obesity was observed in 72 (73%) women with PCOS and 17 (42%)
without PCOS, and hyperandrogenemia in 57 (58%) and 11 (27%) women, respectively

22%), dyslipidemia (32% vs. 12%), endothelial dysfunction (79% vs. 61%), carotid intima-
media thickening (58% vs. 39%), and biomarkers of hepatic disturbances (89% vs. 63%) 
were signiﬁcantly higher in the groups of women with PCOS than in those without PCOS. 
Mean (±SE) BMI (31.77 ± 0.59 vs. 27.18 ± 1.0 kg/m2, p < 0.001) and free testosterone (8.2 ±

without the syndrome. Obesity was observed in 72 (73%) women with PCOS and 17 (42%) 
without PCOS, and hyperandrogenemia in 57 (58%) and 11 (27%) women, respectively

3.2. Associations between Free Testosterone and BMI with Biomarkers of Metabolic Disorders 
Adjusted linear models showed that BMI was related to almost all metabolic bi-
omarkers, whereas FT was only associated with insulin and liver-related biomarkers. In-
sulin sensitivity decreased further in patients with PCOS (Table 1), whereas dietary ω-3 
faĴy acids increased it (M = 0.744 ± 0.246, p = 0.003). The introduction of confounders did 
not modify the associations of BMI and FT with biomarkers.

With another statistical approach, we observed that FT was inversely associated with
clamp-derived glucose disposal (M), and directly associated with liver enzymes, but women
with obesity had lower M values and higher enzyme concentrations than women without
obesity at the same level of FT. The regression line of women without obesity was mostly
within normal ranges (Figure 2).

3.3. Contribution of Obesity and Hyperandrogenemia to the Susceptibility of Metabolic Disorders
Most clinical and biochemical variables were affected by obesity, whereas hyperan-
drogenemia affected only blood pressure and insulin concentration. The dietary intake
of trans fatty acids tended to be higher ( p = 0.076), and that of omega-3 ( p = 0.001) and
omega-6 (p = 0.042) fatty acids was lower in groups with obesity than in those without
obesity (Table 2). All the other dietary variables were comparable among groups.
The studied biomarkers were compared among 32 Healthy, 19 HA, 40 OB, and
49 HAOB women. Hypertension (8%) and prediabetes (11%) were observed exclusively in
the two groups with obesity. Overall, the proportion of women with measurements outside
the reference limits was higher in the two groups with obesity than in those without it.

Consequently, the risk of metabolic disturbances was several orders of magnitude higher
in the OB and HAOB groups than in the Healthy (control) group, and the risk of having M,
HDL, CIMT, and liver enzymes outside normal ranges (described in Section 2.3: Diagnoses
of Metabolic Disorders) in women with obesity was also higher compared to women with
hyperandrogenemia but without obesity (HA). Susceptibility to metabolic disturbances
was comparable between the OB and HAOB groups (Table 3).

4. Discussion
In the present study, we demonstrated that obesity is the main factor that contributes to
the development of metabolic disorders in patients with PCOS. However, we also identiﬁed
a mild but consistent effect of androgens on glucose- and liver-related biomarkers that were
independent of obesity. We also conﬁrmed the high frequency of metabolic disorders in
women with PCOS, as already reported by others [2,5,8–10], and additionally, provided
data concerning the high frequency of metabolic alterations that have not yet been revealed
as a pathological entity.
Although the detrimental effect of both obesity and androgen excess in patients
with PCOS has already been reported [2–4], our analysis allowed us to discriminate the
contribution of each to the risk of metabolic disturbances, which is paramount to choosing
the appropriate therapeutic approach. This analysis revealed that the inﬂuence of obesity is
stronger than that of androgen excess, as the two groups with obesity showed comparable
J. Pers. Med. 2023, 13, 1319 9 of 12
risks of metabolic disturbances independently of hyperandrogenemia, and higher values
than those without obesity. Such results show the predominant involvement of obesity in
the development of metabolic diseases in patients with PCOS. Nevertheless, since the group
of women with hyperandrogenemia and normal weight consistently showed intermediate
risks between healthy and OB, the involvement of androgen excess in the susceptibility to
metabolic disturbances could not be ruled out. Indeed, the potential inﬂuence of androgens
on metabolism was observed in the linear regression models, which demonstrated a
dose–response association between androgens and glucose- and liver-related biomarkers.
That is, the higher the FT concentration, the lower the M and the higher the concentration
of the hepatic enzyme, even within normal ranges. We interpret these results as evidence of
a mild but consistent inﬂuence of androgens on metabolism, which may progress toward a
pathological condition.
Our study confirmed the high frequency of clinical conditions in patients with PCOS, in-
cluding dyslipidemia, thickened carotid, and liver alterations, reported in otherstudies [2,5,8–10].
We also provided additional evidence regarding the high frequency of metabolic alterations,
such as decreased insulin sensitivity and increased biomarkers of endothelial and hep-
atic alterations, which have not reached the cut-off point to diagnose a clinical condition
but are precursors of chronic pathologies. This is clinically relevant because it underlies
the need to intentionally search for these disturbances to prevent progression to an irre-
versible condition such as diabetes, endothelial dysfunction, and non-alcoholic fatty liver
disease (NAFLD).
We acknowledge some limitations, mainly the small sample of women in the HA
group. Although this circumstance may lead to a lack of power to detect differences
between the groups as observed in the stratiﬁed analysis, other statistical approaches used
in our study, which used continuous data instead of stratiﬁcation, allowed us to identify
the androgenic effect with reasonable certainty. It is also an important limitation that we
considered liver enzymes as potential markers of hepatic disturbances. We are aware that
these enzymes raise non-speciﬁcally in response to liver aggressions from different etiology
(e.g., metabolic, viral, toxic, and alcoholic), and even in response to extrahepatic injuries;
therefore, their elevation is not a speciﬁc indication of metabolic liver damage. Nevertheless,
considering the high frequency of obesity-associated hepatic alterations reported in the
literature, and that most of our participants exhibited obesity and did not acknowledge
alcohol consumption, we think that the liver involvement in these patients is probably
high. In addition, we believe that the use of a proposed ALT cut-off point to identify
healthy individuals, derived from a huge sample of women without risk factors for liver
disease, and validated for its ability to predict liver damage [26], increases the likelihood
that our result will be correctly interpreted. Furthermore, the association of liver enzymes
with obesity and hyperandrogenemia was consistent throughout the different analyses,
suggesting the plausibility of our interpretation. Yet, we recognize that this ﬁnding needs to
be replicated with appropriate diagnostic tools for liver damage. Finally, we acknowledge
that we studied a particular selected population, as participants were recruited from a
hospital that treats fertility cases and were purposefully selected if they met the selection
criteria until the proposed sample size was completed. Therefore, our results may apply
only to women with similar characteristics.
Our study has important strengths that are worth highlighting. The stratiﬁed analysis
allowed us to disentangle the role of obesity and hyperandrogenemia, providing strong
evidence for the predominant role of obesity over that of androgen excess. This is clinically
relevant because it provides the basis for selecting the most appropriate therapeutic ap-
proach. In addition, we used cutting-edge technology to measure important variables, thus
obtaining accurate data on insulin sensitivity (clamp), testosterone (mass-spectrometry),
and endothelial dysfunction (two biochemical, ADMA and arginine, and two ultrasound,
CIMT and FMD), which improved the chance of detecting any possible effects. Moreover,
we excluded overweight women to increase the likelihood of identifying differences in
the metabolic proﬁles of women with or without obesity. Furthermore, we considered the
J. Pers. Med. 2023, 13, 1319 10 of 12
inﬂuence of important confounders like dyslipidemia and dietary lipids, which are often
associated with the risk of metabolic disorders but are not usually considered in similar
studies. We believe that all these characteristics made our results robust and reliable.
The recommendations of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists
for the management of patients with PCOS include the evaluation of BMI, blood pres-
sure, and laboratory documentation of hyperandrogenemia and metabolic abnormalities,
such as a two-hour glucose tolerance test, as well as fasting lipid and lipoprotein con-
centrations [33]. Our results support these recommendations and, additionally, provide
enough information to encourage intentional screening for liver abnormalities. We are
certain that providing speciﬁc recommendations for the management of PCOS is beyond
the scope of our study, yet it is important to point out the importance of treating obesity
and its complications, such as insulin resistance. In this regard, one issue that deserves
attention is the effect of a low intake of omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids on insulin
sensitivity observed in our study. Although the dietary information obtained with a single
24 h recall questionnaire constitutes a limitation for interpreting the inﬂuence of nutrient
intake, our results are consistent with others found in studies conducted in Mexico by our
team [12] and by others [34], suggesting that the extremely low intake of these fatty acids
in Mexican population is a reliable circumstance. The issue is important because evidence
from experimental studies demonstrates that the long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids
omega-3 are involved in insulin sensitivity and endothelial and hepatic protection [35,36].
In this regard, we had previously reported that eicosapentaenoic acid in erythrocytes, and
supplementation with docosahexaenoic and eicosapentaenoic acid, were associated with
an improved androgenic proﬁle of pubertal girls with obesity [37]. We should take this into
account when planning the treatment of patients with PCOS. On the other hand, the lack of
association between metabolic alterations and saturated fat intake is probably explained by
the close-to-recommended intake of these nutrients.
5. Conclusions
In conclusion, our results have potential clinical implications in the choice of treatment
for patients with PCOS, as well as in the prevention of metabolic disturbances and pro-
gression to irreversible conditions. Our study also highlights the need for a major effort to
improve the detection of metabolic disturbances in clinical settings. Focusing on these situ-
ations will hopefully help clinicians and health authorities to make better decisions in the
management of PCOS patients to limit the progression to irreversible metabolic conditions.
