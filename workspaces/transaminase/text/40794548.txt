 Objective: Unusual clinical course
 Background: Acetaminophen toxicity is a leading cause of liver injury in adolescents and is usually treated with N-acetylcysteine 
(NAC). Rarely, adjunctive therapies, including hemodialysis (HD) and fomepizole, are required. This report de-
scribes the case of a 15-year-old male adolescent who required 2 hemodialysis sessions greater than 24 hours 
apart after a massive, intentional ingestion of acetaminophen.
 Case Report: A 15-year-old male patient presented to care after a single, intentional ingestion of approximately 195 g of 
extended-release acetaminophen. He was started on NAC therapy, and due to concern for early mitochondri-
al failure, he underwent intermittent HD, with reduction of his acetaminophen level. However, over 24 hours 
later, his transaminases increased and liver synthetic function declined, and he underwent HD a second time. 
There was no evidence of bezoar formation on computed tomography (CT) scan, suggesting that ongoing ab-
sorption was due to the extended-release formulation consumed. After his second HD session, his laboratory 
values normalized and he was medically cleared for transfer to psychiatry.
 Conclusions: The need for a second HD session in acetaminophen toxicity >24 hours after an initial successful HD session is 
unprecedented. Given an increasing market of extended-release products and the potential for co-ingestions 
with medications that slow gastrointestinal motility, HD may be more frequently employed going forward, po-
tentially multiple times. While central lines should be removed promptly when no longer needed, we advise 
caution in removing dialysis catheters within 24 hours of initial HD in these patients, given the need to repeat 
HD in this case.

Introduction
Acetaminophen overdose is the most common cause of over-
dose-related acute liver failure requiring liver transplantation 
in the United States [1]. It is also the most commonly identified 
cause of pediatric acute liver failure, recognizing that approxi-
mately 40% of pediatric acute liver failure cases have uniden-
tified causes [2]. Acetaminophen toxicity arises once glucuron-
idation and sulfation biotransformation pathways become 
saturated, and glutathione stores become significantly deplet-
ed [1]. Rather than renally-excretable nontoxic metabolites, the 
toxic metabolite N-acetyl-p-benzoquinone imine (NAPQI) is pro-
duced in increased amounts when acetaminophen levels are su-
pratherapeutic via the activity of a pathway involving CYP2E1 [1]. 
In large quantities, NAPQI can rapidly increase reactive oxygen 
species and lead to cell death [1,3]. Typically, this manifests as 
hepatotoxicity and renal injury, which becomes most evident 
within 1-3 days after ingestion, after typical initial symptoms of 
nausea, vomiting, and malaise have subsided. To prevent ful-
minant liver failure, gastric decontamination and early treat -
ment with N-acetylcysteine (NAC) are the mainstays of therapy, 
as advised by the American College of Medical Toxicology [3]. 
While NAC therapy is remarkably effective in the vast majority 
of pediatric acetaminophen overdoses, adjunctive therapies, in-
cluding hemodialysis (HD) and fomepizole administration, are 
sometimes employed in patients with massive ingestions, or 
when patients exhibit signs of mitochondrial failure (eg, altered 
mental status with lactic acidosis) or acute renal failure (eg, ol-
iguria and rising creatinine) [4,5]. Here, we describe the case 
of a 15-year-old male patient who received 2 separate inter -
mittent HD sessions greater than 24 hours apart after a mas-
sive, intentional ingestion of extended-release acetaminophen.
Case Report
Our hospital received a transfer request call from a referring 
hospital for a 15-year-old male who had presented after an 
intentional ingestion of approximately 300 tablets of extend-
ed-release acetaminophen (650 mg each), without reported 
co-ingestion of other medications. He developed nausea, dis-
closed his actions to his mother, and presented to the referring 
facility within 2 hours after ingestion. There, a physical exam 
was non-contributory without significant tenderness to pal -
pation of his abdomen. He was started on NAC and received 
oral activated charcoal in consultation with the regional poi -
son control center. Initial laboratory values did not reveal con-
cerning findings beyond an acetaminophen level of 272 mg/L 
(Table 1, Time A). However, 20 hours after ingestion, his acet-
aminophen level increased to >400 mg/L (the maximum result 
of the institution’s laboratory), lactate increased to 8.5 mmol/L, 
and he had an acute change in mental status (Time B). He was

intubated for airway protection, and, after discussions with a 
medical toxicologist, the NAC dose was doubled, fomepizole 
was given, and intermittent HD was urgently initiated (dialy-
sate flow rate 800 mL/min, blood flow rate 200 mL/min). He 
received 4 hours of HD, after which his acetaminophen lev -
el decreased to 253 mcg/dL, and his mental status improved 
(Time C). The referring facility called our hospital in anticipa-
tion of the possible need for liver transplantation.
At our hospital, initial laboratory data showed an acetamino-
phen level that had continued to downtrend (193 mg/L) on in-
travenous NAC, no notable transaminase elevation, and minimal 
acidosis (Time D). Ultrasound imaging of his liver parenchyma 
and vasculature was reassuring. Clinically, he was alert and ori-
ented x3, with a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) of 15, and he had 
reassuring hemodynamics. He was extubated a few hours after 
arrival. However, over the next 24 hours, his acetaminophen 
level markedly increased to 347 mg/L, he developed significant 
transaminase elevation, and his International Normalized Ratio 
(INR) rose to 2.9 (Time E). In consultation with medical toxicol-
ogy, his NAC dose was increased yet again to 25 mg/kg/h (4 
times the typical third-bag infusion rate), and fomepizole was 
re-administered. His GCS remained 15, but he was noted to be 
less alert. A computed tomography (CT) scan of his abdomen 
was performed to assess for bezoar formation, with possible 
endoscopy to follow; however, given no obvious bezoar for -
mation on CT, endoscopy was not pursued. He was ultimately 
restarted on intermittent HD, which lasted 4 hours (dialysate 
flow rate 600 mL/min, blood flow rate 300 mL/min), with rap-
id improvement in acetaminophen levels to 6 mg/L. The trans-
aminase concentrations then began to plateau, his INR normal-
ized, and his NAC was stopped approximately 96 hours after 
ingestion (Time F). Over the next 24 hours, the transaminase 
levels decreased, and he was medically cleared for transfer to 
inpatient psychiatric treatment (Time G).
Discussion
This case report demonstrates the critical role that extracor -
poreal removal of acetaminophen plays in massive ingestion, 
while also showing the hazard of stopping dialysis too early 
when the risk of delayed absorption is high, as with extended-
release products. The risk of future cases like this one is hard-
ly negligible: among all medication poisonings, acetaminophen 
causes the most hospital admissions among pediatric patients 
in the United States, with >1 child admitted every hour due 
to acetaminophen ingestion [6]. Unfortunately, it is a growing 
problem. Data from US poison control centers indicates that 
while around 10 000 intentional overdoses of acetaminophen 
among youths took place in each of the pre-COVID pandemic 
years of 2016-18, that number jumped to greater than 15 000 
in 2020 and to approximately 20 000 in 2021 and in 2022 [7].
Our patient was a teenage boy who intentionally ingested ap-
proximately 200 g of acetaminophen. He was appropriately 
started on gastric decontamination and NAC therapy once he 
presented to care, which was quite soon after ingestion. As 
expected, he did not show signs of liver injury in this immedi-
ate post-ingestion period, but did experience the typical clini-
cal symptom of nausea. However, within hours after ingestion, 
he exhibited signs of mitochondrial failure, with metabolic ac-
idosis and altered mental status before any demonstrable liv-
er injury. This phenomenon is thought to be due to both acet-
aminophen itself and reactive oxygen species resulting from 
NAPQI interfering with energy production. Extracorporeal re -
moval of acetaminophen is indicated in this clinical scenar -
io according to the Extracorporeal Treatments in Poisoning 
(EXTRIP) guidelines, a publication written by a working group 
of international toxicologists, nephrologists, and other experts 
advising the appropriate use of extracorporeal therapies for 
specific toxin removal [8]. These guidelines recommend the 
use of intermittent HD over continuous renal replacement in 
acetaminophen toxicity given the superior drug clearance of 
the former technique. Given modern HD membranes and ac-
etaminophen’s low molecular weight (151 Da) and low protein 
binding (<25%), dialysis has been shown to very effectively re-
move the drug [8]. Nevertheless, continuous renal replacement 
has also been shown to be successful in acetaminophen tox-
icity in pediatric patients, with 1 report describing its use in a 
toddler who had high transaminases and concern for cerebral 
edema, attempting to limit fluid shifts typical of intermittent 
HD that might worsen cerebral edema [4].
Our patient also underwent treatment with fomepizole, which 
prevents formation of toxic metabolites by inhibiting CYP2E149]. 
In the last decade, there have been a small number of case re-
ports on use of both fomepizole and renal replacement therapy 
in acetaminophen toxicity [5,10-13]. While intermittent HD was 
the initial choice for renal replacement in these cases, those 
without a drop in acetaminophen level with initial HD were 
switched to continuous renal replacement therapy [12,13]. In 
most of these, NAC dosing was empirically increased, as it was 
in this case, given some evidence it is dialyzable [5,10,11,13].
Thus, while there have been rare cases requiring repeated in-
termittent HD sessions and/or trials of continuous renal re -
placement therapy, none of these had initial improvement and 
then required re-initiation of extracorporeal toxin removal >24 
hours later. However, in this case, the patient’s acetaminophen 
level began to climb again more than 24 hours after the initial 
session of hemodialysis was performed, which suggests that 
ongoing absorption complicated our patient’s clinical course. 
Given the efficiency with which intermittent HD clears acet -
aminophen, we concluded that the patient’s drug absorption 
continued after the first HD session. With a negative CT scan, 
a bezoar does not appear to have played a role in slowing the

transit of the large quantity of ingested drug, instead suggest-
ing that the continued absorption was caused by ingesting an 
extended-release product.
Conclusions
Given the growing number of extended-release formulations 
of acetaminophen on the market, and the possibility of co-in-
gestions of medications that slow gastric motility (eg, anti -
histamines such as diphenhydramine, with which acetamino-
phen is often combined in a single pill), we anticipate that the 
need for subsequent HD sessions may be required 24 hours or 
more after the initial session. As such, we recommend close
