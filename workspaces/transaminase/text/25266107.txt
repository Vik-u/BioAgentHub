Engineered baker’s yeast as whole-cell biocatalyst
for one-pot stereo-selective conversion of amines
to alcohols
Nora Weber, Marie Gorwa-Grauslund and Magnus Carlquist*
Abstract
Background: One-pot multi-step biocatalysis is advantageous over step-by-step synthesis as it reduces the number
of process operation units, leading to significant process intensification. Whole-cell biocatalysis with metabolically
active cells is especially valuable since all enzymes can be co-expressed in the cell whose metabolism can be
exploited for supply of co-substrates and co-factors.
Results: In this study, a heterologous enzymatic system consisting ofω-transaminase and ketone reductase was
introduced inSaccharomyces cerevisiae, and evaluated for one-pot stereo-selective conversion of amines to alcohols.
The system was applied for simultaneous kinetic resolution ofracemic 1-phenylethylamine to (R)-1-phenylethylamine
and reduction of the ketone intermediate to (R)-1-phenylethanol. Glucose was used as sole co-substrate for both the
supply of amine acceptor and the regeneration of NADPH in the reduction step.
Conclusions: The whole-cell biocatalyst was shown to sustain transaminase-reductase-catalyzed enantioselective
conversion of amines to alcohols with glucose as co-substrate. The transamination catalyzed by recombinant vanillin
aminotransferase fromCapsicum chinenseproved to be the rate-limiting step as a three-fold increase in transaminase
gene copy number led to a two-fold increased conversion. The (R)-selective NADPH-dependent alcohol dehydrogenase
from Lactobacillus kefirproved to be efficient in catalyzing the reduction of the acetophenone generated in the
transamination reaction.

Background
Chiral amine and/or chiral alcohol moieties are present in
many bioactive molecules, e.g. Saxagliptin, which is used
for the treatment of type 2 diabetes; Vanlev, an antihyper-
tensive drug; Rivastigmine for the treatment of Alzheimer’s
disease and the HIV protease inhibitors Atazanavir and
Indinavirsulphate [1-3]. Consequently, efficient methods for
preparation of bioactive compounds with chiral amine and/
or alcohol functionalities, including their inter-conversion
and inversion of stereochemistry are needed. Chemical
methods where chiral amines aref i r s tt r a n s f o r m e di n t oi n -
termediates and subsequently into chiral alcohols with
inversion of the stereochemistry have been previously
described [4-6]. Additionally, amixture of diethylene glycol
and KOH at 210°C converts several amines into alcohols in
a one-pot reaction, albeit withlimited enantiomeric purity
[7], which highlights main limitations of chemical synthesis.
As an alternative, biocatalytic methods based on isolated
alcohol oxidase andω-transaminase enzymes for one-pot
conversion of alcohols to amines [8] and conversion of
amines to alcohols with ω-transaminase-oxidoreductase
enzymes [9] have been described. However, these methods
rely on the addition of multiple enzymes, expensive co-
substrates andin vitro co-factor regeneration systems. As
an alternative, whole-cell biocatalysis with recombinant
Pichia pastoris over-expressing a transaminase combined
with endogenous reductase activity has previously been
described for the conversion of amines to alcohols [10].
Additionally, it has been demonstrated, that recombinant
Saccharomyces cerevisiaeexpressingω-transaminase can be

used for kinetic resolution ofracemic amines with glucose
as sole co-substrate for the supply of amine acceptor and
pyridoxal-5’-phosphate by cell metabolism [11]. Engineered
yeast has also been developed for efficient stereo-selective
carbonyl reductions of prochiral ketones for the synthesis
of chiral alcohols (see review [12] or [13]). In that case, cell
metabolism was exploited forin vivo regeneration of the
NADPH co-factor [14,15].
Herein, we study the use of recombinant yeast as whole-
cell biocatalyst for one-pot enantioselective conversion of
amines to chiral alcohols, using the kinetic resolution of
racemic1-phenylethylamine (PEA) to (R)-1-PEA and simul-
taneous production of (R)-1-phenylethanol (1-PE) as a
model reaction (Figure 1).Enantiomerically pure (R)-1-PEA
and (R)-1-PE are for instance important building blocks for
the production of 4-amino-6-aryl thienopyrimidines and
Fendiline derivatives, which can be used for the treatment
of cancer, as well as for N3-substituted uridines with
CNS-depressant effect or (S)-Rivastigmine for the treatment
of Alzheimer’s disease [16-19]. In the present study, the
possibility to co-express a functional heterologous
ω-transaminase ketone reductase (TA-KRED) gene cascade,
and to exploit the inherent cellular machinery to generate
amine acceptors and for regeneration of NADPH via sugar
metabolism has been studied. The influence of a three-fold
increase of the transaminase gene copy number was evalu-
ated as well as the effect of resting or growing cells on con-
version. The specific reaction cascade does not exist in wild
type yeast, and the influence on cell physiology of the cata-
lytic activity of the artificially assembled enzymes has not
been described yet.
Results
Transamination and product inhibition
Whole-cell transamination was previously achieved in engi-
neered S. cerevisiae strains carrying a codon-optimised
vanillin aminotransferase (VAMT)g e n ef r o mCapsicum
chinense [11]. However, the reaction did not go to comple-
tion. A decrease of the transaminase reaction rate due to
substrate and/or (co-) product inhibition has previously
been observed [20-22]. So we investigated the effect of dif-
ferent concentrations of L-alanine and acetophenone
(ACP) on the efficiency of the kinetic resolution of (rac)-1-
PEA by strain TMB4350 (VAMT). The transamination
reaction with whole-cells was followed with concentrations
of L-alanine and ACP ranging from 0 to 10 mM at the start
of the reaction. The addition of L-alanine did not lead to
any negative effect on the kinetic resolution of (rac)-1-PEA
(Figure 2). In contrast, already 1 mM ACP inhibited kinetic
resolution of (rac)-1-PEA (Figure 2) and the conversion de-
creased to about half when 10 mM ACP were added. It was
therefore decided to further reduce ACP to a chiral alcohol,
which would limit the inhibition of the transamination
reaction, while generating another valuable chiral alcohol
product.
Assembly of functional transaminase - oxidoreductase
cascade in yeast
Codon-optimized genes encoding VAMT from Capsi-
cum chinense [23] and the (R)-specific alcohol dehydro-
genase (LK RADH)f r o mLactobacillus kefir [24] were
assembled in series in a chromosomal integration cas-
sette generating plasmid pNW4 (Table 1). The integra-
tive plasmid was used to transform the strain TMB4150,
generating VAMT + LK RADH strain (TMB4351). A
plasmid containing only VAMT gene and no reductase
was also constructed (pNW10, see Table 1), and used to
transform the same strain TMB4150, generating strain
TMB4367 (VAMT). Both strains contained identical
copy numbers of the integrated plasmid, which was
verified by qPCR (data not shown).
Strains VAMT (TMB4367) and VAMT + LK RADH
(TMB4351) were evaluated in a batch conversion of
(rac)-1-PEA to (R)-1-PEA and (R)-1-PE. In particular,
the specific activity, enantioselectivity and the ability to
exploit the native sugar metabolism to provide essential
co-factors and co-substrates for the reaction were
determined.
For the VAMT strain, about 1.1 mM ACP was formed
after 24 h of reaction, and thereafter it remained at this
concentration range until 72 h (Figure 3a). The ACP re-
ductase activity in cell extract was low (0.0099 ± 0.0075
U/mg for NADH and 0.0057 ± 0.0008 U/mg for
NADPH), which is in accordance with what has been
observed in previous studies [11]. Thus, as expected
there was no formation of 1-phenylethanol from
Figure 1Reaction scheme for simultaneous production of (R)-1-phenylethylamine (PEA) and (R)-1-phenylethanol (PE).

acetophenone from yeast endogenous reductase activity.
Overexpression of the NADPH dependent reductase
from Lactobacillus kefir in VAMT + LK RADH strain
led to 45 times higher activity with NADPH as co-factor
(0.2598 ± 0.0302 U/mg) and about 2 times higher activ-
ity with NADH (0.017 ± 0.0088 U/mg) in cell extract.
And during the first 24 h of the whole-cell conversion
of racemic 1-PEA, there was no ACP formation, but a
significant production of enantiomerically pure ( R)-1-
PE (>99% ee) instead (Figure 3b). In later stages of the
reaction, (R)-1-PE decreased from 1.48 mM at 24 h to
1.03 mM at 72 h while ACP accumulation was observed
( 0 . 5 4m Ma t7 2h ) .
During the first 24 h, the reaction rate of (S)-1-PEA to
ACP with VAMT + LK RADH strain (TMB4351) was

higher than for VAMT strain (TMB4367) with 0.008 mmol
(S)-1-PEA/g dw/h (see Figure 3a and b). It decreased
between 24 h and 48 h and stopped after that for both
strains at a substrate conversion of about 12% (VAMT +
LK RADH) and 9% (VAMT), respectively. Altogether, the
kinetic resolution of (rac)-1-PEA was improved by 25%
for VAMT + LK RADH strain (TMB4351) compared to
VAMT strain (TMB4367).
Effect of increasing the amount of gene copy numbers of
transaminase
To investigate if the limitation of the two-step reaction
lied in the transamination step, a strain with elevated
transaminase activity and unchanged reductase activity as
compared to VAMT + LK RADH strain (TMB4351) was
constructed by increasing VAMT gene copy number.
Strain TMB4365 containing several copies ofVAMT gene
was transformed with the plasmid pNW4 containing
VAMT and LK RADH generating strain TMB4373 which
contained three times more copies ofVAMT gene than
VAMT + LK RADH strain (TMB4351). The increased
gene copy number ofVAMT led to a two-fold higher con-
version for 3x VAMT + LK RADH strain (TMB4373)
(Figure 3c) compared to VAMT + LK RADH strain
(TMB4351) containing only one copy ofVAMT and LK
RADH genes (Figure 3b) and nearly three-fold higher con-
version than for VAMT strain (TMB4367) (Figure 3a).
The higher amount of transaminase increased the overall
reaction rate of the kinetic resolution from 0.014 mmol (S)-
1-PEA/g dw/h (TMB4351, 1x VAMT + 1x LK RADH) to

copies ofVAMT gene present, the reaction rate decreased

strain (TMB4373). As with VAMT + LK RADH strain
(TMB4351), 3x VAMT + 1x LK RADH strain (TMB4373)
showed no ACP production during the first 24 h, indicating
that the reductase was efficient in reducing ACP to (R)-1-
PE (Figure 3c). Between 24 h and 72 h however, nearly
twice the amount of ACP (1.05 mM) was formed with 3x
VAMT + LK RADH strain (TMB4373) than with VAMT +
LK RADH strain (0.54 mM, TMB4351). For both strains,
the highest amount of (R)-1-PE (>99%ee) was at 24 h, after
which it was decreasing at about the same rate (0.002 mmol
(R)-1-PE/g dw/h for VAMT + LK RADH strain, 0.001 mmol
(R)-1-PE/g dw/h for 3x VAMT + LK RADH strain).
Resting vs. growing cells as biocatalyst
Many biotransformations with whole-cells are carried
out with resting cells as no biomass is produced simul-
taneously which leads to high specific activities and
yields from the added energy source [26]. However, rest-
ing cells can lose their activity faster than growing cells
due to a shortage of intracellular NADPH and no possi-
bility for synthesis of new enzymes, due to limited nutri-
ent resources [26]. Therefore, the effect of using growing
instead of resting cells as whole-cell biocatalyst was in-
vestigated by performing the reaction in defined mineral
media with VAMT strain (TMB4367, Figure 4a), VAMT +
LK RADH strain (TMB4351, Figure 4b) and 3x VAMT +
LK RADH strain (TMB4373, Figure 4c). The conversion
was for all three strains very similar between resting and
growing cells. Only during 48 h to 72 h for the 3x
VAMT + LK RADH strain (TMB4373), the use of grow-
ing cells led to a 8% higher conversion. A sample taken
after 140 h showed though, that the reaction did not

continue further (data not shown) with the growing
cells.
There was no significant difference in the product for-
mation for resting and growing cells of VAMT strain
(TMB4367, Figure 4a). On the contrary for VAMT + LK
RADH strain (TMB4351), resting cells accumulated
0.54 mM ACP after 72 h (Figure 3b) but only 0.04 mM
with growing cells (Figure 4b). After 72 h, the amount of
(R)-1-PE was about 1 mM with both resting and growing
cells, but for resting cells, nearly 1.5 mM of (R)-1-PE
was produced after 24 h.
3x VAMT + LK RADH strain (TMB4373) showed five
times higher production of ACP with resting (1 mM, see
Figure 3c) than with growing cells (0.2 mM, see Figure 4c).
The highest amount of (R)-1-PE (2.5 mM) was obtained
with resting cells also after 24 h and 2.1 mM (R)-1-PE was
left after 72 h; for growing cells 2.5 mM (R)-1-PE was
formed after 72 h.
Glucose assimilation during the reaction
To assess the metabolic activity of the cells during one-pot
biocatalysis, glucose and by-product formation was moni-
tored during the kinetic resolution of (rac)-1-PEA with rest-
ing and growing cells of the best biocatalyst (3x VAMT +
LK RADH strain, TMB4373). With resting cells, the glu-
cose consumption rate was 1.08 mmol glucose/g dw/h for
the first 24 h and reached then a plateau which led to an ar-
rest in NADPH co-factor regeneration (see Figure 5a).
Growing cells, on the other hand, had nearly a constant
glucose consumption rateof 0.44 mmol glucose/g dw/h
until 72 h (Figure 5b). For both strains, no pyruvate and
nearly no succinate were formed, as both are intermediate
compounds and generally not observed outside the cells
during fermentation of glucose [27]. There was though a
significant difference with the other by-products, about five
times more acetate, seven times more glycerol and ten
times more ethanol were formed with growing cells com-
pared to resting ones, reflecting increased metabolic
activity.
Discussion
In this study, we demonstrate that recombinant yeast
over-expressing heterologous transaminase and reduc-
tase genes can be used as whole-cell biocatalyst for one-
pot conversion of specific amine enantiomers to alcohols
with high selectivity.
The biocatalytic system only contains yeast, buffer, the
racemic substrate phenylethylamine (PEA), glucose as co-
substrate and pyridoxal-5’-phosphate (PLP) as co-factor,
which makes it environmentally friendly, simple and
cheap as compared to chemical reaction systems that
often require work-up of intermediates, expensive cata-
lysts, protective groups or several solvents. The process is
also much simpler than in vitro enzymatic counterpart.
For instance, simultaneous synthesis of (R)-1-PEA and
(R)-1-PE with purified enzymes consisted of the following
steps: Growth ofE. coli cells containing ω-TA and GDH
(glucose dehydrogenase), harvest, disruption, dialysis of
the cell extract (addition of PLP forω-TA) and commer-
cially obtained ADH (alcohol dehydrogenase), addition of
purified enzymes, NADPH, (rac)-1-PEA, pyruvate, glucose
and buffer [9]. Multi-step reactions are especially suitable
with whole-cell systems since all enzymes necessary for
operational synthetic cascade reactions can be co-
expressed in the same host and thus have a minimal
number of upstream steps, which results in simplified

processes. For example, several steps for expression, puri-
fication, or addition of involved enzymes, co-factors,
co-substrates or intermediates can be omitted which sig-
nificantly reduce the cost of the process [28].
Baker’sy e a s tS. cerevisiae is used in many different in-
dustrial settings such as production of ethanol, butanol,
isobutanol, succhinic acid, artemisinin and recombinant
protein production [29]. Additionally, research is carried
out for the production of phenolic compounds like fla-
vonoids and stilbenoids [29]. It is also a well suited bio-
catalyst for the enantioselective conversion of (S)-1-PEA
to (R)-1-PE as there is no competing endogenous trans-
aminase activity [11] and very little ACP reductase
activity. In addition, glucose can fuel both catalytic reac-
tions: it is converted to the central carbon intermediate
pyruvate that acts as the amine acceptor in the trans-
amination reaction and it also regenerates, via the pen-
tose phosphate pathway, the co-factor NADPH needed
for the carbonyl reduction. Thus, there is no need for
external addition of neither of these system functions,
which simplifies and reduces the cost of the process
[30].
Coupling of the transamination to a subsequent reduc-
tion of the product also led to a 25% improvement of
the kinetic resolution of the racemic amine substrate,
which was probably due to the lower level of ACP in-
hibitor. In parallel, incomplete inhibition by ACP might
be due to the use of whole-cells instead of isolated en-
zyme, as the transaminase was not directly exposed to
the bulk concentration of ACP. Previous comparison of
whole-cells and cell extract of Pichia pastoris showed
that the ω-transaminase was indeed inhibited stronger
by ACP and at much lower concentration in cell extract
than in whole-cells [10].
L-Alanine was found not to inhibit the transamination
reaction in the whole-cell system. This is consistent with
previous studies using purified ω-transaminases from
Vibrio fluvialis JS17, Bacillus thuringiensis JS64 and
Klebsiella pneumonia JS2F where addition of the co-
product L-alanine did not inhibit the reaction to a high
extent at low concentrations [22,31]. The inhibitory ef-
fect in our set-up was even lower. This may, again, be
explained by the use of a whole-cell system instead of
enzymes. Also, in S. cerevisiae, L-alanine can be con-
verted by ALT1 gene product to pyruvate, convertingα-
ketoglutarate into L-glutamate, [32], or by AGX1 gene
product to pyruvate, yielding L-glycine from glyoxylate
[33]. The whole-cell system is therefore beneficial for
kinetic resolution where L-alanine is a by-product, as it
can be removed from the reaction, shifting the thermo-
dynamic equilibrium to the product side.
A higher amount of gene copies of the transaminase
VAMT led to significant improvement in biocatalysis, indi-
cating that the transamination reaction was the bottleneck
of the cascade system. The reaction rate of the following
NADPH-dependent reductase fromL. kefir was, at least
during the first 24 h, as fast as the reaction rate of the
t r a n s a m i n a s e ,a sn oA C Pw a sb u i l tu p .A f t e r2 4hh o w e v e r ,
ACP started accumulating, maybe because of the reduced
rate of NADPH co-factor regeneration (see below).
Biocatalytic systems based on whole-cells can have
major differences in the metabolic state of the cell. Rest-
ing and growing cells are both alive and metabolically
active, but the addition of vitamins, trace elements and a
nitrogen source increase the cost of the process. Addition-
ally, nucleic and amino acids, lipids and other com-
pounds are synthesized, the growing cells are less robust
and cellular reactions compete for co-factors [34]. There
was no significant difference between growing and rest-
ing cells for the transamination step in our system,
which indicates that the higher glycolytic flux did not
lead to more available pyruvate. Alternatively, pyruvate
from glucose assimilation was not limiting the reaction
in any of the process set-ups. Therefore, a buffer system
would be preferred as it is simpler and cheaper than a
system with media as the reaction solution. However, a
significant difference was observed between resting and
growing cells for the reduction step, thereby confirming

previous observations on diketone whole-cell reduction
[14]. With growing cells, the amount of ACP was 14
times lower for VAMT + LK RADH strain (TMB4351)
and five times lower for 3x VAMT + LK RADH strain
(TMB4373) than with resting cells. Low accumulation of
ACP shows that the transamination and reduction rates
are similar with growing cells, even after 24 h of reac-
tion. This was more pronounced when only one copy of
VAMT was present, as ACP was generated less rapidly
by the cells. Additionally, after 72 h the amount of (R)-
1-PE was 20% higher with growing than with resting
cells with 3x VAMT + LK RADH strain (TMB4373). A
higher amount of ACP can have two reasons: (1) The
transamination is more efficient, and/or (2) the reduc-
tion is less efficient. Growing cells displayed higher glu-
cose consumption rate and product formation from
fermentation of glucose [34,35]; however, the intracellu-
lar concentration of pyruvate was not measured and its
influence on the difference in reaction performance is
therefore not known. A comparison between using glu-
cose or adding pyruvate directly as co-substrate for
whole-cell transamination with resting cells has been
performed previously [11]. The use of glucose as co-
substrate had a higher initial specific reaction rate, but
led to about the same final conversion as when pyruvate
w a sa d d e da sc o - s u b s t r a t e .T h i si n d i c a t e st h a tp y r u v a t e
is not limiting the reaction for resting cells. The higher
glycolytic flux for growing cells could lead to faster re-
generation of the co-factor NADPH [34] and therefore
more efficient reduction of ACP. These observations lead
to the conclusion that for resting cells, the amount of
NADPH was too low after 24 h. When glucose consump-
tion after 24 h decreased, less NADPH may have been re-
generated and NADP
+ may have accumulated, leading to a
shift of the reduction towards the ketone side, which would
explain the depletion of (R)-1-PE with resting cells after
24 h. The accumulation of ACP is due to further kinetic
resolution ofracemic 1-PEA after 24 h. For a transaminase-
oxidoreductase coupled system, growing cells are therefore
more suitable, unless more efficient NADPH regeneration
systems can be introduced. For this strategyPGI1 gene is
deleted and ZWF1 gene overexpressed, which forces the
glycolytic flux through the pentose phosphate pathway and
leads to efficient regeneration of NADPH for whole-cell re-
duction [15].
Conclusions
We could demonstrate simultaneous kinetic resolution
of racemic-1-PEA to (R)-1-PEA and reduction of the ke-
tone intermediate ACP to (R)-1-PE. Glucose was used as
sole co-substrate for production of the amine acceptor
pyruvate and regeneration of the co-factor NADPH. Our
method shows the possibility of one-pot two-step reac-
tions with whole-cell systems. Even if the method cannot
yet compete in an industrial setting, it shows the poten-
tial of microbial cell factories for the production of use-
ful chiral building blocks.
Methods
Chemicals
All chemicals were bought from VWR (Leuven, Belgium)
except acetophenone (ACP), racemic 1-phenylethylamine
(1-PEA), (R)-1-PEA, (S)-1-PEA and sodium pyruvate from
Merck (Hohenbrunn, Germany), (R)-1-phenylethanol (PE)
and (S)-1-PE from Sigma-Aldrich (Steinheim, Germany)
and pyridoxal-5 ’-phosphate (PLP) from AppliChem
(Darmstadt, Germany).
Strains, media, and cell growth
S. cerevisiae strain TMB4150 (MATa, ura3-52 MAL2-8C
SUC2) was kindly provided by Jan Knudsen, Applied
Microbiology, Lund University, Sweden. E. coli strain
DH5α (Life Technologies, Rockville, MD, USA) was used
for subcloning.S. cerevisiaestrain TMB4350 [11] was used
for the inhibition experiments. TMB4351, TMB4367 and
TMB4373 (see construction below and Table 1) were used
for whole-cell transamination and measurement of reduc-
tase activity. Strains were kept as 20% glycerol stocks at
−8 0 ° Ca n dg r o w no ns o l i dm e d i af o r1– 2 days prior to ex-
periments. Transformation and cell growth was performed
as described previously [11] except that mineral medium
[36] was used instead of YPG medium.
Nucleic acid manipulation
Plasmid DNA was prepared with the GeneJET Plasmid
Miniprep Kit (Thermo Scientific, Rockford, IL, USA) and
agarose gel DNA extraction was performed using QIA-
quick® Gel Extraction Kit (Qiagen GmbH, Hilden,
Germany). Primers from MWG-Biotech AG (Ebersberg,
Germany) andPhusion Hot Start II DNA Polymerase and
dNTPs from Thermo Scientific (Rockford, IL, USA) were
used for polymerase chain reactions (PCR) and performed
in a GeneAmp PCR system 9700 (Applied Biosystems,
Foster City, CA, USA). PCR products were purified with
the GeneJET PCR Purification Kit (Thermo Scientific,
Rockford, IL, USA). Sequencing was performed by MWG-
Biotech AG (Ebersberg, Germany). InFusion® HD Cloning
Kit (Clontech Laboratories, Mountain View, CA, USA)
was used for DNA manipulation.
Strain construction
Plasmids pUC57 VAMT containing theω-transaminase
gene from Capsicum chinense [GenBank: AAC78480.1,
Swiss-Prot: O82521] and pUC57 LK RADH containing
the NADPH-dependent reductase fromLactobacillus ke-
fir [GenBank: AAP94029.1, Swiss-Prot: Q6WVP7]
(Table 1) were PCR amplified with the primers listed in
Table 2. YIpOB7 was digested with the restriction

enzyme XbaI (VAMT) orBglII (LK RADH) and the PCR
fragments inserted by InFusion® cloning, thus creating
pNW4 and pNW10. Correct orientation of the inserts
and sequences were verified by restriction analysis and
sequencing. Integrative vectors pNW4 and pNW10 were
cleaved with ApaI within the URA3 marker gene and
then used to transform the haploid laboratory strain
TMB4150 (MATa, ura3-52 MAL2-8
C SUC2) which re-
sulted in strains TMB4351 and TMB4367.
TMB4373 was constructed by transformation of
TMB4365 with pNW4.
Determination of relative gene copy number
Strains were grown in 5 ml YPG medium overnight, total
DNA was extracted with Yeast DNA Extraction Kit
(Thermo Scientific, Rockford, IL, USA) and the concentra-
tion measured with BioDropμLite (BioDrop, Cambridge,
U K ) .T h eg e n ec o p yn u m b e ro ft h es t r a i n sw a sd e t e r m i n e d
by qPCR with a LightCycler® Nano Instrument (Roche Ap-
plied Science, IN, USA) with the following program: 95°C,
60 sec; 45x (95°C, 10 sec; 55°C, 20 sec; 72°C, 30 sec); 40°C,
60 sec. The mastermix contained 1 U Ex Taq HS polymer-
ase (TaKaRa Bio Inc, Otsu, Shiga, Japan), 1x Ex Taq buffer,
0 . 2m Md N T P s ,0 . 5μM primers (see Table 2) and 1x Eva-
Green (Biotium, Hayward, CA, USA). A duplicate standard
curve was performed with TMB4367 (VAMT) as reference
and 0.05, 0.1, 1.0, 10.0 and 20.0 ng total DNA. Duplicates
of 0.1 and 10 ng total DNA of the other strains were com-
p a r e dt ot h es t a n d a r dc u r v ea n dt h er e s u l t i n gv a l u ew a s
coupled to the relative amount of gene copies. The forma-
tion of the correct fragment was verified by a melting curve
analysis (50°C to 97°C at 0.05°C/sec) and an agarose gel.
Whole-cell transamination
50 ml sealed serum flasks with magnetic stirring (140 rpm)
and 5 g/l cell dry weight (dw) at 30°C were used for whole-
cell transamination. For resting cells, the reaction solution
contained 10 ml 100 mM sodium phosphate buffer
(pH 7.0), 50– 100 g/l glucose, 12– 25 mM (rac)-1-PEA and
0.1 mM PLP. Vitamins, trace elements, (NH
4)2SO4,M g S O4
and ergosterol were also added as in the growth media [36]
for growing cells. For the inhibition experiment,
0– 10 mM L-alanine or ACP were added from the start.
Enzyme activity
For the determination of specific enzyme activity, cells
were grown until stationary phase, washed once with
25 ml water, and resuspended in sodium phosphate buffer
(100 mM, pH 7.0). Cell extract was made with glass beads
(0.5 mm) and precellys 24 bead beater with a cryolys cool-
ing unit (Bertin technologies, Aix-en-Provence Cedex,
France). Total protein amount was determined by Brad-
ford with bovine serum albumin (Fermentas UAB, Vilnius,
Lithuania) as standard [37]. Reductase activity was assayed
by following the oxidation of NAD (P) H at 340 nm using
Ultrospec 2100pro spectrophotometer (Amersham Biosci-
ences, Sweden). Data were collected using the software
SWIFTII (Amersham Biosciences, Sweden). Samples were
diluted so that the absorbance decreased linearly during
5 min. One unit of activity corresponds to 1μmol NAD
(P) H consumed per minute at 30°C. The assay contained
sodium phosphate buffer (100 mM, pH 7.0), NAD (P) H
(200 μM), ACP (10 mM) and cell extract.
Analyses
Growth was monitored by measuring optical density at a
wavelength of 620 nm (OD620) with an Ultrospec 2100pro
spectrophotometer (Amersham Biosciences, Sweden). Cell
dry weight determination was performed as described pre-
viously, as was determination of (R)-1-phenylethylamine,
(S)-1-phenylethylamine, (R)-1-phenylethanol, (S)-1-phenyl-
ethanol, acetophenone, glucose, pyruvate, glycerol, acetate,
succinate and ethanol [11].
