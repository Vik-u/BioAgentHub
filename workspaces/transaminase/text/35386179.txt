Purpose: The COVID-19 pandemic was noted for the high degree of contagion and the large number of cases, as well as for the
various clinical forms, from asymptomatic towards rapid evolution to death. The hospitals limited care capacity imposed the need to
identify some markers of unfavorable evolution. The purpose of our study is to identify the parameters correlated with COVID-19
unfavorableevolutionandtodrawtheprofileofthepatientatriskofunfavorableevolution.Thissetofparameterswillhelpthedoctor
in deciding whether to hospitalize a patient and in choosing the treatment.
PatientsandMethods: Weperformedaprospective,observational,activelycontrolledstudyon849patientswithCOVID-19,hospitalized
in the Second Clinic of “Sf. Cuv. Parascheva” Infectious Diseases Clinical Hospital Galati, Romania, between 1.03.2020–30.11.2020.
Results:The parameters statistically significant modified at the admission of the patients with COVID-19 unfavorable evolution were
age, oxygen saturation, D-dimers, creatine kinase (CK), troponin, erythrocytes sedimentation rate (ESR), leukocytes, lymphocytes,
neutrophils, platelets, hemoglobin (Hb), aspartate transaminase (AST), total and direct bilirubin(TBIL, DBIL), urea,creatinine, serum
glucose. Strong correlations were observed between the unfavorable evolution and the admission values of D-dimers, AST, TBIL and
between D-dimers and AST, which suggests that D-dimers levels can be considered predictive for the alteration of liver function and
for the negative prognosis of the patient.
Conclusion: Coagulation disorders and acute respiratory failure are the prevailing causes of death from COVID-19. Together with
other parameters that constitute the risk profile for severe COVID-19 evolution, the D-dimers dosing at admission proved to be
extremely useful in the management of COVID-19.
Keywords:COVID-19, D-dimer, aspartate transaminase, total bilirubin, unfavorable evolution marker
Introduction
On 28.11.2021, at the time of writing this article, 261,373,214 COVID-19 cases were registered in the world of which
5,212,953 deaths during the pandemic’s 5 waves with various strains of SARS-CoV-2, the last and deadliest of them
being the Omicron strain because of its high contagiousness and multiple mutations on the spike protein.1
SARS-CoV-2 infection affects the whole body even if predominant are respiratory symptoms. Coagulation abnorm-
alities such as hypercoagulation, thrombocytopenia, venous thrombosis (TV) and disseminated intravascular coagulation
(DIC) have been observed in approximately 60–70% of hospitalized patients. The autopsies showed that in almost 58%
of patients the cause of death was a pulmonary embolism or venous thrombosis, while DIC was reported in 70% of the

patientswho died fromCOVID-19.2–4 Inthe currentpractice the D-dimersvalue provesto be usefulin the diagnosisand
prediction of deep vein thrombosis recurrence; it is also an early marker for disseminated intravascular coagulation. In
COVID-19, the average value of D-dimers is 0.9 mg/L, with increased values in 36% of the patients.5,6
The D-dimers level positively correlates with the severity of the disease, and is inversely proportional to the survival.
Some case series note D-dimers values> 3 mg/L in 85% of the patients who died post COVID-194, others D-dimers
values> 1 mg/L in 81% of the patients who died post COVID-19, and only 24% of D-dimers survivors> 1 mg/L.7,8
The average level of D-dimers is 2.4 mg/L in critical cases, as compared to 0.5 mg/L in mild cases.9,10
Inaddition,inCOVID-19non-survivors,asteadyprogressiveincreaseinD-dimersisnoted,comparedwithsurvivors
inwhom the D-dimers valueremains stable orimproves. Therefore, D-dimers canbe considered an importantprognostic
factor in COVID-19 and correlates with unfavorable evolution and higher mortality.4,9
Liver injury is also important in COVID-19 and is considered to be a prognostic factor for patient progression. The
factors involved in causing liver damage are: the SARS-CoV-2 direct attack, drug toxicity of the COVID-19 therapy,
acute inflammatory changes and hypoxia.10
Abnormal levels of aspartate transaminase (AST)/alanine transaminase (ALT) can be attributed to muscular, hepa-
tocyte and myocardial lesions. AST/ALT values in COVID19 are slightly elevated (between 1–2 normal values) in
approximately 60% of patients; moderate (2 to 5 times higher than normal) in about 30% of patients; and increased by
more than 5 times the normal value in approximately 10% of patients.11,12 Strikingly increased transaminases have also
been reported, such as ALT = 7590 U/L and AST = 1445 U/L, in a patient with a severe form of COVID-19.13

Another study of critically ill patients with COVID-19 showed dermatological manifestations of hypercoagulability
such as significant ischemia of the limbs with plantar plaques and acral cyanosis.18–21
Coagulation disorders along with inflammatory mechanisms have also been implicated in the onset of neurological
manifestations in COVID-19, such as cerebral hemorrhage or ischemia, cerebral venous thrombosis, demyelinating and
neurodegenerative lesions, taste, smell and visual dysfunctioning and consciousness disorders.22
Materials and Methods
A prospective, observational, actively controlled study was performed on 849 COVID-19 patients (67 children and 782
adults), admitted to “Sf. Parascheva” Infectious Diseases Clinic Hospital in Galati, between 1.03.2020–30.11.2020. The
studywasconductedaccordingtotheguidelinesoftheDeclarationofHelsinki,andapprovedbytheEthicsCommitteeof
“Sf. Cuv.Parascheva” Infectious Diseases Clinical Hospital Galati, with number 22 and date of approval 02/26/2021.
Written informed consent has been obtained from all the patients involved in the study, to publish this paper.
The inclusion criteria were: adults or children with moderate or severe forms of COVID-19, confirmed by reverse
transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) of the nasopharyngeal swab, patients who had written informed
consent for participation in the study, staff in full knowledge, themselves or their parents or legal guardian in the case
of children.
Criteria for exclusion from the study were: inability of the patient to sign informed consent, refusal to participate in
the study, pregnancy and lactation, and outliers (patients with extreme results in routine laboratory tests: leukocytes,
hemoglobin, bilirubin, AST, ALT, serum creatinine).
Patients were monitored during hospitalization and one month after discharge were evaluated by telephone or in
the day ward of the hospital.
Study sublots: the 849 patients were divided into 2 groups: group A (N = 807) of the favorable evolution patients
consisted of discharged patients in good general condition, while group B (N = 42) of the unfavorable evolution patients
included the patients who died or were transferred to intensive care.
It is worth mentioning that not all patients had complete data available.
The endpoint of the study was the total number of deaths and patients transferred to intensive care.

Patient dataextractedfromthe observationsheets were analyzedusingIBM StatisticsV.24 * SPSS, INC.,Chicago,Il,
USA, and Excel 2019. Gross descriptive statistical parameters were calculated for all variables, at which this analysis
wasuseful.Forcontinuousnumericalvariableswerecalculated:minimumandmaximumvalue,meanvalueandstandard
deviation (SD), then simple bivariate correlations were performed, with the calculation of the Pearson correlation
coefficient (r - linear correlation coefficient) and the determining factor (R2). For the categorical values were calculated:
frequency, median and modeand then they were entered in the contingency tables and the non-parametric chi-square test
was applied (χ2). Comparisons were made between the group of patients with COVID-19 and favorable outcome (group
A) compared to the group with COVID-19 with unfavorable outcome (group B). For each of the statistical tests used,
a level of statistical significance was considered for values below 0.05 (with p-index calculated at both ends).
Results
The characteristics of the main scalar variables were analyzed, as they were detected at the group level. Thus, it can be
observed that:
-Theaverageageofpatientsis50.21years,towhichastandarddeviation(SD)of±20.05yearsisassociated,andthe
median value is 51 years. The Gaussian curve is deviated to the right, with a maximum incidental peak around 40 years
(Figure 1). The average age of the group of unfavorable evolution patients (73.22 years) is statistically significantly
higher (p<0.0001) than that of the group of favorable evolution patients (49.01 years) (Table 1).
- Predominantly female sex- 460 women (54.18%), in the total group. In the group of favorable evolution
patients, women predominate (55.14%) and in the group of unfavorable evolution patients, men predominate
(64.28%) (a statistically significant difference: p = 0.0212) (Table 2).
- Predominantly environment - urban origin - 72.90% patients in the total group, 72.61% of the patients in the group
of favorable evolution patients, and 76.19% in the group of unfavorable evolution patients (Table 2).

statistically, significantly higher in the favorable evolution group who performed the entire treatment until the significant
improvement of health, in our clinic, compared to those with unfavorable evolution who either decompensated suddenly
and died in our clinic, or needed further intensive care hospitalization (p<0.0001) (Table 1).
A series of biochemical parameters, at hospitalization, indicating the degree of liver damage, were analyzed, from
a descriptive point of view, by tracking the values of liver markers (AST, ALT, total and direct bilirubin (DBIL),
simultaneously with the D-dimers values and other biochemical parameters (Table 1):
- An average value of D-dimers was 841.22 ng/mL, with an SD of 1160.85 ng/mL, a median value of 473.73 ng/mL,
a minimum value of 52 ng/mL and a maximum value over 10,000 ng/mL in the total group. The average value of
D-dimers in the unfavorable evolution group (2057 ng/mL) was, statistically, significantly higher than the average
D-dimers in the favorable evolution group (784 ng/mL; p<0.0001). The COVID-19 favorable evolution patients had
D-dimers values between 1500–5000 ng/mL in a proportion of 7.9% and values between 5000–10,000 ng/mL in
a proportion of 1.4% as opposed to unfavorable evolution patients whose D-dimers values were between 1500–5000
ng/mL in a proportion of 28.6%, and between 5000–10,000 ng/mL in a proportion of 7.1%.
- The AST has an average value of 34.91 U/L, associating an SD of 29.64 U/L, while the ALTis characterized by an
average value of 40.67 U/L and an SD of 44.08 U/L, in the total group. The average values of AST and ALT in the
favorable evolution group fall within the normal values range of the analysis, and those in the unfavorable evolution
group exceed the maximum limit of normal values. It is also worth mentioning that the average of AST in the

unfavorable evolution group is, statistically, significantly higher than in the favorable evolution group, probably justified
due to cell lysis, more important products of SARS-CoV-2, simultaneously in liver, striated muscles and myocardium, in
patientswithsevereformsofCOVID-19.TheunfavorableevolutionpatientshadmodifiedASTvaluesinapercentageof
64.3%, compared to 27.1% in those with favorable evolution.
- The values of total bilirubin are defined by an average value of 0.55 mg/dl (with SD of 0.46 mg/dl), and the direct
bilirubin with an average value of 0.23 mg/dl (with SD of 0.67 mg/dl), in the total group.
The mean values of the total bilirubin in both groups of patients fall within the normal values range of the
analysis, however, being, statistically, significantly higher with the unfavorable evolution group. The mean values of
direct bilirubin are in the normal values range of the analysis in the favorable evolution group and exceed the
maximum limit of normal values in the unfavorable evolution group. The mean values of direct bilirubin are,
statistically, significantly higher in the unfavorable evolution group compared to the favorable evolution group.
The unfavorable evolution patients had 14.3% modified values of TBIL as compared to 4% in those with favorable
evolution.
Therefore, the causal relationship existing between the ASTand ALT values was followed, respectively the D-dimers
values obtained from the blood analyses of the patients. Obviously and punctually, it can be seen that there are a number
of relationships of positive interdependence, directly proportional, but with different degrees of statistical power.
Therefore, the correlations between the D-dimers determined values were analyzed and the existence of positive
correlation with AST, statistically strong, were noticed. Consequently, a tendency of variation of the AST and ALT
values related to those of the D-dimers (D-dimer values [y], the values of the hepatic indices on the [x] axis) is obvious.
We will discuss them in detail below (Figure 3).

- The same type of strong correlation from a statistical point of view was detected between the values of AST and
ALT (r= +0.718; p=0.001);
-A significant correlation we observed between TBIL and DBIL (r= +0.119; p=0.002) and between DBIL and ALT
(r= +0.09; p=0.021).
The same type of extremely strong correlation from a statistical point of view was detected between the patients’
evolutions during hospitalization, respectively the mean values of D-dimers decrease from 1269±105 to 966±83
(p=0.001) and mean values of ALT increase from 52.53±3.74 to 75.81±5.50 (p=0.003) (Figures 4and 5).
In patients with unfavorable evolution we noticed the following differences (Table 1):
-the mean values of D-dimers were significantly higher (2057 vs 784 µg/mL; p=0.001) (Figure 4);
- the mean values of AST were significantly higher (53.23 vs 33.98 UI/L; p=0.001) (Figure 6);
- the mean values of TBIL were significantly higher (0.85 vs 0.53 UI/L; p=0.001) (Figure 7).
The comparative analysis of the two groups of patients also included:
-the value of creatine kinase (CK) - its average in the unfavorable evolution group (287U/L) was statistically
significantly higher than the average in the favorable evolution group (142 U/L), p = 0.0071 (Table 1).

Discussion
COVID-19 is a potentially severe systemic infection. The pulmonary and hepatic tropism of SARS-CoV-2 and the
prothrombotic physiopathological mechanisms justify to carefully monitoring the respiratory, hepatic, coagulation and
renal functions and the glycemic balance, as well as the early therapeutic interventions to prevent the complications.
Clinical studies support the monitoring of D-dimers in COVID-19 patients and describe its correlation with the
unfavorable evolution of the cases with increased D-dimers values.
A study of 2377 adult patients hospitalized with COVID-19 was performed on patients with D-dimers > 2000 ng/mL
and observed a risk of critical illness of 66%, thrombotic event of 37.8%, acute kidney damage of 58.3% and of death of
47% (the critical illness being considered hospitalization in intensive care, mechanical ventilation, or death).23–25
A meta-analysis of 29 clinical trials involving 4328 hospitalized patients with COVID-19 found a higher average of
D-dimers levels, at admission), in severe patients than in non-severe patients, as well as in patients who required
intensivecareand thosewhodied.Theconclusionofthe studywas thatelevatedlevelsofD-dimersatathebeginningof
hospitalization, in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection were associated with an increased risk of severe disease
progression and mortality.26–28
Anothermeta-analysisof16clinicaltrials showedhigherlevels ofD-dimers inpatientswith severediseaseand death
from COVID-19 and noted the usefulness of anticoagulant therapy with lower mortality in patients treated with
anticoagulants than those without anticoagulant therapy.27,29
Xu et al observed in postmortem liver biopsies microvesicular steatosis and mild lobular and portal inflammatory
activity.30 Other biopsy studies described thrombosis, fibrous thickening of the vascular wall and luminal ectasia,
suggesting that endothelial lesion and coagulation dysfunction are involved in the pathogenesis of liver failure in
COVID-19.10 Cai et al observed SARS-CoV-2 viral particles in hepatocyte’s cytoplasm, and described the following
hepatocyte changes: mitochondrial swelling cell membrane damage and endoplasmic reticulum dilation.31

Increased ASTand ALT levels in adults are correlated in clinical trials with an unfavorable prognosis of the patient
comparedtochildren,whereALT,ASTlevelsareusuallybelowtwicethenormalvalue.Severeliverdamageisveryrare
in children.11,32–34
In most cases COVID-19, TBIL is normal or slightly increased.11,35–37
Clinical studies demonstrated the correlation between the severity of COVID-19, its negative prognosis and the
degree of liver damage.13
Our study statistically demonstrates that high blood values of D-dimers can predict the liver damage and that the
values of AST and total bilirubin are accurate parameters correlated with an unfavorable evolution.
Other parameters with statistically significant higher values in the unfavorable evolution group compared to those
with favorable evolution were: oxygen saturation, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, hemoleukogram changes, hyperglyce-
mia, elevated values of serum CK, troponin, urea and creatinine.
Our study also notes the unfavorable evolution of patients with the mean age over 70 years, predominantly men, with
multiple comorbidities (Charlson score between 4 and 6) and with severe pneumonia (CURB-65 score equal to 2). Elderly
patients with multiple comorbidities have an increased risk of infection in general and COVID-19 in particular.38,39
Demonstration of severe prognosis in this patient profile, elderly with multiple comorbidities requires the establishment of
asetofpersonalizedprophylacticmeasures,suchaspriorityvaccination,hygienemeasuresandincreasedisolation,easyand
quick access to specific antiviral therapy, mandatory measures to improve the prognosis of these patients.40
Conclusion
Given the endothelial aggression and prothrombotic mechanisms triggered by SARS-CoV-2, and the statistical results
obtained in our study, we can say that the increased value of the D-dimers may be predictive for abnormal liver
functional parameters and for a severe evolution.
TheprofileofthepatientatriskwithCOVID-19severeevolutionresultingfromourstudyis:patientover70yearsof
age, male, with multiple comorbidities (Charlson score between 4 and 6), with severe pneumonia (CURB-65 score equal
to 2) with high values of D-dimers, AST, ESR, CK, troponin, total and direct bilirubin, urea, creatinine, glycemia, total
leukocytes, neutrophils and low values of oxygen saturation, hemoglobin, platelets and lymphocytes at admission.
Defining this profile of a patient at risk with COVID-19 severe evolution argues the need for repeated monitoring of
these parameters and their use in the patient’s hospitalization decision and the choice of therapy. These parameters along
with clinical and imaging parameters help in assessing the severity of the case, in choosing antiviral therapy or the
immunomodulatory therapy, in choosing doses of anticoagulant medication, in modulating hepatoprotective therapy and
in the management of the glycemic and renal balance.
