Abstract 
ω-Transaminases’ (ω-TAs) importance for synthesizing chiral amines led to the development of different methods to 
quickly identify and characterize new sources of these enzymes. Here we describe the optimization of growth and 
induction of such an enzyme in a wild type strain of Bacillus sp. strain BaH (IBRC-M 11337) isolated from Iranian soil 
in shaking flasks by the response surface methodology (RSM). Optimum conditions were set in a multiplexed bench-
top bioreactor system (Sixfors). ω-TA activity of obtained biomass was checked by an innovative efficient colorimetric 
assay for localizing ω-TAs in crude extracts on acrylamide gel by using ortho-xylylenediamine (OXD) as amino donor. 
The application of the established OXD assay is thereby expanded from high-throughput activity screenings and 
colony-based screenings of heterologously expressed mutants to a direct identification of ω-TAs in wild-type strains: 
This assay can be used to detect the protein band of the respective enzyme in crude extracts of novel isolates by 
visual inspection of native PAGEs without any upstream protein purification, thus enabling subsequent further investi-
gations of a newly discovered enzyme directly from the crude extract.

Introduction
Discovery and characterization of new ω-transaminases 
(ω-TAs) to synthesize pure chiral amines has drawn 
attention (Gomm et  al. 2016) as an alternative green 
approach instead of chemical synthesis via transition-
metal catalysis (Weiß et  al. 2017). Enantiopure amines 
play an important role as building blocks in the produc -
tion of pharmaceuticals and fine chemicals (Höhne and 
Bornscheuer 2009). ω-TAs are members of the pyridoxal 
5ʹ-phosphate (PLP)-depending enzyme family that trans -
fers amine groups from amine donors to aldehydes or 
ketones as amine acceptor. An ω-TA catalyzed synthesis 
of chiral amines can be performed via kinetic resolution 
of racemic amines or by asymmetric synthesis where the 
amine group of an amine donor is transferred to ketones 
or aldehydes with usually high enantioselectivity (Weiß 
et al. 2017).
As the expression of ω-TAs is growth-associated and 
essential in nitrogen metabolism, nitrogen plays an 
important role in the induction of these enzymes (Shin 
and Kim 2001). (rac )-α-methylbenzylamine (MBA) and 
o-xylylenediamine (OXD) are promising amine donors 
to survey ω-TA activity (Buß et al. 2018c; Shin and Kim 
2001). The former is a model amine donor (Shin and

Kim 1997) which is converted to acetophenone (AcPhe) 
after transformation of amine group to ketone during 
ω-TA activity, then, AcPhe concentration can be quan -
tified (Guo and Berglund 2017) (Fig.  1a). The latter was 
originally reported by Green et al. (2014): OXD reaction 
is irreversible since after amine transfer the molecule 
spontaneously cyclizes and tautomerizes to the stable 
isoindole product which leads to the generation of an 
insoluble black polymer by oxidative processes (Fig.  1b). 
OXD is a substrate for most (R)- and (S)-selective ω-TAs 
that have been assayed so far and can be used as amine 
donor in combination with a plethora of amine acceptors 
as demonstrated by Kelly (Kelly et  al. 2017). The OXD 
colorimetric assay can be applied to high-throughput 
screening of ω-TAs in liquid phase (Buß et al. 2018c ) or 
recombinant colonies expressing transaminase in solid 
phase (Green and Turner 2016).
Our recently published research on screening wild-
type bacterial strains exhibiting ω-TA activities led to 
the identification of promising Bacillus  strains from 
Iranian soil by using (rac )-α-MBA as sole nitrogen 
source in the medium. Among them, Bacillus  sp. strain 
BaH (IBRC-M 11337) exhibited ω-TA activity towards 
several amine donors and acceptors with broad pH tol -
erance from 5 to 9 (Gord Noshahri et al. 2019).
The highest potential of ω-TA activity of Bacillus  
sp. strain BaH (BaH-ω-TA) against bulky substrates 
encouraged us to increase its production in the wild-
type strain by growth optimization and enzyme induc -
tion using the response surface methodology (RSM).
Although many ω-TAs from a plethora of microor -
ganisms have been described to be produced recom -
binantly, there are a few reports to cultivate the related 
wild-type strains in bioreactors which can be impor -
tant for enzymes hard to express heterologously, e.g. 
from extremophile microorganisms. Buß et al. (2018a) 
studied β-phenylalanine degradation during fermenta -
tion of Paraburkholderia. Cultivation of Arthrobacter  
sp. KNK168 in a 5  L fermenter was reported by Iwa -
saki et  al. (2006); both publications, however, do not 
describe any attempts for growth optimization.
Designing a fermentation system in a bioreactor 
depends on knowledge of several reaction param -
eters on cultivation such as pH, temperature, dis -
solved oxygen (DO) concentration and agitation speed 
(Hsu and Wu 2002). In case of enzyme production,

confirmation of enzyme activity is a necessary step dur -
ing fermentation.
In this study, the optimization of cell growth of Bacil -
lus sp. strain BaH along analyzing ω-TA activity in shak -
ing flasks and subsequently in a multiplexed bench-top 
fermenter system was investigated. Enzyme activity was 
confirmed by a colorimetric assay on acrylamide gel and 
kinetic parameters were determined.
Materials and methods
Chemicals
Otherwise indicated, all chemicals and solvents were 
purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, US) and 
Carl Roth GmbH (Karlsruhe, Germany).
Bacterial strains and culture media
ω-TA mutant with PDB code 3FCR of Ruegeria sp. 
TM1040 was kindly provided by Uwe Bornscheuer 
(Greifswald/Germany) (Buß et  al. 2018c ). Bacillus sp. 
strain BaH (IBRC-M 11337) was isolated from Iranian 
soil as described by Gord Noshahri et  al. (2019) and is 
preserved by IBRC (Iranian Biological Resource Center). 
Expression of the ω-TA mutant 3FCR of Ruegeria sp. 
TM1040 in E. coli BL21 was conducted according to 
Buß et  al. (2018b). Bacillus sp. strain BaH was grown 
in minimal medium (MIM) containing 18 mM (rac )-α-
methylbenzylamine (MBA) and 100 mM glycerol as sole 
nitrogen and carbon sources and salts including 1  g/L 
 MgSO4·7H2O, 4  mg/L  FeSO4·7H2O, 0.02  mg/L  H3BO3, 
0.1  mg/L  ZnCl2, 0.2 mM  CaCl2, 0.05  CoCl2, 0.1  mg/L 
 MnSO4·4H2O, 0.05 mg/L  CoCl2, 0.1 mg/L  CuSO4·5H2O, 
2.0 mg/L  NaMoO4, 0.1 mg/L  NiSO4 ·  6H2O in potassium 
phosphate buffer (50 mM) (Yun et  al. 2004).  FeSO4 and 
(rac)-MBA were separately filtrated for sterilization and 
added to the medium after autoclaving.
Effect of α‑MBA on ω‑TA induction
A single colony of Bacillus sp. strain BaH was cultured 
separately in 25 ml LB and MIM media in shaking flask 
(100 mL) by incubation at 35 °C with 120 rpm until the 
absorbance at 600 nm  (OD600) reached approximately 
2.0. The cells were harvested by centrifugation (6000×g, 
10  min). Then the cell  OD600 was adjusted to ~ 20 by 
resuspension in HEPES buffer (50mM, pH 7.5). ω-TA 
activity was surveyed by using 50 µL cell suspension in a 
150 µL reaction mixture composed of 10 % dimethyl sul-
foxide (DMSO), 1 mM PLP in HEPES buffer (50mM, pH 
7.5). 7.5mM o-xylylenediamine (OXD), and 5 mM pyru -
vate were added to reaction as an amine donor and amine 
acceptor, respectively (Buß et  al. 2018c ). The reactions 
were carried out in 96-well plate and incubated for five 
hours at 35 °C with 150 rpm. 3FCR cells grown in auto-
inducing medium (Formedium, UK) as described by Buß 
et al. (2018b) were used as a positive control. Each reac -
tion was done in duplicate. HEPES buffer without cells 
was used as negative control.
Optimization with response surface methodology (RSM)
To determine the effect of three variables including tem -
perature, pH, and agitation speed on biomass production 
by Bacillus sp. strain BaH was survey by RSM. It is a sta -
tistical method which investigates combined effects of 
independent variables (Sunitha et al. 1999) and has been 
applied in various studies (Ahmad and Panda 2014; Singh 
et al. 2011; Sunitha et al. 1999). Experimental designing 
was formulated according to central composite design 
(CCD) by using Design Expert 7.0.0 software (Stat-Ease 
Inc., USA). The three factors: temperature, pH, and agi -
tation speed were surveyed in three levels (+), (0)  and 
(−)  with three repetitions (Table  1). In total, 15 runs 
were generated with central point: temperature 33  °C, 
pH 7.7, 160 rpm agitation. Table 1 shows coded levels for 
independent variables. Biomass production  (OD600nm) 
and AcPhe formation (deaminated form of MBA) were 
considered as responses. Point prediction of the Design 
Expert was applied to obtain optimum value of the fac -
tors for production maximum level of biomass. Then, 
predicted condition was run with triplicate experiments 
to survey model accuracy.
Growth optimization in shaking flasks
All designed experiments were applied in 500 mL baf -
fled shaking flasks containing 100 mL medium with three 
repetitions (Table  2). Each Erlenmeyer flask was inocu -
lated with 1 % (v/v) of three days Bacillus  sp. strain BaH 
culture in MIM with 18 mM (rac )-MBA as described 
previously (Gord Noshahri et  al. 2019). Incubation was 
performed in a rotary shaker (Infors-HT, Switzerland). 
The optimum condition was compared with initial condi-
tion (35 °C, pH 7.0 and 120 rpm).
Samples were taken daily for measuring the optical 
density at 600 nm  (OD600), and pH value. After centrif -
ugation (6000×g, 10  min) the supernatant of each sam -
ple was applied for measuring AcPhe concentration by 
HPLC.

Biomass production optimization in the bioreactor
The best condition of Bacillus  sp. strain BaH growth in 
shaking flask was optimized in Sixfors multiplex bench-
top fermenter system (vessel volume 0.5  L; Infors AG, 
Switzerland). MIM (pH 7.0) was used as a culture 
medium and each fermenter was filled with 300 mL of 
medium. The fermenter was equipped with a pH sensor 
(Hamilton, Reno, NV, USA), optical dissolved oxygen 
sensor (Hamilton, Reno, NV, USA) and Pt-100 tempera -
ture sensor. Since antifoam addition can effect on cell 
growth (Routledge 2012), produced foam was trans -
ferred from exhausted cooler to plastic bag as a foam trap 
(Willenbacher et  al. 2014). Fermentation temperature 
was set at 38 °C and all processes were run without pH 
regulation.
Stirrer speed and aeration were set up in the fermenter 
by one-factor-at-a-time method. In the mentioned 
method, to determine optimal level, only the effect of one 
factor was surveyed and other factors were kept constant. 
Then the optimized factor was considered as a basis. 
Each experiment was carried out in duplicate or tripli -
cate. As depicted in Table 4, firstly, stirrer speed was sur -
veyed in three levels of 200, 600 and 1200 rpm with 1.5 
vvm aeration (Run1). At Run2, to determine proper agi -
tation rate, the range of agitation speed was minimized 
and set around optimum of Run1. At the next step, aera -
tion rate was evaluated in three levels of 0.5, 1 and 1.5 
vvm with the best stirrer speed as Run3.
The inoculum was grown in a 100 mL in shaking flask 
in MIM medium (pH 7.0) and cultivated at 38  °C with 
200  rpm in a rotary shaker (Infors-HT, Switzerland) for 
2 days. The fermenters were run with 5 % (v/v) inoculum 
with initial optical density ~ 0.1. As a negative control, 
MIM medium containing AcPhe (3mM) was run in fer -
menter without any bacteria. Samples were taken four 
times a day. The samples were applied for analysis after 
centrifugation for 10 min at 6000×g with bench-top cen -
trifuged (Eppendorf, Germany). The supernatants were 
used for quantification of AcPhe and glycerol.
At the time of sampling, DO and pH were recorded 
along with measurement of  OD600nm. The cells from the 
sample with the highest amount of AcPhe were taken 
for ω-TA activity assay and measurement of kinetic 
parameters.
Colorimetric ω‑transaminase activity assay by native PAGE
Cell-free extraction of 3FCR was carried out according 
to Buß et  al. (2018b) and applied as a positive control. 
Crude extract of Bacillus  sp. strain BaH was obtained as 
described previously (Gord Noshahri et  al. 2019). The 
concentration of protein was estimated with Roti®-Quant 
universal kit (Carl Roth, Karlsruhe, Germany). Glycerol 
was subsequently added to crude extracts obtained final 
concentration of 20 % (v/v) and extracts were stored at 
− 80 °C.
Polyacrylamide gel 12 % (v/v) was prepared based on 
Laemmli (1970) in the absence of any denaturant like 
SDS. Native sample buffer (62.5 mM Tris-HCl pH 6.8, 
glycerol 40 %, 0.01 % bromophenol blue) was added to 
each sample with ratio of 1:1. In each well 10 µL of sam -
ple (30 µg protein) without heating was loaded onto the 
gel. Samples were loaded in duplicate on both sides of 
gel in order to apply two kinds of staining. Electropho -
resis was carried out in Laemmli running buffer without 
SDS, pH 8.0 at 4 °C with 150 V for 2 h. Afterwards the 
gel was divided into two sections containing samples and 
pre-stained protein marker (Roti ®-Mark TRICOLOR, 
Carl Roth, Karlsruhe, Germany). Each gel section was 
transferred to different petri dishes. One gel section 
was stained for activity, the other section for localiza -
tion of protein bands via Coomassie staining. Activ -
ity staining containing 50 mM HEPES buffer pH 7.5, 1 
mM PLP , 5 mM OXD (amine donor), 7.5 mM pyruvate 
(amine acceptor) and 5 % DMSO was applied in one petri 
dish. The reaction was performed at 35 °C, 500 rpm for 
30 min. Proteins in another section of gel were visualized 
by Coomassie Brilliant Blue R250 (Laemmli 1970).

investigated at varying concentrations of (S)-MBA and 
pyruvate in a Britton-Robinson buffer (pH 6) includ -
ing 15 % (v/v) DMSO, 0.1 mM PLP , and 1 mg/mL crude 
extract in the total reaction volume of 250 µL: One sub -
strate was varied in concentration and the other one was 
kept at a constant concentration. For calculating kinetic 
parameters of BaH-ω-TA for amine acceptor, pyru -
vate was added to reaction in the range of 0 to 70 mM 
with 70 mM (S)-MBA constant. For measuring kinetic 
parameters of BaH-ω-TA for amine donor, (S)-MBA was 
applied in a reaction between 0 and 60 mM with con -
stant amount of 60mM pyruvate. The reactions were per-
formed at 35 °C, 600 rpm for one hour. Subsequently, the 
reaction was stopped by heating at 95 °C for 5 min. The 
supernatant was separated by centrifugation (6000×g, 
10  min) and produced AcPhe was detected by HPLC. 
Each reaction was conducted in triplicate. The apparent 
Km for (S)-MBA and pyruvate was calculated based on 
Michaelis–Menten kinetics using non-linear regression 
method.
Quantification of AcPhe by HPLC
The AcPhe concentration was measured via UV detection 
at 254 nm by mobile phase containing acetonitrile/water 
(50/50, v/v) at flow rate of 0.6 ml  min− 1 (Gao et al. 2017) 
at room temperature using a  C18 Hypersil- keystone col -
umn (250 × 4.6 mm 5 µ Hypersil). The injection volume 
was 1 µL. Agilent 1100 HPLC system (Santa Clara, CA, 
USA) was used for samples analysis.
Quantification of glycerol by HPLC
The concentration of glycerol in the samples was ana -
lyzed with Agilent 1100 HPLC system (Santa Clara, CA, 
USA) with RI-detector system (G1362A RI Detector). 
Separation was carried out using LC column (Rezex TM 
ROA-organic acid H+ (8 %), 300 × 7.8 mm, with pre-
column ROA-organic acid H+ (8 %) (50 × 7.8 mm), both 
Phenomenex, Germany) and a mobile phase consisting of 
5 mM  H2SO4 at a flow rate of 0.50 mL/min at 50 °C. The 
injection volume was set to 5 µL.
Results
Effect of cultivation medium on ω‑TA induction
Inducible expression of ω-TA from Bacillus  sp. strain 
BaH showed that enzyme production also happened 
without using (rac )-MBA in complex medium such as 
LB, although activity of ω-TA increased significantly in 
the presence of (rac )-MBA as a sole nitrogen source in 
the minimal medium (MIM) which was therefore pre -
ferred in the following. A comparison of ω-TA activity 
in whole cells is shown in Fig.  2. The color development 
of ω-TA containing crude extract of Bacillus  sp. strain 
BaH after growth in MIM showed a significantly higher 
intensity than after growth in LB: An intensity level simi -
lar to the recombinantly overexpressed 3FCR was gained.
Optimization of culture condition based on RSM
An experiment of 15 runs with three repetitions contain -
ing 5 central points was designed based on three factors 
(Table 2). The amount of biomass production  (OD600nm) 
along with AcPhe production (deaminated form of MBA) 
was measured daily for 4 days (Table  2). There was a 
positive correlation between growth and AcPhe pro -
duction. Therefore, the amount of biomass was chosen 
as response to analyze the effect of three factors on cell 
growth and ω-TA production with Design Expert 7.0. 
Based on 15 runs, the quadratic model was fitted to the 
response variable, and could be explained by the follow -
ing equation where A, B and C represent temperature, 
agitation speed and pH, respectively:
The analyses of variance of regression for biomass 
production by Bacillus  sp. strain BaH are summarized 
in Table 3. The R 2 value was 0.9891, which indicates the 
accuracy of the model. The P value serves as a tool for 
checking the significance of each of the coefficients: If it 
is > 0.05 (not significant), the model fits well.
In this case A, C, AC, BC, A2 , C2  are significant model 
terms (p < 0.05) in biomass production while B and AB 
were not significant (p > 0.05). Figure 3 presents response 
surface plot of interaction between two variables while 
third one kept constant. According to the plot the inter -
action between pH and temperature (Fig. 3a) and pH and 
agitation speed (Fig.  3b) are significant. The optimum 
condition of variables can be understood easily from the 
plot.
According to the model, a temperature of 38 °C, pH 7.0 
and agitation with 200 rpm were determined as optimum

conditions. Applying optimum values led to a final 
 OD600nm of 5.4 which agreed well with predicted value 
 (OD600nm = 5.5). In addition, Maximum AcPhe concen -
tration in optimum condition was determined 3.4 mM.
Comparing with initial condition with  OD600nm ∼  2.9, 
biomass production was estimated to be around 1.9 times 
enhanced. As a result of growth optimization and using 
MBA as nitrogen source, AcPhe concentration emerged 
2.6 times higher than at the initial condition with 1.3 mM 
AcPhe.
The highest AcPhe production in optimum condition 
was measured after 72  h which was immediately before 
the culture reached the stationary phase.
Batch culture of Bacillus sp. strain BaH in bioreactor
The optimum condition in shaking flask including tem -
perature 38  °C and pH 7.0 were transferred to the Six -
fors bioreactor system, while stirrer speed and aeration 
rate were developed in the bioreactor (Additional file  1: 
Figure S1). Table  4 shows the optimization results. The 
evaluation of both biomass and AcPhe concentration 
indicated 0.5 vvm aeration with 600  rpm stirrer speed 
as best conditions. Stirrer speed showed direct effect on 
biomass production: Both less and more than 600  rpm 
had negative effect on the amount of biomass produced. 
All bioreactors shared almost the same amount of bio -
mass, optical density at 600 nm was around 5 in all reac -
tors, at different aeration rate levels with agitation of 
600  rpm. However, AcPhe concentration dropped with 
increasing oxygen dissolved (DO) in culture.
The fermentation process of Bacillus  sp. strain 
BaH under optimum condition (600  rpm, 0.5 vvm) 
is depicted in Fig.  4. As inoculum medium is similar 
with fermentation medium, no lag phase was recorded. 
Maximal growth was obtained 24  h after inoculation 
with optical density of 5.3. Detection of ω-TA activity 
by monitoring formation of AcPhe gave a maximum 
amount of 3.5 mM which was produced after 20  h. A 
coincidence was observed between dissolved oxygen 
(DO) depletion and AcPhe decline: A drop in DO was 
accompanied by a gradual decrease in AcPhe and glyc -
erol concentration. DO declines with increasing OD, 
growth rate decreases and DO rises again after 20 h.
ω‑TA activity assay on native gel
Crude extracts of the Bacillus  sp. strain BaH from the 
fermenter and a recombinantly expressed ω-TA (3FCR) 
in shaking flask were subjected to native PAGE and 
subsequently stained with OXD assay. Ten minutes 
after starting the staining reaction, a dark brown pre -
cipitation was observed which indicated an ω-TA band.
Significant development of a dark precipitate was 
demonstrated with a crude extract of Bacillus  sp. strain 
BaH (Fig.  5b). As a negative control, a conventional 
staining using Coomassie brilliant blue was performed 
to show that many other protein bands were present in 
the crude extract that were not stained with the OXD 
assay. As a positive control, crude extract of the ω-TA 
with PDB code 3FCR overexpressed in E. coli led to 
a strong reaction and a distinct black band. Again, a 
Coomassie staining demonstrated the exclusive stain -
ing of the overexpressed ω-TA band in the OXD assay

whereas a plethora of other protein bands did not show 
any visible reaction (Fig. 5 a).
Kinetic parameters of BaH‑ω‑TA
Kinetic constants were estimated by non-linear regres -
sion based on Michaelis-Menten kinetics. The apparent 
Km of BaH-ω-TA value for (S)-MBA and pyruvate were 
calculated 2.6 mM and 17.3 mM, respectively (Additional 
file 1: Figure S2).
Discussion
Although ω-TAs received considerable attention recently 
and are used in industrial reactions both as isolated 
enzymes and as whole-cell catalysts, to the best of our 
knowledge there is no report to optimize ω-TAs produc -
tion in wild-type strains as applied for industrial catalysts 
(Almyasheva et  al. 2018). Determining the influence of 
culture condition on biomass and ω-TA production poses 
a major challenge for industrial application of enzymes 
which cannot be easily expressed in established produc -
tion strains, e.g. enzymes from extremophiles.
The aim of this study was to achieve growth optimi -
zation and improved enzyme induction of Bacillus  sp. 
strain BaH in shaking flask and bioreactor in a small scale 
in order to produce ω-TA and identify kinetic parameters 
of this enzyme. In accordance with Shin et  al. (2001), 
ω-TA activity is considerably increased in minimal media 
in comparison to LB medium depending on particular 
nitrogen sources offered in the medium.
Therefore, minimal medium containing MBA as a sole 
nitrogen source was used in this study to induce ω-TA 
production during the growth of Bacillus  sp. strain BaH. 
ω-TA activity during cultivation was monitored by meas-
uring formation of AcPhe (deaminated form of MBA). 
Cell growth is affected by enzyme production depend -
ing on MBA as a sole nitrogen source. Thus, microbial 
growth accelerates with increasing intracellular ω-TA 
activity. Consequently, cells should be in their exponen -
tial growth phase with high cell density to extract and 
purify ω-TA. Shin et al. harvested Vibrio fluvialis cell in 
the late exponential phase to separate ω-TAs of bacteria 
(Shin and Kim 2001).

RSM software was applied for optimization of culture 
condition in shake flask. It was found that the produced 
biomass under optimum condition (38  °C, pH 7.0 and 
200 rpm) was 1.9 times higher than under initial condi -
tion (30  °C, pH 7.0 and 120  rpm). The optimum condi -
tion was scaled up in bench-top bioreactor with changing 
agitation speed to 600  rpm. Notably, scale up cultiva -
tion from shaking flask to bioreactor share similar bio -
mass and AcPhe concentration, reaching approximately 
5.3 and 3.4  mM, respectively, which indicated a good 
determination of parameters involved in growth in the 
bioreactor.
During fermentation in bioreactor, it was observed 
that AcPhe concentration decreased in the late expo -
nential phase. A control experiment with AcPhe was run 
in parallel to exclude evaporation of this compound. It 
was demonstrated that AcPhe depletion via evaporation 
in bioreactor was not notable (data not shown). AcPhe 
decreasing during fermentation was also reported by 
Buß et al. (2018a), who discussed the possibility of bac -
terial metabolization of AcPhe. Besides, it was shown 
that alcohol dehydrogenases (ADH) from Lactobacillus 
kefir accepts AcPhe and converts it to (R)-alcohol (Yun 
et al. 2003). Degradation of 4-hydroxyacetophenone and 
conversion to phenyl-acetate in the presence of molecu -
lar oxygen by Baeyer-Villiger monooxygenases in Pseu -
domonas putida JD1 is reported by Rehdorf et al. (2009). 
Moreover, microbial degradation of AcPhe catalyzed by 
oxygenases has been approved in Arthrobacter sp., Mic -
rococcus sp. (Havel and Reineke 1993) and Alcaligenes sp. 
(Higson and Focht 1990). Noticeably, the former strain 
showed ω-TA activity (Iwasaki et  al. 2006; Päiviö and 
Kanerva 2013) and its ω-TA mutant (ATA-117) is pro -
duced commercially with collaboration of Codexis and 
Merck (Savile et al. 2010). The enzymatic degradation of 
AcPhe would be a potential way to overcome ω-TAs inhi-
bition by their ketone product.

BaH, each gel from left to right, containing Coomassie brilliant blue staining (as described in method section) and activity staining assay was carried 
out in 50 mM HEPES buffer, pH 7.5 with OXD (5 mM), pyruvate (7.5 mM) DMSO (5 %) and PLP (1 mM). The numbers indicating the protein marker 
bands resemble the order of the bands when used for SDS-PAGE according to the manufacturer’s manual and cannot be used for molecular weight 
determination in native gels. However, we used this pre-stained marker to demonstrate the color development and the specific staining of the ω-TA 
band
Page 10 of 11Gord Noshahri et al. AMB Expr           (2021) 11:46 
As an additional aspect of the study, we present an 
efficient colorimetric assay to visualize ω-TAs in crude 
extracts on acrylamide gel by using ortho-xylylenedi -
amine (OXD) as amine donor. The application of the 
OXD assay established by Green et al. (2014) is thereby 
expanded from high-throughput activity screen -
ings and colony-based screenings of heterologously 
expressed mutants to the protein level to directly iden -
tify the desired enzyme in wild-type strains. Results of 
separate studies clearly demonstrated that OXD is a 
specific diamine substrate for ω-TA (Green et al. 2014; 
Kelly et  al. 2017). Therefore, we applied this substrate 
for a colorimetric assay on acrylamide gel. The strategy 
explained is a simple and fast method for localization 
of ω-TA directly in crude extract on polyacrylamide gel 
in order to enable identification and further sequenc -
ing of the enzyme if a sufficient protein amount and 
purity is given. Conducting Coomassie blue staining 
indicates that this assay appears sensitive without any 
background color and a need for removing by-product. 
In particular, several α-transaminases (α-TA) are con -
stitutively expressed enzymes in Bacillus  as well as in 
Escherichia as in every living cell (Dold et al. 2016) and 
should have been stained with an unspecific staining 
method. So the OXD assay appears to be specific for 
ω-TAs.
While the original OXD assay was established for 
screening large substrate panels or libraries of ω-TA 
variants to facilitate the development of the next genera -
tion of ω-TA biocatalysts by directed evolution (Green 
and Turner 2016), our modification may prove ben -
eficial for a fast screening for novel ω-TAs from natural 
isolate screenings. In particular, the direct isolation of 
the desired ω-TA protein band from the gel for further 
investigations should be possible if a sufficient amount of 
enzyme is applied. Kim et  al. (2007) reported native gel 
activity staining for rapid partial purification of so-called 
β-transaminase by using a nitroblue tetrazolium colori -
metric assay. The resulting single purple band of protein 
was used for amino acid sequencing. In this method, 
removing alanine produced during the reaction and 
regeneration of pyruvate by using alanine dehydroge -
nase plus  NAD+ as a cofactor are essential parts of color 
development which makes this approach rather complex.
Development of an enzymatic reaction involves deter -
mination of kinetic constants (Villegas-Torres et  al. 
2018). We calculated the Michaelis–Menten constants as 
2.6 mM and 17.3 mM for (S)-MBA and pyruvate, respec -
tively, which represented the good affinity of (S)-MBA to 
the enzyme. Jiang et al. (2014) calculated the apparent Km 
of an ω-TA from Burkholderia vietnamiensis for (S)-MBA 
and pyruvate as 14.67 mM and 1.65 mM, respectively. 
On the other hand, the apparent Km of an ω-TA from 
Alcaligenes denitrificans toward pyruvate was reported 
11 mM in the presence of 10mM l-β-amino-n-butyric 
acid (Yun et al. 2004).
