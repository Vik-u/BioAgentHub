Amine compounds biosynthesis usingω-transaminases has received considerable attention
in the pharmaceutical industry. However, the application ofω-transaminases was hampered
by the fundamental challenge of severe by-product inhibition. Here, we report that ω-
transaminase CrmG fromActinoalloteichus cyanogriseus WH1-2216-6is insensitive to inhibition
from by-product α-ketoglutarate or pyruvate. Combined with structural and QM/MM stu-
dies, we establish the detailed catalytic mechanism for CrmG. Our structural and biochemical
studies reveal that the roof of the active site in PMP-bound CrmG isﬂexible, which will
facilitate the PMP or by-product to dissociate from PMP-bound CrmG. Our results also show
that amino acceptor caerulomycin M (CRM M), but notα-ketoglutarate or pyruvate, can
form strong interactions with the roof of the active site in PMP-bound CrmG. Based on our
results, we propose that theﬂexible roof of the active site in PMP-bound CrmG may facilitate
CrmG to overcome inhibition from the by-product.

A
mine moieties are recognized as one of the vital chemical
building blocks forming bioactive natural products,
agrochemicals, as well as pharmaceutical drugs1,2. The
development of effective and broadly applicable methods for
amine compound production has been regarded as a research
priority in the pharmaceutical industry. Chemical transformation
is currently the predominantly used approach for chiral amines
synthesis. However, the drawbacks of the conventional chemical
method are apparent, including low enantiopurity selectivity,
environmental harm, and sometimes the use of precious and even
toxic metal catalysts
2. In virtue of environmental friendliness,
external cofactor independence, extraordinary enantioselectivity
and regioselectivity, ω-transaminases have gained considerable
attractions in chiral amine synthesis 1. ω-transaminases are a
subgroup of pyridoxal 5′-phosphate (PLP)-dependent enzymes,
which are capable of catalyzing amination of keto acids, alde-
hydes, and ketones. This catalytic process consists of two half-
reactions2,3. In the ﬁrst half-reaction, PLP accepts an amino
group from amine (amino donor), resulting in the generation of
pyridoxamine 5′-phosphate (PMP)-bound enzyme and ketone or
aldehyde by-product; in the second half-reaction, the amino
group is transferred to an amino acceptor (keto acid, aldehyde, or
ketone), leading to new amine production and PLP regeneration.
Despite the tremendous advantage and potential, the wide-
spread application of ω-transaminases for organic synthesis is
facing the fundamental challenges of severe by-product inhibition
and unfavorable equilibrium1,4–7. To overcome these challenges,
several by-product removal strategies have been developed. Two
coupled enzymatic systems were used to convert pyruvate, the
corresponding by-product of universal amino donorL-Ala that is
accepted by almost all transaminases8,9, including L-Ala dehy-
drogenase/glucose dehydrogenase system that converts pyruvate
to L-Ala10, and lactate dehydrogenase/glucose dehydrogenase
system that converts pyruvate to lactate1,4,11,12. However, the
large-scale application of this strategy was limited by the high
costs of the coupled enzyme system. Using isopropylamine as an
amino donor, the corresponding by-product acetone can be
removed by evaporation under reduced pressure
1,4,13,14. Unfor-
tunately, isopropylamine is not widely accepted for ω-
transaminases9.
Aside from by-product removal, protein engineering was
developed to overcome the by-product inhibition of ω-
transaminase. In 2005, through random mutagenesis, Yun
et al.15 developed a mutant ofω-transaminase from Vibrio ﬂu-
vialis JS17with reduced by-product inhibitory effect. However, it
is still difﬁcult to obtainω-transaminase completely lacking by-
product inhibition through enzyme engineering. Interestingly, in
2013, Park et al.16 reported that ω-transaminase from Ochro-
bactrum anthropi (OA-ωTA) is devoid of inhibition from by-
product acetophenone in the transamination between amino
acceptor pyruvate and amino donor (S)-α-MBA. However, the
mechanism of how OA- ωTA eliminates inhibition from the
ketone product is still unknown. Moreover, until now, no ω-
transaminase has been reported to circumvent the inhibition
from by-product pyruvate, which is derived from the deamina-
tion of the universal amino donor L-Ala. Thus, it is highly
desirable to discover by-product inhibition-freeω-transaminases
and understand the mechanism, which can efﬁciently facilitate
the rational design ofω-transaminases completely devoid of by-
product inhibition and eventually eliminate the obstacle for
widespread application ofω-transaminases.
Previously, the biosynthetic pathway of the immunosuppres-
sive agent caerulomycin A (CRM A) from the marine actino-
mycete Actinoalloteichus cyanogriseus WH1-2216-6 has been
identiﬁed17–20, and the critical role of the ( S)-selective ω-
transaminase CrmG in the biosynthesis of CRM A has been
reported. CrmG catalyzes amino acceptor caerulomycin M (CRM
M) transformation to caerulomycin N (CRM N)21. In this study,
we report that, without by-product removal in situ, high con-
version of CRM M can be achieved by CrmG with amino donor
L-Ala, L-Gln, or L-Glu. Moreover, the activity of CrmG is insen-
sitive to inhibition from ketoneα-ketoglutarate or pyruvate. To
uncover the mechanism on how CrmG eliminates by-product
inhibition, we determine the crystal structures of the apo form
CrmG, as well as its complexes with amino donorL-Ala, L-Gln, or
L-Glu. Combined with detailed structural analysis of CrmG in
complex with the cofactor (PLP or PMP), or amino acceptor
CRM M, we not only establish the reaction mechanism of CrmG-
catalyzed transamination, but also, more importantly, elucidate
the mechanism of CrmG overcoming by-product inhibition.
Results
ω-Transaminase CrmG is insensitive to by-product inhibition.
Severe by-product inhibition is a common feature of
transaminase1,4,5,7. Vibrio ﬂuvialis JS17 transaminase (Vf-ωTA)
was strongly inhibited by the by-product 2-butanone with aKi of
5.1 mM15; the activity of Vf-ωTA catalyzing acetophenone ami-
nation was completely lost in the presence of 5 mM pyruvate11.
Previously, we reported thatω-transaminase CrmG can effectively
catalyze CRM M amination with some amino acids, especiallyL-
Glu, as amino donors21 (Fig. 1a). To determine the susceptibility
of CrmG to the by-product inhibition, here, we determined the
inhibition constant ofα-ketoglutarate, which is the by-product in
L-Glu deamination, against CrmG-catalyzed reaction. Interest-
ingly, we found that the inhibitory activity of α-ketoglutarate
toward CrmG is very weak with aKi value of 145.9 mM (Fig.1b).
In addition, CrmG is also tolerant of the inhibition from by-
product pyruvate with aKi value of 225.9 mM (Fig.1c).
Favorable equilibrium of CRM M conversion by CrmG. Besides
by-product inhibition, unfavorable equilibrium caused by by-
product is another fundamental hurdle for the widespread
application of transaminase1,4,8. To determine whether CRM M
conversion suffers from unfavorable equilibrium, we investigate
the equilibrium of CrmG catalyzing CRM M conversion. We
previously reported that, without by-product removal in situ,
biaryl aldehyde CRM M can be completely converted to biaryl
amine CRM N by CrmG using high excess (50 equiv) ofL-Glu, L-
Gln, or L-Ala as the amino donor (Supplementary Table 1)21.
Here, we carried out reactions of CrmG catalyzing CRM M
amination with 1.5 equiv amino donor L-Glu, L-Gln, or L-Ala
(Fig. 1d). Our results showed that, without by-product removal
in situ, about 90% CRM M can be converted to CRM N with
amino donorL-Glu andL-Gln, in 12 and 48 h, respectively. With
amino donor L-Ala, 50% conversion of CRM M to CRM N was
achieved in 48 h. This indicates that high conversion of CRM can
be achieved with little excess amino donorL-Glu, L-Gln, orL-Ala.
Crystal structure of apo form and amino donor-bound form
CrmG. To illustrate the mechanism of CrmG overcoming by-
product inhibition, here, we determined the structures for apo
and amino donor-bound form CrmG. The crystal structures of
the apo form CrmG were determined to resolution 2.10 and 2.85
Å in space group I222 and C2, with one and two dimers in the
asymmetric unit, respectively. The crystal structures of CrmG in
complex with amino donor L-Gln, L-Glu, or L-Ala in P1 space
group were determined to resolution 2.35, 2.25, and 2.20 Å,
respectively. For these three crystal structures, each asymmetric
unit contains two dimers.
To conﬁrm that the dimeric CrmG form shown in the crystal
structure is not due to crystal packing artifact, here, we performed

the solution study on apo CrmG using Dynamic light scattering
(DLS). The calculated molecule weight of CrmG in solution is
114 kDa (Supplementary Fig. 1), whereas the theoretical molecule
weight of CrmG is 59.22 kDa. DLS results suggested that CrmG
can form a dimer in solution.
PLP binding induces the rearrangement and stabilization of
CrmG active site. We have previously deﬁned the catalytic pocket
of CrmG as located on the dimer interface, containing cofactor
(PLP or PMP) binding site and substrate binding site separated by
catalytic base K34421. In the active form CrmG (PLP or PMP-
bound CrmG),β5/α6 loop andα6-α7 helices cover on top of the
active site, hereafter we named this region “roof” (Fig. 2a).
However, the catalytic pocket in apo CrmG is structurally dif-
ferent from that in the active form. In the structure of apo CrmG
in C2 space group, we observe four similar catalytic pockets in
two CrmG dimers. In these structures, the“roof” region, i.e., the
segment between β5 and β6 from one monomer andα11′ from
another monomer is disordered orﬂexible (Figs. 2b, 3a; Supple-
mentary Fig. 2). The structural difference of the“roof” in active
form (Supplementary Fig. 3a) and apo form (Supplementary
Fig. 3b, c) is also validated by molecular dynamics (MD) simu-
lations, and root-mean squareﬂuctuation (RMSF) (Supplemen-
tary Fig. 3d) indicates that the“roof” in apo CrmG of C2 space
group is moreﬂexible. Interestingly, in the structure of apo CrmG
in I222 space group, the two catalytic pockets of CrmG dimer
show completely different conformations. One catalytic pocket

adopts the conformation similar with that of apo CrmG in
C2 space group, in which the catalytic base K344 is exposed to
solvent, here we name it“open” pocket; whereas the other cata-
lytic pocket exhibits closed conformation, in which the G213-
S232 loop acts like a lid covering on top of the catalytic K344,
therefore K344 becomes inaccessible to the solvent (Fig.2c). The
closed pocket is more ordered than the open pocket (Fig.2b, c
and Fig. 3a, b). Residue W223 from the closed pocket forms a
cation–π interaction with R451 from a symmetry-related mole-
cule (Supplementary Fig. 4), indicating that the closed pocket
might be stabilized by crystal packing. In addition, in the catalytic
pocket of the closed apo form, residues S206-V212 form a helix,
whereas this segment is a loop in both open apo form and
cofactor-bound active form (Fig.2a–c; Supplementary Fig. 3a–c).
Another interesting difference between apo and active catalytic
pocket is the conformation of V317-I321 around the β10/α10
loop. In the active pocket, the aromatic ring of PLP sits on V317.
However, in both open and closed apo pockets, the V317-I321
region adopts a more relaxed conformation, and Q318 occupies
the position of the aromatic ring of PLP (Fig. 2d). Structure
analysis and key distances tracking along the MD trajectory also
validate the position shift of Q318. As shown in Supplementary
Fig. 5, the distance between side chains of V317 and Q318 is more
ﬂuctuant in the apo from. Moreover, the main chain shift of
catalytic base K344 is also observed between apo and active form
CrmG (Fig.2d). This is conﬁrmed by the MD analysis that reveals
more ﬂuctuating and longer distances between V317 and K344
(both main chain and side chain) in apo form (Supplementary
Fig. 5). These indicate that the catalytic pocket in apo CrmG is
dynamic, and PLP binding induces the structural rearrangement.
To further elucidate how PLP binding induces the structural
rearrangement of the catalytic pocket, we revisit the crystal
structure of PLP-bound form CrmG (PDB code 5DDS)
21.A s
shown in Fig.2e, there are two Proline residues (P222 and P226)
located on theﬁrst and second turn ofα7 helix, which is part of
the “roof” region. These two proline residues, leading to the loss
of backbone hydrogen bonds, potentially destabilize theα7 helix
and contribute to theﬂexibility of the roof. When PLP is bound, it
can induce and stabilize the S206-V212 region to adopt
appropriate conformation via interaction with F207, hence
enabling K210 to interact with the side chain of S372′ and the
main chain of I370′ from the adjacent monomer via hydrogen
bonds. The interactions of K210 with S372′ and I370′ further
stabilize the conformation of α11′ helix (residues P365′-I370′).
The F207 and K210 also interact with W223 onα7 helix through
hydrophobic interaction and cation–π stack, respectively; and
I370′ on α11′ helix forms hydrophobic interactions with P222,
W223, P226, and F227 onα7 helix. Therefore, the interactions

with F207 and K210 andα11′ helix are essential for the formation
and stability ofα7 helix. Hence, the structural rearrangement of
the “roof” is induced by PLP.
To our knowledge, although numerous structures of ω-
transaminase have been determined, here, we ﬁrstly report a
closed form catalytic pocket of apo ω-transaminase with the
active base inaccessible to the solvent. Nevertheless, the
disordered roof of the active site has been reported in other
apo form ω-transaminases. In apo form ω-transaminase from
Chromobacterium violaceum(Cv-ωTA), theﬂexibility of the roof
depends on crystallization condition22. This region is disordered
in the apo form Cv-ωTA crystallized with PEG3350, but it folds
into the active conformation when crystallized from a solution
containing poly(acrylic acid). Besides CrmG and Cv-ωTA, the
disordered roof region is also observed in one molecule of the apo
form structure of catabolic N-succinylornithine transaminase
(AstC)23. However, the roof in the other molecule adopts active
conformation in the apo AstC structure. This suggests that a
certain degree ofﬂexibility in the roof may be a general property
of apoω-transaminase. Thisﬂexibility will facilitate the PLP entry

to the active site, as PLP sits deeply in the catalytic pocket and is
covered by the roof region ofω-transaminase.
Other than the roof of the active site, the structural
rearrangement of the interfacial loop, outer loop, and N terminal
on the active site cavity was also observed in Cv-ωTA upon PLP
binding
22,24. A more recent study proposed that the structural
change of the later element is triggered by a steric clash between
the free catalytic lysine and Y322′ on the interfacial loop, which is
induced by the conformational change of catalytic lysine in apo
Cv-ωTA24. Moreover, this clash was also proposed to promote
the dissociation of apo Cv-ωTA dimer. However, in CrmG, the
Y322 is replaced by F375, and the free catalytic lysine moves away
from F375′ in the apo CrmG (Supplementary Fig. 6). Thus, in apo
CrmG, the free catalytic lysine is unable to induce the structural
rearrangement of the interfacial loop and the dimer dissociation.
Flexibility of the active site in PMP-bound CrmG. As men-
tioned above, structural rearrangement and stabilization of the
roof in the active site of CrmG depend on PLP binding, which is
covalently linked to the catalytic base residue K344. In theﬁrst
half-reaction of a typical transaminase reaction (amino donor
deamination), PLP is converted into PMP and then released from
K344. This indicates that the interaction of PMP with CrmG is
weaker than that of PLP, which potentially leads to the increased
ﬂexibility of the roof region in PMP-bound CrmG. Crystal-
lography temperature factor (B-factor) distribution analysis
clearly shows that active site in PMP-bound CrmG is less ordered
than that in the PLP-bound CrmG (Fig.3c, d). Theﬂexibility of
the active site roof region in PMP-bound CrmG is increased,
compared with that in PLP-bound CrmG, especially for residues
F207 and P222. For comparison, we further analyze the B-factor
distribution for the structures of PMP-bound form ω-
transaminase from V. ﬂuvialis (Vf-ωTA) (PDB code 4E3Q),
PMP-bound form ω-transaminase from O. anthropi (OA-ωTA)
(PDB code 5GHF). Different from CrmG, both Vf-ωTA and OA-
ωTA prefer pyruvate as amino acceptor
14,25. The B-factor dis-
tribution analysis clearly shows that the roof region remains well
ordered in both PMP-bound Vf-ωTA and OA-ωTA structures
(Fig. 3e, f).
In 2009, Schell et al.26, used transaminase to synthesize PMP,
indicating that PMP can be released from the active site of some
transaminases. We then hypothesized that the PMP can also be
easily released from CrmG as a result of the increasedﬂexibility of
the roof at the active site in PMP-bound CrmG. To test this
notion, we performed the PLP conversion reaction (0.02 mM
CrmG, 0.2 mM PLP, and 2 mM amino donor). As shown in
Fig. 4a, the time course of UV–vis spectral changes reveals the
transamination reaction catalyzed by CrmG with PLP (absorption
λmax ≈ 414 nm) converted to PMP (absorptionλmax ≈ 323 nm).
Within 48 h, almost all PLP is converted to PMP using excess
amino donor L-Glu, L-Gln, or L-Ala. We should note that the
concentration of PLP is 10 times of CrmG in these reactions. This
indicates that the synthesized PMP should be released from
CrmG, which then allows new PLP to bind to the active site and
be converted to PMP. Our structures show that PMP/PLP is
deeply buried in the catalytic pocket and covered by the roof
(Figs. 2a and3c, d). For PMP to be released form CrmG, the roof
region of the active site on PMP-bound CrmG must have a
certain degree of ﬂexibility. Therefore, we speculated that
increasing the ﬂexibility of the active site roof would accelerate
the displacement of PMP by free PLP. We then mutated W223 on
α7 helix to alanine, as W223 can stabilizeα7 helix by interacting
with F207 and K210 and I370′. The efﬁciency of CrmG catalyzing
PLP conversion to PMP is greatly improved by the mutation
W223A (Fig.4a, b). Taken together, these results suggest that the
active site of PMP-bound form CrmG is destabilized comparing
to that of PLP-bound CrmG.
Structure basis of amino donor recognition by CrmG .T o
further understand the amino donor deamination reaction of
CrmG, here we analyze the crystal structures of CrmG with dif-
ferent amino donors: L-Gln, L-Glu, and L-Ala. In the crystal
structure of CrmG withL-Gln, only one of four active sites holds
L-Gln. TheL-Gln does not form external aldimine with PLP as no
continuous electron density can be observed between the N atom
of L-Gln and C4′ atom of PLP (Supplementary Fig. 7a). TheL-Gln
is anchored in the substrate cavity via interactions with residues
from both CrmG monomers (Fig.5a). The L-Gln is sandwiched
between F55 and F207. Theα-carboxylate of L-Gln forms a salt
bridge with R486. The side chain ofL-Gln orients toward the
second monomer and the γ-carboxamide group interacts with
S372′ through a hydrogen bond. Most interestingly, the PLP also
contributes to the L-Gln capture by forming a hydrogen bond
with N atom of L-Gln via its phenolic OH group. With these
interactions, the L-Gln should be held tightly in the substrate
cavity. We also notice that the distance between N atom ofL-Gln
and C4′ of PLP is 3.1 Å, suggesting that theL-Gln is ready to react
with PLP to form the external aldimine.
In the structures of CrmG withL-Glu or L-Ala, clear electron
density was observed between the N atoms of those amino donors
and the C4′ atom of PLP (Supplementary Fig. 7b, c), indicating
that we have captured the external aldimine for these amino
acids. In the structure of CrmG with PLP-Glu,γ-carboxylate of
the L-Glu portion not only forms a hydrogen bond with S372′ but
also forms an additional salt bridge with K210 (Fig.5b). In the
structure of CrmG with PLP-Ala, due to the shorter side chain
and lack of γ-carboxylate or γ-carboxamide group, the L-Ala
portion only forms contact with residues of R486 and Q318 from
one monomer via salt bridge and hydrogen bond interaction,
respectively, without interacting with the second monomer of
CrmG dimer (Fig.5c).
Based on these three crystal structures, amino donorsL-Glu,
L-Gln, and L-Ala exhibit strong, moderate, and weak binding to
CrmG, respectively, due to side chain differences. These
corroborate well with our kinetic data that,Km value for L-Glu,
L-Gln, and L-Ala toward CrmG is 80.02, 182.70, and 405.10μM,
respectively (Fig. 5d).
Energetic characteristics of the transamination reaction.T o
deeply understand the equilibrium of CrmG catalyzing CRM M
amination, we further calculated the reaction energy proﬁle of
CrmG, using a combined quantum mechanics/molecular
mechanics (QM/MM) approach. The energy proﬁle for CrmG
catalyzing L-Glu deamination was calculated based on the crystal
structures of PLP-bound CrmG and L-Glu-bound CrmG; the
energy proﬁle for CrmG catalyzing CRM M amination was cal-
culated based on structures of PMP-bound CrmG and CRM M-
bound CrmG. Our calculated results suggested that the deami-
nation of L-Glu contains three stages, integration of amine to
generate geminal diamine (Stage A, A-1 to A-4), dissociation of
geminal diamine to generate external aldimine (Stage B, B-1 to B-
3), and hydrolysis of external aldimine (Stage C, C-1 to C-3)
(Fig. 6a). Similarly, the amination of CRM M can be regarded as a
reverse process of the deamination process. For the reaction
mechanism, our proposed three stages in the transamination
process agree with that previously reported by Himo et al.27,28.
As shown in Fig.6b, CrmG catalyzingL-Glu deamination is an
exothermic reaction with calculated reaction enthalpy of−33.5
kcal/mol, and CRM M amination is endothermic with calculated

that L-Glu deamination is energetically more favorable than CRM
N deamination, and CRM M amination is energetically more
favorable than α-ketoglutarate amination. This implies that by-
product α-ketoglutarate and product CRM N cannot induce
severe unfavorable equilibrium for CrmG catalyzing CRM M
amination with amino donorL-Glu. This corroborates well with
our biochemical results that high conversion of CRM M by CrmG
can be achieved usingL-Glu as an amino donor.

By-product inhibition elimination mechanism of CrmG. It had
been well demonstrated that pyruvate was a highly reactive amino
acceptor for Vf-ωTA25 and OA-ωTA14, and the acetophenone
amination by Vf-ωTA was severely inhibited by pyruvate11. In the
docked structure of PMP-bound form OA-ωTA in complex with
pyruvate, the carboxyl group of pyruvate was coordinated by
hydrogen bonds with residue W58 and R41729, which are con-
served in Vf-ωTA. Similarly, in the structure of CrmG in complex
with L-Ala (corresponding amino donor for by-product pyr-
uvate), the carboxyl group ofL-Ala forms a hydrogen bond with
Q318 and a salt bridge with R486 (Fig.5c). However, CrmG is
insensitive to pyruvate inhibition withKi of 225.9 mM. Moreover,
in the case ofL-Glu, which forms stronger interactions with the
active site of CrmG thanL-Ala, the corresponding by-productα-
ketoglutarate also exhibits very weak inhibitory potential with a
Ki value of 145.9 mM. Our structural analysis shows that the roof
of the active site in PMP form CrmG isﬂexible, whereas this
region is well ordered in both PMP form Vf-ωTA and OA-ωTA
(Fig. 3d–f). Our biochemical results also indicate that theﬂexible
roof of the active site can facilitate PMP releasing from CrmG.
This implies that the ﬂexible roof of the active site can also
promote by-product dissociation from CrmG. Thus, our results
suggest that the ﬂexibility of the active site will protect CrmG
from by-product inhibition.
Based on the above-mentioned analysis, for effective binding to
the active site, the amino acceptor should provide enough energy
to stabilize the roof of the active site in PMP-bound form CrmG.
Previously, we reported the crystal structure of CrmG with amino
acceptor CRM M21. Compared toL-Glu/L-Gln/L-Ala, CRM M not
only forms interaction with F55, and with R486 and S372′ via
water molecules, but also forms strong interactions with the roof
of CrmG through π–π interactions with F207 and W223 and
cation–π interaction with K210 (Fig.7a–c; Supplementary Fig. 8).
This indicates that the roof of the active site on PMP-bound
CrmG can be effectively stabilized by amino acceptor CRM M. We
also showed that amination activity toward CRM M was reduced
for CrmG W223A and K210E mutants with amino donor
L-Gln21.
W223 and K210 are not required for CrmG binding withL-Gln
but involved in the interaction with CRM M and the stabilization
of the roof on CrmG active site. This strongly implies that
stabilizing the roof of CrmG is essential for CRM M amination.
Taken together, our results indicate that stabilizing the active
site in PMP-bound CrmG is essential for amino acceptor
amination and by-product inhibition. Thus, we propose a
mechanism for the by-product inhibition elimination for CrmG
(Supplementary Fig. 9). In apo CrmG, the active site is dynamic,
which might switch between open and closed forms. When apo
CrmG is in its open form, the PLP binds to the active site,
resulting in active site stabilization. Then the deamination
reaction occurs. The amino group is transferred from the amino
donor (L-Ala, L-Glu, orL-Gln) to PLP, generating by-product and
PMP. In PMP-bound CrmG, the active site is dynamic and
ﬂexible. The by-products converted from L-Ala/L-Glu/L-Gln
deamination are easily released from the PMP-bound form
CrmG, owing to the ﬂexible roof of the active site and the
inability of the by-products to stabilize theﬂexible roof. Hence,
the by-product cannot prevent CRM M from binding to the
active site of PMP-bound form CrmG. Furthermore, CRM M
binding can stabilize the roof of the active site in the PMP-bound
CrmG, which can enable CRM M to form intermediate with
PMP, resulting in CRM N formation and PLP regeneration.
Discussion
Severe by-product inhibition is the fundamental challenge for the
widespread application of ω-transaminase to synthesize amine
compounds. Here, we identi ﬁed that ω-transaminase CrmG,
which is involved in the biosynthetic pathway of the immuno-
suppressive agent CRM A, is insensitive to the inhibition from the
by-product. Combined with biochemical, structural, and QM/
MM studies, we provide the detailed catalytic mechanism of
CrmG. Particularly, we gain structural insights on how CrmG
overcomes inhibition from the by-product. Further studies,
especially on protein engineering, will need to be carried out to
validate our proposed mechanism of overcoming by-product
inhibition of ω-transaminases. Thus, our results not only shed
light on how CrmG circumvents the by-product inhibition, but
also may facilitate the rational design of transaminase to eliminate
by-product inhibition.
Methods
Protein expression and puriﬁcation. CrmG was expressed and puriﬁed as
described previously21. Brieﬂy, the cDNA encoding CrmG was inserted into
pET28a vector. CrmG was expressed inE. colistrain BL21 at 16 °C overnight and
induced with 0.3 mM IPTG. The protein has an N-terminal His-tag and additional
14 residues from the vector. Puriﬁcation of CrmG was performed using Ni afﬁnity
chromatography and followed by gelﬁltration. For crystallization, CrmG was
concentrated to 10 mg/mL and dissolved in a buffer containing 20 mM Tris pH 7.5,
200 mM NaCl. For enzyme assay, CrmG was dissolved in a buffer containing
50 mM Tris pH 7.5, 100 mM NaCl and 5% glycerol.
Dynamic light scattering experiments. The CrmG with concentration of 4.8 mg/
mL is dissolved in 50 mM Tris buffer pH 7.5. The dynamic light scattering
experiments were performed at 20 °C using DynaPro Titan instrument.
Crystallization. All crystals of CrmG were grown at 293 K with sitting drop vapor
diffusion method using the sparse matrix crystallization kit from Hampton research.
The apo CrmG crystal in space group I222 was crystallized with 2 µL protein and
2 µL reservoir (30% PEG5000 MME, 100 mM Tris pH 8.0 and 200 mM Lithium
sulfate); the apo CrmG crystal in space group C2 was crystallized with 4 µL protein
(containing 2 mM PLP and 2 mM
L-Gln) and 2 µL reservoir (0.2 M sodium acetate,
0.1 M Tris pH 8.5, 30% PEG 3350, 2% glycerol). To obtain crystals ofL-Gln-bound,
L-Glu-bound, andL-Ala-bound CrmG, CrmG was incubated with 5 mM PLP and
5m M L-Gln, 5 mM PLP, and 5 mML-Glu, 5 mM PLP, and 5 mML-Ala prior to

crystallization, respectively. The crystals of amino donor-bound CrmG were grown
in 0.2 M sodium acetate, 0.1 M Tris pH 8.5, 30% PEG 3350, and 2% glycerol.
Data collection and structure determination. All crystals were cryo-protected in
mother liquid with addition of 20% glycerol, prior to collecting data at 100 K.
Diffraction data for apo form,L-Glu-bound and L-Ala-bound CrmG crystals were
collected at beam line 19U1 of the Shanghai Synchrotron Radiation Facility30.
Diffraction data forL-Gln-bound CrmG crystal was collected at beam line 17U of
the Shanghai Synchrotron Radiation Facility31. Data for apo CrmG,L-Glu-bound,
and L-Gln-bound CrmG were processed with Mosﬂm32, and data forL-Ala-bound
CrmG was processed with DIALS33. All processed data were then scaled with
Aimless34. All crystal structures were solved by molecule replacement with software
Molrep35 using PLP-bound CrmG structure (PDB code 5DDS) as the template.
The reﬁnement of the structures was conducted using Refmac536. Data collection
and reﬁnement statistics are shown in Table1. For apo CrmG structure in C2 space
group, 486 residues, 483 residues, 487 residues, and 489 residues were modeled in
chain A, B, C, and D, respectively. For apo CrmG structure in I222 space group,
505 residues and 514 residues were modeled in chain A and B, respectively. For
structure of CrmG in complex with amino donor
L-Gln, 512 residues, 512 residues,
512 residues, and 508 residues were modeled in chain A, B, C, and D, respectively.
For structure of CrmG in complex with amino donorL-Glu, 512 residues were
modeled in each of the four molecules in the asymmetric unit. For structure of
CrmG in complex with amino donorL-Ala, 511 residues, 511 residues, 510 resi-
dues, and 512 residues were modeled in chain A, B, C, and D, respectively.
CrmG enzyme assays. For PLP conversion reaction by CrmG, the enzyme assays
were carried out in 1 mL reaction mixture in Tris buffer (containing 50 mM Tris
pH 7.5, 100 mM NaCl, 5% glycerol) by incubating 0.02 mM CrmG or CrmG
W223A mutant, 0.2 mM PLP, and 2 mM amino donor (L-Gln, L-Glu, or L-Ala) at
30 °C. The reaction was analyzed with a CD spectrophotometer after blanked with
Tris buffer. For CD spectrophotometer analysis, one milliliter quartz cuvettes were
used, and spectra from 500 to 300 nm were recorded.
The CRM M conversion reactions were performed in 50μL assay solution
(50 mM Tris pH 7.5, 0.1 M NaCl, and 5% Glycerol) containing 4μM CrmG, 80μM
PLP, 0.3 mM amino donor (
L-Glu, L-Gln, or L-Ala), 0.2 mM CRM M, at 30 °C
for 0–48 h. HPLC was used to analyze CRM M consumption and CRM N
production in the reaction. The HPLC analysis was carried out on a C18 column
(250 × 4.6 mm, 5μm) with a running program previously described21. Brieﬂy, a
gradient was run from 5% CH3CN to 30% CH3CN for 18 min, UV detection was
performed at 313 nm.
The Ki value of α-ketoglutarate or pyruvate toward CrmG was determined at
30 °C in 25μL assay solution (200 mM Tris pH 7.5, 0.1 M NaCl, and 5% Glycerol)
containing 4μM CrmG, 80μM PLP, 100 mML-Glu, 0–5 mM CRM M, and 0/
50 mM/100 mMα-ketoglutarate or pyruvate. Competitive inhibition constant ofα-
ketoglutarate or pyruvate toward CrmG was calculated by nonlinear regression
analysis.
The kinetic parameters of CrmG toward amino donorL-Gln, L-Glu, and L-Ala
were determined at 30 °C in 50μL assay solution (200 mM Tris pH 7.5, 0.1 M
NaCl, and 5% glycerol) containing 4μM CrmG, 80μM PLP, 0.2 mM CRM M and
amino donor L-Gln/L-Glu/L-Ala.
QM/MM study. The crystal structures obtained in our previous work (PDB code:
5DDS and 5DDU) were employed as the initial models for the QM/MM simula-
tion. A multi-step MM MD simulation performed with pmemd.cuda in
AMBER12
37 was adopted to equilibrate the complex structure. The structure in the
stable stage of the 50 ns MD simulations was chosen as the initial model for QM/
MM simulations. Periodic boundary condition was considered in MM MD,
whereas spherical boundary condition was employed in QM/MM simulation. QM
atoms were all described by DFT method (B3LYP) at 6–31G* basis set and MM
atoms were described by the AMBER99SB forceﬁeld
38. The QM/MM boundary
was treated by the improved pseudo bond approach and the 12 and 18 Å cutoffs
were employed for van der Waals and electrostatic interactions, respectively. The
QM/MM systems were minimized again for several iterations, and more than 5 ps
QM/MM MD simulations were performed. The minimal time step of integration
(1 fs/step) and equilibration time are adopted to give a more relaxed reaction
system. The resulting conformations were used to map out the minimum energy
path with the reaction coordinate driving method
39. All the QM/MM simulations
were run with QChem4.040 and Tinker41 programs. The whole protocol is trans-
planted from our previous studies and has been carefully validated42–44. Additional
