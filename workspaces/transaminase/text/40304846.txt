ABSTRACT
Introduction: Omaveloxolone, the only 
approved medication for Friedreich ataxia 
(FRDA), is an NRF2 activator available since 
July 2023. We examined safety monitoring of 
omaveloxolone administration over the first 
12 months of administration.
Methods: We recorded baseline and follow-up 
serum transaminase, albumin, total bilirubin, 
cholesterol, and brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) 
values as well as adverse events over 1 year in 
patients initiating commercial omaveloxolone 
therapy.
Results: Access to omaveloxolone was 
obtained in 236 of individuals for whom it was 
prescribed. Side effects were noted in 23.8% of 
patient with the most common being gastroin-
testinal upset, headache, and fatigue baseline. 
Twenty-one patients (8.9%) permanently dis-
continued the drug during the first year. Over 
the first year, 56.6% of patients had at least one 
transaminase value above the upper limit of nor-
mal at some point. Elevations largely occurred 
over the first 3 months of therapy, and after 
6 months of dosing, only 8.6% of patients had 
elevations in transaminases. Elevations were 
generally < 3 × the upper limit of normal and 
decreased with temporary pausing of the drug 
or dose reduction. Few changes were noted in 
albumin or bilirubin, and such changes did not 
parallel changes in transaminases, suggesting 
they are independent events. BNP values were 
generally unchanged throughout the year, and 
no systematic changes in blood counts were 
noted. Cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein 
(LDL) elevations were mild.
Conclusions: Most patients with FRDA even-
tually had access to omaveloxolone, and it was 
generally well tolerated. Side effects were mod-
est, and, overall, most patients remained on 
the drug. Abnormalities in serum liver function 
tests were limited to transaminases, resolved 
with dose pausing or reduction, and diminished 
markedly over time. Thus, the safety features 
of omaveloxolone after administration largely 
resemble the favorable features noted during 
clinical trials.

Abstract at the International Congress for Ataxia 
Research, November 2024.

Key Summary Points 
Friedreich ataxia (FRDA) is characterized by 
progressive gait and limb ataxia, scoliosis, 
dysarthria, visual loss, and hypertrophic car-
diomyopathy
The only FDA-approved medication for 
patients ≥ 16 years old with FRDA is 
omaveloxolone
Omaveloxolone is an NRF2 stabilizer shown 
to improve mFARS (modified Friedreich 
Ataxia Rating Scale) scores in clinical trials 
and has been commercially available since 
July 2023
We followed patients over the first year of 
commercial availability, tracking laboratory 
values and reported adverse events
The clinical findings after the first year of 
treatment are similar to the findings in the 
MOXIe clinical trials
INTRODUCTION
Friedreich ataxia (FRDA), the most common 
hereditary ataxia, is characterized by progres-
sive gait and limb ataxia, scoliosis, dysarthria, 
visual loss, and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy 
[1–3]. The age of onset is usually within the first 
2 decades of life, and individuals are wheelchair-
bound within 10–15 years of disease onset [4 ]; 
cardiomyopathy-associated heart failure is the 
main cause of mortality [ 5]. FRDA is usually 
(96%) caused by biallelic expanded guanine-
adenine-adenine (GAA) trinucleotide repeats 
in intron 1 of the  FXN gene. Such expanded 
GAA repeats repress FXN expression leading to 
reduced frataxin protein levels. Frataxin is tar-
geted to mitochondria, where it facilitates bio-
synthesis of iron–sulfur clusters (ISCs) [6–8] and 
energy production in the cell [9, 10].
While definitive therapy probably requires 
restoration of frataxin levels, a variety of 
approaches targeted to reversal of mitochondrial 
dysfunction have reached clinical trials, with 
omaveloxolone being approved by the FDA in 
2023 [11–16]. Omaveloxolone stabilizes NRF2, a 
transcription factor controlling the endogenous 
response to oxidative stress; NRF2 is paradoxi-
cally downregulated in FRDA [17– 20]. In the 
MOXIe clinical trials of patients with FRDA 16 
to 40 years of age, omaveloxolone demonstrated 
a biphasic concentration response curve, with 
maximal benefit occurring at 160 mg per day, 
leading to a dosing in pivotal studies of 150 mg 
per day. At this dose, omaveloxolone improved 
mFARS scores, the most commonly used meas-
ure for assessment of neurologic function in 
FRDA, at 1 year with benefit persisting during an 
open label extension for at least 3 years [11– 15, 
21]. The drug was also safe and well tolerated in 
the MOXIe study, but its dosing is complicated 
by interactions with strong CYP4A3 inhibitors. 
CYP4A3 inhibitors increase the metabolism of 
omaveloxolone, requiring a reduction of dosage 
to prevent overmedicating.
Based on these data, omaveloxolone was 
approved for treatment of patients with FRDA 
≥ 16 years old with no other restrictions. Rec-
ommended monitoring of omaveloxolone treat-
ment includes yearly BNP and cholesterol levels 
as well as hepatic function testing at baseline 
and months 1, 2, 3, 6, and 12 after starting ther-
apy. Here, we report on the safety and tolerabil-
ity of omaveloxolone given clinically for 1 year.
METHODS
Patients
Procedures were approved by the Children’s 
Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP) Institutional 
review board as a component of the long-run-
ning FRDA natural history study FACOMS and 
its successor (UNIFAI) (CHOP IRB #2609). Sub-
jects provided informed consent through this 
study and were initially identified as those fol-
lowed at CHOP in the natural history study. 
Data were extracted from their study visits to 
1107Neurol Ther (2025) 14:1105–1114 
evaluate medical history, laboratory testing, and 
adverse events.
Ethical Approval
The study was approved through the CHOP IRB 
as study 2609 and performed in accordance with 
the Helsinki Declaration of 1964. All subjects 
provided informed consent to participate in the 
study.
Data Collection
We extracted the start date, baseline laboratory 
values, and medication interactions for each 
patient. Laboratory values included lipid panels 
(total cholesterol and LDL) and brain natriuretic 
peptide (BNP), at baseline visits and hepatic 
function testing at months 1, 2, 3, 6, and 12 
months after starting omaveloxolone, focusing 
on alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate 
aminotransferase (AST), albumin, and total bili-
rubin levels. For patients previously enrolled in 
the clinical trial of omaveloxolone, only baseline 
and 12-month laboratory values were extracted.
Dosing
All patients were initially dosed based on the 
clinical recommendation of 150 mg/ day (three 
50 mg pills), except those on chronic CYP3A4 
inhibitors (most commonly diltiazem and vera-
pamil). Patients on these inhibitors were dosed 
at 100 mg/ day (two pills) to achieve the pre-
sumptively similar blood levels [22].
For those subjects followed clinically at CHOP, 
omaveloxolone dose was reduced in response to 
elevated transaminase values as follows: Patients 
continued dosing at the same dose if ALT val-
ues were < 2 × the ULN. If the value for ALT was 
> 3 × the upper limit normal (ULN), the patient 
was instructed to discontinue omaveloxolone 
for 2 weeks and repeat laboratory testing. If the 
repeat testing showed ALT levels < 3 × normal, 
the patient was restarted at 50 mg less than their 
previous dose. Once a patient was had stable 
ALT levels under 2 × ULN based on serial testing 
(typically each month), patients could increase 
back to their full dosage. If ALT was 2–2.9 × ULN, 
patients continued the same dosing, but hepatic 
function values were reevaluated in 2 weeks to 
confirm stable ALT levels. The average ALT upper 
limit of normal (ULN) was 41.3 U/l but varied 
depending on patient demographics and site of 
assessment. The mean value for each test is pro-
vided for reference.
For patients who experienced dose reduction 
due to ALT values or other side effects, dos-
ing was slowly returned to their original dos-
ing regimen if transaminase values remained < 
3 × normal.
Data Analysis
Data were calculated using Stata version 18 (Col-
lege Station, TX) or Graphpad (www. graph pad. 
com/ quick calcs). For analysis of proportions of 
elevated values, ULN was presumed to be Gauss-
ian in distribution and thus represent two stand-
ard deviations greater than mean and analyzed 
by chi-square tests. For analysis of means, sam-
ples were compared to the ULN by one-sample 
t-tests.
RESULTS
Demographics
Two hundred ninety-two patients were iden-
tified for the study; 236 were prescribed 
omaveloxolone by a member of the CHOP neu-
rology division (and participated in FACOMS/
UNIFAI at CHOP), with 56 further patients 
utilizing outside prescribers (obtaining other 
care or participating in FACOMS at CHOP). At 
CHOP, the average age for starting treatment 
was 31.8 and for non-CHOP was 28.8 years. The 
average disease duration was 17.8 (CHOP) and 
18.9 (non-CHOP). The average age of onset was 
13.9 (CHOP) and 10.3 (non-CHOP). The aver-
age GAA1 repeat length was 631.7 (CHOP) and 
720 (non-CHOP). At CHOP, 44.4% of patients 
were male and 55.5% were female. Patients pre-
scribed outside of CHOP were 50% male and 
50% female (Table 1). Forty individuals had par-
ticipated in the MOXIe trials, 33 of whom tran-
sitioned directly from the study to commercial 
1108 Neurol Ther (2025) 14:1105–1114
drug. The remaining seven patients participated 
in MOXIe but had terminated participation 
before starting commercial medication. Further 
analysis concentrated on the individuals for 
whom omaveloxolone was prescribed at CHOP 
as more detailed information was available.
Of the 236 patients prescribed omavelox-
olone at CHOP, 207 remained on the drug with 
most patients (88.4%) having taken omavelox-
olone for > 1 year (Table  2). Five patients never 
obtained approval, and 21 patients discontinued 
omaveloxolone (Table  2). Patients mainly dis-
continued omaveloxolone because of reported 
side effects or were lost to follow-up. Of those 
treated at CHOP, 22 obtained medication 
through a patient assistance program, while the 
patient’s insurance covered omaveloxolone in 
214 people.
Dosing
The majority of patients prescribed at CHOP 
reached the maximum dose of 150 mg a day 
(three 50 mg pills a day); 87.9% of patients 
have an ideal maximum dose of 150 mg/day, 
and 12.1% have a maximum dose of 100 mg 
(2 pills) a day based on interactions with 
other drugs. Eighty-five percent (176 patients) 
at CHOP reached 150 mg a day, 14.0% (29 
patients) take 100  mg a day, and 1.0% (2 
patients) take 50 mg (one pill) a day. Seven 
patients are currently (at least 12 months after 
initiation of therapy) taking less than their 
ideal dose but are actively working towards the 
maximum ideal dose.

Adverse Events
In the cohort, 63 subjects reported significant 
adverse events, most commonly matching 
those noted in the clinical trial (GI distur-
bances, headache), but a few individuals dis-
continued drugs because of such events. Some 
patients had multiple adverse events, almost 
all of which subsided over the first 3 months 
(Table  3). Three individuals reported rash, 
which correlated highly with omaveloxolone 
administration in one individual. In two of 
these patients, a dermatologic consultant felt 
the rash was unrelated after skin biopsy. Of 
those with rash, two tolerated the drug with 
minimal skin reaction on rechallenge, while 
the third had a recurrence and discontinued 
omaveloxolone permanently. No ongoing side 
effects were noted in those individuals who 
had transitioned from the MOXIe study.
Monitoring of Hepatic Function
As expected, transaminase elevations (any value 
greater than the upper limit of normal) occurred 
in many subjects, with 56.6% of patients having 
an elevation in transaminases at some point over 
the 12-month period (p < 0.0001). By 12 months, 
16.6% of patients had elevations (p < 0.0001) but 
none were > 3 × the ULN (Fig. 1A, B). Omavelox-
olone did not change albumin levels or total bili-
rubin levels in a substantial number of patients at 
any time point. One patient had a significant drop 
in albumin levels due to pneumonia unrelated to 
omaveloxolone. Two other significant elevations 
in bilirubin were explained by unrelated comor-
bidities (Gilbert’s syndrome and biliary atresia). 
In those situations, in which albumin or bilirubin 
changed, it was felt related to comorbidities rather 
than FRDA or omaveloxolone and did not corre-
late with changes in transaminases. (Fig. 1C, D). 
No abnormalities of hepatic function testing were 
identified in those who had transferred directly 
from the MOXIe trial.
Twenty-six patients paused dosing because of 
elevated transaminases, and one patient tempo-
rarily paused dosing because of side effects. Of the 
27 patients that paused dosing, 23 returned to 
their targeted dose. The remaining four patients 
remained in the process of increasing their dose 
toward their target. Four patients decided to per-
manently stop medication, and only one patient 
(with rash) could not resume modified or full 
dosing.
Within the cohort were three individuals who 
had been removed from active treatment in the 
MOXIe study for persistent transaminase eleva-
tions > 5 × normal. These individuals were started 
on omaveloxolone clinically with close moni-
toring of hepatic function. All individuals again 
had a dramatic increase in transaminases requir-
ing dose reduction. However, they were able to 
return to omaveloxolone treatment and after 1 
year, and two of three have reached their target 
dose (Fig. 2).
T able 3  Reported adverse events
Sixty-three patients followed reported one or multiple 
adverse events (AEs) directly or during clinical visits. Most 
AEs involved GI (gastrointestinal) upset, which subsided 
within the first 3 months. Other common AEs reported 
included fatigue and headache

Other Laboratory Values
Total cholesterol and LDL levels were slightly 
elevated on average after 12 months of  OMAV 
treatment. The average ULN for total cholesterol 
was 197.0 mg/dl and the average ULN for LDL 
was 108.9 mg/dl. On average, there was a 0.07 
(± 0.16) point increase in total cholesterol levels 
above the ULN and a 0.24 (± 0.16) increase in LDL 
levels above ULN (Fig. 3). Similarly, BNP had no 
meaningful change over the course of 1 year. 
The ULN for BNP was 100 pg/ml. Three patients 
with a history of cardiac dysfunction (low ejec-
tion fraction) had a slight increase in BNP, and 
one patient had a fall in BNP levels, suggesting

ALT levels typically increased after starting omavelox -
olone and leveled out after continuation or dose modifica -
tion. T ransaminase elevations (any value greater than the 
upper limit of normal) occurred in many subjects, with 
56.6% of patients having an elevation in transaminases 
at some point over the 12-month period (p < 0.0001). 
At 1 month, 55.0% of patients had elevated ALT val -
ues with 12.1% above 3 × ULN (both p < 0.0001). At 2 
months, 48.9% (p < 0.0001) of patients had elevations with 
4.4% (p < 0.003) above 3 × ULN. At 3 months, 39.2% 
(p < 0.0001) had elevations with 4.4% (p < 0.003) above 
3 × ULN. At 6 months, 35.2% (p < 0.0001) had elevations 
with 3.6% (p < 0.003) above 3 × ULN. At 12  months, 
16.6% of patients had elevations (p < 0.0001), but none 
were > 3 × the ULN. B Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) 
levels were compared to the upper limit of normal (ULN)

lated with increases in ALT levels but at lower magnitude.

DISCUSSION
The clinical use of omaveloxolone over its first 
19  months since release recapitulates most 
of the safety findings of the MOXIe trial. To 
this point, few major adverse events occurred 
with omaveloxolone treatment in either the 
MOXIe study or the clinical use described here. 
Omaveloxolone has been generally tolerated. 
These findings justify its ongoing use and sug-
gest that the MOXIe study, as a representative 
clinical trial, reflects the effects in larger popula-
tions with FRDA.
Still, various issues can appear with 
omaveloxolone. While access to omaveloxolone 
was difficult for some subjects, the vast majority 
eventually had access to the agent. Surprisingly, 
while all patients were instructed to obtain 
laboratory values before starting omavelox-
olone, only 57% had baseline transaminases. 
This low rate could reflect the unfamiliarity of 
the patient population with drug monitoring 
but also likely results from the delay between 
approval (Fevruary 28, 2023) and commercial 
availability (July 7, 2023) of the agent. Once 
started, laboratory abnormalities were modest; 
abnormalities in liver function were limited to 
transaminases and resolved with time in associ-
ation with dose pausing or dose reduction. This 
is most consistent with a metabolic effect on

the liver rather than a typical toxicity. Despite 
the effects of the related compound bardox-
olone, no effects were noted on BNP values, 
and cholesterol changes, though present, were 
modest [23]. Side effects were also modest and 
transient; overall, most patients remained on 
the drug. In addition, apart from one individual 
with a significant rash, no new adverse events 
appeared.
CONCLUSION
Overall, patients have responded well to com-
mercial treatment with omaveloxolone. Eleva-
tions in transaminases were expected and lev-
eled out over time or after dose modification. 
Adverse events have been modest and were 
similar to those reported in the MOXIe trials. 
Further investigation should study the reported 
benefit and change in mFARS score after 1 year 
of treatment. Further investigations should also 
examine changes in cardiac disease.
