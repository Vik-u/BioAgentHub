ABSTRACT Amination of bulky ketones, particularly in (R) conﬁguration, is an at-
tractive chemical conversion; however, known/H9275-transaminases (/H9275-TAs) show insufﬁ-
cient levels of performance. By applying two screening methods, we discovered 10
amine transaminases from the class III
/H9275-TA family that were 38% to 76% identical
to homologues. We present examples of such enzymes preferring bulky ketones
over keto acids and aldehydes with stringent (S) selectivity. We also report represen-
tatives from the class III
/H9275-TAs capable of converting (R) and (S) amines and bulky
ketones and one that can convert amines with longer alkyl substituents. The prefer-
ence for bulky ketones was associated with the presence of a hairpin region proxi-
mal to the conserved Arg414 and residues conforming and close to it. The outward
orientation of Arg414 additionally favored the conversion of (R) amines. This conﬁg-
uration was also found to favor the utilization of putrescine as an amine donor, so
that class III
/H9275-TAs with Arg414 in outward orientation may participatein vivo in the
catabolism of putrescine. The positioning of the conserved Ser231 also contributes
to the preference for amines with longer alkyl substituents. Optimal temperatures
for activity ranged from 45 to 65°C, and a few enzymes retained/H1135050% of their ac-
tivity in water-soluble solvents (up to 50% [vol/vol]). Hence, our results will pave the
way to design, in the future, new class III
/H9275-TAs converting bulky ketones and (R)
amines for the production of high-value products and to screen for those converting
putrescine.
IMPORTANCE Amine transaminases of the class III/H9275-TAs are key enzymes for modi-
ﬁcation of chemical building blocks, but ﬁnding those capable of converting bulky
ketones and (R) amines is still challenging. Here, by an extensive analysis of the sub-
strate spectra of 10 class III
/H9275-TAs, we identiﬁed a number of residues playing a role
in determining the access and positioning of bulky ketones, bulky amines, and (R)-
and (S) amines, as well as of environmentally relevant polyamines, particularly pu-
trescine. The results presented can signiﬁcantly expand future opportunities for de-
signing (R)-speciﬁc class III
/H9275-TAs to convert valuable bulky ketones and amines, as
well as for deepening the knowledge into the polyamine catabolic pathways.

T
ransaminases (TAs) (EC 2.6.1.x), also called aminotransferases, are versatile enzymes
with industrial potential (1). They catalyze asymmetric amine transfer reactions
between an amine and a ketone, aldehyde, or keto-acid and, thus, are key enzymes to
produce building blocks for drug discovery and chemical biology. All transaminases
reported so far require pyridoxal-5=-phosphate (PLP) as a coenzyme, which serves as a
molecular shuttle for ammonia and electrons between the amine donor and the
acceptor in a catalytic cycle. First, the amine group from the amine donor binds to the
enzyme, and then pyridoxamine-5=-phosphate (PMP) is formed from PLP and the amine
donor is released as a keto product. Afterwards, PMP transfers the amine group to the
acceptor and PMP is regenerated to PLP, closing the catalytic cycle. Based on their
amino acid sequences, transaminases are classiﬁed in six groups (classes I to VI) (
1), with
class III covering the so-called/H9275-transaminases (/H9275-TAs). Within the/H9275-TAs, the class of
amine transaminases (ATAs) has industrial relevance, as they have been used for the
preparation of optically pure amines starting from the corresponding ketones (
1, 2).
In an ideal scenario, functional screening with genomics and metagenomics tech-
niques would allow the identiﬁcation of a new generation of microbial biocatalysts,
including ATAs of the class III
/H9275-TAs (3–6). However, extensive bioprospecting by
metagenomics was only rarely successful (5), despite the growing number of sequences
available in public databases (7). Indeed, only three class III/H9275-TAs have been identiﬁed
by metagenomics techniques; however, this was by applying sequence homology-
based techniques rather than functional methods (
8). These enzymes showed poor
levels of performance with ketones compared with their performance with aldehydes
and keto acids. As an example, the conversion of acetone was measured to be less than
0.04% relative to that for 2-oxobutyrate and propionaldehyde (
8), which were the
preferred keto acid and aldehyde substrates, respectively. A thermodynamic limitation
for the amination of ketones is a common characteristic of
/H9275-TAs (9). For instance, the
kcat/Km ratio of the /H9275-TA from Ochrobactrum arthropi for acetophenone was only
0.0004% relative to that for pyruvate (10). Also,/H9275-TAs fromParococcus denitriﬁcansand
Chromobacterium violaceum showed from 0.015% to 0.083% relative activities for
ketones compared to the values for/H9251-keto acids and aldehydes (9). This prompted the
research to create, by active-site engineering, /H9275-TA variants displaying improved
capacity for the synthesis of chiral amines from bulky ketones. By applying this
procedure, a 105-fold activity improvement for the conversion of butyrophenone was
achieved for the
/H9275-TA fromO. arthropi, although the relative activity compared to the
value for aldehyde was still low (from 1.4 to 11.3% relative activity) (10).
Finding new /H9275-TAs displaying high capability for the conversion of ketones, in
combination with good stability and preferably stringent (R)o r(S) selectivity (11–13), is
thus a priority for the synthesization of pharmaceutically valuable chiral amines (9).
However, their discovery is limited, most likely due to a lack of suitable screening
methods at large scale. Recently, new assays for high-throughput screening of ATAs in
liquid or solid phase were described (
14, 15). By adapting these methods to screen a
large collection of clone libraries generated from environmental DNA of diverse origins,
we successfully identiﬁed 10 genes encoding presumptive ATAs of the class III
/H9275-TA
family. These genes were expressed in fusion proteins fused to polyhistidine (His)
afﬁnity tags, puriﬁed by immobilized metal afﬁnity chromatography, and characterized.
The results presented here illustrate the beneﬁts of the methods herein applied to
screen for
/H9275-TAs using metagenomics. The extensive analysis of their substrate spectra
allowed the identiﬁcation of those capable of converting bulky ketones and bulky
amines, as well as environmentally relevant amines like putrescine. Finally, the appli-
cation of sequence and 3-dimensional-model analyses shed new lights on the molec-
ular determinants of their substrate speciﬁcities and stereochemistry. The present study
may help future bioprospecting and engineering programs to identify and design class
III
/H9275-TA family proteins converting bulky ketones and bulky amines with stringent (R)
or (S) stereospeciﬁcity.

RESULTS
Gene selection by naive screens.Recently, a large set of metagenomic fosmid
libraries from microbial communities inhabiting 28 geographically distinct environmen-
tal sites has been created and subjected to naive screen for esterase activity (
16). In
accordance with biological diversity and activity success rates, libraries from microbial
communities inhabiting 10 of these sites (for details, see Materials and Methods) were
chosen as starting points for screening new
/H9275-TA-encoding sequences. We applied to
all libraries two distinct naive agar-based screen methods, utilizing the two amine
donors 2-(4-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-amine ando-xylylenediamine hydrochloride (see Fig.
S1 in the supplemental material), which after transfer reactions render a colored
product that can be identiﬁed by visual inspection (
14, 15). About half a million
pCCFOS1 fosmid clones (nearly 18 Gbp) from libraries generated from environmental
DNA and 4,400 plasmid-based (pCR-XL-TOPO) clones from aPseudomonas oleovorans
genomic DNA library were screened for ATA activity using both agar-based screens. We
identiﬁed a total of 10 positive clones active against 2-(4-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-amine, 3
of which were also active againsto-xylylenediamine hydrochloride. They were recov-
ered from clone libraries created from two chronically polluted marine sediment
samples, an acidic beach pool, and theP. oleovoransgenome (see the legend to Table
S1) (
16–18). This means a ratio of circa 1 positive result per 50,000 clones tested; note
that this ratio is an indicator of the abundance of enzyme activities in metagenomes (5,
19). The 10 positive fosmid/plasmid inserts were fully sequenced using the Illumina
MiSeq sequencing system. From the sequence data, 10 candidate genes encoding
putative
/H9275-TAs, one per insert, were identiﬁed.
Analysis of candidates at the protein sequence level.As shown by the results in
Table S1 in the supplemental material, the deduced molecular mass and estimated
isoelectric point (pI) values for the amino acid sequences comprising the 10/H9275-TAs
(designated TR1 to TR10 based on the code TR, which refers to transaminase) ranged
from 48.4 to 50.8 kDa and from 5.4 to 6.1, respectively. A comprehensive analysis of the
TBLASTX results (
20) indicated that putative proteins exhibited amino acid sequence
identities ranging from 84% to 100% to sequences of uncharacterized homologous
proteins in nonredundant public databases and from 35.7% to 60.7% to sequences in
Protein Data Bank (PDB). As determined by Matcher (EMBOSS package), the pairwise
amino acid sequence identities between the 10 selected sequences ranged from circa
33% to 99% (see Table S2A). TR
3 and TR7 (98.9%), TR4 and TR5 (94.5%), and TR9 and TR10
(92.9%) shared the highest sequence similarities. Sequence analysis and TBLASTX (20)
categorized all sequences within the class III/H9275-TA family (21). It is interesting to note
that the naive assays employed led to the identiﬁcation of only class III/H9275-TAs and none
of the other 5 groups, referred to as classes I, II, IV, V and VI (1). It may be due to the
fact that compared to ATAs from other groups,/H9275-TAs transfer an amino group from an
amine donor onto a carbonyl moiety of an amine acceptor, in which process at least
one of the two substances is not an
/H9251-amino acid or an/H9251-keto acid (1). Any of these
substrates was used in the naive screens, which may explain why the screening with the
two amine donors 2-(4-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-amine ando-xylylenediamine hydrochlo-
ride produced a bias toward class III
/H9275-TAs.
Taken together, these data suggest that there is a large divergence at the sequence
level within the identiﬁed class III /H9275-TA sequences and that the diversity is not
dominated by a particular type of protein or highly similar clusters of proteins but
consists of diverse nonredundant
/H9275-TA sequences. Phylogenetic binning (22, 23)o ft h e
sequences encoding presumptive class III/H9275-TAs further revealed that they most likely
originated from bacteria of theRhodobacteraceae family (5 sequences) and thePseu-
domonas (3 sequences), Acidihalobacter (1 sequence), and Amphritea (1 sequence)
genera (see Supporting Results and Fig. S2 in the supplemental material).
Recombinant protein production.The 10 candidates were cloned into pBXCH or
pRhokHi-2 (with C-terminal His tags) or into pBHXN3 (N-terminal His tags) (Fig. S1);
these expression vectors allow high-expression yields for genes of environmental and

microbial origins (16, 24, 25). Escherichia coli strains MC1061 (when using pBXCH and
pBHXN3 vectors) and DH5 /H9251(for pRhokHi-2) were used as expression hosts. The
preferred construct design for each enzyme was selected on the basis of the protein
yield obtained, which is out of the scope of the present study and, thus, not shown. The
average yields of the
/H9275-TAs in E. coli heterologous expression systems were approxi-
mately 32 mg puriﬁed protein per liter of culture. The 10 hexahistidine-tagged candi-
dates were puriﬁed from lysed cells by immobilized metal afﬁnity chromatography
using Ni-nitrilotriacetic acid (NTA) technology (Fig. S3). The substrate proﬁles and
properties of puriﬁed
/H9275-TAs were further analyzed.
Acceptor proﬁling: preference for bulky ketones. The acceptor proﬁling was
performed by using the colorimetric liquid assay reported by Baud et al. (14) with minor
modiﬁcations (see Materials and Methods). We used one primary amine donor [2-(4-
nitrophenyl)ethan-1-amine] and a set of 18 chemically and structurally distinct alde-
hydes, ketones, and keto acids as amine acceptors (see Scheme S1 in the supplemental
material). Alkyl ketones of different lengths and large aromatic ketones and aldehydes
were also included, since a larger group adjacent to the aldehyde or ketone group
increases the difﬁculty of amine transfer. Reaction mixtures obtained in all cases were
analyzed by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) (see Materials and
Methods), and the existence of reaction products was conﬁrmed in each case (see
Supporting Results in the supplemental material).
The relative (%) speciﬁc activities obtained with the best substrates for all 10
/H9275-TAs
for each of the 18 acceptors are summarized in Fig. 1; for speciﬁc activity (U g/H110021
protein) raw data, see Table S2B. We ﬁrst observed that according to the data for the
best acceptor, TR1, with a maximum speciﬁc activity of 95.7 U g/H110021, was also the least
active enzyme, with the other/H9275-TAs having values ranging from 972 U g/H110021 to 179
Ug /H110021 (Table S2B). The speciﬁc activities for the best substrates are in the range
previously reported for/H9275-TAs (12, 26).
Regarding acceptor range, only 6 of 18 amine acceptors were converted by all 10
/H9275-TAs (Fig. 1). We found that TR1 was characterized by a restricted acceptor spectrum,
only capable of using as acceptors the keto acids glyoxylic acid, levulinic acid, and
/H9251-ketoglutaric acid (nonpreferred acceptors) and, to a much greater extent, the alde-
hydes hexanal (preferred acceptor) and benzaldehyde and the ketone 2-hexanone. No
capacity of TR
1 to use any of the other linear and bulky ketones tested was detected
under the assay conditions. All of the other 9/H9275-TAs showed broader acceptor spectra
and were characterized by signiﬁcantly higher preferences for ketones than for alde-
hydes and keto acids. Thus, on the basis of speciﬁc activity determinations (U g
/H110021), the
relative activities for amine transfer to the best accepted ketone compared to the
preferred aldehydes or keto acids were found to be 50.4% (for TR
1), 96.1% (for TR2),
9.0% (for TR3), 90.3% (for TR4), 112.5% (for TR5), 1.1% (for TR6), 84.3% (for TR7), 14.9%
(for TR8), 173.4% (for TR9), and 142.8% (for TR10), as measured at 40°C and pH 7.5 (Table
S2B). These percentages are signiﬁcantly higher than those observed for previously
reported /H9275-TAs (below 0.083%) (8–10).
Preferred acceptors for most /H9275-TAs were hexanal, benzaldehyde, or the bulky
ketone 1-N-Boc-3-pyrrolidinone, depending on the transaminase (Fig. 1). Other bulky
ketones, particularly 2-acetylpyridine and 2-acetylpyrazine, were well accepted by all
/H9275-TAs, albeit they were not the preferred acceptors. Concerning the use of aliphatic
ketones as acceptors, we found that increases in the side chain length resulted in lower
levels of conversion (2-hexanone /H110222-heptanone /H110222-nonanone). As shown by the
results in
Fig. 1, bulky ketones were converted at levels similar to or higher than
aliphatic ketones and aldehydes. Concerning the use of ketoacids, TR6 and TR8 had a
noticeably higher preference for glyoxylic acid than did the other/H9275-TAs.
The similar acceptor proﬁles for TR9 and TR10 (Fig. 1) agreed with their 93% identity
at the amino acid sequence level (Table S2A). However, TR3 and TR7, which shared 99%
identity, differed in the capacity to use multiple acceptors, which was particularly
noticeable for their capacity to use 1-N-Boc-3-pyrrolidinone (relative activities of 1.6%
Coscolín et al. Applied and Environmental Microbiology

for TR3 and 84.31% for TR7) and glyoxylic acid (relative activities of 28.8% for TR3 and
1.04% for TR7). TR4 and TR5, which were 94.5% identical, only showed an appreciable
difference for the conversion of 4-phenyl-2-butanone (relative activities of 31.7% for
TR
4 and 3.3% for TR5); 1-indanone was only converted by TR5, albeit at a signiﬁcantly
low relative activity (0.93%) compared to the value for its best acceptor. It was
particularly noticeable that, excluding TR
1, which was unable to use 1- N-Boc-3-
pyrrolidinone, TR3 and TR8 showed signiﬁcantly low relative speciﬁc activities for this
acceptor (1.6% for TR3 and 0.3% for TR8) compared to all of the other/H9275-TAs, for which
this was one of the preferred acceptors (from 84.3% to 100% relative activity).
Donor proﬁling: preference for bulky amines.The /H9275-TAs were examined using
benzaldehyde as a ketone acceptor and a set of 14 chemically and structurally distinct
amine donors (see Scheme S2), including 4 pairs of enantiomers and the inexpensive
isopropyl amine (
Fig. 1; for raw data, see Table S2C). Instead of using the common gas
chromatography (GC) method for detecting transamination products (12), we adapted
the colorimetric assay described by Baud et al. (14). Brieﬂy, we detected the amount of
benzaldehyde that remained after the reaction compared to the amounts remaining
FIG 1 Substrate ranges of class III/H9275-TAs. Amine acceptors (top) and donors (bottom) tested are shown on the left.
The identiﬁcation code for each enzyme is shown on the bottom. This ﬁgure was created from data presented in
Tables S2B and C in the supplemental material. 2-(4-Nitrophenyl)ethan-1-amine was used as the amine donor with
the aldehydes, ketones, and keto acids listed as acceptors. Benzaldehyde was used as the acceptor with the amines
listed as donors. (R)-(/H11001)-Aminohexane, (R)-(/H11001)-
/H9251-methylbenzylamine, and (R)-1-(4-nitrophenyl)ethylamine are not
indicated because their conversion was below the detection limit under our assay conditions. The speciﬁc activity
(U g
/H110021) at 40°C and pH 7.5 was determined as described in Materials and Methods, and the relative activity (%)
obtained with the best acceptor (top) or donor (bottom) is indicated. The ﬁgure was created with the R language
console. The structures of the acceptors and donors can be seen in Schemes S1 and S2 in the supplemental
material.

after control reactions in the absence of the amine donor and in the absence of
enzymes (see Materials and Methods, as well as Scheme S2). The reaction mixtures
obtained in all cases were also analyzed by ESI-MS (see Materials and Methods), and the
formation of reaction products conﬁrmed (see Supporting Results in the supplemental
material).
We ﬁrst observed that, using benzaldehyde and the preferred amine donor, the
maximum activity ranged from 22.8 to 841.5 U g
/H110021 (Table S2C), which is in the
range found for other reported /H9275-TAs (12, 27). Regarding speciﬁcity, mayor differ-
ences in the capacity to use the amine donors were noticed, although all of them
were characterized by an ample amine spectrum (
Fig. 1). Only 4 of 14 amine donors
were converted by all 10 /H9275-TAs, including ( S)-(/H11001)-2-aminononane and the bulky
amines 1-methyl-3-phenylpropylamine, 1-(4-triﬂuoromethylphenyl)ethylamine, and
1-(4-methoxyphenyl)ethanamine, which were among the preferred amines in most
cases. The other 10 amines were distinctly converted, highlighting the following
major differences in the capacity to convert bulky amines. TR
1 was the only one
using 1-(2-pyridyl)ethylamine and 2-methyl-1-phenylpropan-1-amine as amine do-
nors; the capacity to use these bulky amines contrasts with the low capacity of TR
1
to use bulky ketones as acceptors (Fig. 1). To date, only a few (S)-selective /H9275-TAs,
but not (R)-selective ones, have been identiﬁed as being capable of accepting a
propyl group of amine substrates in the so-called S pocket ( 28). The fact that
TR1, which converts ( R) and (S) amines (see below), was capable of using as an
amine donor 2-methyl-1-phenylpropan-1-amine, which contains an isopropyl
group, is thus an unusual feature for this enzyme. Benzylamine and ( S)-(/H11002)-
/H9251-
methylbenzylamine were the only donor substrates for TR 1 and TR 2,( S)-1-(4-
nitrophenyl)ethylamine was not accepted by TR9 and TR10, and 1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-
1-naphthylamine was not converted by TR8. Concerning the use of aliphatic amines,
we found that larger amines were preferred. Indeed, all of the /H9275-TAs converted
(S)-(/H11001)-2-aminononane, but only 3 (TR3,T R5, and TR7) of 10 converted the shorter
(S)-(/H11001)-2-aminohexane. It was particularly noticeable that all but TR1,T R9, and TR10
were capable of using isopropyl amine as a donor substrate, although it was not the
preferred donor (Fig. 1).
In agreement with their high sequence identity (Table S2A), TR9 and TR10 showed
similar donor proﬁles. TR3 and TR7 (99% identical) were capable of using 10 amine
donors, with a notable difference in their capacity to convert 1-(4-methoxyphenyl)-
ethanamine, which was not converted by TR
3 but was one of the preferred donors
for TR7 (relative activity of 96%). Finally, the 94.5% identical TR4 and TR5 converted
10 amines, with major differences only noticed in the conversion of ( S)-(/H11001)-2-
aminohexane, which was not converted by TR4 but was one of the preferred donors for
TR5 (relative activity of 80.3%).
Sequence similarity and GNN analysis.Sequence similarity network (SSN) analysis
of the TR1 to TR10 sequences was performed with the aminotransferase class III
collection of the InterPro database (IPR005814; 55,400 entries). The network is shown
in
Fig. 2A and B, where each node represents entries with 60% or higher sequence
similarity and the lengths of the edges correlate with the dissimilarity of the connected
sequences represented by the nodes (organic layout). Although the pairwise amino
acid sequence identities between the 10 selected sequences ranged from circa 33% to
99%, they were all located in a central color cluster. A secondary SSN built from the ﬁrst
500 BLAST hits against each sequence query (Fig. S4A) was used for building a genome
neighborhood network (GNN). Using a window of 5 open reading frames (ORFs)
upstream and downstream from the candidate TR
1 to TR10 genes, the genomic context
of each of the target sequences was inferred.
The GNN for the TR2,T R9, and TR10 cluster is shown in Fig. S4B. The GNN was highly
homogenous with regard to the ORF architecture (Fig. 2C), consisting of a putrescine-
binding periplasmic protein (PotF), a spermidine/putrescine import ATP-binding pro-
tein (PotA), a putrescine transport permease, a Gln-synt_C (glutamine synthetase

catalytic domain) that is likely to act as a gamma-glutamyl-putrescine synthetase, which
ligates glutamate and putrescine, and an aminotransferase (Fig. 2C). Together, TR2,T R9,
and TR10 might be involved in the catabolism of polyamines, more speciﬁcally pu-
trescine (Fig. 3). The GNN for the TR6 cluster (Fig. S4B) and the ORF architecture (Fig. 2C)
revealed that, despite the pattern variations, the same elements are present: the
FIG 2 Genomic context analysis. (A) Sequence similarity network (SSN) analysis of transaminase family III (InterPro
entry IPR005814) generated using the UniRef90 database with an E value of 10e/H1100270. The nodes containing the 500
BLAST hits to the different TR candidates are in color (red for TR2,T R6,T R9, and TR10, green for TR1, and blue for
TR3,T R4,T R5,T R7, and TR8). These three clusters segregate completely with an E value of 10e/H11002100. (B) Enlargements

most common gene architectures for the three clusters are shown with Pfam annotations. Note that the color code

transporter proteins, Gln-synt_C, the aminotransferase, and an oxidase mostly related
to glycine/D-amino acid oxidase or gamma-glutamyl-putrescine oxidoreductase. In
summary, TR2,T R6,T R9, and TR10 seem to be related to putrescine catabolism (Fig. S4D).
In this pathway, the only transaminase occurs after obtaining 4-aminobutanoate (also
known as GABA), which serves as the substrate for the transaminase (Fig. S4C).
However, it is plausible that putrescine can also be a direct substrate for the trans-
aminase; this is an alternative catabolic pathway that generates glutamate and
4-aminobutanal that is further oxidized to GABA (
Fig. 3).
The GNN clusters (Fig. S4B) and genomic contexts (Fig. 2C) for the other transami-
nases (TR1,T R3 to TR5,T R7, and TR8) do show many common elements, but there are
also signiﬁcant variations. The major difference is that genes encoding both the
putrescine-ABC transporter system and the glutamate:putrescine ligase are missing,
but others are present in the vicinity, including genes for an aldehyde dehydroge-
nase family protein (Aldedh), anaminotransferase 3, and another type of transporter

(amino acid permease). The SSN analysis suggests that most entries corresponding to
Aldedh are annotated as 5-carboxymethyl-2-hydroxymuconate dehydrogenase (ty-
rosine metabolism), betaine-aldehyde dehydrogenase (glycine, serine, and threonine
metabolism), succinate-semialdehyde dehydrogenase (putrescine and GABA degrada-
tion), gamma-glutamyl-gamma-aminobutyraldehyde dehydrogenase (putrescine ca-
tabolism), methylmalonate-semialdehyde dehydrogenase (inositol metabolism, valine,
leucine, and isoleucine degradation and propionate metabolism), or phenylacetalde-
hyde dehydrogenase (phenylalanine metabolism). Together, we may suggest that
these transaminase genes are related to amino acid catabolism but not putrescine
catabolism, because of the absence of an ABC transporter and Gln-synt_C. However, the
possibility that these genes are implicated in the catabolism of putrescine cannot be
ruled out: the transport is through a permease different from the ABC type, and the two
aminotransferases and the Aldedh are related to the catabolism of putrescine via
4-aminobutanal and GABA.
Based on the SSN and GNN analyses, the roles of TR
1 to TR10 in vivoin the catabolism
of putrescine may be investigated. Potential substrates may be putrescine and GABA.
They were tested as amine donors using benzaldehyde as the acceptor. The progress
of the reaction was followed by measuring the amount of benzaldehyde remaining at
the end of the reaction (see Materials and Methods and Scheme S2) and by ESI-MS (see
Materials and Methods), respectively.
The data provided in
Table 1conﬁrmed that TR1,T R2,T R6,T R9, and TR10 are capable
of using putrescine as an amine donor when using benzaldehyde as the acceptor. None
of the enzymes converted GABA. This suggests their implicationin vivo in putrescine
catabolism via the formation of 4-aminobutanal (
Fig. 3). In contrast, TR3 to TR5,T R7, and
TR8 did not use putrescine or GABA as an amine donor (Table 1), so it is most likely that
they may participate in the catabolism of polyamines other than putrescine. Overall, the
results agree with the SSN and GNN results.
Evaluation of enantioselectivity. The selectivity toward chiral amines was ﬁrst
determined by means of the selectivity factor, calculated as the ratio of speciﬁc
activities (U g
/H110021) of the preferred over the nonpreferred chiral amines when both (R)
and (S) amines were tested separately (see Scheme S3). It should be mentioned that
these apparent values may not correspond to true selectivity or enantiomeric
factors calculated when the enzyme is confronted with a racemic mixture, because
the rates of transamination of the enantiomers were measured separately; never-
theless, recent studies for other classes of enzymes have clearlydemonstrated that
apparent and true selectivity values closely match each other (
29). Brieﬂy, the speciﬁc
activities for (S)-(/H11001)-2-aminohexane, (R)-(/H11002)-2-aminohexane, (S)-(/H11001)-2-aminononane,
(R)-(/H11002)-2-aminononane, ( S)-(/H11002)-/H9251-methylbenzylamine, ( R)-(/H11001)-/H9251-methylbenzylamine,
(S)-1-(4-nitrophenyl)ethylamine, and (R)-1-(4-nitrophenyl)ethylamine were determined
by applying a colorimetric assay in which benzaldehyde was used as the amine
acceptor, as described above.

As shown by the results in Fig. 1 and Table 2, we found that under our assay
conditions, 6 /H9275-TAs were stringently (S) selective, with no appreciable activity for any
of the (R) amines tested. TR2,T R6,T R9, and TR10 were capable of converting both (R) and
(S) enantiomers of 2-aminononane, with the (S) enantiomer being preferred (Fig. 1).
For these 4/H9275-TAs, the selectivity factors, calculated as the ratio of speciﬁc activities (U
g/H110021) of the preferred [( S)-(/H11001)-2-aminononane] over the nonpreferred [( R)-(/H11002)-2-
aminononane] chiral amine, ranged from /H110111.2 to 5.4 (Table 2). The selectivity, as
calculated by kinetic resolution and asymmetric synthesis and gas chromatography (see
Scheme S3 and Fig. S5), also conﬁrm the results of the colorimetric assays (
Table 2).
It has previously been demonstrated that cosolvents (i.e., 30% dimethyl sulfoxide
[DMSO]) can change the selectivity of /H9275-TAs (13). For this reason, the apparent
selectivity factors for TR2,T R6,T R9, and TR10 were evaluated by colorimetric assays in
the presence of 30% DMSO, a concentration at which the enzymes retain more than
67% of their activity (see below). No statistically signiﬁcant changes in apparent
selectivity factors were observed against (S)- and (R)-2-aminononane (data not shown).
Optimal parameters for activity.Using benzaldehyde and 2-(4-nitrophenyl)ethan-
1-amine as the acceptor and donor, respectively, the puriﬁed
/H9275-TAs were found to be
most active at temperatures ranging from 45 to 65°C (Fig. 4). TR3,T R6,T R7, and TR8 were
the most active at the high temperature range (60 to 65°C). A tolerance for organic
solvents increases the industrial utility of enzymes. The amination of benzaldehyde with
2-(4-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-amine was tested at different concentrations (from 5% to 50%
[vol/vol]) of water-miscible solvents, namely, methanol, acetonitrile, DMSO, dimethyl
acetamide (DMA), isopropanol, and acetone (
Fig. 5). TR2,T R4,T R5, and TR10 were most
active in the presence of acetone (from 45.0 to 51.7% relative activity at 50% acetone),
and TR3,T R6,T R7, and TR9 were most active in the presence of DMSO (circa 100%, 42%,
63%, and 44% relative activity at 50% DMSO). TR8 retained more than 59% relative
activity in the presence of DMA, DMSO, and isopropanol at 50% each.
Molecular determinants of substrate speciﬁcity.The extensive analysis of the
substrate spectra showed a number of differences (Fig. 1), possibly a reﬂection of the
divergence in steric constraints and active-site architecture, which may help to better
understand the speciﬁcity and stereochemistry of the
/H9275-TAs herein investigated.

An extensive analysis of the key active-site residues determining the substrate
speciﬁcity in previously reported/H9275-TAs (30) through multiple sequence alignments and
three-dimensional structural models (Fig. S6 to S10) was performed. This analysis was
done in relation to substrate speciﬁcity data (
Fig. 1). We ﬁrst found that residues
previously suggested to play a role in substrate recognition (Fig. S7) (30) may not have
a role in determining the substrate spectra and preference for bulky substrates in the
10
/H9275-TAs herein described (see Supporting Results in the supplemental material).
Rather, most likely, a major molecular determinant of the capacity of class III/H9275-TAs
herein described to use bulky ketones as acceptors is the presence of a hairpin region
proximal to the highly conserved Arg414 (following the numeration in the
/H9275-TA from
Pseudomonas putida [PDB 3A8U]) (Fig. 6), an extensively characterized /H9275-TA whose
X-ray structure has been determined (30). This hairpin region is present in TR2 to TR10
but not TR1 nor the PDB3A8U sequence (Fig. 7). We hypothesize that the presence of
this hairpin, the residues comprising it (Fig. 7), and the nature of 3 amino acids in its
proximity play arole in determining the orientation of the conserved Arg414 and the
access to and positioning of bulkier ketones in relation to the L pocket to an extent
greater than that previously thought for the conserved Arg414 (
30). This can be
seen by the results in Fig. 7 and, in more detail, in Fig. S8. In addition to this, as
shown in Supporting Results and Fig. S7 and S10 in the supplemental material, most
likely the positioning of the conserved Ser231 (following the numeration in the
/H9275-TA with PDB 3A8U) may additionally play a role in the capacity of class III/H9275-TAs to
use amines with longer alkyl substituents, to a greater extent than previously thought
(
27).
TR2,T R6,T R9, and TR10 were the only class III /H9275-TAs herein reported that were
capable of converting (R) amines, although their low selectivity cannot give access to
highly optically pure amines. In order to increase the possibility of designing (R)-
selective variants, an inspection of the literature was ﬁrst undertaken. Note that
(R)-selective amine transaminases have been only reported within the PLP-dependent
fold class IV
/H9275-TAs, which were found by applyingin silicomining approaches (28, 29).
Sequence alignment of the TR1 to TR10 sequences with sequences of (R)-selective
PLP-dependent fold class IV proteins (28) revealed that the conserved residues impli-
cated in the recognition of (R) amines in class IV/H9275-TAs were found in the class III/H9275-TAs
herein reported (Fig. S11). This suggests that residues other than those reported for

and 2-(4-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-amine were used as the acceptor and donor, respectively. Full data sets are
given in Table S2D.

class IV/H9275-TAs are determining the capacity of class III/H9275-TAs to convert (R) amines. The
analysis of sequence alignments and three-dimensional models revealed that TR2,T R6,
TR9, and TR10, in contrast to the other class III/H9275-TAs herein reported, have in common
the presence of a large pocket volume, the presence of a hairpin region close to the
conserved Arg414, and an outward orientation of Arg414 (
Fig. 7; Fig. S6 to S8). We
suggest that, those structural elements aside, others yet to be determined may be
responsible for the capacity of both enantiomers to be positioned in the active sites of
FIG 5 Solvent resistance proﬁles for puriﬁed class III/H9275-TAs. The data represent the relative percentages
of speciﬁc activity at pH 7.5, expressed as U g/H110021, compared with the maximum activity when benzal-
dehyde and 2-(4-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-amine were used as the acceptor and donor, respectively. Full data
sets are given in Table S2E.

TR2,T R6,T R9, and TR10 and, thus, determine the capacity of such enzymes to convert
(R) amines.
DISCUSSION
In this study, we adapted two high-throughput screening methods to identify 10
class III/H9275-TA family proteins. The identiﬁed/H9275-TAs originated from bacteria from at least
FIG 6Conservation of the highly conversed Arg414 residue (bold and underlined) examined by multiple sequence

FIG 7 Structural investigation of the class III/H9275-TAs to elucidate the positioning of the hairpin region, located close to a highly conserved arginine (Arg414 in
the /H9275-TA fromP. putida[PDB 3A8U], as the reference); the orientation of the conserved arginine is also shown. Arg414 is located in a small hairpin (red) in the
middle of a coil delimited by the two helices, one being shown. Only the region in the proximity of the conversed arginine is represented, with initial and end
residues indicated in parentheses. The region present in TR2 to TR10 (and also in PDB 3A8U [not shown in the ﬁgure]), but not in TR1, is shown in red. Three
additional residues located in the proximity of this region, which were found to play a role in determining the access to the L pocket (see Supporting Results),
are shown in green. Although the modeling does not give an exact orientation of the Arg414 side chain, the presence of the hairpin and the residues located
in its proximity seem to play a role in its orientation and also in the access to the active site, as can be seen in detail in Fig. S8. The PDB codes of templates
used to create the models are shown in Fig. S7 and S8. (Top) The class III/H9275-TAs capable of degrading putrescine, with TR2,T R6,T R9, and TR10 containing

arginine differs signiﬁcantly among the groups of class III/H9275-TAs.

four different and divergent lineages: thePseudomonas, Acidihalobacter, andAmphritea
genera and theRhodobacteraceae family. /H9275-TAs from thePseudomonas genus (31) and
Rhodobacteraceae family (32, 33) have been reported previously. However, this study
examines /H9275-TAs derived from bacteria of theAmphritea (TR8) andAcidihalobacter (TR2)
genera, which are bacterial groups rarely investigated from an enzymatic point of view
(
34, 35). Our results suggest that the class III/H9275-TA (TR8) from the bacterium of the
Amphritea genus is thermoactive (up to 65°C) and stable (it retained more than 35%
activity in methanol, acetonitrile, and DMSO, each at a concentration of 50% [vol/vol])
and efﬁciently converts bulky substrates and (S) amines. The enzyme from the bacte-
rium of theAcidihalobacter genus was capable of accepting bulky substrates as well as
(R) and (S) amines. These features clearly suggest that those transaminases and their
bacterial origins should be considered for chemical transformations in the future.
Particularly noticeable was the high level of performance with ketones in compar-
ison to the results using aldehydes and keto acids, with speciﬁc activities for ketones
being up to 173.4% relative to those of the best-accepted aldehyde and keto acid
substrates. Such a preference for ketones is rarely observed for other native or engi-
neered
/H9275-TAs (8–10), which exempliﬁes the potential of bioprospecting programs to
identify new enzymes for the amination of bulky ketones. Molecular determinants for
this unusual speciﬁcity for bulky ketones were found and suggested, including a hairpin
region proximal to the highly conserved Arg414 and residues in its proximity (
Fig. 7)a s
a major determinant of the preference for bulky ketones and amines. Identifying
transaminases containing this hairpin and applying rational or traditional protein
engineering in the region may allow class III
/H9275-TAs capable of converting bulky ketones
and bulky amines to be designed. The conserved Ser231 was also found to be a major
determinant of the preference for amines with longer alkyl substituents (Fig. S7).
The present study also reported 6 class III
/H9275-TAs with a stringent (S) enantioselec-
tivity. This is a common feature within most transaminases, such as the/H9275-TAs belong-
ing to PLP type I fold, which are all speciﬁc toward the ( S) enantiomer of their
substrates. This also accounts for class III/H9275-TAs (30). Interestingly, we also reported four
ATAs capable of acting toward (S) and (R) amines, with the (S) enantiomer being
preferred. Note that both (S)- and (R)-selective /H9275-TAs have been found in distantly
related families other than class III/H9275-TAs, namely those belonging to Pfam class IV
transaminases with a PLP type IV fold ( 28, 36–40). Compared to the (S)-selective
enzymes, the (R)-selective counterparts are less abundant and have been less studied.
All (R)-speciﬁc class IV/H9275-TAs preferentially convert aliphatic substrates with high yields
and high enantioselectivities [enantiomeric excess (ee) higher than 90% for (R) enan-
tiomers], but the yields are signiﬁcantly lower with aromatic substrates. Recently, the
introduction of 27 mutations into a fold IV ATA allowed the substrate scope toward
bulky substrates to be broadened (
29). Therefore, four of the enzymes herein reported
represent examples of the class III/H9275-TA family converting (R) amines, although they also
convert (S) amines. Having a class III/H9275-TA acting toward (S) and (R) amines with low
selectivity toward the latter may be more of a disadvantage than an advantage, as they
cannot give access to highly optically pure amines. Although they are not (R) selective,
the capacity to act efﬁciently toward (R) amines can be used as a starting point to apply
rational design and protein engineering to design ( R)-selective variants from the
naturally occurring class III
/H9275-TAs identiﬁed herein and, possibly, others. This study
suggests a number of molecular determinants which may help in the rational design of
such enzymes. These determinants include a large active-site pocket, the presence of
a hairpin region close to the conserved Arg414, and the outward orientation of Arg414
(
Fig. 7). Improving or even reversing the selectivity by single point mutations has also
been shown by recent examples in other classes of/H9275-TA (11, 13), although engineering
has been shown to lead to variants with low selectivity and it is not a universal effect
for all substrates (
11).
Taken together, this study reported examples of class III/H9275-TAs efﬁciently converting
not only bulky ketones with stringent (S) stereochemistry but also one converting bulky
ketones and bulky amines with a large alkyl substituent and a number converting bulky
Coscolín et al. Applied and Environmental Microbiology

ketones and both (R) and (S) amines. Four enzymes additionally retained signiﬁcant
activity up to 60 to 65°C, and ﬁve were stable in concentrations of up to 50% (vol/vol)
of organic solvents. Altogether, the amine transaminases herein reported display
biochemical properties that make them attractive candidates for a variety of chemical
conversions and suggest future actions to design (R)-selective class III
/H9275-TAs.
The characterization of the 10 class III /H9275-TAs herein described also allows their
participation in polyamine catabolism, namely that of putrescine, a ubiquitous and
important biological molecule (
41), to be increased. We found that class III/H9275-TAs that
contained the highly conserved Arg414 in an outward conformation (TR2,T R6,T R9, and
TR10)( Fig. 7) were capable of degrading putrescine via the formation of 4-aminobutanal
(Fig. 3). In the opposite case, class III /H9275-TAs in which Arg414 was in the inward
conformation (TR3 to TR5,T R7, and TR8)( Fig. 7) were not able to degrade putrescine. TR1
was also capable of degrading putrescine. Its sequence differs from those of TR2 to TR10
by the absence of a hairpin region proximal to Arg414 (Fig. 7), causing an inward
conﬁguration of this residue, which is slightly differently oriented than those in TR3 to
TR5,T R7, and TR8. Therefore, the orientation of the highly conserved Arg414 may be
used not only as an indicator of the capacity of class III/H9275-TAs to degrade bulky ketones,
bulky amines, and (R) and (S) amines but also as an indicator of the capacity to degrade
putrescine. Note that in previously reported class III/H9275-TAs, the conserved Arg414 has
also been shown to adopt different conformations, inward or outward ( 30). This
orientation has been implicated in the recognition of carboxylate groups of keto acids
and in determining the size of the large pocket (
27). However, no environmental
implication was suggested for the different orientations of the conserved Arg414. In
this study, we found that the different orientations of the conserved Arg414 cannot,per
se, be directly linked to the distinct capacity to convert keto acids over ketones, as was
previously suggested (
27, 30), since enzymes in which Arg414 is similarly oriented show
marked differences in substrate preference and their capacity to use keto acids (Fig. 1).
Rather, we found that the orientation can be linked to the capacity to degrade
environmentally important biological polyamines (
41), such as putrescine, as shown in
this study (Fig. 3).
MATERIALS AND METHODS
General experimental procedures.All chemicals used for enzymatic tests were of the purest grade
available and were purchased from Fluka-Aldrich-Sigma Chemical Co. (St. Louis, MO, USA).E. colistrains
MC1061, a generous gift from Eric Geertsma, and DH5/H9251were used for expressing TR1 to TR10.
Naive screens.The fosmid libraries used in the present study derived from 9 geographically distinct
marine samples. They include samples from Port of Milazzo and Port of Messina (Sicily, Italy) (16, 18, 42),
the Ancona harbor (Ancona, Italy), with uric acid and ammonium amendments (17), the Priolo Gargallo
harbor (Syracuse, Italy) (18), the Arenzano harbor (Ligurian Sea, Genoa, Italy) (18), an acidic beach pool
on Vulcano Island (Italy) (18, 42), the El Max site (Alexandria, Egypt) (18), Bizerte Lagoon (Tunisia) (18), and
the Gulf of Aqaba (Red Sea, Jordan) (18). In all cases, DNA extraction and preparation of pCCFOS1 fosmid
libraries were performed as described elsewhere (16, 18, 42). A genomic library ofP. oleovorans strain
DSM 1045 was constructed as described previously (43), with minor modiﬁcations. Brieﬂy, genomic DNA
of P. oleovoransDSM 1045 was isolated and fragmented by sonication, and appropriately sized fragments
were then collected by gel extraction and end repaired (44). 5=-End phosphates were removed by using
alkaline phosphatase (FastAP; Thermo Scientiﬁc) followed by DNA precipitation. 3=-End adenine over-
hangs were added by usingTaq polymerase and cloned into the pCR-XL-TOPO vector according to the
manufacturer’s recommendations (TOPO XL PCR cloning kit; Invitrogen). The recombinant plasmids were
then transformed intoE. coli TOP10 cells by electroporation.
Clones were scored for their ability to perform transamination reactions by adapting a colorimetric
assay (
14). Brieﬂy, the method is based on the use of 2-(4-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-amine as an amine donor
that when converted into the corresponding aldehyde and subsequently deprotonated would give a
highly conjugated structure with absorbance in the UV region and an orange/red precipitate. Fosmid
clones were plated onto large (22.5- by 22.5-cm) petri plates with Luria-Bertani (LB) agar containing
chloramphenicol (12.5
/H9262gm l/H110021) and induction solution (Epicentre Biotechnologies, Madison, WI, USA) in
an amount recommended by the supplier to induce a high fosmid copy number. After overnight
incubation at 37°C, the plates were overlaid with 40 ml of a solution of K
2HPO4 buffer, pH 7.5 (100 mM),
containing 0.4% (wt/vol) agar, to which the following chemicals were added immediately prior to use:
PLP (10 mg, or 1.0 mM ﬁnal concentration), the amine donor 2-(4-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-amine (202.64 mg,
or 25 mM ﬁnal concentration), and benzaldehyde (106.12 mg, or 25 mM ﬁnal concentration) as the
aldehyde acceptor. Note that the method can be adapted to any other ketone or aldehyde. Positive
colonies in agar plates change to an orange/red color in 20 to 30 min when the colonies are overlaid with

the screening solution. Screens were also performed witho-xylylenediamine hydrochloride as the amine
donor by adapting a colorimetric assay (15). Brieﬂy, clones were plated on LB agar containing 12.5/H9262g
ml/H110021 chloramphenicol (for screening the clone library from environmental sources) or 50 /H9262gm l/H110021
kanamycin (for screening theP. oleovoransclone library). After overnight incubation at 37°C, clones were
transferred to Whatman paper. A drop of reaction solution containing 5 mMo-xylylenediamine hydro-
chloride and 2.02 mM PLP in 100 mM K2HPO4 buffer, pH 8.0, was placed in the lid of a petri dish and
covered with the colony-bearing Whatman paper. After the petri dish was sealed to prevent drying of the
reaction solution, the plate was incubated at 30°C overnight. Positive clones with transaminase activity
were identiﬁed by black coloration.
Positive clones containing presumptive transaminases were selected, and their DNA inserts were
sequenced using a MiSeq sequencing system (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA) with a 2/H11003150-bp sequenc-
ing kit. Upon completion of sequencing, the reads were quality ﬁltered and assembled to generate
nonredundant metasequences, and genes were predicted and annotated as described previously (
45).
The sequences of the inserts of the plasmids containing TR9 and TR10 genes were obtained from P.
oleovorans genome data (46) after terminal sequencing of the plasmid insert (LGC Genomics GmbH,
Berlin, Germany).
Gene expression.Two expression platforms were used. Codon-optimized synthetic versions of the
TR1 and TR3 to TR8 candidate genes were synthesized by GenScript (Hong Kong) and delivered in a
customized pUC plasmid. These constructs were dissolved in sterile water upon arrival and used as
delivery plasmid for subcloning by fragment exchange (FX) into expression vector pBXCH or pBXNH3
using E. coliMC1061 as a host (
24, 47). Candidate genes for TR2,T R9, and TR10 were ampliﬁed from clonal
DNA using gene-speciﬁc primers containing overhangs with restriction sites (NdeI/XhoI for TR2 and
NdeI/HindIII for TR9 and TR10) and cloned into expression vector pRhokHi-2 usingE. coliMC1061 as the
host (25).
Recombinant protein puriﬁcation. All recombinant proteins were expressed with His tags and
puriﬁed as follows. Brieﬂy, selectedE. coli clones that were found to convert the screening substrates
were grown at 37°C on solid LB agar medium supplemented with the appropriate antibiotics (100/H9262g
ml/H110021 ampicillin for pBXCH or pBXNH3 or 30/H9262gm l/H110021 kanamycin for pRhokHi-2). Single colonies were
picked and used to inoculate 10 ml of LB broth supplemented with the appropriate antibiotic in a
0.25-liter ﬂask. The cultures were then incubated at 37°C and 200 rpm overnight. Afterwards, 10 ml of this
culture was used to inoculate 0.5 liter of LB medium plus antibiotic, which was then incubated to an
optical density at 600 nm (OD
600) of approximately 0.7 (ranging from 0.55 to 0.75) at 37°C. The expression
of TR1 and TR3 to TR8 was induced by addingL-arabinose to a ﬁnal concentration of 0.1%, followed by
incubation for 16 h at 16°C. TR2,T R9, and TR10 were constitutively expressed using the same conditions
(no inductor needed). In all cases, the cells were harvested by centrifugation at 5,000/H11003g for 15 min to
yield a pellet of 2 to 3 g (wet weight). The wet cell pellet was frozen at/H1100286°C overnight, thawed, and
resuspended in 15 ml of 40 mM 4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazineethanesulfonic acid (HEPES), pH 7.0.
Lysonase bioprocessing reagent (Novagen, Darmstadt, Germany) was added (4
/H9262lg /H110021 wet cells) and cells
incubated for 60 min on ice with rotation. The cell suspension was sonicated for a total of 5 min and
centrifuged at 15,000/H11003g for 15 min at 4°C, and the supernatant was retained. The soluble His-tagged
proteins were puriﬁed at 4°C after binding to Ni-NTA His-Bind resin (Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis, MO,
USA), followed by extensive dialysis of the protein solutions against 100 mM K
2HPO4 buffer, pH 7.5, by
ultraﬁltration through low-adsorption, hydrophilic, 10,000 (10K)-nominal-molecular-weight-cutoff mem-
branes (regenerated cellulose, Amicon) and storage at 4°C. The proteins were further puriﬁed by gel
ﬁltration as described previously (
48). Purity was assessed as/H1102298% using SDS-PAGE analysis (49)i na
Mini-PROTEAN electrophoresis system (Bio-Rad). The protein concentration was determined according to
the Bradford method with bovine serum albumin as the standard (
50).
Enzyme assays for determinations of acceptor substrates.Transaminase activity was assayed
using 2-(4-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-amine and structurally diverse keto acids, aldehydes, and ketones in
96-well plates as previously described with some modiﬁcations (
14). Note that K2HPO4 buffer was used,
following recommendations described elsewhere (11, 14, 28). Brieﬂy, assay reactions were conducted as
follows. Prior to the assay, a solution of 25 mM amine donor 2-(4-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-amine and 1.0 mM
cofactor PLP was ﬁrst prepared in 100 mM K
2HPO4 buffer, pH 7.5 (40 ml). A 400 mM acceptor (keto acid,
aldehyde, or ketone) stock solution was prepared in acetonitrile or buffer, depending on solubility.
Reaction assays, in 96-well microtiter plates, were started by adding 2.5
/H9262l of a protein solution (stock
solution, 10.0 mg/ml in 100 mM K2HPO4 buffer, pH 7.5) to an assay mixture containing 185 /H9262lo f
PLP–2-(4-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-amine solution and 12.5/H9262l of acceptor stock solution. The ﬁnal volume of
the assay mixture was 200/H9262l, and the amine donor and acceptor concentrations were 25 mM each. All
measurements were performed in triplicates at 40°C in a microplate reader at 600 nm (Synergy HT
multimode microplate reader; BioTek) in continuous mode for a total time of 180 min. Speciﬁc activities
( i nUg
/H110021 protein) were determined. One unit (U) of enzyme activity was deﬁned as the amount of protein
required to transform 1/H9262mol of substrate in 1 min under the assay conditions using a reaction product
extinction coefﬁcient (aldehyde 4 in reference14) of 537 M/H110021 cm/H110021 at 600 nm, as determined experi-
mentally. All values were corrected for nonenzymatic transformation (background rate).
Enzyme assays for determination of amine substrates, including enantiopure amines.Transam-
inase activity was assayed using benzaldehyde as the acceptor and structurally diverse amines in 96-well
plates. Any other aldehyde, ketone, or keto acid may be used instead of benzaldehyde. Prior to the assay,
a solution of 25 mM benzaldehyde as the acceptor and 1.0 mM PLP as the cofactor was ﬁrst prepared in
100 mM K
2HPO4 buffer, pH 7.5 (40 ml). Then, a stock solution of each amine was prepared in acetonitrile
or buffer, depending on the solubility. Reaction assays, in 96-well microtiter plates, were started by
Coscolín et al. Applied and Environmental Microbiology
January 2019 Volume 85 Issue 2 e02404-18 aem.asm.org 16
adding 2.5/H9262l of a protein solution (stock solution, 10.0 mg/ml in 100 mM K2HPO4 buffer, pH 7.5) to an
assay mixture containing 185/H9262l of PLP-benzaldehyde solution and 12.5/H9262l of amine stock solution. The
ﬁnal volume of the assay mixture was 200/H9262l, and the amine donor and acceptor concentrations were
25 mM each. Reactions were allowed to proceed for 60 min at 40°C, during which time the amount of
benzaldehyde remaining (not reacting with the amines) was determined every 5 min by adding 12.5
/H9262l
of a stock solution of the amine 2-(4-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-amine (400 mM in 100 mM K2HPO4 buffer, pH
7.5). After adding 2-(4-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-amine, the reaction was allowed to proceed for 10 min and
absorbance due to the appearance of orange/red color was recorded continuously in a microplate reader
at 600 nm (Synergy HT multimode microplate reader; BioTek). Lower absorbance values imply higher
consumption of benzaldehyde and, thus, of the corresponding amines used as donors. Enzyme activity
under the assay conditions was expressed as the amount of enzyme required to transform 1
/H9262mol of
substrate in 1 min under the assay conditions using a reaction product extinction coefﬁcient (aldehyde
4 in reference
14) of 537 M/H110021 cm/H110021 at 600 nm. All values were corrected for nonenzymatic transformation
(background rate) and for the results from a control reaction mixture containing benzaldehyde but not
amines [no transfer reaction occurs, so all of the benzaldehyde reacts with 2-(4-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-
amine].
Mass spectrometry. Conventional mass spectrometry analyses were performed on a hybrid qua-
drupole time-of-ﬂight (Q-TOF) analyzer (QSTAR Pulsar I; AB Sciex, Framingham, MA, USA). Reaction
samples were analyzed by direct infusion and ionized by electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry
(ESI-MS) with methanol as the mobile phase in positive reﬂector mode. High-resolution mass spectrom-
etry (HR-MS) analysis was carried out by ﬂow injection analysis combined with electrospray ionization-
mass spectrometry (FIA-ESI-MS) on an Agilent G6530A accurate-mass Q-TOF liquid chromatography-
mass spectrometry (LC-MS) system (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA). The sample was directly
infused and ionized by ESI in negative reﬂector mode. Ionization was enhanced by JetStream technology,
and the mobile phase was 99.9:0.1 (vol/vol) H
2O–formic acid. Data were processed with MassHunter Data
Acquisition B.05.01 and MassHunter Qualitative Analysis B.07.00 software (Agilent Technologies).
GC analysis for determination of chiral selectivity.Enantioselectivity was evaluated by kinetic
resolution of (R) and (S) amines. Prior to the kinetic resolution assay, a solution of 25 mM benzaldehyde
as the acceptor and 1.0 mM PLP as a cofactor was ﬁrst prepared in 100 mM K2HPO4 buffer, pH 7.5 (40 ml).
A stock solution of a racemic mixture of (R)- and (S)-aminononane at a concentration of 400 mM each in
acetonitrile was prepared. Reaction assays, in 5.0-ml Eppendorf tubes, were started by adding 25/H9262lo fa
protein solution (stock solution, 10.0 mg/ml in 100 mM K2HPO4 buffer, pH 7.5) to an assay mixture
containing 1,850 /H9262l of PLP-benzaldehyde solution and 125/H9262l of racemic (R)-/(S)-aminononane stock
solution. The ﬁnal volume of the assay mixture was 2,000 /H9262l, and the concentrations of ( R)- and
(S)-aminononane and benzaldehyde were 25 mM each. Reactions were allowed to proceed at 40°C for
60 min. Next, the reaction mixture was ﬁltered through an adsorptive, hydrophilic, 3K-nominal-
molecular-weight-cutoff membrane (regenerated cellulose, Amicon) to remove the enzymes. Then, 10
/H9262l
of a stock solution of (R)-2-aminohexane was added as an internal standard to take into consideration
biases due to the extraction procedure, as follows. To 0.2 ml of the reaction mixture, 0.2 ml ethyl acetate
was added, and after vigorous vortexing, the solvent used for GC-MS analysis. The GC system (Agilent
Technologies 7890A) consisted of an autosampler (Agilent Technologies 7693) and an inert MSD (mass
selective detection) instrument with quadrupole (Agilent Technologies 5975). A total of 2
/H9262lo ft h e
sample was injected through a CP-Chirasil-Dex CB GC column (25 m in length, 0.25-mm internal
diameter, 0.25-
/H9262m ﬁlm) (J&W GC columns; Agilent). The ﬂow rate of the helium carrier gas, the split ratio,
and the temperature gradient were optimized for each of the chiral mixes. After each injection, the
column was cleaned up during 2 min at 200°C using a 1.5-ml/min ﬂow rate. The detection of each chiral
compound [(R)- and (S)-aminononane] was performed in single-ion-monitoring (SIM) mode in order to
maximize the sensitivity. The elution order and the target ions were previously validated with a mixture
of standards and the NIST 14 library. The semiquantiﬁcation of (R)- and (S)-aminononanes was performed
using MassHunter Qualitative Analysis software (B.06.00; Agilent), reporting the area for the individual
peaks in arbitrary units, on the basis of which enantiomeric excess and conversion were calculated.
Stereochemistry was also calculated by following the asymmetric synthesis of ( R)- and ( S)-
aminononane. Asymmetric synthesis assays were performed at 40°C for 180 min in 100 mM K
2HPO4
buffer, pH 7.5, containing 1 mM PLP and 25/H9262g pure protein. The reaction mixture contained 25 mM
2-nonane as the acceptor and 25 mM 2-(4-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-amine as the amine donor. The conver-
sion was measured by detection of the formed amines (R)-aminononane and (S)-aminononane by GC
after extraction of the reaction products as described above. The percent-enantiomeric-excess values for
products were analyzed by GC. Note that conversions were not optimized.
Enzyme assays for determinations of optimal parameters for activity.Temperatures between 25
and 70°C were tested to determine the conditions under which each protein displayed maximal activity
in 100 mM K
2HPO4 buffer, pH 7.5. Assays of activity in the presence of a water-miscible solvent were
performed by adding methanol, acetonitrile, dimethyl sulfoxide, dimethyl acetamide, isopropanol, or
acetone at concentrations from 5% to 50% (vol/vol). Benzaldehyde and 2-(4-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-amine
were used as the acceptor and donor, respectively. The standard assay conditions to determine optimal
temperatures and activities in the presence of solvents were as for determinations of acceptor substrates
(see above).
Homology modeling and docking simulations.Homology models were developed using Prime
software from Schrödinger. Prime uses BLAST (with the BLOSUM62 matrix) for homology search and
alignment and reﬁnes the results using the Pfam database and pairwise alignment with ClustalW.
Docking simulations of (S)-(/H11001)-2-aminononane and (R)-(/H11002)-2-aminononane with the structural models

created for each of the class III/H9275-TAs were carried out using the Protein Energy Landscape Exploration
software, which offers one of the best modeling alternatives to map protein-ligand dynamics and
induced ﬁt, as described previously (
48). The substrate was initially positioned in the active site with the
nitrogen atom of the substrate toward the Lys catalytic base. The substrate conformation was set to be
fully ﬂexible in the docking simulations, whereas the protein conformation was not allowed to change.
Genetic enzymology analysis.Sequence similarity networks (SSNs) were generated by using the
Enzyme Function Initiative’s Enzyme Similarity Tool (EFI-EST) (
51). All-vs-all BLAST was performed against
the ﬁrst 500 BLAST hits in UniProt (2018_06) for each query sequence (option A). A negative LogE value
was applied for the initial network generation. The network consists of the nodes representing protein
clusters with/H1102260% sequence identity. The network was visualized in Cytoscape version 3.3.0 (
52), using
the organic layout in which the lengths of the edges correlate with the dissimilarity of the connected
sequences represented by the nodes. The subgroupings in each major cluster were visualized by
gradually increasing the stringency of the LogE ﬁlter of the networks. The ﬁnal network was used to build
genome neighborhood networks (GNNs) in EFI’s Genome Neighborhood Network Tool (EFI-GNT). Initial
default values of a 10-ORF window and 20% cooccurrence were chosen, although the values were
eventually narrowed to a 5-ORF window and 20% cooccurrence. The GNT database uses the updated
UniPro 2018_06 and ENA 136 versions. Accession numbers within relevant Pfam nodes were extracted
and used for building a new SSN using option D. The published functional data were used to determine
the consensus function and substrate preference of each subfamily of protein sequences.
Accession number(s).The sequences were named based on the code TR, which refers to transam-
inase, followed by an arbitrary number representing 1 of the 10 enzymes analyzed. Sequences encoding
the enzymes designated TR1 to TR8 were deposited at the NCBI public database under accession
numbers MF158200, MH588437, MF158202, MF158203, MF158204, MF158205, MF158206, and
MF158207. Sequences encoding TR9 and TR10 are available as part of the genome sequence of P.
oleovorans (accession numbers NZ_NIUB01000001 and NZ_NIUB01000017).
