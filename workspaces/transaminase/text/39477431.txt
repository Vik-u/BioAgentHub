Abstract. Background/Aim: Although it has been reported  
that different molecules are effective in preventing ischemia-
reperfusion (I/R) injury, the most effective treatment is still  
unknown. Materials and Methods: The rats were divided into  
four groups of eight rats each. Group C: 1 ml intraperitoneal  
(IP) isotonic + laparotomy + IP 2 ml isotonic +I/R. Group  
D: 100 μg kg–1/1 ml IP dexmedetomidine + laparotomy + IP  
2 ml isotonic +I/R. Group L: 1 ml IP isotonic + laparotomy  
+ IP levobupivacaine (2.5 mg kg –1/2 ml) +I/R. Group DL:  
100 μg kg –1/1 ml IP dexmedetomidine + laparotomy + IP  
levobupivacaine (2.5 mg kg –1/2 ml) +I/R. Brain, heart, lung,  
and liver tissue samples were collected for histopathological  
examination. Biochemically, levels of aspartate amino  
transaminase, alanine amino transaminase, serum glucose,  
total antioxidant status (TAS), total oxidant status, ischemia  
modified albumin, and malondialdehyde were measured in  
blood samples. Results: Group D mean blood TAS levels were 
found to be statistically significantly higher than those in  
Group C and Group L (p=0.037, p=0.048 respectively).  
Group DL oxidative stress index (OSI) value was found to be  
statistically significantly lower than that of Group C  
(p=0.010). Conclusion: Both dexmedetomidine and  
levobupivacaine demonstrated protective effects in I/R injury. 
When used in combination, the effects of these treatments  
were further enhanced, reaching statistical significance. As  
our literature review found no studies on the combined use of  
dexmedetomidine and levobupivacaine in I/R injury, it is  
anticipated that supporting these results with clinical studies  
may significantly contribute to clinical practice.  
 
Clinically, ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury is a vascular crisis 
with high mortality that frequently occurs after acute  
mesenteric ischemia, shock, and major operations (1). It is  
known that I/R injury develops due to oxidative stress, lipid  
peroxidation, and oxygen-derived free radicals (2). I/R injury  
not only damages the ischemic region but also causes varying 
degrees of damage to other organ systems (3). Although it has 
been reported that different molecules are effective in  
preventing I/R injury, the most effective treatment is still  
unknown (2).  
Dexmedetomidine (Dex) is a highly selective α2-adrenergic 
agonist that has sedative, analgesic, anxiolytic, and  
sympatholytic properties (4). It is frequently used in the  
intensive care units and during perioperative periods as an

anesthetic adjuvant (1). Dex prevents I/R injury by reducing  
the oxidative stress response and suppressing the release of  
inflammatory mediators (5). Some studies demonstrated that  
that Dex has a protective effect on the liver, kidney, brain, and 
retina upon I/R damage (5-7). However, in these studies, there 
were not enough data to simultaneously demonstrate its effects 
on the brain, lung, and liver damage. For this reason, unlike  
other studies, our study examined the effects of Dex in the  
cranial cavity, thorax, and abdomen simultaneously.  
Local anesthetics (LA) are widely used in many surgical  
procedures for the purpose of postoperative analgesia.  
Bupivacaine (B) and levobupivacaine (LVB) are among the  
local anesthetic agents frequently used for this purpose (8).  
LVB is an amide local anesthetic that is the negative  
enantiomer of bupivacaine. Aside from its local anesthetic  
properties, it also has an adrenergic antagonist effect (9). The  
anti-inflammatory effects of LAs have been demonstrated in  
several studies (10, 11). Considering that Dex can prevent I/R 
damage through its anti-inflammatory mechanisms, it is  
hypothesized that LAs, which also possess this property, could 
reduce I/R damage as well. There is a limited number of  
studies on the effects of B on I/R injury whereas there is only  
1 study on the effects of LVB (12-14). In studies on the effects 
on IR injury, B is frequently administered via thoracic epidural 
injection and although its mechanism is not fully known, it  
may be associated with a reduction of organ hypoperfusion  
through the induction of sympathetic preganglionic blockade  
(12, 13, 15). It has also been stated that intraperitoneal (IP)  
application of B in surgery is effective for postoperative  
analgesia (16). However, no studies were found regarding the  
effects of IP bupivacaine administration on I/R injury. In  
addition, it has been reported that LVB is as effective as B  
whilst having a lower risk of cardiac and central nervous  
system toxicity (17). The reason we studied LVB is that  
although there are a few studies on the effect of B on I/R  
injury, there is a lack of studies on LVB, which possesses a  
lower risk of toxicity. Studies demonstrate that LVB and Dex  
can be used safely together while achieving a more effective  
analgesia and anesthesia (18). Therefore, in our study, the  
effects of combined use of Dex and LVB were investigated,  
with the hypothesis that they may be more effective in  
preventing IR damage, as they are thought to provide a  
stronger anti-inflammatory effect when used in combination.  
The primary aim of this study was to reveal the effects of  
Dex and LVB on oxidative stress parameters in I/R injury. The 
secondary aim was to investigate the effects of Dex and LVB  
on blood biochemical parameters indicating organ functions,  
ischemia biomarkers and histopathological organ damage. 
 
Materials and Methods  
 
This study was conducted at the University of Health Science,  
Hamidiye Animal Experiments Laboratory between 03-28 October  
2022 with the approval of the Health Science University,  
Hamidiye Animal Experiments Local Ethics Committee (Approval  
Date/Approval No: 28/07/2022/07-02). A total of 32 Spraque  
Dawley male rats with an average weight of 360±50 grams, 20-24  
weeks of age, were used. Throughout the study, all rats were kept  
in metal cages, with four rats in each cage, in a 12-h light-12-h  
dark environment with normal room temperature (21±2 ˚C) and  
humidity (40-60%). The rats were fed with standard rat chow and  
given tap water. Cage maintenance was carried out regularly with  
daily checks, and all rats were treated humanely during the course  
of the study in accordance with the ‘Guide for the Care and Use  
of Laboratory Animals’. All surgical procedures performed on rats  
were performed under anesthesia. In anesthesia induction,  
Ketamine Hydrochloride (Ketalar ® vial, 50 mg/ml, Eczac ıbaşı, 
Istanbul, Turkey) 80 mg/kg IP and Xylazine Hydrochloride  
(Rompun ® vial, 23.32 mg/ml, Bayer, Istanbul, Turkey) 10 mg/kg  
IP was used.  
The rats were divided into four groups of eight rats each. Group  
C (Control): 1 ml IP isotonic solution + Laparotomy + IP 2 ml  
isotonic solution +I/R. Group D (Dexmedetomidine): 100 μg kg–1/1 
ml IP Dex + Laparotomy + IP 2 ml isotonic solution +I/R. Group L  
(Levobupivacaine): 1 ml IP isotonic solution + Laparotomy + IP LVB 
(2.5 mg kg –1/2 ml) +I/R. Group DL (Dex+LVB): 100 μg kg–1/1 ml 
IP Dex + Laparotomy + IP LVB (2.5 mg kg –1/2 ml) +I/R. 
After 8 h of fasting, the weights of all rats were measured under  
anesthesia and recorded. Vascular access was established from the  
tail vein of all rats with a 26G intravenous cannula under  
anesthesia. Rats were administered 10 ml/kg/h saline infusion  
during the procedure. Three ml IP isotonic solution were  
administered to the rats in Group C, 100 μg kg–1/1 ml IP Dex and  
2 ml isotonic solution to the rats in Group D, 1 ml IP isotonic  
solution and LVB (2.5 mg kg –1/2 ml) to the rats in Group L, and  
100 μg kg –1/1 ml IP Dex and LVB (2.5 mg kg –1/2 ml) to the rats  
in Group DL. A 3 cm long full-thickness abdominal midline  
incision was made 30 min after the administration of IP isotonic  
solution or Dex according to the groups. Immediately after  
laparotomy, 2 ml IP isotonic solution or LVB was administered  
according to the groups as stated above, and the superior  
mesenteric arteries (SMA) of the rats in all groups were dissected  
and closed with a vascular clamp. After 60 min of ischemia, 60 min  
of reperfusion was achieved. Approximately 4-6 ml of blood  
samples were collected  via cardiac puncture for biochemical  
analysis. The rats were sacrificed, and the brain, lung and liver  
tissue samples were taken for histopathological examination.  
 
Biochemical method (Blood). The person performing the blood  
sample tests was blinded to group assignments. Aspartate amino  
transaminase (AST), alanine amino transaminase (ALT) and serum  
glucose in blood samples were measured with an Abbott Architect  
c16000 analyzer (Abbott, Abbott Park, IL, USA). Total antioxidant  
status (TAS) and total oxidant status (TOS) were measured with  
Real Assay Total Antioxidant Status Assay Kit (Mega Medikal,  
Ankara, Turkey) (2). TAS values were calculated as mmol ascorbic  
acid equivalent/l, and TOS values were calculated as μmol H 2O2 
equivalent/l. Oxidative stress index (OSI) was measured using the  
formula:  
OSI (AU)=(TOS μmol/l)/(TAS [mmol Trolox equiv/l] ×100) (19).  
Ischemia modified albumin (IMA) and malondialdehyde (MDA)  
concentrations were determined according to the method described  
by Ertürk et al. (20).

Histopathological examination. Tissue samples stained with  
hematoxylin-eosin were examined under a light microscope. Liver  
histopathological evaluation was performed according to the  
histopathological activity index (HAI) (21). Lung injury was rated  
from 1 (best, Grade 0) to 4 (worst, Grade 3) (22). For brain tissue  
damage, the presence of congestion, necrosis and gliosis was  
evaluated (23). The heart was evaluated semi-quantitatively as no  
damage (0), mild damage (1), moderate damage (2) and severe  
damage (3) according to myocardial damage, edema, inflammatory  
cell infiltration, and loss of striation (24).  
 
Statistical analysis. Analyses were performed using MedCalc  
Statistical Software version 12.7.7 (MedCalc bvba, Ostend, Belgium). 
 
Results 
Mean blood glucose levels in Group L and Group DL were  
found to be statistically significantly higher than those in  
Group C ( p=0.001 and p=0.016, respectively). Mean blood  
creatinine levels in Group L and Group DL were statistically  
significantly higher than those in Group C ( p=0.008, 
p<0.001 respectively). It was also found that Group L mean  
blood AST levels were statistically significantly higher than  
those in Group C ( p=0.031). Group L mean blood IMA  
levels were statistically significantly higher than those in  
Group D ( p=0.001). Blood biochemical parameters and  
ischemia markers of the rats in the groups are shown in  
Table I whereas post-hoc  pairwise comparisons of blood  
biochemical parameters and ischemia markers between the  
groups are shown in Table II.  
Group D mean blood TAS levels were found to be  
statistically significantly higher than those in Group C and  
Group L ( p=0.037 and p=0.048 respectively). Group DL

Since the lung tissue sample of rat C6 was lost during the

calculated. Upon analyzing the histopathology scores of rats  
in the groups, no statistically significant differences were  
observed in terms of mean Liver Histopathology Score  
(LHS), Pulmonary Histopathology Score (PHS), and Heart  
Histopathology Score (HHS) ( p=0.793, p=0.720, and  
p=0.123 respectively). Table V presents the group-wise data

Discussion 
In this study, it was observed that Group L exhibited  
significantly elevated levels of blood glucose, creatinine, and  
AST, whereas Group DL displayed significantly higher levels 
of blood glucose and creatinine when compared to the control 
group. The study revealed that the blood TAS level was  
significantly lower in Group D compared to Group C and  
Group L, whereas the OSI level in Group DL was notably  
lower when compared to Group C. Blood IMA level was found 
to be significantly higher in Group L compared to Group D. 
The results regarding the protective effects of Dex have been 
found to vary depending on the route of administration, time,  
dose and model of ischemia (2). Therefore, the results  
regarding the effects of Dex on I/R injury are controversial and 
new studies are needed. Dex is frequently used in the  
perioperative period. In addition to its effects on the central  
locus coeruleus α2 adrenergic receptors that prevent stress and 
reduce hyperglycemia, Dex also acts on α2 adrenaline  
receptors on peripheral islet tissue cells, inhibiting insulin  
secretion and increasing blood glucose levels. However, the  
ultimate effect of dexmedetomidine on perioperative glucose  
levels is unclear (25, 26). In our study, while the administration 
of Dex resulted in a rise in average blood glucose levels  
compared to the control group, it was determined that this  
increase did not yield a statistically significant difference. The 
results obtained from our study and other studies highlight the 
uncertainty regarding Dex’s final effect on blood glucose level.  
It has been shown that Dex generally reduces blood AST  
and ALT levels (2, 27). In our study, unlike these studies in  
the literature, it was determined that Dex application did not  
cause a statistically significant change in AST and ALT  
levels. It was considered that this difference might be  
attributed to the variations in the I/R model, particularly  
regarding the shorter duration of reperfusion.  
In the literature, while it is stated that Dex has a renal  
protective effect on I/R injury, the exact mechanism of this  
effect has not yet been definitively elucidated. Studies have  
generally shown that it has protective effects on renal  
histopathology without causing any significant change in blood 
urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine levels (Cr) (28-30). In our

study, although the reperfusion period was short, it was  
determined that Dex did not cause a significant change in  
blood BUN and Cr levels, which is consistent with the results  
of other studies (28-30). Some studies reported that Dex  
reduced blood BUN and Cr levels (31, 32). According to the  
results obtained from studies in the literature and our own  
research, it is evident that Dex does not induce changes in  
blood BUN and Cr levels in the early hours of reperfusion but 
reduces them in the later hours; weeks later their levels are  
restored. Therefore, blood BUN and Cr levels may vary  
depending on the duration of ischemia and the degree of injury.  
MDA is the product of lipid peroxidation and is  
considered the most important marker of oxidative stress  
(33). The results of studies in the literature show that the  
effect of Dex on blood MDA levels may vary depending on  
the reperfusion time (31, 33). In our research, consistent with  
the study conducted by Cakir et al.  (31), Dex did not yield  
any statistically significant alterations in blood MDA levels.  
The results of our study as well as of studies in the literature  
demonstrate that the effect of Dex on MDA levels in I/R  
injury varies depending on the ischemia model and duration.  
Therefore, it is thought that the effect of Dex on MDA levels  
can be elucidated by measuring MDA levels in blood  
samples taken at different times with short intervals after I/R.  
IMA is the modified form of albumin, that is formed  
because of its interaction with superoxide radicals caused by  
ischemia and oxidative stress. It is used in the diagnosis of  
many ischemic diseases (30). Studies in the literature  
generally state that Dex has a reducing effect on IMA levels  
(30, 34). In our study, consistent with the results of the study  
conducted by Acar et al.  (30), it was determined that Dex  
administration reduced IMA levels, however the effect was  
not statistically significant. The results of other studies and  
those of our study reveal that Dex has a protective effect by  
reducing blood IMA levels in I/R injury.  
Although studies in the literature have generally reported  
that Dex has a protective effect on organs, its effects on  
biochemical parameters indicating organ functions are  
controversial (2, 31, 32). Our study showed that Dex  
administration caused an increase in blood glucose, BUN, Cr, 
AST, and ALT values, but the change was not statistically  
significant. Therefore, more comprehensive clinical and  
experimental studies are needed to clearly demonstrate the  
effects of Dex on biochemical parameters indicating organ  
functions in I/R injury. Studies in the literature indicate that  
Dex generally reduces MDA and IMA values, which are also  
used as biomarkers in I/R injury, although the decrease varies  
according to the ischemia reperfusion time (30, 34). Likewise,

in our study, it was determined that the average MDA and IMA 
levels decreased in Dex-treated rats, although the decrease was 
not statistically significant. The outcomes of other studies and 
those of our own study suggest that Dex has a protective  
benefit by decreasing IMA and MDA in I/R injury.  
Under normal conditions, free oxygen radicals in the body  
are kept in balance by protective mechanisms. Oxidant  
molecule formation rates and the effectiveness of all  
antioxidant molecules determine the level of oxidative stress.  
Since oxidant and antioxidant molecules have a synergistic  
effect with each other, their separate measurements may be  
insufficient to determine the total intracellular oxidant stress.  
Additionally, these measurements have high costs. Hence,  
due to their ease and practicality, TAS, TOS, and OSI  
(TOS/TAS ratio) are measured for the assessment of  
oxidative stress. OSI is used to determine the oxidant-
antioxidant balance of the body (30, 35). For this reason,  
TAS, TOS and OSI were evaluated in this study. The primary 
aim of our study was to reveal the effects of the agents used  
on TAS, TOS and OSI. Studies in the literature generally  
report that Dex has an oxidative stress-reducing effect (2,  
36). Our study, consistent with the study results in the  
literature, showed that Dex application caused a statistically  
significant increase in TAS level, a slight increase in TOS  
level although not statistically significant, and a decrease in  
OSI that was also not statistically significant.  
The only study in the literature examining the impact of  
LVB on I/R injury was conducted by Kosucu et al. (14), and 
this clinical study employed an intrathecal method. However,  
no studies were found regarding IP application of the LVB  
in I/R injury. Additionally, there is a lack of research on the  
combined use of Dex and LVB. Kosucu et al. (14) reported  
that intrathecal LVB did not reduce blood IMA and MDA  
levels when compared to preoperative values and was  
disadvantageous compared to total intravenous anesthesia. In  
our study, it was found that LVB increased average IMA  
levels and decreased MDA levels, although the change was  
not statistically significant. In addition, it was determined  
that Dex significantly reduced IMA levels compared to LVB.  
However, it did not cause a significant change in MDA  
levels. This result suggests that LVB is disadvantageous  
compared to Dex regarding IMA. Additionally, when LVB  
was used together with Dex, the negative effect of LVB on  
IMA was reduced and no statistically significant difference  
was seen compared to the control group. This result suggests  
that Dex may reduce the negative effect of LVB on IMA. In  
an experimental study conducted by Sarikus et al.  (13), it  
was reported that epidural application of B did not result in  
a significant change in MDA levels in blood samples, but it  
did lead to a statistically significant decrease in blood AST  
and ALT levels. It has been reported that it reduces hepatic  
apoptosis histopathologically. In our study as well, in  
accordance with the results of the aforementioned study,  
LVB did not induce a significant change in blood MDA  
levels. However, contrary to the results of this study, our  
study showed a statistically significant increase in ALT  
levels. It was thought that this difference might arise from  
the fact that B and LVB are different molecules, even though  
they have a similar structure, and the differences in the I/R  
model and duration. Additionally, it was observed that the  
levels of AST and ALT decreased in the rats receiving a  
combination of LVB and Dex compared to the group that  
received LVB alone, whereas there was no statistically  
significant increase in AST levels. This result suggests that  
Dex may reduce the possible negative effects of LVB on  
liver function tests. However, in our study, LVB had no  
negative effect on the liver, either histopathologically or  
regarding the oxidative stress parameters. Therefore, it was  
thought that the most likely reason for the increase in liver  
function parameters in the group using LVB was the  
difference in the I/R model or the difference in the use of B  
and the method of LA application in other studies. Bedirli et 
al. (12) reported that epidurally administered B reduced  
blood MDA levels, histopathological intestinal injury score  
and apoptosis. Since no effect on oxidative stress parameters  
was found in the studies investigating I/R damage of LVB  
and B in the literature, no comparison could be made with  
the oxidative stress parameters in our study. Our primary aim  
was to discuss the effects of I/R injury on oxidative stress  
parameters in the early period. We observed that although  
both Dex and LVB reduced OSI in the early period of I/R  
injury, there was no statistically significant difference.  
However, OSI decreased statistically significantly in the  
group where Dex and LVB were used together. This result  
reveals that the most effective method in reducing oxidative  
stress in I/R injury is the combined use of Dex and LVB.  
Due to the scarcity of research on the impact of B and LVB  
on I/R injury, the ongoing debate surrounding the effects of  
Dex, and the absence of any studies concerning the  
concurrent use of Dex and LVB in our English literature  
review, we conclude that the findings of this study should be  
supported by clinical trials. Supporting our study results with  
clinical trials could contribute significantly to reducing  
patient morbidity/mortality and treatment costs through  
providing an organ-protective effect in cases of I/R injury  
which can cause serious damage.  
In the clinical studies found in the literature, it is  
commonly noted that Dex exhibits cardioprotective effects,  
however Tosun et al.  (37) reported the absence of such  
protective effects (38). The study conducted by Bouwman et 
al. (39) reported that B infusion reduced cardiac infarction  
rates assessed histopathologically. Our study, in line with the  
results of the study mentioned earlier, also found that LVB,  
while not statistically significant, reduced the mean HHS  
values. The results from our study showed that, although not  
statistically significantly, Dex and LVB reduced HHS when  
in vivo 38: 2696-2704 (2024)
2701
used alone. This decrease was found to be greater with Dex.  
Additionally, it was concluded that when DEX and LVB  
were used together, they had no cardioprotective effects  
assessed histopathologically.  
In our literature review, no study was found that explored  
the effects of LVB and B on histopathological lung damage  
following I/R injury. It is reported in the literature that Dex  
has positive effects on lung histopathology in I/R injury (40).  
In contrast to these studies, our study did not observe a  
significant change in the PHS values in the group subjected  
to Dex treatment. Although not statistically significant, it was  
found that LVB reduced mean PHS compared to the control  
group. In our study, it was determined that Dex alone did not  
reduce PHS and LVB alone reduced it slightly. Notably,  
when Dex and LVB were administered together, although the  
statistical significance was not established, a more  
substantial decrease in pulmonary I/R damage was observed  
histopathologically. These results indicated that the Dex-LVB 
combination may have a pulmonary protective effect.  
In the literature, the effects of B on organ damage in I/R  
are controversial (13). A study on the effects of B on the  
liver following I/R injury was conducted by Sarikus et al.  
(13) but new studies are needed on this subject. Sarikus et 
al. (13) reported that epidurally administered B increased  
hepatic damage assessed histopathologically. In our literature  
review, we could not find any studies showing the  
histopathological effects of LVB on liver damage in I/R  
injury. In I/R injury Dex is generally reported to have a  
hepatic protective effect (2, 27). The results obtained in our  
study reveal that, although not statistically significantly, LVB 
reduced the average LHS. Unlike studies in the literature, it  
was determined that Dex alone did not cause a significant  
change in the mean LHS. The results of our study  
demonstrate that, even though statistical significance was not  
established, in I/R injury, LVB has a protective effect on the  
liver whereas Dex has no effect. Additionally, the results  
show that the combined use of Dex and LVB leads to an  
increase in I/R damage in liver tissue. However, these results  
were not supported by oxidative stress parameters.  
 
Conclusion 
 
Based on our results, it was determined that both Dex and  
LVB had protective effects on I/R injury. Particularly, when  
used in combination, these effects were further enhanced and  
reached statistical significance. Considering that the  
combined use of Dex and LVB further increases analgesic  
and anesthetic effectiveness as demonstrated in studies in the  
literature, we conclude that the risk of patient morbidity and  
mortality can also be decreased by reducing I/R damage with  
the combined use of Dex and LVB in major surgical  
interventions where the risk of I/R damage is high. Since no  
studies on the combined use of Dex and LVB in I/R injury  
were found in our literature review, it is anticipated that  
supporting the results of this study with clinical studies may  
substantially contribute to clinical practice.
