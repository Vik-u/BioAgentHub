Abstract: This study investigated the effect of tannic acid (TA), a natural plant-derived polyphenol,
on hepatocyte viability and function, focusing on both hepatoprotective and hepatocurative aspects
within liver failure models. In an in vitro prevention model, the TA-containing group exhibited
1.5-fold and 59-fold higher relative cell viability and albumin synthesis, respectively, in injured
mature hepatocytes (MHs) and 1.14-fold and 1.10-fold higher values in injured small hepatocytes
(SHs), compared with the TA-free group. In the in vitro curative model, the TA-containing group
exhibited 3.25-fold and 113-fold higher relative cell viability and albumin synthesis, respectively, in
injured MHs and 0.36-fold and 3.55-fold higher values in injured SHs, compared with the TA-free
group. In the in vivo disease model, the administration of 300 µL of 1 µg/mL TA significantly
mitigated acute liver failure damage and post-APAP toxicity in mice. This was evident in serum
analysis, where the levels of alanine transaminase, aspartate aminotransferase, and total bilirubin
notably decreased, in agreement with histological observations. The study findings reveal that TA
can enhance hepatic function at specific additive concentrations. Furthermore, even when injured
by APAP , hepatocytes could revert to their preinjury state after additional TA supplementation.
Additionally, pretreating hepatocytes with TA can alleviate subsequent damage. Thus, TA holds
clinical potential in the treatment of APAP-induced liver failure.

1. Introduction
Liver failure, which can be broadly categorized into acute and chronic hepatic failure,
is associated with high mortality rates. Although acute liver failure is rare, it is a severe
syndrome with a high risk of mortality [1]. In developed countries, drug-related problems,
especially acetaminophen (APAP) misuse and abuse, are a major cause of acute liver
failure [2]. Under normal conditions, the metabolism of APAP generates free radicals,
which are typically neutralized by the body’s antioxidant defense system. However,
when this balance is disrupted, these radicals cause oxidative stress, leading to liver cell
injury [3,4]. The mechanism of APAP toxicity involves its liver metabolism, producing
the toxic n-acetyl-p-benzoquinone imine (NAPQI) metabolite. NAPQI, a key driver of
APAP toxicity, swiftly reacts with and depletes glutathione (GSH). In overdose scenarios,
depleted GSH enables excess NAPQI to irreversibly bind to cellular proteins, including
mitochondria. This accumulation induces hepatocellular damage by escalating oxidative
stress alongside mitochondrial dysfunction [3,5]. Although APAP is safe when used within
recommended doses for treating pain and fever, overdosing can lead to severe liver damage
and even death [6].
Oxidative stress in APAP-induced hepatotoxicity is characterized by lipid peroxi-
dation, mitochondrial damage, and ATP depletion [ 3,7]. Substances with antioxidant
properties may protect against such hepatocellular injury [3]. N-acetylcysteine (NAC) is

currently the only FDA-approved drug for the treatment of APAP-induced liver injury [8,9].
It has garnered significant attention as a therapeutic agent against drug-induced liver
injury (DILI) due to its robust antioxidant properties, particularly its ability to augment
endogenous GSH levels to counteract oxidative stress [ 10]. However, its clinical use is
substantially restricted because of the narrow therapeutic window for acute liver injury and
associated side effects [8,11]. By contrast, natural products are valuable sources of novel
medicines and therapies. Compounds such as triterpenoid saponins, schisandra lignans,
polysaccharides, iridoids, flavonoids, and quinones have demonstrated protective effects
against APAP-induced hepatotoxicity [8]. However, improving the therapeutic window
of natural hepatoprotective agents and reducing their toxicity are challenges that need
to be addressed [ 8]. Moreover, researchers and clinicians are increasingly interested in
discovering naturally sourced hepatocurative and hepatoprotective agents that can enhance
treatment efficacy [12].
Tannic acid (TA), which is primarily found in various plants used as food and feed,
such as food grains, fruits, wine, and tea [ 13,14], is a natural polyphenol with diverse
therapeutic properties, including antioxidant, antitumor, and anti-inflammatory effects [15].
The hepatoprotective effects of TA on APAP-induced hepatotoxicity were previously in-
vestigated due to its anti-oxidation, anti-inflammation, and anti-apoptosis properties.
Their study further demonstrated that TA treatment could alleviate hepatotoxicity in
APAP-induced mice, ameliorating hepatic dysfunction and mitigating histopathological
changes [3]. Although TA shows promise in anticancer applications, its mechanisms for
enhancing hepatic functions in vivo remain unclear [13]. Furthermore, the dual hepatopro-
tective and hepatocurative effects of TA remain relatively unexplored.
Numerous studies have highlighted similarities between carbon tetrachloride (CCl4)-
induced liver damage and human liver cirrhosis [ 16,17]. Therefore, CCl 4-induced liver
damage is commonly used as an experimental model for screening hepatoprotective and
hepatocurative herbal medicines or drugs [16]. Although APAP and CCl4 are both com-
monly used in intrinsic drug-induced liver injury models, APAP-induced liver injury is
the most clinically relevant [18]. However, few studies have focused on hepatoprotective
and hepatocurative drugs specifically for APAP-induced liver injury [19]. In addition, most
studies have examined the potential of herbal medicines in addressing toxin-induced liver
injuries, such as those affecting alanine transaminase (ALT), alkaline phosphatase (ALP),
aspartate transaminase (AST), and lactate dehydrogenase levels in serum and histological
studies [16,19]. Numerous phytoconstituents have been demonstrated to protect against
liver diseases in both in vitro and in vivo settings [20]. However, few of these studies
have examined specific components within herbal medicine or their role in facilitating the
recovery of liver function, including albumin, following toxin-induced liver injury [13].
In this study, we investigated the effect of TA on the functions of normal hepatocytes.
Subsequently, we established an APAP-induced acute liver failure model to determine the
effects of TA on the viability and functions of injured hepatocytes, bothin vitro and in vivo.
In the APAP-induced acute liver failure model, TA was employed as a hepatoprotective
agent prior to the introduction of APAP as a toxin and as a hepatocurative compound
after APAP exposure. In addition, to assess short-term effects, we utilized primary mature
hepatocytes (MHs), the gold standard in vitro cell model, because they can retain their func-
tionality over short durations [21]. To evaluate long-term effects, we used small hepatocytes
(SHs), known for their remarkable ability to proliferate and high potential to differentiate
into MHs [22]. This study investigated the hepatoprotective and hepatocurative effects of
TA through comprehensive in vitro and in vivo analyses. Figure 1 presents the flowchart
of the study.

2.1. Eﬀect of TA on MHs in In Vitro Cultures 
As depicted in Figure 2A, the relative viability of MHs cultured with 1 µg/mL of TA 
(120% ± 2%) was higher than that of MHs cultured in a TA-free medium (100% ± 14.35%). 
In addition, the relative viability of MHs cultured with continuous 1 µg/mL of TA 
(177.49% ± 15.79%) was higher than that of MHs cultured in the other conditions on day 
3. These results indicated that the continuo us supplementation of 1 µg/mL TA enhanced 
the viability of MHs. However, higher concen trations (>5 µg/mL) of TA can harm MHs, 
whereas lower concentrations (<0.1 µg/mL) might not yield positive eﬀects. These ﬁndings 
are consistent with those of our previous study conducted in microﬂuidic system cultures 
[13]. Thus, this condition was subsequently used for further experiments.

As depicted in Figure 2B, albumin synthesis was signiﬁcantly higher in MHs cultured 
with 1 µg/mL of TA than in those cultured in a TA-free medium within the ﬁrst 3 days of 
culture. Speciﬁcally, on day 2, the albumin concentration was 1.20 ± 0.07 µg/well/day in 
the TA-free group and 1.55 ± 0.11 µg/well/day in the TA-containing group. On day 3, the 
albumin concentration was 0.99 ± 0.01 µg/well/day in the TA-free group and 1.37 ± 0.03 
µg/well/day in the TA-containing group. However, the albumin synthesis in MHs mark-
edly decreased on days 4 and 5, even in the TA-containing group. As presented in Figure 
2C, the albumin (ALB) gene expression was signi ﬁcantly higher in MHs cultured with 1 
µg/mL of TA than in those cultured in the TA-free condition within 2 days of culture. 
Speciﬁcally, on day 2, the values were 1.00 ± 0.78-fold for the TA-free group and 3.17 ± 0.64 
µg/well/day for the TA-containing group. However, no signi ﬁcant diﬀerences were ob-
served on day 4 between these groups. Although TA has demonstrated bene ﬁts for MH 
culture, the occurrence of epit helial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) within 5 days of 
culturing can hinder hepatocyte growth and function for extended periods, even under 
favorable conditions [15]. In addition, Chiu et al. reported that the eﬀect of EMT was more 
signiﬁcant within the 5 day culture period compared with that of TA [14], which is con-
sistent with our ﬁndings (Figure 2B,C).

As depicted in Figure 2B, albumin synthesis was significantly higher in MHs cultured
with 1 µg/mL of TA than in those cultured in a TA-free medium within the first 3 days of
culture. Specifically, on day 2, the albumin concentration was 1.20 ± 0.07 µg/well/day
in the TA-free group and 1.55 ± 0.11 µg/well/day in the TA-containing group. On day
3, the albumin concentration was 0.99 ± 0.01 µg/well/day in the TA-free group and
1.37 ± 0.03 µg/well/day in the TA-containing group. However, the albumin synthesis in
MHs markedly decreased on days 4 and 5, even in the TA-containing group. As presented
in Figure 2C, the albumin (ALB) gene expression was significantly higher in MHs cultured
with 1 µg/mL of TA than in those cultured in the TA-free condition within 2 days of
culture. Specifically, on day 2, the values were 1.00 ± 0.78-fold for the TA-free group and
3.17 ± 0.64 µg/well/day for the TA-containing group. However, no significant differences
were observed on day 4 between these groups. Although TA has demonstrated benefits for
MH culture, the occurrence of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) within 5 days of
culturing can hinder hepatocyte growth and function for extended periods, even under
favorable conditions [ 15]. In addition, Chiu et al. reported that the effect of EMT was
more significant within the 5 day culture period compared with that of TA [14], which is
consistent with our findings (Figure 2B,C).

2.2. Effect of TA on SHs in In Vitro Cultures
As presented in Figure 2D, the relative viability of SHs cultured with 1 µg/mL of TA
(107% ± 2.1%) was higher than that of SHs cultured in the TA-free condition (100%± 5.2%)
on day 7; this observation is consistent with that in MHs (Figure 2A).
As illustrated in Figure 2E, albumin synthesis in SHs cultured with 1 µg/mL of TA
was significantly higher than that in SHs cultured in the TA-free condition within 11 days
of culture. Specifically, on day 1, the values were 0.33 ± 0.03 µg/well/day for the TA-free
group and 2.88 ± 0.61 µg/well/day for the TA-containing group. On day 4, the values were
1.46 ± 0.24 µg/well/day for the TA-free group and 2.77 ± 0.11 µg/well/day for the TA-
containing group. On day 7, the values were 0.27± 0.07 µg/well/day for the TA-free group
and 2.44 ± 0.11 µg/well/day for the TA-containing group. On day 11, the values were
0.27 ± 0.02 µg/well/day for the TA-free group and 2.60± 0.24 µg/well/day for the TA-
containing group. As depicted in Figure 2F, urea synthesis in SHs cultured with 1 µg/mL
of TA was significantly higher than that in SHs cultured in the TA-free condition within
11 days of culture. Specifically, on day 7, the values were 2.92 ± 0.26 µg/well/day for the
TA-free group and 4.31 ± 0.66 µg/well/day for the TA-containing group. On day 11, the
values were 3.28 ± 0.21 µg/well/day for the TA-free group and 4.53 ± 0.85 µg/well/day
for the TA-containing group.
As presented in Figure 2G, the ALB gene expression in SHs cultured with 1 µg/mL
of TA was significantly higher than that in SHs cultured in the TA-free condition within
11 days of culture. Specifically, on day 1, the values were 1.00 ± 0.02-fold for the TA-
free group and 1.17 ± 0.02-fold for the TA-containing group. On day 4, the values were
0.62 ± 0.03-fold for the TA-free group and 1.17 ± 0.02-fold for the TA-containing group.
On day 7, the values were 0.37 ± 0.03-fold for the TA-free group and 0.71 ± 0.02-fold for
the TA-containing group. On day 11, the values were 0.26 ± 0.02-fold for the TA-free group
and 1.59 ± 0.02-fold for the TA-containing group. These findings demonstrated that TA
exerted positive effects on hepatocyte culture, enhancing both cell viability and function.
Furthermore, our finding of the ability of SHs to sustain their functions over an extended
period aligns with that of a previous study [13].
2.3. Hepatoprotective and Hepatocurative Effects of TA on AP AP-Injured MHs
As presented in Figure 3A, the relative viability of MHs cultured in the MHs, APAP-
MHs, [TA + (APAP-MHs)], and [TA + (APAP-MHs) + TA] groups were 1 00% ± 14.35%,
40.23% ± 10.12%, 60.51% ± 8.37%, and 130.87 ± 6.25%, respectively. As illustrated
in Figure 3B, albumin synthesis values in MHs cultured in the MHs, APAP-MHs, [TA
+ (APAP-MHs)], and [TA + (APAP-MHs) + TA] groups were 0.9 ± 0.12, 0.02 ± 0.01,
1.18 ± 0.46, and 2.26 ± 0.17 µg/well/day, respectively. As depicted in Figure 3C,
ALB gene expression levels in MHs cultured in the MHs, APAP-MHs, [TA + (APAP-
MHs)], and [TA + (APAP-MHs) + TA] groups were 1.0 ± 0.02-fold, 0.6 ± 0.03-fold,
1.2 ± 0.02-fold, and 4.1 ± 0.05-fold, respectively. These findings demonstrated that
the addition of TA not only mitigated the cytotoxicity of injured hepatocytes but also
enhanced their functionality. In addition, in terms of prevention, TA supplementation
preconditions the functions of hepatocytes, enabling them to effectively counteract the
toxic effects of APAP.
The relative oxidation stress levels in MHs cultured in the APAP-MHs, [TA + (APAP-
MHs)], and [TA + (APAP-MHs) + TA] groups were 100% ± 5.4%, 94% ± 5.3%, and
89% ± 3.2%, respectively (Figure 3D), suggesting that 1 µg/mL of TA not only slightly
prevents oxidative stress before toxicity but also reduces oxidative stress after cell toxicity
significantly. This finding aligns with that of a previous study [23] that reported the antiox-
idative effects of TA, indicating that it reduces oxidative stress and free radical damage.

2.4. Hepatoprotective and Hepatocurative Effects of TA on AP AP-Injured SHs
The relative viability values of SHs cultured in the SHs, APAP-SHs, [TA + (APAP-
SHs)], and [TA + (APAP-SHs) + TA] groups were 100%± 5.2%, 115% ± 5.3%, 131% ± 4.2%,
and 42% ± 4.6%, respectively (Figure 3E). The albumin synthesis values in SHs cultured
in the SHs, APAP-SHs, [TA + (APAP-SHs)], and [TA + (APAP-SHs) + TA] groups were
31.3 ± 0.55, 3.74 ± 0.71, 4.10 ± 0.17, and 13.29 ± 2.81 µg/well/day, respectively (Figure 3F).
The relative oxidation stress levels in SHs cultured in the APAP-SHs, [TA + (APAP-SHs)],
and [TA + (APAP-SHs) + TA] groups were 100%± 7.4%, 97.3% ± 5.1%, and 67.1% ± 4.8%,
respectively (Figure 3G), suggesting that 1µg/mL of TA not only slightly prevents oxidative
stress before toxicity but also reduces oxidative stress after cell toxicity significantly. This
finding is consistent with that presented in Figure 3D.

As illustrated in Figure 4A, the proportions of live cells, cells in late apoptosis, and
necrotic cells in MHs within the APAP-injured group were 58.1%, 5.2%, and 19.8%, respec-
tively. In the APAP-injured group pretreated with TA, these proportions were 61.9%, 3.7%,
and 9.5%, respectively. As presented in Figure 4B, the proportions of live cells, cells in
late apoptosis, and necrotic cells in SHs within the APAP-injured group were 94.3%, 1.0%,
and 3.0%, respectively. In the APAP-injured group pretreated with TA, these proportions
were 97.7%, 0.1%, and 1.3%, respectively, consistent with the results shown in Figure 4A.
Our results suggest that TA effectively prevented apoptosis in both MHs and SHs in the
APAP-injured model.

The relative oxidation stress levels in MHs cultured in the APAP-MHs, [TA + (APAP-
MHs)], and [TA + (APAP-MHs) + TA] groups were 100% ± 5.4%, 94% ± 5.3%, and 89% ± 
3.2%, respectively (Figure 3D), suggesting that 1 µg/mL of TA not only slightly prevents 
oxidative stress before toxicity but also redu ces oxidative stress after cell toxicity signi ﬁ-
cantly. This ﬁnding aligns with that of a previous study [23] that reported the antioxida-
tive eﬀects of TA, indicating that it reduces oxidative stress and free radical damage. 
2.4. Hepatoprotective and Hepatocurative Eﬀects of TA on APAP-Injured SHs 
The relative viability values of SHs cult ured in the SHs, APAP-SHs, [TA + (APAP-
SHs)], and [TA + (APAP-SHs) + TA] groups were 100% ± 5.2%, 115% ± 5.3%, 131% ± 4.2%, 
and 42% ± 4.6%, respectively (Figure 3E). The albumin synthesis values in SHs cultured in 
the SHs, APAP-SHs, [TA + (APAP-SHs)], and [TA + (APAP-SHs) + TA] groups were 31.3 ± 
0.55, 3.74 ± 0.71, 4.10 ± 0.17, and 13.29 ± 2.81 µg/well/day, respectively (Figure 3F). The 
relative oxidation stress levels in SHs cultured in the APAP-SHs, [TA + (APAP-SHs)], and 
[TA + (APAP-SHs) + TA] groups were 100% ± 7.4%, 97.3% ± 5.1%, and 67.1% ± 4.8%, re-
spectively (Figure 3G), suggesting that 1 µg/mL of TA not only slightly prevents oxidative 
stress before toxicity but also reduces oxidative stress after cell toxicity signiﬁcantly. This 
ﬁnding is consistent with that presented in Figure 3D. 
2.5. Cell Apoptosis Eﬀects of TA on APAP-Injured MHs and APAP-Injured SHs 
As illustrated in Figure 4A, the proportions of live cells, cells in late apoptosis, and 
necrotic cells in MHs within the APAP-injured group were 58.1%, 5.2%, and 19.8%, re-
spectively. In the APAP-injured group pretreated with TA, these proportions were 61.9%, 
3.7%, and 9.5%, respectively. As presented in Figure 4B, the proportions of live cells, cells 
in late apoptosis, and necrotic cells in SHs within the APAP-injured group were 94.3%, 
1.0%, and 3.0%, respectively. In the APAP-inj ured group pretreated with TA, these pro-
portions were 97.7%, 0.1%, and 1.3%, respectively, consistent with the results shown in 
Figure 4A. Our results suggest that TA eﬀectively prevented apoptosis in both MHs and 
SHs in the APAP-injured model.

2.6. Effect of TA on the Prevention and Recovery of AP AP-Induced Liver Injury In Vivo
As presented in Figure 5A, the AST level in normal mice was approximately
221 ± 35 (U/L), which is consistent with that reported in a previous study [ 24]. How-
ever, the AST level in 300 mg/kg APAP-induced injured mice reached 12,018 ± 6246 (U/L)
after 12 h poisoning. The AST level in 300 mg/kg APAP-induced injured mice treated
with 300 µL of 1 µg/mL TA was below 4005 ± 1047 (U/L). As illustrated in Figure 5B, the
ALT level in normal mice was 42 ± 11 (U/L), which is consistent with that reported in
a previous study [24]. The AST level in 300 mg/kg APAP-induced injured mice reached
6533 ± 2509 (U/L) after 12 h poisoning. However, the AST level in 300 mg/kg APAP-
induced injured mice treated with 300 µL of 1 µg/mL TA decreased to 4971 ± 1623 (U/L).
As presented in Figure 5C, the total bilirubin level (BIL-T) in normal mice wasapproximately

0.05 ± 0.04 (mg/dL), which is consistent with that reported in a previous study [25]. How-
ever, the BIL-T level in 300 mg/kg APAP-induced injured mice reached 0.27± 0.01 (mg/dL)
after 12 h poisoning. The BIL-T level in 300 mg/kg APAP-induced injured mice treated
with 300 µL of 1 µg/mL TA was below 0.07 ± 0.06 (mg/dL). These results revealed that
mice with APAP-induced liver injury exhibited significantly higher levels of AST, ALT,
and BIL-T than did normal mice. However, when mice were treated with TA after APAP
poisoning, the levels of these indicators were reduced compared with those in untreated
mice, indicating a potential protective effect of TA against liver damage.

tective eﬀect of TA against liver damage.

The necrotic area in APAP-treated mice subjected to TA treatment was smaller than that in

3. Discussion
Medicinal plants have long been used for the treatment of liver diseases. Numerous
studies focusing on plants and their herbal formulations worldwide have reported their
hepatoprotective properties. Various phytoconstituents derived from these plants have
demonstrated their effectiveness in protecting liver health, both in vitro and in vivo [20].
Int. J. Mol. Sci.2024, 25, 317 9 of 17
For instance, TA, which is abundantly found in cereals, legumes, fruits, herbs, green
tea, and red wine, possesses robust antioxidant, astringent, antiviral, and antibacterial
properties. TA was reported to reduce serum cholesterol and triglyceride levels and inhibit
lipogenesis [27]. Moreover, these properties of TA have been reported to positively affect
liver function markers, including AST, ALT, ALP , γGT, and bilirubin, in a liver injury
model [13,28,29]. These properties can explain traditional beliefs in Asia that drinking tea
can protect the liver. However, the term “hepatoprotective” may imply either protecting
or preventing liver damage [20]. Moreover, numerous studies have explored differences
between hepatoprotective and hepatocurative properties in medicinal plants [11,16]. Thus,
despite the aforementioned belief, substantial empirical evidence supporting both the
hepatoprotective and hepatocurative abilities of the main tea ingredient, polyphenol TA,
is necessary.
APAP , which is commonly prescribed to alleviate fever and pain, is generally safe when
administered in therapeutic doses. However, an overdose of APAP can lead to hepatocyte
necrosis, damage to mitochondrial membranes, and an increase in mitochondrial oxidative
stress [3,30]. TA exhibited substantial hepatoprotective effects against APAP-induced
hepatotoxicity, indicating that the hepatoprotective mechanism of TA may be related to
antioxidation, anti-inflammation, and antiapoptosis [3]. However, only a few studies have
analyzed the effects of TA on albumin and urea levels in a normal liver model [ 13]. In
addition, no study has investigated the relationship between TA and hepatic functions by
using an injured liver model. To address this knowledge gap, we examined the effect of
and mechanism through which TA enhances hepatocyte viability and functions in normal
liver models. In addition, we investigated the hepatoprotective and hepatocurative effects
of TA on APAP-induced liver failure models.
Our results revealed a significant increase in the relative viability of MHs in the
presence of 1 µg/mL of TA (Figure 2A). Specifically, the continuous supplementation
of 1 µg/mL of TA resulted in superior performance compared with all other conditions.
Furthermore, we observed a notable enhancement in albumin synthesis in these MHs
(Figure 2B). This improvement was corroborated by the upregulation of ALB gene expres-
sion (Figure 2C). We investigated the effects of 1 µg/mL of TA on both prevention and
recovery in APAP-MHs. In the prevention model, the relative cell viability, albumin synthe-
sis, and ALB gene expression in MHs were 1.5-fold, 59-fold, and 2-fold higher, respectively,
in the [TA + (APAP-MHs)] group than in the APAP-MHs group. In the curative model, the
relative cell viability, albumin synthesis, andALB gene expression in MHs were 3.25-fold,
113-fold, and 6.83-fold higher, respectively, in the [TA + (APAP-MHs) + TA] group than in
the APAP-MHs group (Figure 3A–C). These results indicated that 1µg/mL of TA not only
increased cell viability after injury but also enhanced hepatic functions, both preventing
and curing APAP-induced injury. In addition, APAP damages MHs by generating free
radicals. The antioxidative effect of TA exhibited a significant difference in its ability to
promote recovery after toxicity, but it did not exert significant preventive effects before
the onset of toxicity (Figure 3D). These results further explain the superior performance of
1 µg/mL of TA in aiding the recovery of injured MHs in a curative manner compared with
its performance in preventive damage before toxicity (Figure 3A–C).
As presented in Figure 2D–G, we observed significant increases in relative viability,
albumin synthesis, urea synthesis, and ALB gene expression in SHs in the presence of
1 µg/mL of TA within 11 days of culture. We also investigated the effects of 1µg/mL of TA
on both prevention and recovery in APAP-SHs. In the prevention model, the relative cell
viability and albumin synthesis in SHs were 1.14-fold and 1.10-fold higher, respectively, in
the [TA + (APAP-SHs)] group than in the APAP-SHs group. In the curative model, the rela-
tive cell viability and albumin synthesis were 0.36-fold and 3.55-fold higher, respectively,
in the [TA + (APAP-SHs) + TA] group than in the APAP-SHs group (Figure 3E,F). The
MTT assay does not only reflect cell viability but also cell proliferation [15,31]. Previous
studies have indicated an inverse relationship between cell proliferation and differen-
tiation [15,32]. In addition, SHs exhibited a superior ability to maintain 3D structures
Int. J. Mol. Sci.2024, 25, 317 10 of 17
and resist differentiation into fibroblast-like cells compared with MHs [ 22]. Therefore,
we hypothesize that the stimulation of APAP-SHs following TA supplementation led to
advanced differentiation, resulting in the formation of more functionally mature liver
tissue during in vitro proliferation (Figure 3F). The functionalized and differentiated liver
tissue exhibited decreased proliferative capacity, leading to a marked decline in APAP-SHs
activity (Figure 3E). Similar results were observed in normal hepatocyte cultures. The
relative viability of MHs and SHs increased by 1.77-fold (day 1) and only 1.07-fold (day 7),
respectively, in the TA-containing group (Figure 2A,D). However, the albumin synthesis in
MHs and SHs increased by 1.38-fold (day 3) and almost 9.63-fold (day 7), respectively, in
the TA-containing group (Figure 2B,E). These findings align with observations reported in
prior studies [15,33].
The recovery group exhibited a significant reduction in relative oxidative stress fol-
lowing toxicity. The effectiveness of 1 µg/mL of TA in reducing relative oxidative stress
was more pronounced in SHs than in MHs. This is because stem cells typically have lower
levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) than fully differentiated cells. Highly proliferative
stem cells, such as cancer stem cells, maintain low ROS levels to prevent ROS-induced
apoptosis, resulting in less DNA damage from radiation due to the presence of enhanced
ROS scavenging systems [34]. However, we noted no significant preventive effects before
toxicity on both MHs and SHs (Figure 3D,G). This is because the metabolic half-life of
albumin in serum is approximately 17 days, and the albumin level in serum does not
change rapidly [15]. Thus, with TA’s cumulative enhancement of albumin synthesis over
prolonged culture periods, the disparity in albumin synthesis became increasingly evident.
This difference led to a more pronounced change in the recovery of relative oxidative stress
after toxicity (Figure 3G). However, although the preventive effect of TA on ROS reduction
may not have been apparent, the findings shown in Figure 4 still suggest that TA effectively
prevented apoptosis in both MHs and SHs in the APAP-injured model. In addition, the
effectiveness of TA in ameliorating injured cell viability and inhibiting apoptosis/necrosis
was more pronounced in SHs than in MHs.
We hypothesize that the mechanism underlying the effect of TA on hepatocytes under
this condition may operate through alternative pathways, particularly by significantly
affecting albumin synthesis. Moreover, the decrease in relative oxidative stress after toxicity
might result from various factors. Apart from TA’s inherent antioxidative properties that
significantly reduce free radicals after toxicity, Doweiko et al. indicated that albumin itself
acts as an excellent antioxidant [35], providing protection against free radicals in hepato-
cytes. Xie et al. also suggested that the addition of TA strengthens protein structures [36].
Because oxidized albumin can increase oxidative stress [37], the decrease in oxidative stress
can have an additive effect. This mechanism might involve the stimulation of hepatocytes
by TA, leading to increased albumin synthesis [13]. In addition, the stable structure formed
between TA and albumin [36] might contribute to the reduction in relative oxidative stress
in the culture medium after toxicity.
In in vivo experiments, the addition of 1 µg/mL of TA in mice significantly reduced
acute liver failure damage after APAP toxicity, as reflected by notable reductions in the
serum levels of ALT, AST, and BIL-T (Figure 5A–C). Moreover, the histopathological
examination of tissue sections revealed a significant reduction in the tissue area in the group
treated with 1 µg/mL of TA compared with the untreated group (Figure 5D–F). These
results demonstrated the hepatocurative effects of TA after toxicity in mice experiencing
acute liver failure. These findings propose a multifaceted interaction among TA, albumin,
and relative oxidative stress in hepatocytes after toxic exposure, shedding light on potential
therapeutic pathways for acute liver failure. In addition, many studies have explored
the therapeutic potential of TA orally in injured liver models [3,38], but only one report
has discussed the potential of TA-embedded decellularized liver matrix (DLM)-based
nanomedicine in promoting liver regeneration after 70% of partial hepatectomy via the
intraperitoneal (IP) route [15]. However, the specific effect of TA alone via IP administration
remains uncertain.
Int. J. Mol. Sci.2024, 25, 317 11 of 17
While our findings demonstrated the potential therapeutic effects of TA in an injured
rat model, it is important to note that Goel et al. have reported a gradual and progressive
destruction of liver cells and transformation of their architecture in Clarias batrachusfollow-
ing the IP administration of an aqueous solution of TA [39]. In addition, despite the faster
and more complete absorption seen with IP administration of pharmacological agents
compared to oral, intramuscular, and subcutaneous routes, it has limitations. One such
limitation is first-pass metabolism, leading to reduced systemic exposure to substances
administered via the IP route [ 40]. On the other hand, Li et al. have demonstrated that
orally administered TA had minimal adverse side effects in rats [38]. However, the molecu-
lar composition of tannins in the bloodstream or excreted in urine may differ significantly
from their ingested forms [41], and there is limited information available on the absorption,
distribution, metabolism, and excretion (ADME) of hydrolyzable tannins in humans. This
knowledge gap extends to trials conducted with rodents and pigs [42]. The aforementioned
findings may raise concerns regarding the potential translation of these effects into clinical
settings. Detailed discussions and exploration of potential mechanisms will be addressed
in our future work.
In conclusion, our study demonstrates that the inclusion of TA significantly enhances
cell viability and hepatic functions in both normal and APAP-injured liver models, both
in vitro and in vivo, under hepatoprotective and hepatocurative conditions. Notably, these
results highlight the pivotal role of TA, particularly its cumulative effect, in enhancing
albumin synthesis in SHs over extended periods. Furthermore, TA’s potential for mitigating
oxidative stress in hepatocytes highlights its promising applications in treating acute liver
failure. This study offers scientific validation for the traditional belief that “drinking tea to
protect the liver”. Specifically, the coadministration of TA-based components with APAP
may hold potential for clinical applications.
Limitations of the Study
In our study, we investigated the therapeutic potential of TA for APAP-induced liver
injury through both in vitro and in vivo approaches. While our findings provide valuable
insights, a more in-depth exploration of the underlying mechanisms, such as the immunore-
active levels of IL-1β and TNF-α and potential pathways, is warranted. Furthermore, it
is important to note that although the IP route is commonly used in animal studies, its
differences from oral intake, which is more relevant for human therapeutic application,
should be considered. Future discussions will delve into the potential translation of these
effects into clinical settings, with a focus on detailed mechanisms.

4.2. Hepatocyte Isolation and Seeding
Hepatocytes (both MHs and SHs) were obtained from male SD rats (age, 6–8 weeks)
by using a two-step collagenase perfusion technique with some modifications [13,43]. The
Trypan Blue exclusion method indicated that the viability of each experimental preparation
exceeded 85%. In total, 5 × 105 cells/mL of hepatocytes (500 µL/well) were seeded on a
0.1 g/L collagen-coated 24-well plate. MHs were maintained in William’s E (WE) medium
supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), whereas SHs were maintained in a
DMEM/F12-based medium in both cultures. The medium was replaced with a 1 µg/mL
TA-containing medium at 4 h and 24 h post-inoculation and subsequently changed every
48 h. Hepatocyte morphology was investigated using a microscope.
4.3. Injured MHs Cultures
MHs were cultured in WE medium containing 10% FBS, and the medium was replaced
after 4 h. Then, the culture medium was replaced with WE medium + 1 µg/mL TA + 10%
FBS and incubated for 20 h to protect MHs. Subsequently, the culture medium was replaced
with WE medium + 20 mM APAP + 10% FBS and incubated for 18 h to induce injury in
MHs. Furthermore, the culture medium was replaced again with WE medium + 1 µg/mL
TA+ 10% FBS and incubated for another 18 h to facilitate the recovery of MHs from injury.
MHs refer to normal MHs cultured in regular Petri dishes without TA supplemen-
tation. APAP-MHs refer to APAP-injured MHs cultured in regular Petri dishes without
TA supplementation. [TA + (APAP-MHs)] refers to MHs cultured in regular Petri dishes

was replaced with DMEM/F-12-based medium + 20 mM APAP and incubated for 48 h to
induce injury in SHs. Furthermore, the culture medium was replaced again with DMEM/F-
12 medium + 1 µg/mL TA and incubated for another 24 h to facilitate the recovery of SHs
from injury.
SHs refer to normal SHs cultured in regular Petri dishes without TA supplemen-
tation. APAP-SHs refer to APAP-injured SHs cultured in regular Petri dishes without
TA supplementation. [TA + (APAP-SHs)] refers to SHs cultured in regular Petri dishes

supplementation, followed by exposure to APAP-induced toxicity for 48 h, and then
recovered through additional TA supplementation for another 24 h (curative model).
4.5. Relative Hepatocyte Viability
The relative hepatocyte viability of normal and injured hepatocytes was examined
using an MTT assay [44,45]. MTT was added to a final concentration of 10% in WE medium
and incubated at 37 ◦C under 5% CO2 in a humidified incubator. After 4 h of incubation,
75 µL of the supernatant was aspirated, and 55 µL of dimethyl sulfoxide was added to
each well. After another 10 min of incubation, absorbance was measured at 570 nm on a
microplate reader. To calculate relative hepatocyte viability within the 5 days of culture,
the measured absorbance value of hepatocytes in the medium without TA on day 1 was
used as the blank. Subsequently, the absorbance value of each experimental condition was
divided by the value of this blank to determine relative hepatocyte viability [44].
4.6. Assessment of Hepatic Functions
The culture medium collected in the previous step was stored at−20 ◦C for subsequent
liver function analyses, specifically focusing on two key indicators: albumin synthesis and
urea production [13,46]. The concentrations of albumin and urea in the collected media
were determined using a protein detector ELISA kit, a horseradish peroxidase/ABTS
system, and a QuantiChrom urea assay kit, respectively, following the manufacturer’s
instructions.
4.7. Total RNA Extraction and Reverse Transcription
Total RNA was extracted from the cultured hepatocytes by using TRIzol [ 47]. The
quality of the extracted RNA was assessed by determining the OD260/OD280 absorption
ratio. Subsequently, total RNA (500 ng) was reverse-transcribed into single-stranded cDNA
by using PrimeScript RTase and 50 pM random hexamer primers. Polymerase chain reac-
tion (PCR) was performed using primers specific for liver function markers (albumin) and a
housekeeping gene (glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase [GAPDH]). The following
primers were used: 96 bp albumin (forward, 5 ′-TCCCAGACAAGGAGAAGCAG-3′; re-
verse, 5′-TCACCGTCTTCAGCTGATCTT-3′) and 143 bp GAPDH (forward, 5′-GGCACAG
TCAAGGCTGAGAATG-3′; reverse, 5′-ATGGTGGTGAAGACGCCAGTA-3′).
4.8. Real-Time PCR
In the rotor-gene SYBR Green PCR method, a mixture was prepared by combining
8 µL of RNAse-free water (PCR grade), 0.5 µL of forward primer (20 µM), 0.5 µL of reverse
primer (20 µM), and 10 µL of rotor-gene SYBR Green master mix. Then, cDNA (1 µL) was
amplified using a rotor-gene SYBR Green PCR kit and a standardized PCR protocol. The
melting curve analysis program of the Rotor-Gene Q was used to identify specific PCR
products. Gene expression data obtained from the analysis were quantified and normalized
to the expression data of GAPDH. Relative gene expression was quantified in terms of
fold change.

4.9. Relative Oxidative Stress
Disrupted liver metabolism is closely associated with inflammation and excessive ROS
production, thereby promoting hepatocyte damage, and leading to liver diseases [23]. To
assess the markers of lipid peroxidation, the PeroxiDetect kit was utilized in accordance
with the manufacturer’s instructions. Specifically, 50 to 100 µL of the culture medium was
added to a 1.5 mL Eppendorf tube, followed by the addition of 1 mL of the working color
reagent. The mixture was left at room temperature for 30 min. Absorbance was measured at
560 nm by using a spectrophotometer. To calculate relative oxidative stress, the absorbance
of the APAP-MHs cultured in the TA-free culture medium was used as the blank. Then, the
absorbance value derived from each experimental condition was divided by the value of
the blank to estimate relative oxidative stress.
4.10. Annexin V Detection Using a Flow Cytometer
Annexin V is a calcium-dependent phospholipid-binding protein that specifically
binds to phosphatidylserine. Apoptosis can be detected using flow cytometry or fluores-
cence microscopy with green fluorescent fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-labeled Annexin
V [48]. Annexin V/propidium iodide (PI) staining and analysis were performed following
the manufacturer’s instructions. Initially, as the cell culture progressed to day 1, cells on the
culture plate were detached through trypsinization and suspended in phosphate-buffered
saline. After centrifugation, the cells were resuspended in a solution conducive to Annexin
V binding, resulting in a final cell concentration of 1 × 106 cells/mL. Subsequently, 100 µL
of this cell suspension was transferred to a new centrifuge tube, and 5 µL of FITC-labeled
Annexin V and 5 µL of PI were added. The reaction occurred at room temperature for
15 min. Finally, the stained cells were analyzed through flow cytometry.
4.11. In Vivo Acute Liver Failure Therapeutic Model Establishment
C57Bl/6 mice, aged 7 weeks, were initially subjected to an 8 h fasting period, followed
by an intraperitoneal injection of APAP . APAP was dissolved in 0.9% saline at 37◦C, and
the injection dose was 300 mg/kg. Acute liver failure was induced within 12 h of poisoning,
as described in [49]. Subsequently, we administered 300 µL of 1 µg/mL TA through an
intraperitoneal injection to initiate a 12 h recovery period for APAP-induced liver failure.
Experimental parameters were adapted from [24].
4.12. Biochemical Analysis
Blood samples were collected from the mice through cardiac puncture by using a
27 G 1 mL syringe. The samples were then centrifuged at 3000 rpm at 4 ◦C for 25 min. The
resulting supernatants were carefully collected into 1.5 mL heparin-free microcentrifuge
tubes and stored at −20 ◦C. The serum was maintained at 2 ◦C to 8 ◦C and sent to the
Laboratory Animal Center, National Taiwan University College of Medicine, for further
analysis of ALT, AST, and BIL-T. ALT and AST, specific enzymes of hepatocytes, are released
into the bloodstream during hepatocytic necrosis, whereas BIL-T serves as an indicator of
acute liver failure, as described in [50].
4.13. Histological Analysis
After the 12 h in vivo TA injection, livers were extracted and fixed in formalin, embed-
ded in paraffin, and sliced into sections for histological staining. The paraffin-embedded
sections were stained using hematoxylin and eosin (H and E). H and E staining, which
uses hematoxylin to stain cell nuclei blue–purple and eosin to stain the cytoplasm pink,
was conducted to observe and analyze cellular morphology [46,51]. Paraffin embedding
and staining procedures were conducted in the Sectioning Room of the Department of
Veterinary Medicine at National Taiwan University.

4.14. Statistical Analysis
All data are presented as the mean ± standard deviation. Each experiment was
conducted in biological triplicate. Statistical analyses involving multiple samples were
conducted using a two-tailed unpaired Student’s t test using Microsoft Excel 2017. p < 0.05
indicated statistical significance.
5. Conclusions
In our study, we observed a significant enhancement in the relative viability and hep-
atic functions of both MHs and SHs in vitro at a specific concentration of TA. Furthermore,
our findings highlight the hepatoprotective and hepatocurative effects of TA against APAP-
induced hepatotoxicity. Additionally, our results underscore the therapeutic potential of
TA through IP administration in clinical settings. Future investigations should compre-
hensively explore the mechanisms underlying TA’s protective and preventive effects on
hepatocytes, whether administered orally, and assess its long-term impact on liver function
in cases of liver injury.
