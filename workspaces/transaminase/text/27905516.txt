Transaminases are useful biocatalysts for the production of amino acids and chiral amines as 
intermediates for a broad range of drugs and fine chemicals. Here, we describe the discovery and 
characterisation of new transaminases from microorganisms which were enriched in selective media 
containing (R)-amines as sole nitrogen source. While most of the candidate proteins were clearly 
assigned to known subgroups of the fold IV family of PLP-dependent enzymes by sequence analysis 
and characterisation of their substrate specificity, some of them did not fit to any of these groups. The 
structure of one of these enzymes from Curtobacterium pusillum, which can convert d-amino acids and 
various (R)-amines with high enantioselectivity, was solved at a resolution of 2.4 Å. It shows significant 
differences especially in the active site compared to other transaminases of the fold IV family and thus 
indicates the existence of a new subgroup within this family. Although the discovered transaminases 
were not able to convert ketones in a reasonable time frame, overall, the enrichment-based approach 
was successful, as we identified two amine transaminases, which convert (R)-amines with high 
enantioselectivity, and can be used for a kinetic resolution of 1-phenylethylamine and analogues to 
obtain the (S)-amines with e.e.s >99%.
Biocatalytic processes have become increasingly important in chemical industry
1–3. Of particular importance 
is one property of enzymes - their stereoselectivity - which enables one of the two enantiomers to be preferen-
tially reacted or formed in chemical reactions with chiral or prochiral compounds. Enantiopure chiral amines 
and amino acids are important building blocks in the synthesis of many pharmaceuticals, fine chemicals and 
agrochemicals. Within the expanding biocatalytic toolbox for amine synthesis
4, especially amine transaminases 
(ATAs) have been studied extensively during the past few years5–7. In general, transaminases catalyse the transfer 
of an amino group from an amino donor to a carbonyl acceptor with pyridoxal 5′ -phosphate (PLP) as cofactor. 
They belong to fold types I and IV of PLP-dependent enzymes. While α -transaminases such as l-branched chain 
aminotransferases (BCATs) and d-amino acid aminotransferases (D-ATAs) use solely α -amino acids as amino 
donors, amine transaminases can use amines as donors as well.
In addition to excellent enantioselectivity, high conversions and a broad substrate scope, also high space-time 
yields, high substrate loadings and process stability are mandatory for an efficient industrial process. Although 
a lot of effort has already been made to improve and tailor transaminases according to industrial requirements 
by protein, substrate and reaction engineering
8–12, there is still a clear need for further enhancement of known 
transaminases or the discovery of new, especially (R )-selective transaminases ((R )-ATA) exhibiting improved 
properties. All (R )-amine transaminases described in the literature so far are members of the fold type IV 
PLP-dependent enzyme family 13–18. This family includes d -amino acid aminotransferases, L-branched chain 
aminotransferases and 4-amino-4-deoxychorismate lyases (ADCL)19.
Methods used for the discovery of novel enzymes can be classified as either activity or sequence based 20.

substrate of choice or different organisms are screened for their ability to convert the desired substrates. Several 
amine transaminases have been discovered by applying this method21–24. On the other hand, with an increasing 
number of genome sequences and protein structures available, database mining in combination with in silico  
prediction of key amino acid residues has become an increasingly successful tool14,25–27.
Herein, we report the discovery of a new class of fold IV-transaminases, which was discovered during our 
quest for novel (R)-selective transaminases using an enrichment-based approach.
Results and Discussion
Identification of genes encoding putative ( R)-selective transaminases. Soil samples from var -
ious places in the Netherlands and Germany were used for the enrichment of microorganisms, which can use 
(R)-amines such as (R )-2-aminobutane, (R )-3,3-dimethyl-2-aminobutane, (R )-1-phenylethylamine, (R )-1-
phenylpropylamine, (R )-1-aminoindane and (R )-1-aminotetralin as sole nitrogen source. Several bacterial 
and fungal strains were isolated and classified using bacterial or fungal 16 S or D2-LSU rRNA sequences
28. The 
genomes of the four most active bacterial strains, which were enriched on different amines - Rahnella aquatilis  
((R)-1-aminotetralin), Microbacterium ginsengisoli ((R)-1-phenylpropylamine), Curtobacterium pusillum ((R)-1-
aminoindane), and Achromobacter spanius ((R)-1-phenylethylamine) - were sequenced. The genome sequences 
were used for sequence based similarity searches against known (R)-amine transaminase sequences (either from 
public databases or from an in-house platform) with confirmed (R )-ATA activity. Several candidates with dif-
ferent degrees of similarity were identified (Table S1), whereby the overall sequence similarity was rather low 
(highest similarity of only 26.9% to AT-ω TA from Aspergillus terreus). However, we have found before that an 
enzyme with only 34% sequence identity to AT-ω TA showed (R)-ATA activity (unpublished data), and overall 
the sequences in this subfamily are diverse. Comparison of the sequences to those of fold IV transaminases with 
known structures (Fig. 1) revealed that AspTA1 and RaqTA1 are most similar to D-ATAs, CpuTA2, MgiTA2 and 
RaqTA2 to BCATs and RaqTA3 to ADCLs. None of the protein sequences were aligned in the same subgroup 
as currently known (R )-ATAs. AspTA2, CpuTA1, CpuTA3 and MgiTA1 did not fit to any of the characterised

subgroups. Interestingly, several biochemically uncharacterised transaminases, which were included in the com-
parison as their structure was available in the PDB, form additional subgroups in the cladogram (Fig. 1).
Bornscheuer and his group identified sequence motifs, which are characteristic for each subgroup of the fold 
type IV PLP dependent enzyme family14. Based on that, the protein sequences were analysed for the presence of 
these conserved amino acid motifs (Table S2). Again, none of the candidate proteins was clearly predicted to be 
an (R)-amine transaminase. AspTA1 and RaqTA1 share 45% sequence identity and are predicted to be D-ATAs. 
They contain all of the conserved amino acids for D-ATAs, but contain also some of the predicted amino acids of 
(R)-ATAs, which the two subfamilies share. CpuTA1 and MgiTA1 share 49% sequence identity and contain con-
served amino acids of (R)-ATA and ADCLs, thus cannot be explicitly assigned to any of the subgroups. CpuTA2 
and MgiTA2 share 71% sequence identity and are predicted to be BCATs. Also AspTA2 and RaqTA2 show high-
est similarity to BCATs, although their similarity to each other and to CpuTA2 and MgiTA2 is only between 20 
and 30%. CpuTA2, MgiTA2 and RaqTA2 contain all conserved amino acids predicted for BCATs, while AspTA2 
is different at two positions (Table S2). Raq TA3 exhibits a high similarity to ADCLs. Cpu TA3 is predicted to 
belong to the aminotransferase type IV fold family, but it is not very similar to any of the other newly identified 
sequences or the already characterised ( R)-ATAs. Moreover, it does not comprise any of the conserved amino 
acids described for the other members of this family.
Initial characterisation of the transaminases. To further analyse the activity of the candidate proteins, 
they were heterologously expressed in E. coli. All proteins except AspTA1 and CpuTA3 displayed a high expres-
sion level. Most of the target proteins were highly soluble, the rest was partially soluble. AspTA1 was expressed 
with significantly lower yield as soluble protein, and CpuTA3 was almost insoluble. On SDS-PA gels all protein 
bands were displayed at the expected molecular size (Figure S1).
In a standard spectrophotometrical activity assay for amine transaminases using (R)-1-phenylethylamine or 
(R)-1-aminotetralin and pyruvate as substrates, only CpuTA1 and MgiTA1 were active (Table 1).
AspTA1, CpuTA1, MgiTA1 and RaqTA1 showed activities in an LDH coupled d -amino acid transaminase 
assay using α -ketoglutaric acid and d -alanine as substrates (Table 1). l -alanine was not accepted as substrate. 
Unsurprisingly, the three candidates (CpuTA2, MgiTA2, RaqTA2), which were clearly predicted to be L-branched 
chain aminotransferases, were active towards various l-amino acids (Table 1 and Fig. 2), confirming the predic-
tion. AspTA2, CpuTA3 and RaqTA3 were inactive in all assays with all tested substrates.
The reaction products of several amination reactions were also analysed by rp-HPLC to establish the substrate 
scope and stereopreference of the transformations (Tables 2 and 3). In these reactions all active enzymes exclu-
sively showed (R)-selectivity (Fig. 3).
As already observed in the online photometric assay described above (Table 1), Cpu TA1 and MgiTA1 were 
clearly active with several racemic amine donors, reaching up to 50% conversion in the presence of excess pyru-
vate, which corresponds to a full conversion of the (R )-enantiomers (Table 2). All (S )-enantiomers were left  
unconverted without any exception and this property would qualify CpuTA1 and MgiTA1 for kinetic resolutions 
of racemic amines. After substantially longer reaction times than in the photometric assay, also RaqTA3 showed 
some conversion with all three amines (Table 2).
CpuTA1, MgiTA1 and RaqTA3 were also active in amination reactions of structurally more demanding α -keto 
acids (Fig. 4). They can thereby transfer the amino group from primary amines bearing an aromatic substituent in 
close proximity. In sharp contrast, the enzymes provided only low conversions in the presence of excess aliphatic 
amino donors like propan-2-amine or butan-2-amine (Table 3). The highest conversions, especially with the 
larger substrates in this study, were obtained using dl-alanine as donor. CpuTA1 was superior to MgiTA1 in the 
case of the sterically more demanding phenylpyruvate as substrate. As cell-free lysates were used for the reactions,

typically complete racemisation of the initially formed d-alanine was found. This observation can be explained by 
the action of an amino acid racemase present in E. coli. In case of the other amino acid products, this competing 
activity is much weaker and the amount of racemisation almost negligible. Whereas 1-phenylethylamine served 
as amino donor, the corresponding ketone 1-phenylethanone remained completely unconverted as substrate in 
the amination reaction mode. Moreover, none of the new TAs showed activity in amination reactions with neither 
alanine nor 1-phenylethylamine when the following ketones were used as amine acceptors: acetone, 4-methyl-
2-pentanone, 1-phenylethanone, 1-phenylpropanone, 1-phenylbutanone, 4-phenylbutan-2-one, 1-tetralone, or 
1-indanone (data not shown).

Characterisation of CpuTA1 and MgiTA1. Out of the ten target enzymes, CpuTA1 and MgiTA1 showed 
the highest activities as amine transaminases and were therefore characterised in more detail. Both enzymes 
were recloned to introduce a C-terminal His-Tag and were purified by affinity chromatography in high yield and 
purity (data not shown). The activity of the purified enzymes was investigated under different reaction conditions 
(buffer, pH, T) in a photometric activity assay. In general, both enzymes were not active at a pH lower than 7.0, 
and the activities decreased also significantly at pH higher than 10. The optimal activity for CpuTA1 was observed 
at pH 8 with potassium phosphate buffer (KPi). MgiTA1 showed a similar pH profile as Cpu TA1, but was gen-
erally more active in Tris/HCl than in KPi buffer (data not shown). The activity of CpuTA1 was highest at 30 °C, 
but was drastically reduced at temperatures higher than 30 °C (Fig. 5). MgiTA1 was clearly more stable at higher 
temperatures (up to 40 °C) under the same assay conditions.
Structural analysis of Cpu TA1. The overall structure of CpuTA1. The crystal structure of Cpu TA1 was 
determined by X-ray crystallography at a resolution of 2.4 Å. The final model contains 587 amino-acid residues 
(chain A and B), two pyridoxal-5′ -phosphate (PLP), one 3-amino benzoic acid (3-ABA) and 327 water molecules. 
Some residues with poor electron density at the N- and C-terminus were excluded from the final structure (chain 
A: M1, A16-R25 and H309-H313; chain B: M1-T2, A16-A27 and D305-H313). Crystallographic data processing 
and structure refinement statistics are presented in Table 4. The asymmetric unit contains two polypeptide chains, 
which form a stable dimer with a contact surface of 5580 Å2 (PDBePISA29) (Fig. 6A). The interface contacts are 
mostly van der Waals interactions and hydrogen bonds. One chain divides into two domains (N-terminus to E138 
and Q144 to C-terminus), which are separated by an interdomain loop. CpuTA1 exhibits the typical aminotrans-
ferase type IV fold (InterPro: IPR001544, Pfam: Pf01063). A structural similarity search using the DALI server

pH 7.5, 24 h at 30 °C. The conversions were determined by rp-HPLC after derivatisation of the amino acid 
products with Marfey’s reagent; a: Calculated from the sum of d-Ala und l-Ala for following reason: in case of 
Ala, substantial racemisation of the initially formed d-Ala by an amino acid racemase present in the cell-free 
E. coli lysates occurred as checked by incubation of 20 mM d-Ala in the presence of enzyme lysate and PLP at 
the same concentrations. 34% of l-Ala was formed in the presence of lysate from CpuTA1, respectively MgiTA1 
under these conditions. b: Calculated from the amount of d-Glu, d-Met or d-Phe formed as racemisation to the 
corresponding l-amino acids was found negligible.

from Aspergillus terreus15, Z-score: 29.0, rmsd 2.2 Å, seq id: 22%). (R)-selective amine transaminases contain an 
N-terminal α -helix spanning the initial 20 amino acids 15,18, which is not observed in any of the other fold IV 
subfamilies. This helix is also not present in CpuTA1 (Fig. 6B).
Active site. The electron density for the PLP cofactor is well defined and the covalent imino bond to the active 
site Lys174 residue is clearly visible. The PLP binding site and the amino acids involved are highly similar to 
other fold IV enzymes (Fig. 6C). The phosphate group is interacting through a network of hydrogen bonds to 
the side chains of Arg75, Thr234, Thr235 and Ser271, the backbone amides of Thr234, Thr235 and Ser271, and

PLP is sandwiched between the side chain of Leu231 and the backbone of Ser211. Glu207 forms a hydrogen bond 
between its side chain carboxyl group and the nitrogen atom of the pyridine ring.
Amino acids of both chains contribute to the formation of the active site, as observed for other members of 
fold IV enzymes. The two active sites are located at the interface of the two polypeptide chains with the main por-
tion located in one chain, and vice versa. The entrance to the active site is situated at the dimer interface as well. 
The active site is surrounded by the residues R51*, F56, T58, F115, K117, E125, E140, F142, Y178, S270, S271, 
and V272 (*indicates that the residues belongs to the other chain) (Fig. 6D). These amino acids are building two 
binding pockets, whereby the small binding pocket is lined by T58, S270, S271 and V272 and the large binding 
pocket by R51*, F56, K115, E125*, E140, F142 and Y178. The large binding pocket is open to the protein surface 
forming an entrance tunnel, whereby E125* together with E142 seems to be the bottleneck of the entrance tunnel 
(Fig. 6E). Overall, the structure of Cpu TA1 confirms that except for the PLP binding amino acids hardly any of 
the active site amino acids is conserved compared to the characterised fold IV subgroups. The enantiopreference 
of BCATs and D-ATAs is determined by the localisation of the α -carboxyl group in relation to PLP
32,33. In BCATs 
the α -carboxylate is located on the phosphate group side of the cofactor interacting with the hydroxy group of 
a tyrosine, which is polarised by an arginine 32. These residues are not conserved in CpuTA1 and no tyrosine or 
positively charged amino acids are in close distance. In D-ATAs the α -carboxylate is bound in the binding pocket 
above the O3’ of PLP and the oxygen of the carboxyl group interacts with a positively charged arginine and in 
addition with a histidine and a tyrosine residue
34. Although these residues, which are part of a flexible loop, are 
not conserved in CpuTA1, R51 from an adjacent loop of chain B (corresponding to H55 in AT-ω TA) and K117 
(corresponding to E117 in AT-ω TA) from chain A are clearly pointing towards the active site and a potentially 
bound α -carboxylate. Thus, the structural data support the experimentally determined enantiopreference (D, R) 
of CpuTA1. Interestingly, a flexible loop (e.g. aa K125-I135 in AT-ω TA), which is present in (R)-ATAs13,15,17,35 as 
part of the active site (the loop of chain B as part of the active site of chain A and vice versa containing an arginine 
residue, which is discussed to play a role in dual substrate recognition of (R)-ATAs13,15,35) is significantly shorter 
in CpuTA1 (aa E125-G128) and does not contain any positively charged amino acid. Thus, the loop is located 
further away from the PLP binding site creating more space in the active site (Fig. 6F). This loop changes its 
conformation from a closed to an open form upon binding of the inhibitor gabaculin in the (R)-ATA of A. fumig-
atus
35 thereby moving R126 out of the active site, and due to high B-factors of the amino acid residues the loop is 
also expected to be flexible in AT-ω TA of A. terreus15. Moreover, an altered conformation of the respective loop 
in ATA-117-Rd11 variant compared to its wildtype might be one of the reasons for its ability to accommodate the 
pro-sitagliptin ketone
13. While the exact position of R138 in the loop of ATA-117-Rd11 is not conserved com-
pared to other published (R)-ATA structures, the guanidinium groups of all loop arginines localise in a similar 
position. A similar loop as in (R)-ATAs is present but not conserved in most members of fold type IV transami-
nases. Compared to the structure of (R)-ATAs, e.g. of A. terreus and A. fumigatus, the active site of CpuTA1 is fur-
ther slightly opened up as the interdomain loop E138-Q144 is located further away from the PLP (corresponding 
to loop P144-A150 containing I146 and V148 which were predicted to be part of the active site of the (R)-ATA of 
A. fumigatus18. In contrast, the respective loop in D-ATAs is located significantly further away, which is in corre-
spondence with the prediction that the positions of the small and the large binding pocket in relation to the O3′  
and the phosphate group of PLP are complementary in (R)-ATA and D-ATAs. Interestingly, in several BCATs this 
interdomain loop is disordered in structures of unliganded forms. It appears to be very flexible, changes confor-
mation upon substrate binding and differs between BCATs of different origin and even between isoenzymes32,36.
Conclusions
In the last decade, the definition of transaminases became more complex. In addition to α -transaminases, which 
catalyse the conversion of α -amino acids to α -keto acids and vice versa, and β  and ω -transaminases, which trans-
fer amino groups which are more distant from the carboxylic group, also the group of amine transaminases was 
discovered and defined. Amine transaminases can convert amines independently of the presence of a carboxylic 
group, albeit still able to convert e.g. amino acids as well, depending on their substrate scope
14,27. They are espe-
cially interesting in biocatalysis for their ability to catalyse also the reverse reaction converting ketones to amines. 
During our quest for new (R)-selective amine transaminases, we isolated ten candidate enzymes, of which two 
were clearly identified as D-ATAs and three as BCATs. One showed high sequence similarity to ADCLs. For four 
candidates, however, the prediction and biochemical data were less clear. This once more highlights the difficulty 
of predicting function from sequence, which is only possible, if enough biochemical data are already available
27, 
and consequently, the need to close the gap between sequence and functional information. In contrast to exclu-
sive amino acid transaminases such as D-ATAs and BCATs, CpuTA1 and MgiTA1 are in addition able to convert 
amines to ketones, which would categorise them in the subclass of amine transaminases. However, those enzymes 
are commonly able to catalyse also the reverse reaction in reasonable reaction times. In the case of CpuTA1 and 
MgiTA1, a reverse reaction was not detectable during the investigated time scale. Considering this and based 
on sequence and structural analysis, which revealed significant differences especially also in the active site, we 
propose that CpuTA1 and MgiTA1, might form a new subgroup in the fold IV family of PLP-dependent enzymes. 
Moreover, the fact that there are several structures of proteins with uncharacterised function and similarity to the 
fold type IV family of PLP-dependent enzymes deposited in the protein database, which differ in their active site 
amino acids and cannot be clearly assigned to one of the known fold type IV subgroups, indicates that the fold 
type IV family is a lot more diverse and many more activities and substrate specificities are still to be discovered.
Furthermore the results also show that the directed evolution paradigm “you get what you screen for” can also 
apply for a bioprospecting approach of classical enrichment combined with Bio-IT inspection of the obtained 
genome sequence, as presented herein. The strains were enriched for deamination of (R)-amines and indeed con-
tained transaminases capable of catalysing such reactions. No enzyme catalysing the conversion of both, amines 
and ketones, in a reasonable time frame was identified from the four investigated bacterial strains. Most likely

because the amination of ketones was no feature of the enrichment selection pressure and, in retrospect, an 
enrichment assay in the amination direction might have been more difficult to design and perform, but would 
probably have delivered the desired conversion of ketones to (R)-amines.
Methods
General Information. All chemicals were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, USA) or Carl 
Roth GmbH (Karlsruhe, Germany), if not stated otherwise. Materials for molecular biology were obtained from 
Thermo Fisher Scientific (Waltham, MA, USA), if not specifically mentioned. For enrichment of microorganisms 
selective enrichment medium (SEM) consisting of 10 g/L Difco Y east Carbon Base (YCB, BD, Sparks, MD, USA), 
55 mM glycerol (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany), 10 mM pyruvic acid (Sigma-Aldrich, Steinheim, Germany), 
5 mM (R)-amine substrate was used and for solid enrichment medium it contained also 15 g/L Difco Agar Noble 
(BD, Le Pont de Claix, France). E. coli TOP10F‘ (Invitrogen/LifeTechnologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA) and E. coli  
BL21-Gold(DE3) (Stratagene) were used for protein expression.
Enrichment of microorganisms on ( R)-amines as nitrogen source. Soil samples from various 
places in the Netherlands and Germany were suspended in 100 mM potassium phosphate (KPi) buffer, pH 7.0, 
and incubated with shaking at 180 rpm and 28 °C for 1 h. The suspensions were filtered through filter paper 
(Whatman/GE Healthcare, Uppsala, Sweden). Hundred μ  L of filtrate was used for inoculation of 10 mL SEM 
(in 100 mL shaking flasks) containing one of the six (R )-amines selected from the group (R )-2-aminobutane, 
(R)-3,3-dimethyl-2-aminobutane, (R)-1-phenylethylamine, (R)-1-phenylpropylamine, (R)-1-aminoindane and 
(R)-1-aminotetralin. The flasks were incubated with shaking at 180 rpm and 28 °C. When microbial growth was 
obtained, 100 μ L of this culture medium was used to inoculate SEM containing 5 mM of the same (R )-amine. 
After two such passages 100 μ L of a 1:100 dilution of the last culture medium was plated on SEM agar plates 
containing 5 mM of the corresponding ( R)-amine. Additionally, approximately 10  μ L of the undiluted culture 
was streaked out on SEM agar plates containing 5 mM of the corresponding (R )-amine. The inoculated agar 
plates were incubated at 28 °C until growth was observed. Colonies with different morphology were restreaked 
on fresh SEM plates to separate different microbial species. The re-streaking was continued until pure cultures 
with uniform morphologies were obtained after incubation at 28 °C and storage at 4 °C. Selected microorganisms 
were sent for MicroSEQ
® (Applied Biosystems/LifeTechnologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA) Identification to BaseClear 
(Leiden, The Netherlands). The bacterial or fungal 16 S or D2-LSU rRNA sequences obtained were compared 
to the validated MicroSEQ® sequence database (at BaseClear, Leiden, The Netherlands) and in case no identity 
above 99% was obtained compared to the non-redundant (nr) nucleotide database using the BlastN algorithm on 
the NCBI Blast homepage (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/BLAST/).
Isolation of DNA and cloning procedures. From four strains [Rahnella aquatilis  3 Kb (Raq ), 
Microbacterium ginsengisoli  1A1 DSM 23784 (Mgi), Curtobacterium pusillum  5BaB DSM 23787 (Cpu ), and 
Achromobacter spanius 6I DSM 23791 (Asp)], which were grown on selective media as described above, genomic 
DNA was isolated with the Easy-DNA kit (Invitrogen/LifeTechnologies) according to the manufacturer’s manual 
and finally eluted with 10 mM Tris/HCl, 1 mM EDTA, pH 8.0, (TE) buffer. The quality of the DNA was monitored 
spectrophotometrically as well as by digest with Bsp143I or BamHI followed by agarose gel electrophoresis (data 
not shown). The isolated genomic DNA samples from R. aquatilis , M. ginsengisoli, C. pusillum, and A. spanius 
were used for genome sequencing at IIT Biotech GmbH in Bielefeld, Germany. The sequence data were uploaded 
to an in-house server at the Institute of Knowledge Discovery at TU Graz and sequence similarity searches were 
conducted using blastn and tblastn programmes submitting known (R)-transaminase sequences and hits found 
in one of the genomes. Several hits with different degrees of similarity were identified and chosen for subsequent 
amplification by standard PCR using Phusion High Fidelity DNA polymerase (Thermo Scientific) (primers see 
Table S3). Three of the genes could not be amplified by PCR (even after optimisation of the reaction conditions) 
and one gene (RaqTA2) contained the motif of the NdeI and HindIII restriction sites in its native gene sequence 
and thus AspTA1, CpuTA1, CpuTA3 and RaqTA2 were ordered codon-optimised for expression in E. coli from 
Geneart/Life Technologies (Regensburg, Germany). All genes were cloned via NdeI/HindIII into pMS470Δ 8
37. 
The correctness of the inserts was confirmed by sequencing (LGC Genomics, Berlin, Germany). The two genes 
of CpuTA1 and MgiTA1 were subcloned into pET28a expression vector for the fusion of a C-terminal His-Tag by 
PCR amplification and digest with the restriction enzymes NcoI and XhoI.
Protein expression and purification. E. coli TOP10F’ cells harbouring pMS470-constructs or E. coli  
BL21-Gold(DE3) cells harbouring pET28a-constructs were grown in LB medium supplemented with ampicillin 
(Amp, final conc 100 μ g mL
−1) or kanamycin (Kan, final conc 50 μ g mL−1). For the main cultures, the pre-cultures 
were diluted to an attenuance at 600 nm of ~0.1, and grown in baffled flasks at 37 °C and 120 rpm. Protein expres-
sion was induced with 0.5 mM IPTG at an attenuance at 600 nm of ~0.6–0.8 and expression was performed at 
25 °C for 20 h. The cells were harvested at 4,000  ×  g for 15 min, and resuspended in cold buffer (pMS470 con -
structs: 50 mM KPi buffer, pH 7.5, containing 0.1 mM PLP , or pET28a-constructs: buffer A, 20 mM sodium 
phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, 0.1 mM PLP , 0.5 M NaCl and 10 mM imidazole), disrupted by sonication (Branson 
Sonifier S-250; 6 min, 80% duty cycle, 70% output) and centrifuged at 50,000 ×  g for 1 h. The cleared lysates 
were filtered through 0.45 μ m syringe filters and if necessary concentrated using Vivaspin 20 Centrifugal Filter 
Units (10,000 Da molecular-weight cut-off; Sartorius, Göttingen, Germany). The protein concentration of the 
lysate was established by Bradford protein assay. The expression and solubility of the proteins were analysed by 
SDS-PAGE (NuPAGE Bis-Tris PreCast Gels/Life Technologies). For purification of the His-tagged proteins the 
filtered cell-free lysates were incubated with Ni Sepharose
TM 6 Fast Flow resin (GE Healthcare) for 15 min. The 
Ni SepharoseTM resin was then filled into empty PD-10 columns (GE Healthcare). After removal of impurities

with buffer A containing 30 mM imidazole, the target proteins were eluted with 300 mM imidazole in buffer 
A. Fractions were analysed by SDS-PAGE, pooled, concentrated and desalted on PD-10 desalting columns  
(GE Healthcare) into 50 mM KPi buffer, pH 7.5, for biochemical characterisation or 20 mM Tris/HCl, 200 mM 
NaCl, pH 7.5, for protein crystallisation studies. Concentrations of purified proteins were determined with a 
Nanodrop spectrophotometer (model 2000c, Peqlab, Erlangen, Germany), using an absorbance of 10.06 for a 1% 
solution (10 g L−1) at 280 nm, calculated based on the amino acid sequence using Protparam38. The samples were 
frozen until further use.
Spectrophotometric activity assays. (R)-amine transaminase assay. The activities of the enzymes were 
determined using a standard photometric assay39 at 25 °C containing 0.25 mg mL−1 of total lysate protein, 0.1 mM 
PLP , 5 mM (R)-1-phenylethylamine (PEA), or (R )-1-aminotetralin and 5 mM pyruvate in 50 mM KPi, pH 7.5, 
total volume: 1 mL. The increase of the respective ketones was measured at 300 nm (extinction coefficient of 
1-phenylethanone =  0.28 mM−1 cm−1, extinction coefficient of 1-tetralone =  1.5 mM−1 cm−1). KPi at pH 7.5 or 
8.0 was chosen as buffer for all screenings as transaminases are generally active in this buffer at these pHs, and 
thus potential candidates should be active as well, even if not all of them might display their highest activity under 
these conditions.
For a detailed characterisation of Cpu TA1 and MgiTA1 purified protein (0.05–0.25 mg mL
−1) was used. 
Different amines, (R)-1-phenylethylamine, benzylamine, (R )-1-phenylpropylamine, (R )-1-aminotetralin, and 
(R)-1-aminoindane were tested.
For the determination of the optimal pH and buffer conditions, different buffers were used at a standard 
concentration of 50 mM: KPi buffer, pH 6.0, 6.5, 7.0, 7.5 and 8.0; Tris/HCl, pH 7.0, 7.5, 8.0, 8.5 and 9.0; Hepes, 
pH 7.5 and 8.0; glycine, pH 8.5, 9.0, 9.5; carbonate pH 9.2, 9.5 and 10.1. The optimal reaction temperature was 
ascertained between 15° and 45 °C in 50 mM KPi, pH 8. The reaction mixtures (without pyruvate) were preincu-
bated in the photometer for five min at the respective temperature to ensure constant conditions before starting 
the reaction by the addition of pyruvate.
D-ATA-assay. An LDH (lactate dehydrogenase from rabbit, Sigma) coupled activity assay was performed in a 
photometer at 25 °C at 340 nm following the depletion of NADH (extinction coefficient of NADH =  6.22 mM−1 
cm−1). One mL of reaction volume contained 5 mM α -ketoglutaric acid, 5 mM D- or L-alanine, 0.5 mM NADH, 
40 mU LDH in 50 mM KPi, pH 7.5, and cell-free lysate (0.05–0.0025 mg mL−1 total lysate protein). E. coli lysate 
without heterologous transaminase was used as negative control and the obtained slope was subtracted to correct 
for nonspecific oxidation of NADH.
BCAT-assay. A GDH (glutamate dehydrogenase from bovine, Sigma) coupled activity assay 40 was performed 
in a photometer at 30 °C at 340 nm following the formation of NADH. One mL of reaction volume contained 
10 mM α -ketoglutaric acid, 5 mM L-amino acids (L-leucine, L-isoleucine, L-valine, L-phenylalanine, L-alanine, 
L-methionine, L-serine, L-norleucine, L-norvaline). 0.1 mM PLP , 0.5 mM NAD+, 1 U GDH in 50 mM KPi, pH 8, 
with cell-free lysate (0.125 mg mL−1 total lysate protein).
General procedure for reactions of amines with α-keto acids. As a representative example, 20 mM 
rac-1-phenylethylamine (250 μ L, contains 100 mM KPi, pH 7.5 adjusted with ortho-phosphoric acid), 100 mM 
sodium pyruvate (100 μ L), 10 mM PLP (5 μ L) and 100 mM KPi, pH 7.5 (145-X μ L) were mixed in 1.5 mL reaction 
tubes and incubated at 30 °C while shaking at 500 rpm. After 10 min, the reaction was started by the addition of 
lysate (X μ L containing 1.0 mg of total protein) and the shaking speed maintained at 800 rpm.
Analysis of reactions. An aliquot of the reaction solution (10 μ L) was mixed with 10 mM Marfey’s reagent 
Nα-(2,4-dinitro-5-fluorophenyl)- l-alaninamide in acetonitrile (25  μ L, 2.5 eq.) and 1.0 M NaHCO 3 (10 μ L) 
in an 1.5 mL reaction tube and heated under shaking at 50 °C for 2 h. After cooling, methanol (10 μ L) and 
4 M HCl (3 μ L) were added. Following centrifugation (2 min at 15700 ×  g), the derivatised sample was ana-
lysed by rp-HPLC at a detection wavelength of 340 nm. For HPLC analysis conditions refer to Table S4-5. 
For higher concentrated amine solutions, lower amounts of samples were used under otherwise identical 
conditions.
Crystal structure determination. Screening for crystallisation conditions was performed with 
an Oryx8 robot (Douglas Instruments) using Morpheus Screen MD 1-46, JCSG+   MD1-37 (Molecular 
Dimensions) and Index HT HR2-144 (Hampton Research) by the sitting drop vapour-diffusion method in 
96-well plates. A stock solution of Cpu TA1 at 12 mg mL−1 (10 mM Tris/HCl, pH 8) and 5 mM pyridoxal 5′ 
-phosphate hydrate (Sigma Aldrich) was used for all crystallisation experiments. Additional co-crystallisation 
screens with the inhibitor 3-amino benzoic acid (3-ABA) (10 mM) were setup. Drops of 1 μ L were pipetted for 
screens and optimisations with an 1:1 ratio of protein and screening solution. The crystallisation plates were 
incubated at 289 K.
Initial crystals of CpuTA1 were obtained in several crystallisation conditions and diffracted to 4 Å resolution 
at best. Micro-seeding experiments
41 were set up using those initial crystals of CpuTA1 (Morpheus Screen #13)  
as seeding stock (1:1000 diluted). In these trials a new crystal form appeared in 3-ABA co-crystallisation screens 
after two weeks in Index condition 27 [2.4 M sodium malonate pH 7.0] using 10% of microseeds. Data collec-
tion was performed on the synchrotron beamlines (Elettra, Trieste, Italy and EMBL, Grenoble, France) at 100 K 
without additional cryoprotectant. The data sets were processed and scaled using the XDS program package
42.  
Molecular replacement was performed with Phaser 43 using the structure of a putative aminotransferase 
(NCgl2491) from Corynebacterium glutamicum ATCC 13032 (PDB 3SNO, Joint Center for Structural Genomics)

the PHENIX software suite46. Data collection and processing statistics are summarised in Table 4.
