A potent anticancer drug, doxorubicin (DOX), has substantial off-target hepatotoxicity, which limits 
its clinical use. The current study aimed to investigate the hepatoprotective effect of aegeline against 
DOX- induced hepatotoxicity in rats. Four groups of rats were randomly divided into following: Group 
I- Control (saline), group II - DOX, group III DOX + aegeline (5 mg/kg/p.o.), and group IV DOX + aegeline 
(10 mg/kg/p.o.). Various biochemical parameters such as alanine transaminase (AL T), aspartate 
transaminase (AST), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), total bilirubin, oxidative stress markers such as 
superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), glutathione (GSH), malondialdehyde (MDA), nitric oxide 
(NO), inflammatory markers such as interleukin-6 (IL-6), interleukin-1β (IL-1β), tumor necrosis factor α 
(TNF-α), nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-κB) and apoptosis markers, i.e. Bax (Bcl-2-associated X protein), 
B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl2), caspase-3 and caspase-9 were performed. Additionally, histopathology 
and molecular docking were performed. Administration of aegeline at both tested doses led to a 
significant (P < 0.05) reduction in liver enzyme levels such as AL T, ALP , and AST—in rats with DOX-
induced hepatotoxicity, indicating improved liver function. Antioxidant defenses were also markedly 
enhanced in the aegeline-treated groups, as evidenced by increased levels of GSH, SOD, and CAT 
compared to the DOX-only group. In terms of inflammation, aegeline treatment significantly (P < 0.05) 
lowered the concentrations of key inflammatory cytokines, including IL-6, IL-1β, TNF-α, and the 
transcription factor NF-κB. This suggests a strong anti-inflammatory effect. Regarding apoptosis, the 
expression levels of pro-apoptotic markers—Caspase-3, Caspase-9, and Bax were notably decreased 
in the aegeline-treated rats, while levels of the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2 were elevated, pointing 
to a protective role against DOX-induced cell death. Molecular docking analysis further supported 
these findings, showing favorable interactions between aegeline and several target proteins. Notably, 
aegeline exhibited the strongest binding affinity with Bcl-2 (− 6.568 kcal/mol), primarily through 
hydrophobic interactions, suggesting potential molecular targets contributing to its therapeutic 
effects. The present study accredited the hepatoprotective effect of aegeline (5 and 10 mg/kg) by 
ameliorating Dox-induced hepatotoxicity in an experimental animal model.

 Liver toxicity, also known as hepatotoxicity, is a pathological condition characterized by hepatic cellular damage 
resulting from exposure to xenobiotic substances, such as pharmaceuticals, environmental toxins, or industrial 
chemicals. Drug-induced liver injury (DILI) is a major etiological factor in liver dysfunction, manifesting as a 
spectrum of clinical presentations, ranging from asymptomatic elevations in liver enzymes (transaminitis) to 
acute or chronic hepatitis, cholestasis, and ultimately, hepatic failure 1. Numerous pharmacological classes are 
implicated in DILI, including nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, anti-infective agents (e.g., anti-tubercular 
drugs), antineoplastic agents, hormonal therapies, immunosuppressants, and neuropsychiatric medications. The

pathophysiological mechanisms of hepatic injury can be categorized as hepatocellular, cholestatic, or mixed 
(exhibiting characteristics of both). Cholestatic injury frequently arises from the parent drug compound or its 
metabolites, which interfere with hepatobiliary transporter systems essential for bile formation, as well as the 
secretion of cholephilic compounds and xenobiotics2.
Doxorubicin (DOX) is an orange-red, water-soluble, crystalline solid derived from Streptomyces peucetius. 
It is highly potent as an anticancer agent and is used in both powder and injectable liquid forms. DOX is a 
common chemotherapeutic medication used to treat various carcinomas, including lymphomas, leukemias, 
breast carcinomas, ovarian carcinomas, thyroid carcinomas, and lung carcinomas. It is a member of the 
anthracyclines class of chemicals3,4. Daunorubicin, an antibiotic that fights tumors in mice, was created from a 
red pigment taken from the Streptococcus peucetius strain. This Streptococcus strain produced DOX (also known 
as Adriamycin) through additional genetic manipulation, also referred to as DOX.
DOX has a wide range of therapeutic effects4. Although it is generally known that DOX can penetrate the cell 
nucleus and disrupt DNA replication by blocking topoisomerase II, the molecular mechanisms behind its anti-
cancer activities are complex and not fully understood 5. Additionally, DOX produces reactive oxygen species 
(ROS) as a result of redox cycling 3,6 and harm to the DNA, proteins, and lipids of cells, which results in cell 
death5.
The liver is one such tissue that DOX adversely affects. Given that up to 40% of patients receiving DOX 
have increased liver enzymes, liver toxicity is a crucial therapeutic issue7. Furthermore, mitochondrial function 
is compromised by DOX-induced ROS in the liver, particularly the superoxide anion 8. However, the precise 
processes underlying DOX-induced hepatotoxicity remain unclear. Thus, the primary goal of this study was 
to investigate the processes underlying DOX-induced liver injury. Interventions to reduce DOX’s toxicity have 
drawn more interest because side effects limit its utility as an anticancer treatment.
Aegeline is an active compund of the Aegle marmelos  plant. The plant’s medicinal properties 
and the existence of bioactive substances have been thoroughly investigated. A. Marmelos , one of 
its numerous pharmacological characteristics, is antiproliferative 9antipyretic, anti-inflammatory, 
analgesic10antioxidant11antifungal12hypoglycemic13and antidiabetes14. Due to its beneficial medicinal effects, 
attention must be paid to its development.
The study’s rationale is that until now, no study has reported that aegeline ameliorates Dox-induced 
hepatotoxicity. In our research, we investigated the beneficial effects of aegeline on Dox-induced hepatotoxicity, 
focusing on the roles of pro-inflammatory cytokines, oxidative stress, and apoptotic pathways.
Methodology
Chemicals
Aegeline (> 98.0%) and DOX (≥ 98%, C₂₇H₂₉NO₁₁, Mol. Wt. 543.52 g/mol) were obtained from MSW Pharma, 
M.S., India. Tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α, KB3145), interleukin-1β (IL-1β, KLR0119), interleukin-6 (IL-6, 
KB3068), and nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-κB, KLR0287) were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent 
assay (ELISA) kits, procured from Krishgen Biosystem, M.S., India. Bcl-2 associated X protein (MSW-BAX), 
B-cell lymphoma 2 (MSW-Bcl2), caspase-3 (MSW-Cap-3), and caspase-9 (MSW-Cap-9) levels were measured 
by ELISA kits, procured from MSW Pharma, M.S., India.
Experiment layout
Ten to twelve-week-old male Wistar rats were housed in a central animal facility, temperature-controlled 
environment (25 ± 2 °C) with a 12-hour light/dark cycle and given food and water ad libitum in Batterjee Medical 
College, Jeddah. The study rats were obtained from the central animal house facility of Batterjee Medical College 
Jeddah. The study was conducted with the ARRIVE guidelines 15and approved by the Institutional Research 
Board, Batterjee Medical College, Jeddah (RES-2025-0024). The experiments were performed in accordance 
with the guidelines of the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at Batterjee Medical College, Jeddah. 
The rats were given two weeks to become accustomed to their environment before the test.
A total of 24 rats were simply randomized into four groups (n = 6)16,17.
Group 1: Control (normal saline)
Group 2: Single dose of DOX (20 mg/kg i.p.) 16, 17
Group 3: DOX + aegeline (5 mg/kg orally)
Group 4: DOX + aegeline (10 mg/kg orally)
20 days
Blood and liver samples were obtained at the final stage of the study for additional biochemical, oxidative 
stress, apoptotic markers, and histological investigations.
Sample collection and preparation
Following 24 h after the DOX injection, blood specimens were extracted 18. The blood was then allowed to clot 
for 30 min, after which it was chilled for 4 h to remove the serum and subsequently stored at −20 °C to measure 
various biochemical variables.
The ketamine and xylazine at 50 and 10 mg/kg were used, and scarification of the rats via cervical dislocation, 
and the liver was removed, cleansed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and dried. Hepatic tissue 
homogenates were made by homogenizing liver tissue in ice-cold PBS (pH 7.4). After centrifuging the

homogenates (REMI Instruments, India) at 825 × g for 15 min at 4 °C, the clear supernatants were removed 
and stored at −20 °C for later use in estimating hepatic oxidative and antioxidant variables. Immediately after 
the sacrifice, liver tissue was taken and weighed. An additional liver part was taken out and kept at −80 °C. 
Histopathology analyses were performed using liver tissues.
Evaluation of serum biochemical profile
The serum specimens were obtained using a bioanalyzer (UV-Shimadzu, India), and the amounts of alanine 
transaminase (ALT), aspartate transaminase (AST), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), and total bilirubin were 
estimated. All kits were bought via a local vendor (Modern Lab, Wani, M.S., India).
Assay of oxidative stress and antioxidants
Utilising readily accessible sets and following the manufacturer’s directions, the amounts of malondialdehyde 
(MSW-MDA), catalase (MSW-CAT), glutathione (MSW-GSH), and superoxide dismutase (MSW-SOD) (MSW 
Pharma, M.S., India) were measured in liver homogenates using a UV spectrophotometer (Shimadzu, India)19.
Assessment of inflammatory markers
IL-6, IL-1β, TNF-α, and NF-κB levels were assessed using standard ELISA kits. ELISA kits are microwell plate-
based assays with pre-coated antibodies (Merilyzer Eiaquant, MLS Pvt. Ltd., India)19.
Assay of apoptotic indices
The detection of Bax, Bcl-2, Caspase-3, and Caspase-9 markers was performed using commercially available and 
standardised ELISA kits, which are specifically designed for the detection of proteins involved in cell death. An 
ELISA method for detecting specific antigens using antibodies.
Histopathology
Samples of the liver were obtained to evaluate the histological dysregulations caused by DOX. Tissues from the 
liver were preserved in a 10% formalin solution. The conserved tissues were dehydrated using higher degrees of 
ethanol. The tissues were then preserved in paraffin wax. Paraffin blocks were cut into 4–5 μm slices by a rotating 
microtome. These tiny fragments were put on glass slides, stained with hematoxylin-eosin, and viewed at 200X 
magnification using a light microscope.
Molecular docking
Ligand preparation and optimization
The design and optimization of the synthetic compounds were performed using MarvinSketch (ChemAxon, 
version 22.13). Two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) molecular structures were subjected to 
hydrogen atom addition and structural refinement. Following this, conformational analysis was conducted, and 
the conformer exhibiting the lowest energy was selected for subsequent investigation. The 3D structures (Mol2 
files) were prepared for molecular docking using the DockPrep module within Chimera (version 1.17.1, build 
42449). This process employed default parameters, including the assignment of protonation states based on 
AM1-BCC calculations during conjugate gradient optimization.
Protein preparation
Crystallographic structures for key proteins involved in apoptosis and inflammation were obtained from the 
Research Collaboratory for Structural Bioinformatics Protein Data Bank (https://www.rcsb.org/): BAX (PDB ID: 
4ZIG), BCL2 (PDB ID: 8FY1), CASPASE 3 (PDB ID: 5IAG), and CASPASE 9 (PDB ID: 1NW9). Validation of 
these structures included assessment of resolution, wwPDB scores, analysis of missing residues within binding 
sites via PDBsum (  h t t p s :  / / w w w .  e b i . a c  . u k / t h  o r n t o  n - s r v /  d a t a b a  s e s / p d  b s u m /), and evaluation of backbone 
dihedral angles using Ramachandran plots (Fig.  1). Residues comprising the active sites were identified and 
depicted in Table  1. Prior to docking, the raw PDB files were prepared using the DockPrep module within 
UCSF Chimera. This involved the removal of extraneous residues, the addition of hydrogen atoms, and charge 
assignment to optimize the structures for subsequent application of the AMBER force field. The refined structures 
were then exported in PDB format. Conversion to PDBQT format, compatible with AutoDock, was performed 
using AutoDockTools (version 1.5.6) from The Scripps Research Institute.
Grid parameters
Molecular docking was performed to investigate the binding interactions between a target protein and ligand(s). 
AutoDockTools 1.5.63 was utilized for docking simulations. Grid parameter, including the definition of grid 
center and dimensions, was achieved using Chimera and Maestro. For proteins in a co-crystallized state, grid 
parameters were derived from the orientation of the co-crystallized ligand. In the absence of a co-crystal 
structure (Apo state), the CASTp6 server was employed to determine the appropriate grid center. In all cases, a 
consistent grid point spacing of 0.375 Å was implemented (Table 2).
Molecular docking simulation
Molecular docking simulations were performed using AutoDock Vina (version 1.2.6) (  h t t p s :  / / g i t h  u b . c o m  / c c s 
b -  s c r i p  p s / A u t  o D o c k -  V i n a / r  e l e a s  e s / d o w  n l o a d /  v 1 . 2 . 6  / v i n a _ 1 . 2 . 6 _ w i n . e x e) on a Windows operating system 20,21. 
Simulations were conducted in triplicate with varying grid box dimensions to ensure reproducibility and 
assess the robustness of the docking protocol. Predefined parameters governed the simulations, including 
central processing unit (CPU) utilization, grid size, search effort, the number of poses generated, and energy 
constraints. Post-docking analysis involved custom Python scripts, utilizing functionalities from AutoDock

Tools, to extract and organize the docking output and generate separate protein and ligand coordinate files. 
Visualization and analysis of protein-ligand complexes were subsequently performed using Discovery Studio, 
Protein-Ligand Interaction Profiler (PLIP) (  h t t p s :  / / p l i p  - t o o l .  b i o t e c  . t u - d  r e s d e n  . d e / p l  i p - w e b  / p l i p / i n d e x) and

Visualization
Protein-ligand complex structures were visualized and analyzed in silico. Two-dimensional (2D) and three-
dimensional (3D) interaction maps were generated using Biovia Discovery Studio and Maestro (version 12.3, 
academic edition).
Statistical interpretation
A statistical software application was used for the data evaluation. The resulting values were illustrated as 
mean ± SE. GraphPad, version 8.0.2, was used to assess normally distributed data by using the Shapiro-Wilk test. 
After passing the test, apply the One-way ANOV A followed by Tukey`s post hoc test. The level of significance 
was considered at P < 0.05.
Results
Body weight
Compared to the controls, the DOX-induced group resulted in a significant decrease (P < 0.0001) in body weight 
throughout the experiment while increasing both absolute and relative liver weight (Fig.  2A-B). According to 
these findings, aegeline counteracts the significant effects of DOX on the liver [F (3, 20) = 6.407, (P = 0.0032)] and 
body weight [F (3, 40) = 22.19, (P < 0.0001)] compared to DOX-induced group.

20) = 47.22, (P < 0.0001)], AST [F (3, 20) = 39.06, (P < 0.0001)], ALP [F (3, 20) = 23.09, (P < 0.0001)], and total 
bilirubin [F (3, 20) = 10.30, (P = 0.0003)] levels, compared to DOX group (Fig. 3A-D).
Oxidative marker
This indicator was utilized to evaluate the activity of antioxidant enzymes. GSH, SOD, and CAT levels were 
significantly lower in the DOX-induced group than in the control group. Both doses of aegeline markedly 
increase the GSH [F (3, 20) = 7.22, ( P = 0.0018), SOD [F (3, 20) = 6.427, ( P = 0.0032)], and CAT level [F (3, 
20) = 7.22, (P = 0.0001)] compared to DOX-induced group (Fig.  3A-C). In comparison with a control group, 
DOX considerably raised the hepatic MDA value. While aegeline at doses markedly lowered the MDA levels [F 
(3,20) = 7.710, (P = 0.0013)] than the DOX-induced group (Fig. 4A-D).
Estimation of inflammatory markers
The anti-inflammatory effect was assessed using the neuroinflammatory cytokines. Rats treated with DOX 
exhibited higher levels of TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6, and NF-κB than control rats. When aegeline (5 and 10 mg/kg) was 
administered, the amount of NF-κB [F (3, 20) = 20.64, (P < 0.0001)], IL-1β [F (3, 20) = 40.86, (P < 0.0001)], IL-6 [F 
(3, 20) = 38.51 (P < 0.0001)] and TNF-α [F (3, 20) = 55.44, (P < 0.0001)] markedly decreased than DOX-induced 
rats (Fig. 5A–D).
Assessment of apoptosis marker
Comparing the DOX group to the control group, there was a substantial rise in caspase-3, caspase-9, Bax, and 
reduced Bcl2 activity. On the other hand, aegeline reverses the apoptotic modifications of Bcl2 [F (3, 20) = 8.613, 
(P = 0.0007)], Bax [F (3, 20) = 15.91, (P < 0.0001)], caspase-9 [F (3, 20) = 15.50, (P < 0.0001)], and caspase-3 [F (3, 
20) = 13.52, (P < 0.0001)] in liver tissue caused by DOX. (Fig. 6A-D).
Histopathological injury examination
Histological examination revealed that the liver morphology of rats of control rats was found a normal 
architecture (Fig.  7A-D). The injection of DOX altered the structure of the liver, showing focal hemorrhage 
in the peri-portal triad severe. Treatment with aegeline demonstrated reduced hepatocyte cells damage and 
histological alterations. Compared to the control group, histological scores increased significantly in the 
DOX group, indicating severe damage. While aegeline treatment significantly decreased histological scores as 
associated DOX group, indicating a protective effect against DOX in the liver [F (3, 20) = 12.04, (P < 0.0001)] 
(Fig. 7E).
Molecular docking
The molecular docking studies revealed significant binding energies of Aegeline with various target proteins 
(Table 4). The binding energy for BAX (PDB ID: 4ZIG) was − 7.47  kcal/mol, indicating strong hydrophobic 
interactions with residues such as ILE19A, THR22A, LEU26A, and others. For BCL2 (PDB ID: 8FY1), the 
binding energy was − 6.568 kcal/mol, with hydrophobic interactions and hydrogen bonds involving residues like 
PHE76A, TRP88A, and TYR98A. CASPASE 3 (PDB ID: 5IAG) showed a binding energy of −6.916 kcal/mol, 
with hydrophobic interactions, hydrogen bonds, and π-stacking involving residues such as TYR204A, TRP206A, 
and ARG207A. CASPASE 9 (PDB ID: 1NW9) had a binding energy of −6.888  kcal/mol, with hydrophobic 
interactions, hydrogen bonds, and π-stacking involving residues like LEU244B, ARG258A, and TYR324A. 
Figure 8 presents the 2D and 3D images of aegeline after molecular docking.
Discussion
Chemotherapy drugs have been linked to liver damage in recent years due to advances in medical knowledge22. 
By performing metabolic and detoxifying functions, the liver, the body’s largest detoxifying organ, contributes to 
the maintenance of regular organ function throughout the body. The liver has consequently become a prime 
target for drug damage. These consist of methotrexate, oxaliplatin, irinotecan, and the most often-used 
hepatotoxic drugs22. Although these medicines are necessary to treat cancer, there are risks and possible side 
effects associated with them. DOX is hepatotoxic and a potent antitumor drug that combats a range of cancer 
types4,23. Even though DOX is a commonly used basic chemotherapeutic medication in clinical practice, its 
effects on the liver cannot be ignored. Previous studies have shown that DOX generates a large amount of ROS 
during liver metabolism. This results in a redox imbalance, increased oxidative stress, a decreased amount of 
antioxidant enzymes, and the promotion of inflammation and apoptosis 4,24,25. DOX-induced hepatotoxicity, 
these processes interact with one another and collectively lead to liver damage. The intricate process not only 
clarifies the potential impacts of DOX on the liver but also provides insights for developing new hepatoprotective 
techniques that may be more effective in mitigating DOX-induced liver damage 26. Thus, research has been 
conducted on the use of herbal items to avoid the negative effects of chemotherapy27. According to these studies, 
plant extracts with varying chemical compositions may mitigate the adverse effects of DOX. We postulated that 
aegeline anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties would help reduce DOX-induced liver damage. In the 
present study, rats treated with DOX showed a significant decline in their final body weight compared to the 
control group. Previous studies have revealed that DOX is associated with a significant reduction in rats’ body 
weight, which is consistent with our findings 28. The decrease in body weight gain may have resulted from the 
chemotherapeutic drug’s direct toxic effects on renal tubules, which reduced water absorption and caused 
disproportionate salt excretion, leading to dehydration, polyuria, and a decrease in body weight29or it could be 
the result of gastrointestinal toxicity, which would reduce appetite, food intake, and assimilation29. On the other 
hand, rats given aegeline (5 and 10 mg/kg) exhibited a discernible increase in body weight. Aegeline at doses of 
5 and 10 mg/kg improved organ weight and restored body weight compared to the control group. An important

bodily organ, the liver remains engaged in the digestion of food and drugs, detoxification, glucose homeostasis, 
blood coagulation regulation, albumin production, bile synthesis, and the absorption of vitamins and minerals30. 
Liver enzymes are naturally present in liver tissues and play a crucial role in regulating various bodily chemical 
processes, including the metabolism of medications. The liver function test is a collection of liver enzyme tests 
used to measure and track the integrity of the liver enzymes. ALP , AST, and ALT are commonly used liver

function tests30. These tests are useful for establishing a variety of assessments and highlighting a part of the liver 
where damage may occur, depending on the pattern of elevation 30. Some of these tests are related to cellular 
integrity (such as transaminase), others to functionality (such as albumin), and still others to the biliary tract 
(such as ALP)31. These liver enzymes are frequently increased in liver disease or injury because they are released 
from the hepatic cells, which normally store them in the bloodstream32. When the liver is damaged, the enzymes

AST and ALT, which reside within hepatocytes, are released, and ALP , which is also present in the cell lining of 
the liver’s bile ducts, increases32. Chemotherapeutic treatments for cancer, particularly alkylating agents and the 
infamous DOX, are known to change the way liver enzymes function and raise their levels in the blood33. A rise 
in serum ALT and AST activity and total bilirubin in DOX-induced rats relative to the adverse influence in this 
investigation demonstrated DOX-induced hepatotoxicity, indicating significant liver damage. These results are 
entirely consistent with those of other investigations34–39. However, by lowering the levels of total bilirubin and

serum ALT, aegeline restored the liver damage. However, aegeline significantly reduced the serum AST levels in 
the DOX-intoxicated rats, as indicated by the study’s findings. This finding raises the possibility that extra-
hepatic sources may be responsible for the high AST levels. Since AST can have extrahepatic activity and is also 
prevalent in extrahepatic tissues such as skeletal muscle, kidneys, brain, erythrocytes, and lungs, research 
indicates that ALT is a more accurate and specific indicator of liver illness or toxicity than AST 40. Therefore, 
these extrahepatic sources may be the cause of the markedly high serum AST levels. In line with the findings of 
earlier research, our investigation revealed that DOX-intoxicated rats exhibited substantial increases in serum 
AST at 5 and 10 mg/kg aegeline 30,41. However, aegeline markedly lowered serum ALT and ALP levels. These 
results demonstrate aegeline ability to protect against DOX-induced hepatotoxicity. Several different processes 
contribute to the intricate mechanisms behind DOX-induced hepatotoxicity. According to recent studies, 
oxidative stress is one important mechanism of oxidation-induced hepatotoxicity 42. It has been demonstrated 
that DOX induces redox homeostasis imbalance, distinguished by a decline in antioxidant defenses and an 
increase in ROS, which leads to lipid peroxidation and liver injury43,44. SOD and GSH are essential endogenous

antioxidants that shield cells from oxidative damage, while MDA is the primary byproduct of lipid peroxidation, 
which is considered a specific biomarker of oxidative injury 45,46. Conforming to earlier findings, the present 
study demonstrated that DOX induced an increase in liver MDA levels, while decreasing SOD and GSH levels 
in liver tissues47,48. Aegeline administration significantly improved the DOX-induced increase in SOD and GSH 
levels and reduced the MDA caused by DOX. According to these results, aegeline therapy can shield the liver 
from oxidative damage brought on by DOX. The current investigation revealed that the levels of inflammatory 
cytokines (IL-6, IL-β, TNF-α, and NF-κB) in hepatic tissues were elevated following DOX administration. The 
production of inflammatory cytokines, which in turn cause hepatic inflammation, is mediated by the stimulation 
of the cytosolic protein complex (NF-κB) clarified that oxidative damage brought on by DOX poisoning causes 
the blood to release inflammatory cytokines49,50. Our findings demonstrated that aegeline significantly decreased 
these inflammatory levels in hepatic tissues due to the antioxidative properties against oxidative stress. Numerous 
studies have demonstrated that the primary mechanism of DOX-induced liver damage is apoptosis, which is 
cells’ ordered and spontaneous demise following normal or pathological activation51. The two most significant 
regulators in the process are Bax (proapoptotic) and Bcl-2 (antiapoptotic), whose ratio can somewhat indicate 
the level of apoptosis. The final executor of apoptosis is thought to be caspase-3, the hinge component of 
apoptosis51,52. Consistent with previous findings, the present study demonstrated that DOX administration 
significantly increased the Bax, caspase-3, caspase-9 and decreased Bcl-2 levels in liver tissues 51. Aegeline 
treatment dramatically decreased the Bax, caspase-3, caspase-9 and increased Bcl-2 by DOX-induced group. 
These results suggest that aegeline may prevent DOX-induced apoptosis. Additionally, it is advantageous in the 
inflammatory response in this study due to its inhibitory influence on inflammatory mediators. Changes in the 
regulation of the most significant clinical liver enzymes and the preservation of normal liver histology further 
highlight these effects. Furthermore, a molecular docking study confirmed and demonstrated aegeline significant 
affinity for target proteins. Bax exhibited strong hydrophobic interactions. Bcl-2 showed a lower binding energy 
due to hydrophobic interactions and hydrogen bonds. Caspase-3 also exhibited lower binding energy due to 
hydrophobic interactions, hydrogen bonds, and π-stacking. Caspase-9 had a lower binding energy with 
hydrophobic interactions, hydrogen bonds, and π-stacking. These findings indicate Aegeline’s potential 
therapeutic efficacy, with the observed interactions contributing to binding stability and specificity. DOX 
accumulates in hepatocytes, resulting in lipid peroxidation, mitochondrial dysfunction, and the release of pro-
apoptotic factors. The collapse of antioxidant defences leads to a decrease in glutathione, superoxide dismutase, 
and catalase, while levels of malondialdehyde and nitric oxide rise, further compromising cellular integrity. 
Simultaneously, NF-κb activation promotes the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-6, IL-1β, TNF-α), 
creating a cycle of oxidative and inflammatory damage. At the mitochondrial level, the dynamics shift towards 
apoptosis as Bax expression increases, Bcl-2 levels drop, and caspase-9 and caspase-3 are activated, culminating 
in programmed cell death and pronounced hepatocellular damage, evidenced by elevated serum ALT, AST, ALP , 
and total bilirubin. When aegeline is administered alongside DOX, it appears to disrupt these harmful cascades 
at various stages. The phenolic moiety of aegeline likely scavenges free radicals, thereby preventing lipid 
peroxidation and preserving glutathione, SOD, and CAT activities. By stabilising the cellular redox balance, 
aegeline also reduces NF-κb translocation to the nucleus, resulting in decreased transcription of IL-6, IL-1β, and

TNF-α. The overall outcome is a significant reduction in inflammatory signaling within the liver. At the same 
time, aegeline modulates apoptotic proteins: it maintains Bcl-2 expression while inhibiting Bax, caspase-9, and 
caspase-3 activation, thus preserving mitochondrial integrity and reducing hepatocyte apoptosis. Molecular 
docking studies indicate that aegeline interacts favourably with Bcl-2 (−6.568  kcal/mol) via hydrophobic 
contacts, suggesting that direct engagement of these targets is key to its anti-inflammatory and anti-apoptotic 
effects. In summary, aegeline’s capability to restore antioxidant defences, inhibit inflammatory pathways, and 
sustain anti-apoptotic signaling comes together to protect the liver from DOX-induced damage.
The study’s limitations include its short-term nature and the use of small number of animals. Additional 
immunochemistry, genetic models, western blotting, and Masson trichome/Sirius red labeling will be required 
to record collagen in liver sections.
Conclusion
Our study demonstrates that aegeline protects rats from DOX-Induced hepatotoxicity and may be a helpful 
therapeutic agent. Aegeline contains antioxidant molecules that work in harmony to prevent DOX-induced 
oxidative stress, which may be the cause of the observed defensive potential. More research is necessary to 
determine the exact mechanism by which aegeline mediates its therapeutic impact and enables its usage as a 
treatment for several other linked disorders.
