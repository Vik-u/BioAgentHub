A microbioreactor was developed in which selected amine transaminase was immobilized
together with the cofactor pyridoxal phosphate (PLP) to allow ef ﬁcient continuous
transamination. The enzyme and cofactor were retained in a porous copolymeric
hydrogel matrix formed in a two-plate microreactor with an immobilization efﬁciency of
over 97%. After 10 days of continuous operation, 92% of the initial productivity was
retained and no leaching of PLP or enzyme from the hydrogel was observed. The
microbioreactor with co-immobilized cofactor showed similar performance with and
without the addition of exogenous PLP, suggesting that the addition of PLP is not
required during the process. The space-time yield of the microbioreactor was 19.91 g
L
−1 h−1, while the highest achieved biocatalyst productivity was 5.4 mg mgenzyme
−1 h−1.
The immobilized enzyme also showed better stability over a wider pH and temperature
range than the free enzyme. Considering the time and cost efﬁciency of the immobilization
process and the possibility of capacity expansion, such a system is of great potential for
industrial application.

INTRODUCTION
Biocatalytic processes are becoming increasingly important in modern chemistry as they enable more
environmentally friendly production of various value-added molecules. The use of biocatalysts
reduces the waste generated in the process (E-factor), lowers energy consumption, allows operation
at mild process conditions, often uses water as the reaction medium, and eliminates the need for
metal-based catalysts, which are usually problematic (Sheldon and Woodley, 2018; Aguilar et al.,
2019). The introduction of continuous operation in biocatalytic processes, i.e.,ﬂow biocatalysis, can
also meet the requirements for sustainable process design and process intensiﬁcation (Žnidaršič-
Plazl, 2021). The main challenges in the industrial implementation of biocatalysts include improved
biocatalyst stability, cofactor regeneration/retention, and more efﬁcient reactor design (Bolivar and
López-Gallego, 2020), all of which are considered in this work.
The use of microﬂow systems in biotechnology has increased dramatically in recent years, as
microreactor technology offers several advantages over conventional methods, especially in
establishing continuous, i.e., ﬂow processes. A larger surface-to-volume ratio allows for
improved mass and heat transport with better temporal and spatial control, while surface
modiﬁcations and the use of nanostructured materials lead to a larger surface area for enzyme

immobilization (Wohlgemuth et al., 2015; Žnidaršič-Plazl, 2017;
Tamborini et al., 2018). Enzyme immobilization plays a key role
in ﬂow biocatalysis by allowing the catalyst to remain in the
reactor while being continuously supplied with reagents.
Immobilization often increases the stability of the enzyme and
simpliﬁes product work-up (Romero-Fernández and Paradisi,
2020; Sheldon et al., 2021). In biocatalytic processes where the
cofactor regenerates itself during the reaction, its co-
immobilization is of great importance as it eliminates the need
for its exogenous addition and stabilizes the enzyme structure.
Together with miniaturization, the long-term use of enzyme and
cofactor contributes decisively to the intensi ﬁcation of
biocatalytic processes (Žnidaršič-Plazl, 2021).
Amine transaminases are enzymes that have great potential for
the industrial production of optically active amines that enable the
synthesis of various classes of biologically active compounds such
as agrochemicals and pharmaceuticals (Kelly et al., 2018). The
mechanism of enzymatic transamination consists of two half-
reactions in which the cofactor pyridoxal-5′-phosphate (PLP) is
regenerated and the amine acceptor/donor is converted to the
corresponding amine/ketone ( Weber et al., 2017 ). PLP is
responsible for binding the amine moiety in the transamination
step and acts as an enzyme stabilizing additive at higher substrate
concentrations (Park et al., 2013). In addition to the successful co-
immobilization of enzyme and cofactor inﬂow-through systems,
Andrade et al. (2014)reported the development of a 0.5-ml packed-
bed reactor with polymeric methacrylate beads for entrapment of
Escherichia colicells containing amine transaminase and PLP. A
very stable continuous synthesis of chiral amines in organic
reaction media was demonstrated, preventing leaching of the
PLP cofactor. Another self-sufﬁcient transamination system was
presented by the group of López-Gallego (Benítez-Mateos et al.,
2018), in which the enzyme and PLP were co-immobilized on
different porous supports or in cross-linked enzyme aggregates by
adding polyethylenimine (PEI) to achieve electrostatic interactions
of PLP with the supports and prevent PLP leaching. On the other
hand, little success was achieved in the cell-free biocatalytic
synthesis of
L-pipecolic acid by co-immobilization of lysine-6-
dehydrogenase and pyroline-5-carboxylate reductase with NAD+
in agarose resin using PEI, as leaching of the cofactor over time or
rapid loss of catalytic efﬁciency of the system was observed at
different applied ionic strengths (Padrosa et al., 2020).
One of the simplest and non-invasive techniques to
immobilize biocatalysts is their entrapment in porous
structures by cross-linking different (bio)polymers such as
alginates ( Onbas and Yesil-Celiktas, 2019 ), chitosan ( Kim
et al., 2017), or synthetic polymers such as polyvinyl alcohol
(PVA) (Bajić et al., 2017). We have previously reported the use of
a copolymer hydrogel of PVA and alginate to immobilize yeast
cells. This copolymer showed improved chemical and mechanical
stability compared to alginate hydrogel ( Menegatti and
Žnidaršič-Plazl, 2019; Menegatti et al., 2021). In this work, a
microreactor with copolymer hydrogel was developed and tested
for the continuous model biotransformation of ( S)-
α-methylbenzylamine [(S)- α-MBA] and pyruvate (PYR) to
obtain acetophenone (ACP) and
L-alanine ( L-ALA).
Immobilization ef ﬁciency, productivity, and stability of the
microreactor were evaluated. To the best of our knowledge,
this is the ﬁrst report on hydrogel-based co-immobilization of
a transaminase with a cofactor.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Materials
Sodium alginate (SA), phenylboronic acid (PBA), 2-[4-(2-
hydroxyethyl)piperazin-1-yl]ethanesulfonic acid (Hepes) buffer
(S)-α-methylbenzylamine ((S)-α-MBA), sodium pyruvate (PYR),
acetophenone (ACP),
L-alanine ( L-ALA), and pyridoxal 5 ′-
phosphate (PLP) were all from Sigma Aldrich (St. Louis, MO),
CaCl
2 was from Carlo Erba reagents (Milan, Italy), polyvinyl
alcohol (PVA, MW /equals 13,000– 23,000 Da) was purchased from
Acros Organics (Morris Plains, NJ). The enzyme amine
transaminase ( ATA-v1) was provided by c-LEcta GmbH
(Leipzig, Germany).
Batch Enzyme Activity Measurement
If not stated otherwise, the enzyme activity assays were carried
out using 0.1 mM of PLP and 0.81 mg ml
−1 of free or immobilized
enzyme, 40 mM equimolar solution of(S)-α-methylbenzylamine
((S)-α-MBA) and sodium pyruvate (PYR) in 20 mM Hepes buffer
(pH 8.0) (Miložič et al., 2018). The assays were carried out in
thermostated test tubes at 30°C stirred at 300 rpm. The speciﬁc
activity was expressed in U mgATA-v1
−1, where U was deﬁned as
the amount of enzyme that catalyzes the synthesis of 1 µmol of
ACP per min under described conditions. All assays were
performed in at least 3 replicates.
For the evaluation of pH and thermal stability of the
immobilized enzyme, 0.1 mM PLP and 0.81 mg ml
−1 enzyme
were co-immobilized in copolymer hydrogel beads prepared as
described in Enzyme and Cofactor Co-immobilization in a
Copolymeric Hydrogel. Both the immobilized and free enzyme
(the latter together with 0.1 mM PLP) were incubated for 30 min in
20 mM Hepes buffer at pH values ranging from 5 to 10 and at 25
°C
or in the same buffer with pH 8 and at temperatures ranging from
40 to 70°C. After the incubation period, the enzyme was transferred
to the reaction mixture and the residual enzyme activity was
determined under the standard conditions described above and
compared with the activity before the incubation, where the
reagent solutions were kept at 25
°C before the reaction. Besides,
recovered activity was calculated from the observed activity of the
immobilized enzyme compared to that of the total free enzyme
activity (Sheldon and van Pelt, 2013).
To estimate the temperature effect on biotransformation with free
enzyme, enzyme activity was measured under the above conditions
but at varied temperatures. The temperature was controlled by a
thermostated bath placed on a magnetic stirrer with temperature
control (IKA
®, Staufen, Germany) and it varied from 30 to 80°C.
Enzyme and Cofactor Co-Immobilization in
a Copolymeric Hydrogel
To prepare a copolymer solution, 8% (w/v) PVA and 2% (w/v)
sodium alginate were dissolved in a demineralized water by

Menegatti and Žnidaršič-Plazl Enzyme and Cofactor Co-Immobilization in a Microbioreactor
mixing at 60°C. After cooling to room temperature,ATA-v1 and
PLP were dissolved in Hepes buffer at various concentrations and
mixed with the copolymer solution at a ratio of 1:1 (v/v) to obtain
various ﬁnal enzyme (0.81 and 8.1 mg ml
−1) and PLP ﬁnal
concentrations from 0.1 to 1 mM as indicated in the Results
section. Separately, a crosslinking solution was prepared by
dissolving 2% (w/v) of CaCl
2 and 2% (w/v) phenylboronic
acid (PBA) in demineralized water.
To test the pH and temperature stability of the immobilized
enzyme, the copolymer solution mixed withATA-v1 and PLP in
concentrations to yieldﬁnal concentrations of 0.81 mg ml−1 and
0.1 mM, respectively, was added dropwise through the needle of
0.6 mm inner diameter into a crosslinking solution, which was
continuously stirred to prevent agglomeration of the formed
hydrogel beads. After 60 min of crosslinking, the hydrogel
beads were washed with Hepes buffer and stored for further use.
For immobilization in a microreactor, the mixed solution of
enzyme, PLP, and copolymer was poured into the rectangular
channel excavated into the PMMA plates. The crosslinking
solution was sprayed onto the poured copolymer-buffer
solution containing enzyme and PLP to initiate the
crosslinking process (Figure 1A). After 60 min, the hydrogel
layer formed was thoroughly washed with demineralized water
before use.
Microreactor Set-Up
The structure of the microreactor was described in our previous
work ( Menegatti and Žnidaršič-Plazl, 2019 ). Brie ﬂy, the
microreactor consists of two poly (methyl methacrylate)
(PMMA) plates serving as housings and separated by
polytetraﬂuoroethylene (PTFE) spacers deﬁning the geometry of
the microchannels. In this setup, two PMMA plates had
rectangular hollow chambers with a depth of 200μm, a width
of 25 mm, and a length of 50 mm,ﬁlled with a 200-µm thick
hydrogel layer containing the biocatalyst and a cofactor. The
distance between the two plates in the ﬁnal assembly was
determined by a 0.5-mm thick PTFE spacer, which was cut in
the shape of a rectangular hydrogel with an additional triangular
inlet and outlet part (Figure 1A), as previously described for the
packed bed miniaturized reactors (Bajić et al., 2017; Strniša et al.,
2018). The working volume of the microreactor with one inlet and
one outlet shown inFigures 1A,Bwas measured to be 620 µL.

Menegatti and Žnidaršič-Plazl Enzyme and Cofactor Co-Immobilization in a Microbioreactor
Immobilization Efﬁciency in a Microreactor
Leakage of ATA-v1 and PLP from the hydrogel embedded in a
microreactor as described above was determined by measuring
enzyme activity and PLP concentration in the samples collected at
the outlet of the microbioreactor after Hepes buffer was pumped
through the microbioreactor at theﬂow rate of 50μL min
−1. The
initial enzyme concentration was 0.81 mg ml−1 or 8.1 mg ml−1,
while the initial PLP concentration varied between 0.1 and 1 mM,
as indicated in the Results section. Each sample corresponded to
one reactor volume (620 µL). The activity assay was performed as
described in Batch Enzyme Activity Measurement and the
resulting solutions were analyzed by HPLC as described below,
while PLP was quanti ﬁed spectrophotometrically at 390 nm.
Immobilization yield was calculated from the immobilized
enzyme activity (the total activity in the outlet samples was
subtracted from the starting activity) divided by the starting
enzyme activity in the copolymeric solution. Recovered activity
(%) was calculated from observed activity/free enzyme activity)
(Sheldon and van Pelt, 2013).
Continuous Transamination in a
Microreactor
Unless otherwise indicated, an equimolar 40 mM solution of
(S)-α-MBA and PYR in 20 mM Hepes buffer (pH 8.0) was
pumped in a microbioreactor thermostated in a water bath at
50
°Ca tﬂow rates ranging from 5 to 200μLm i n−1 using a high-
pressure pump from Harvard Apparatus (Holliston, MA) with a
stainless-steel syringe (PHD 4400 Syringe Pump Series) (Bajić
et al., 2017). The enzyme concentrations in the microreactor
were 0.81 and 8.1 mg ml−1 (1.32 and 10.45 U ml−1, respectively),
and the PLP concentrations varied from 0.1 to 1 mM, as
indicated in the Results section. After reaching steady state,
samples were taken from the microbioreactor outlet, quenched
with 0.1 M NaOH, and further analyzed by HPLC as described
below. Gross yields (%) were calculated based on ACP produced
relative to (S)-α-MBA consumed. The space-time yield (STY) or
volumetric productivity was calculated from ACP concentration
in the sample taken from the microreactor outlet divided by the
corresponding residence time. The values of STY were used to
express the relative activity in case of temperature effect
evaluation. Biocatalyst productivity was calculated from STY
considering enzyme loading in the microbioreactor. Recovered
immobilized speciﬁc activities [%] of the immobilized enzyme
were calculated as the coefﬁcient between the speciﬁc activity of
t h ei m m o b i l i z e de n z y m ea n dt h es p e c iﬁc activity of the soluble
one (Velasco-Lozano et al., 2020).
Estimation of Temperature Effect on
Biotransformation in a Microreactor
The effect of temperature on immobilized enzyme was evaluated
in a microbioreactor with co-immobilized ATA-v1 and PLP
submerged into the thermostated water bath at the same
temperatures as for the free enzyme. The reaction was
performed as stated in Continuous Transamination in a
Microreactor with 0.81 mg ml
−1 enzyme and 0.1 mM PLP in
the reactor, while theﬂow rate was set to 50μL min−1 yielding
mean residence time of 30 min. After reaching the steady state,
outlet samples were collected and analyzed by HPLC as described
below. Relative activities (%) were calculated from the results
obtained at tested temperature as compared to the ones obtained
at 50
°C.
Operational Stability Measurement
The operational stability of the microbioreactor system was
evaluated by performing a continuous biotransformation for
several days at 50
°C. The reaction mixture with or without
exogenously added PLP was pumped through the
microbioreactor containing the co-immobilized ATA-v1 and
PLP at a ﬂow rate of 2μL min
−1 for a period of 10 days. The
experiment without exogenously added PLP was also performed
at 30°C. Samples from the microbioreactor outlet were taken daily
and analyzed by HPLC as described below. Operational stability
(%) was expressed as relative volumetric productivity compared
to the one at the start of the experiment.
HPLC Analysis
The concentrations of (S)-α-MBA and ACP were determined
by HPLC analysis. An HPLC with diode array detector
(Shimadzu, Tokyo, Japan) and a Gemini-NX 3 µm C18
110 Å (150 × 4.60 mm) column (Phenomenex, Torrance,
United States) was used for separation and detection of
compounds with the isocratic method. The mobile phase
consisted of 50% (v/v) acetonitrile and 50% (v/v) of 0.1 M
aqueous NaOH solution at pH 11. Theﬂow rate through the
column thermostated at 30
°Cw a s1 m l m i n−1.T h er e t e n t i o n
times for (S)-α-MBA and ACP measured at 260 nm were 2.6
and 3.4 min, respectively.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Stability of Free and Immobilized
Transaminase at Various pH Values and
Temperatures
The pH stability of the free and immobilized transaminase was
compared by measuring the enzyme activity after incubation at
25
°C for 30 min in Hepes buffer at different pH values between 5
and 10. The enzyme was immobilized together with the PLP
cofactor in copolymer hydrogel beads of approximately 1 mm in
size, which were prepared by dropwise addition of a copolymer
solution containing enzyme and cofactor into a crosslinking
solution. The activity of free enzyme at standard conditions
measured at 30
°C in a batch process was 1.7 U/mg, while for
the immobilized enzyme, the activity was 1.08 U/mg. Calculated
recovered activity of immobilized transaminase was 63%, which is
promising regarding literature reports. Up to 40% activity was
recovered forPseudomonas putidaω-transaminase immobilized
in cross-linked enzyme aggregates (CLEAs) or by other
immobilization techniques on different pre-existing matrices,
except for entrapment in silica with 87% recovered activity
(Velasco-Lozano et al., 2020).

Menegatti and Žnidaršič-Plazl Enzyme and Cofactor Co-Immobilization in a Microbioreactor
As can be seen inFigure 2A, the immobilizedATA-v1 retained
over 80% of the initial activity in the pH range of 5– 10, while the
free enzyme had much lower residual activity at pH values below
or above pH 8. This is consistent with the results obtained for His-
tagged ω-transaminase immobilized on magnetic mesoporous
silica nanospheres functionalized with Ni
2+-nitrilotriacetic acid,
where immobilization signiﬁcantly improved thermal and pH
stability (Cao et al., 2017). The better stability of the immobilized
enzyme in a wider pH range than that of the free transaminase
could be due to electrostatic interactions of the carrier with the
main ﬂuid. Alginate and polyvinyl alcohol have negative charges
on their surface, which leads to the attraction of H
+ ions and
results in a less alkaline microenvironment in the porous
hydrogel than in the main solution (Cao et al., 2017).
The thermal stability of the immobilizedATA-v1 also showed
higher retained activities after 30-min incubation period at
elevated temperatures up to 70
°C, as shown in Figure 2B.A t
70°C, the co-immobilizedATA-v1 retained almost 70%, whereas
the free form of the enzyme retained only about half of its initial
activity at this temperature. Similarﬁndings were reported for co-
immobilization of P. putida ω-transaminase and PLP in CLEA
with the addition of PEI, where the residual activity after 30 min
at 70
°C was 70%, but was much lower in the case without PLP co-
immobilization (Velasco-Lozano et al., 2020). On the other hand,
immobilization of the same enzyme by entrapment in silica
having 87% recovered activity resulted in only 5% residual
activity after 30 min incubation at 70
°C( Velasco-Lozano et al.,
2020).
The increased stability of the enzyme could be related to the
presence of PLP during incubation, as the cofactor stabilizes the
quaternary structure of the enzyme and maintains the essential
interactions between the cofactor and the catalytic pocket.
Moreover, the interactions between the alginate and PVA
surface with the enzyme increase the resistance to higher
temperatures in the microenvironment within the hydrogel
matrix.
Immobilization Efﬁciency
Immobilization efﬁciency for ATA-v1 and PLP in the porous
hydrogel matrix embedded in the microreactor assembly shown
in Figure 1B was tested by pumping Hepes buffer through the
microbioreactor and monitoring the leakage of both molecules at
the microreactor outlet. After initial washout of the unconﬁned
enzyme within theﬁrst 4 reactor volumes,ATA-v1 activity in the
outlet samples remained close to zero (Figure 3A), conﬁrming
that the enzyme was successfully retained in the porous matrix of
the copolymer hydrogel. The immobilization yield taking into
consideration leaking of the enzyme was above 97% for both
tested enzyme concentrations. As for the cofactor co-
immobilization, starting PLP concentrations of 0.1, 0.5, and
1 mM in the reactor were tested at the initial enzyme
concentration of 0.81 mg ml
−1. From Figure 3B after the
initial washout of the excess PLP during continuous operation,
no PLP leakage was detected in the ef ﬂuent at all PLP
concentrations tested. Total washout varied between 6.2% for
1 mM and 8.8% for 0.1 mM PLP. Since the smallest amount of
unbound PLP was observed at a PLP concentration of 0.1 mM,
this concentration was used in all further experiments.
For immobilization of enzymes based on hydrogels
entrapment, its efﬁciency is mainly related to the hydrogel’s
pore size and structure, which need to prevent the leakage of
the biocatalyst. Recently, successful ﬁxation of yeast cells in a
copolymeric sodium alginate-PVA hydrogel was reported
(Menegatti and Žnidaršič-Plazl, 2019), but immobilization of
enzymes with molecular weight below 100 kDa having
diameters up to 6 nm ( Erickson, 2008 ) resulted in poor
performance due to enzyme leakage (data not shown). These
ﬁndings are consistent with the literature data on the average pore

Menegatti and Žnidaršič-Plazl Enzyme and Cofactor Co-Immobilization in a Microbioreactor
size of alginate hydrogels prepared from 2% (w/v) sodium
alginate and 2% (w/v) CaCl2, which was deﬁned to be 5 nm
(Kopač et al., 2021), while 8% addition of PVA even reduced the
average pore size below 4 nm (Menegatti et al., 2021). Since the
tetrameric amine transaminase used in this study has a molecular
weight of 194 kDa (Börner et al., 2017) corresponding to>8n m
protein diameter ( Erickson, 2008 ), this explains successful
retention of this enzyme together with a cofactor within the
selected copolymer hydrogel.
Besides lowering the average pore size, the addition of PVA to
alginate also improved chemical stability of the copolymer
hydrogels compared to commonly used alginate hydrogels,
making them more suitable for enzyme immobilization
(Nunes et al., 2016 ; Menegatti and Žnidaršič-Plazl, 2019 ;
Menegatti et al., 2021). Furthermore, PVA addition solves the
problem encountered by calcium alginate hydrogels that are
unstable in solutions with pH values higher than thepKa of
their substituent groups, as such conditions disrupt the
crosslinked 3D structure (Kopač et al., 2021), which renders
them non-applicable for biotransformations such as
aminations with amine transaminases, where the amine
donors have highpKa values [e.g., pKa of (S)-α-MBA is 9.7].
Biotransformation in a Microbioreactor
Transamination in a microbioreactor was performed with two
hydrogel layers between two plates, which has also been shown to
be advantageous for fumaric acid transformation with yeast cells
(Menegatti and Žnidaršič-Plazl, 2019). Two different enzyme
loads were used, resulting in ﬁnal enzyme activities of 1.32
and 10.45 U mL
−1, while PLP was added at a ﬁnal
concentration of 0.1 mM. The calculated gross reaction yields
in samples taken at the microbioreactor outlets, where the
reaction mixture was pumped at various ﬂow rates and thus
residence times, are shown in Figure 4. As expected, higher
enzyme load and longer residence times resulted in higher yields
under the same conditions. The highest gross yield of 80% was
obtained with a higher enzyme load and a residence time of
310 min, while a 10 times lower enzyme load at the same
residence time resulted in a gross yield of 52%. Recovered
activities calculated at the highest ﬂow rate giving 3.1 min
residence time were 44.8 and 26.4% for enzyme loads of 1.32
and 10.45 U mL
−1, respectively.

Menegatti and Žnidaršič-Plazl Enzyme and Cofactor Co-Immobilization in a Microbioreactor
The highest space-time yields (STY) calculated at the
shortest residence time of 186 s were 4.13 and 19.91 g ACP
L−1 h−1 for enzyme loading of 1.32 and 10.45 U mL −1,
respectively. This is much lower than reported for amine
transaminase immobilized onto polymer-coated glass beads
with controlled porosity (EziG
™) via iron cation af ﬁnity
binding. When tested in a packed bed reactor with a high
enzyme loading of 112 mg ml
−1,S T Yo f3 3 5gACP L−1 h−1 was
calculated at 54 s residence time (Böhmer et al., 2019). Also
Bajić et al. (2017)reported a STY value of 277 gACP L−1 h−1 at
22 s residence time for the same reaction performed in a
miniaturized packed bed reactor. On the other hand,
surface immobilization in microreactors with amine
transaminase genetically fused to a silica-binding Z
basic2
protein ( N-SBM-ATA-wt ) in a silicon/glass microchannel
yielded STY of only 14.42 gACP L−1 h−1, mainly due to the
small enzyme loading of 1.57 U mL−1 that was possible on the
reactor wall surface (Miložič et al., 2018).
When comparing biocatalyst (or speci ﬁc) productivities
calculated at the highest STY, 5.4 and 2.6 mgACP mgATA
−1 h−1
were obtained at enzyme loads of 1.32 and 10.45 U mL −1,
respectively. This is comparable to 5.6 mg ACP mgATA
−1 h−1
obtained with N-SBM-ATA-wt transaminase immobilized on
the microchannel surface ( Miložič et al., 2018 ), but again
lower than in a packed bed reactor with transaminase
immobilized on the surface of the beads, where a biocatalyst
productivity of 244 mg

−1 h−1 was reported (Benítez-
Mateos et al., 2018). This productivity was obtained at very high
ﬂow rates of 1.45 ml min−1 in an optimized packed bed reactor
with His-tagged amine transaminase. In contrast, amine
transaminase entrapped in lenticularLentikats® PVA particles
packed in miniaturized packed bed reactors resulted in lower
speciﬁc productivities ranging from 0.17 to 16 mg
ACP mgATA
−1
h−1 (Bajić et al., 2017).
Estimation of Temperature Effect on
Biotransformation
The effect of temperature on transamination with immobilized
enzyme was studied atﬂow conditions in a microbioreactor and
compared to reaction with free enzyme deﬁned in a batch process.
FIGURE 5 |Relative activity of the free and the immobilized enzyme at
various temperatures as compared to the reaction rate at 50°C. Experiments
with immobilized enzyme were performed in a microreactor at 50μLm i n−1
ﬂow rate, while the reaction rate with free enzyme was determined using
standard batch enzyme activity measurement. Error bars indicate standard
deviations of triplicates.

equimolar substrate concentration of 40 mM andATA-v1 concentration of 0.81 mg ml−1. The initial STY at 30 and 50°C were 15.2 U g−1 and 19.4 U g−1, respectively.

Menegatti and Žnidaršič-Plazl Enzyme and Cofactor Co-Immobilization in a Microbioreactor
The residence times in the microreactor and batch process times
were identical.
From Figure 5 it is evident that increasing the reaction
temperature up to 50°C had a positive effect on the reaction
rate for both the free and immobilized enzyme and almost
reached a plateau up to 60 °C. This is comparable to the
optimal temperatures reported for other amine transaminases
from various organisms (Mallin et al., 2014). Further increase in
temperature resulted in a decrease in reaction rate, which was
much more pronounced when the free enzyme was used. At 80
°C,
the reaction with the immobilized enzyme was almost twice as
fast as with the free enzyme, reaching only 26% of the maximum
value for the latter. This is consistent with previousﬁndings of
improved thermal stability of the immobilized enzyme, as shown
in Figure 2B , and with other literature reports. Thus,
immobilization of bovine heart ω-transaminase in a sol-gel
matrix even shifted the apparent temperature optimum and
improved biotransformation rates compared to the reaction
with free enzyme at temperatures up to 60
°C. The good
activity of the immobilized enzyme even at high temperatures
could be due to the additional multi-point contact through
hydrogen bonding as well as ionic interactions of the enzyme
with the matrix (Koszelewski et al., 2010).
Determination of Operational Stability
To determine the operational stability of the co-immobilized
system, continuous transamination was performed in a
microbioreactor over a 10-day period. The process with co-
immobilized ATA-v1 and PLP, where only substrates were
pumped through the reactor at a constantﬂow of 2μLm i n
−1,
was compared with the system with immobilizedATA-v1 and
exogenously added 0.1 mM PLP in the reaction mixture, both
run at 30
°C. Figure 6Arepresents the relative productivity of the
reactor over time for the system with immobilized PLP and the
system with exogenously added PLP. The productivity
ﬂuctuates over a 10-day period without any signiﬁcant loss.
The microbioreactor with co-immobilized PLP retained 92% of
its initial productivity after 10 days and showed similar
performance to the reactor without immobilized but
exogenously added PLP, con ﬁrming that co-immobilization
of the cofactor was also successful. The microbioreactor with
co-immobilized PLP was also tested for its operational stability
at an optimal temperature of 50
°C. As evident fromFigure 6B,
t h er e l a t i v ep r o d u c t i v i t yr e m a i n e dv e r ys t a b l ed u r i n gt h e1 0 - d a y
continuous transamination and retained 87% productivity at the
end of the experiment. The results obtained with co-
immobilization in a copolymer hydrogel were much better
than those reported for a silic on/glass microreactor with
surface immobilized N-SBM-ATA-wt tested over a period of
4 days, with productivity dropping below 50% after only 16 h of
continuous operation (Miložič et al., 2018). Similarly, (Abdul
Halim et al., 2013 ) reported on an immobilized His-tagged
transaminase packed in a microreactor, where the relative
productivity also dropped to 60% after only 8 h of
continuous transamination. On the other hand, the
aforementioned lenticular PVA Lentikats
® particles with
immobilized amine transaminase in a miniaturized packed
bed reactor showed great operational stability with about
80% retained productivity after 21 days of operation at room
temperature ( Bajić et al., 2017 ), suggesting that enzyme
immobilization by entrapment also improves the operational
stability of this enzyme.
The industrial potential of alginate hydrogel-based
biocatalyst immobilization in a bio-lamina bioreactor for
the conversion of methane into liquid fuel has been recently
described (Jovanovic et al., 2018; Jovanovic et al., 2021). The
identi ﬁed features of such systems are relatively high
biocatalyst loads with the ability to adjust the thickness and
porosity of theﬁlm to allow efﬁcient diffusion of substrates and
product to the active sites.
CONCLUSION
A successful co-immobilization of PLP cofactor withATA-v1 in
porous copolymeric hydrogel that stabilizes the enzyme over a
wide pH and temperature range is presented. This novel co-
immobilization method does not require organic solvents or
additional polycationic polymers for successful PLP retention
in a ﬂow-through microbioreactor. The developed
microbioreactor between two plates enabled continuous
operation without signi ﬁcant leaching of ATA-v1 and PLP.
The microbioreactor system also showed high operational
stability over a period of 10 days, even at 50
°C.
