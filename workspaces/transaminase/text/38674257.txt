Abstract: Background and Objectives: The purpose of this study was to investigate the influence induced
by magnesium chloride (MgCl2) and zinc gluconate (ZnG) supplementation on liver and kidney injuries
experimentally induced with acetaminophen (AAPh) and potentiated by a ciprofloxacin addition in rats.
Material and Methods: The experiment was performed on five animal groups: group 1—control, treated for
6 weeks with normal saline, 1 mL/kg; group 2—AAPh, treated for 6 weeks with AAPh, 100 mg/kg/day;
group 3—AAPh + C, treated for 6 weeks with AAPh 100 mg/kg/day and ciprofloxacin 50 mg/kg/day ,
only in the last 14 days of the experiment; group 4—AAPh + C + Mg,with the same treatment as group
3, but in the last 14 days, MgCl2 10 mg/ kg/day was added; and group 5—AAPh + C + Zn, with the
same treatment as group 3, but in the last 14 days, zinc gluconate (ZnG), 10 mg/kg/day was added.
All administrations were performed by oral gavage. At the end of the experiment, the animals were
sacrificed and blood samples were collected for biochemistry examinations. Results: Treatment with
AAPh for 6 weeks determined an alteration of the liver function (increases in alanine aminotransferase,
aspartate aminotransferase, lactic dehydrogenase, and gamma-glutamyl transferase) and of renal
function (increases in serum urea and creatinine) (p < 0.001 group 2 vs. group 1 for all mentioned
parameters). Furthermore, the antioxidant defense capacity was impaired in group 2 vs. group
1 (superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase activity decreased in group 2 vs. group 1,
at 0.001 < p < 0.01 and 0.01 < p < 0.05, respectively). The addition of ciprofloxacin, 50 mg/kg/day
during the last 14 days, resulted in further increases in alkaline phosphatase, alanine aminotransferase,
aspartate aminotransferase, urea, and creatinine ( 0.01 < p < 0.05, group 3 vs. group 2). MgCl 2
provided a slight protection against the increase in liver enzymes, and a more pronounced protection
against the increase in serum urea and creatinine ( 0.001 < p < 0.01 group 4 vs. group 3). MgCl 2
provided a slight protection against the decrease in superoxide dismutase (0.01 < p < 0.05 group 4
vs. group 3), but not against decrease of glutathione peroxidase. The improvement of mentioned
parameters could also be seen in the case of ZnG, to a higher extent, especially in the case of
alanine aminotransferase and lactic dehydrogenase (0.01 < p < 0.05 group 5 vs. group 4). Conclusions:
This study presents further proof for the beneficial effect of magnesium and zinc salts against
toxicity induced by different agents, including antibacterials added to the analgesic and antipyretic
acetaminophen; the protection is proven on the liver and kidney’s function, and the antioxidant
profile improvement has a key role, especially in the case of zinc gluconate.

1. Introduction
Antibacterial drugs represent an important arsenal in fighting against infections.
Among the greatest problems related to their utilization, bacterial resistance development
is particularly severe, especially in the case of injudicious use; but another very serious
concern related to antibacterial use is their potential to induce adverse effects, as their
action in the patient’s body is not limited to the pathogenic microbial agent. Even though
these drugs are regularly bio-transformed in the human body and eliminated, and their
toxicity is generally selective, they often induce serious adverse effects or significant toxicity
(nephrotoxicity, hepatotoxicity, cardiotoxicity) [1].
The toxicity of antibacterials often overlaps with that of some other drugs that they
are concomitantly recommended with, or with that of recreational toxics (e.g., ethanol).
Fever is a symptom that frequently accompanies infections, including bacterial ones. Ac-
etaminophen is often used as an analgesic and antipyretic, and its association with antibac-
terials is common in the therapy of infections. It is considered safe at therapeutic levels,
but at high doses it can lead to hepatotoxicity and nephrotoxicity. Although high doses of
acetaminophen establish a conjugated bond with glucuronic acid or sulphate, a significant
portion is metabolized by the cytochrome P450 system, determining the production of
reactive toxic metabolites such as N-acetyl-p-benzoquinone imine. This interacts with
sulfhydryl groups in the glutathione molecule, determining an impairment of antioxidant
capacity and potentiating lipid peroxidation; several studies have reported that high ac-
etaminophen doses reduce tubular epithelial cell vitality, leading to kidney toxicity [2–4].
The toxicity of acetaminophen is often cumulative with that of antibacterial medication.
On the other hand, certain chemical elements, either essential macronutrients or trace
elements (chemicals representing less than a thousandth of the dry tissue composition
in the human or animal body) have essential roles in the living world. These roles are
often ignored, and the diet does not always manage to provide a necessary supply of
certain such elements. The deficiency of both magnesium and zinc are relatively com-
mon [5–8] and known to be associated with kidney and liver function impairment [9–19].
For instance, several liver diseases, including cirrhosis, are associated with magnesium
deficiency, and, in turn, insufficient magnesium aggravates those conditions [9,10]. Benefits
of supplementation with zinc and magnesium have also been shown in the absence of defi-
ciencies. Magnesium, for example, induces hepatoprotection against toxicity induced by
arsenic trioxide [20], or elevated fructose levels [21], and clinical studies have demonstrated
that an elevated magnesium level is associated with longer survival with chronic kidney
disease [22]. Beneficial effects of zinc supplementation have been observed in children
and adolescents with kidney disease [23], while a zinc-acetate formulation induced liver
function improvement [24].
Based on the above, we justify the current study, in which we aimed to investigate
the supposed protective effect of supplementation with magnesium chloride and zinc glu-
conate, respectively, in nephro-hepatopathy experimentally induced with acetaminophen
and potentiated by the addition of ciprofloxacin. Hepatotoxicity was documented by the
increase in liver enzymes, and creatinine and urea were markers for the kidney toxicity.
2. Materials and Method
2.1. Ethical Policies
This study complied with the European Guidelines for Human and Animal Rights,
Directive 2010/63/EU, and the Romanian Law of Research no. 206/27.05.2004. The
research was approved by the Research Ethics Committee of the Grigore T. Popa University
of Medicine and Pharmacy in Ia¸ si, Romania (6 August 2019).
2.2. Substances
Acetaminophen (AAPh), powder; ciprofloxacin, neat; magnesium chloride (MgCl2),
anhydrous; and zinc gluconate (ZnG), powder were purchased from Sigma Chemical Co.
(St. Louis, MO, USA).
Medicina 2024, 60, 611 3 of 12
Substances were prepared as solutions.
2.3. Laboratory Animals
5-week-old male albino Wistar rats (nonconsanguineous; n = 50) were used in the
experiments. The animals weighed 150 ± 10 g each at the beginning of the experiment and
were purchased from the I. C. Cantacuzino National Institute of Research and Development
for Microbiology and Immunology, Bucharest, Romania. The animals were individually
housed in polypropylene cages according to European standards in the Laboratory for
Pharmacology Research in a controlled environment (temperature 23 ± 2 ◦C, 50–60%
relative humidity, central ventilation and artificial light–dark cycles of 12 h/12 h). The
animals had free access to water and standard food, which were provided ad libitum.
The rats were acclimatized for 7 days prior to the beginning of the experimental study.
2.4. Groups and Design of the Experiment
The rats were randomly divided into 5 groups of 10, and the experiment was conducted
for 42 days.
Group 1 (control, C): the animals were treated for 6 weeks with normal saline, 1 mL/kg.
Group 2 (acetaminophen-induced hepatopathy, AAPh): the rats were treated for
6 weeks with acetaminophen, 100 mg/kg/day.
Group 3 (acetaminophen-induced hepatopathy plus ciprofloxacin, AAPh + C): the rats
were treated for 6 weeks with acetaminophen, 100 mg/kg/day, by oral gavage. In addition,
ciprofloxacin, 50 mg/kg, was added in the last 14 days of the experiment (50 mg /kg/day).
Group 4 (acetaminophen-induced hepatopathy plus ciprofloxacin plus magnesium,
AAPh + C + Mg): the rats were treated for 6 weeks with acetaminophen 100 mg/kg/day.
In addition, in the last 2 weeks of the experiment, ciprofloxacin, 50 mg/kg/day, and
magnesium chloride, 10 mg/kg/day, were added.
Group 5 (acetaminophen-induced hepatopathy plus ciprofloxacin plus zinc,
AAPh + C + Zn): the rats were treated for 6 weeks with acetaminophen, 100 mg/kg/day.
In addition, in the last 2 weeks of the experiment, ciprofloxacin, 50 mg/kg/day, and zinc
gluconate, 10 mg/kg/day, were added.
All solutions/substances were administered by oral gavage, in a unique daily dose,
at 7.30. The solutions for each of the pharmacologically active substances administered
had the concentration calculated so that the volume of each administration was 1 mL of
solution/kg.
2.5. Biochemical Determination
Blood samples were collected from the carotid artery of sacrificed animals and stored in
standard biochemistry vacutainers. In order to limit supplementary suffering of the animals
(required by the institution’s Ethics Committee), blood sampling was not performed before
the application of different treatments or during different stages of the experiment.
The following parameters, related mainly to the hepatic function, were determined:
alanine aminotransferase or glutamic-pyruvic transaminase (ALT/GTP), aspartate amino-
transferase or glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase (AST/GOP), lactic dehydrogenase (LDH),
and gamma-glutamyl transferase, γ-GT (GGT), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), and their
values were expressed in international unites per liter (IU/L), with a precision of 1 IU/L
(except for GGT, where the precision was 0.01 IU/L).
The following parameters related mainly to the kidney function were determined:
urea and creatinine and their values were expressed in mg per deciliter (mg/dL), with a
precision of 1 mg/dL.
Biochemical determinations were performed using kits supplied by BD Biosciences
Co. (Heidelberg, Germany) and a VITROS® 350 Chemistry System biochemical analyzer
(Johnson & Johnson Ortho-Clinical Diagnostics) (colorimetric methods).
The following parameters related mainly to the antioxidant status were determined:
superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1) and Glutathione peroxidase 1 (GPX 1). The determinations
Medicina 2024, 60, 611 4 of 12
were performed using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kits from Cloud-Clone
Corp, and an optical density reader by Perkin EnVision. Values were expressed in mg per
deciliter (pg/mL), with a precision of 1 pg/mL.
2.6. Statistical Data Analysis
Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS software version 20 for Windows (IBM,
Chicago, IL, USA). Data were first checked for normality in each group and for each tested
parameter using the Shapiro–Wilk test. As the data showed a normal distribution, the
results were expressed in graphs and tables as average±standard, and one-way ANOVA
was used to test for differences among groups.
3. Results
3.1. Body Weight, Growth, Food, and Water Intake
During the acclimatization period and the 42 days thereafter, the body weight of the
animals in all groups increased constantly regardless of their treatments. None of the rats
died during the 6 weeks of different treatment applications.
3.2. Biochemical Determinations
Treatment with acetaminophen for 6 weeks determined an alteration of:
• liver function: increases in ALT, AST, LDH, GGT, and ALP ( p < 0.001, group 2 vs.
control group 1);
• renal function: increases in serum urea and serum creatinine (p < 0.001, group 2 vs.
control group 1);
• antioxidant defense capacity (decrease in SOD and GPX activity, 0.001 <p < 0.01 and
0.01 < p < 0.05, respectively, group 2 vs. control group 1).
The addition of ciprofloxacin, 50 mg/kg/day, during the last 14 days of AAph admin-
istration resulted in a further increase of the following serum biochemical parameters: ALT,
AST, serum creatinine, and urea (0.01 < p < 0.05, group 3 vs. group 2), while ALP was even
more seriously increased (0.001 < p < 0.01, group 3 vs. group 2), and SOD was increased
(0.01 < p < 0.05, group 3 vs. group 2). The serum concentrations of GGT, LDH, and GpX
were not modified by the addition of ciprofloxacin.
The magnesium chloride oral treatment, 10 mg/kg/day, addition during the 14 days
of ciprofloxacin administration on the background of acetaminophen-induced toxicity
provided a certain degree of protection against the alteration of certain assessed biochemical
parameters, as follows:
• pronounced protection against the increase in serum concentration of serum urea and
creatinine (0.001 < p < 0.01, group 4 vs. group 3);
• slight, yet significant protection against the increase in the serum concentration of
liver enzymes ALT, AST, LDH, GGT, and ALP , and against the decrease in the serum
concentration of SOD (0.01 < p < 0.05, group 4 vs. group 3);
• insignificant protection against the decrease in the serum concentration of GPx.
A zinc gluconate oral treatment, 10 mg/kg/day, addition during the 14 days of
ciprofloxacin administration on the background of acetaminophen-induced toxicity pro-
vided a certain degree of protection against the alteration of certain assessed biochemical
parameters, as follows:
• particularly pronounced protection against the increase in the serum concentration of
liver enzymes ALT and LDH and serum creatinine (p < 0.001, group 5 vs. group 3);
• pronounced protection against the increase in the serum concentration of liver enzyme
GGT and serum urea (0.001 < p < 0.01, group 5 vs. group 3);
• slight, yet significant protection against the increase in the serum concentration of
liver enzymes AST, ALP , and the decrease of SOD and GPx (0.001 <p < 0.01, group 5
vs. group 3).
Medicina 2024, 60, 611 5 of 12
Only for ALT and LDH, the improvement was superior in the case of zinc gluconate
compared to magnesium chloride (0.01 < p < 0.05, group 4 vs. group 5), while the opposite
situation was not recorded for any parameter.
The complete list of values for the assessed biochemical parameters in rats can be

4. Discussions
In the current study, we have used a model of hepato-nephropathy induced with ac-
etaminophen oral administration (100 mg/kg/day, 42 days) and potentiated with
50 mg/kg/day ciprofloxacin (orally, only in the last 14 days). The chosen dose of ac-
etaminophen induced significant increase in liver enzymes, while nephrotoxicity, docu-
mented as urea and creatinine increases, even though statistically significant, was not
as severe.
Medicina 2024, 60, 611 6 of 12
Furthermore, the addition of ciprofloxacin to acetaminophen mainly affected the liver
enzymes’ concentration, while the increase in the biochemical parameters related to kidney
function was less evident.
We have demonstrated that both zinc gluconate and magnesium chloride offered a
considerable protection against renal, and mainly against the hepatic toxicity induced with
acetaminophen and enhanced by ciprofloxacin in rats. The doses of zinc and magnesium
compounds were chosen according to the medical literature, in order not to be toxic and
yet to provide efficacy [ 25,26]. The choice of the oral route is justified by the fact that
magnesium and zinc compounds are regularly given as dietary supplements, with the
mentioned administration route.
The protection is more evident for the zinc-based preparation, especially in the case
of liver function. Nephrotoxicity was less severe than hepatotoxicity in the case of the
acetaminophen-only group 2. Additionally, in the ciprofloxacin + acetaminophen group 3,
the ciprofloxacin addition just slightly potentiates the increase in urea and creatinine in-
duced with acetaminophen; therefore, we consider that the results related to the protection
induced with magnesium or zinc are difficult to be interpreted with relevance to animals or
human beings.
Both compounds offered a slight level of protection against the alteration of anti-
oxidant capacity induced by mentioned toxics (they protected against the decrease in the
serum concentration of superoxide dismutase, but just ZnCl2 protects against the decrease
in the serum concentration of glutathione peroxidase). This supports the hypothesis that
magnesium or zinc cations kidney and liver protection is, at least partially, due to improving
the antioxidant defense.
An important limitation of the study is the lack of modeling the infective pathology,
as antibacterials (especially if used systemically, but also when used topically), and the
pathology itself may contribute to changes in the parameters of the kinetics and dynamics
of different other substances, as well as microelements or magnesium.
In the medical literature, there is important evidence from studies by different re-
searchers regarding the possible beneficial effects of zinc and magnesium compounds in
liver and kidney damage of various causes. There are both observational clinical studies
that could prove a possible association of zinc or magnesium deficiency with liver or
kidney pathology and interventional clinical studies documenting a possible benefit of
the administration of zinc or magnesium-containing compounds in liver or kidney pathol-
ogy). Furthermore, there are plenty of experimental studies proving the benefits of zinc or
magnesium compounds in liver or kidney pathology, or the potentiation of liver or kidney
damage by the deficiency of the two cations.
Some of those studies also manage to reveal certain aspects regarding mechanisms
involved in hepatoprotection and nephroprotection induced by zinc and magnesium ions;
in vitro studies contribute to the understanding of the protective mechanisms as well.
4.1. Magnesium—Roles in Hepatoprotection and Nephroprotection
4.1.1. The Role of Magnesium in Hepatoprotection
The relationship between magnesium levels in the human body and liver diseases is
complex. Observational studies showed that several liver diseases are associated with mag-
nesium deficiency, while such a condition aggravates these diseases, like in a downward
spiral [9]. Patients with liver cirrhosis usually have low magnesium body levels [10]. Cir-
rhosis is often due to alcohol consumption, and magnesium deficiency is common among
alcohol-consumers [11]. Progression to cirrhosis is very likely, particularly in patients with
low hepatocytic magnesium concentrations.
Hepatic loss of magnesium is associated with greater collagen deposition in the
liver [27]. Decreased intracellular Mg2+ content has a negative impact on mitochondrial
bioenergetics, which implies impairment of oxidation in hepatocytes, associated with
reduction in ATP production and hepatocyte damage. The subsequent repair process of the
liver leads to further fibrosis and worsens cirrhosis.
Medicina 2024, 60, 611 7 of 12
Interventional studies have shown that magnesium supplementation ameliorates vari-
ous liver diseases. For instance, a 100 mg increase in daily magnesium intake is associated
with a 49% decrease in the risk of mortality from all liver diseases [28]. Another study claims
that magnesium supplementation can prevent hepatitis C virus replication by binding to
the NS3 helicase of the virus [29].
The magnesium hepatoprotective effect has also been demonstrated by numerous
experimental studies. Prophylactic administration of magnesium isoglycyrisinate (9 and
18 mg/kg/day) significantly reduced serum ALT and AST levels in rats treated with
20 mg/kg methotrexate (intravenously), and attenuated methotrexate-induced liver fi-
brosis, hepatocyte apoptosis, and reduced serum malondialdehyde levels more than
glutathione, 80 mg/kg/day. Methotrexate-induced cyclooxygenase-2 expression, intesti-
nal permeability, and inflammation were attenuated [30]. Magnesium isoglycyrrhizinate
(i.p., 50 mg/kg/day) induces hepatoprotection against arsenic trioxide-induced toxicity in
mice [20] or elevated fructose levels [21] in rats.
An in vitro study showed that magnesium cantharidate has an inhibitory effect on
the proliferation of SMMC-7721 human hepatoma cells by blocking the MAPK (mitogen-
activated protein kinases) signaling pathway; the phosphorylation levels of C-jun N-
terminal kinase (JNK) and extracellular signal-related kinase (ERK) decrease significantly
after such treatment [31].
4.1.2. The Role of Magnesium in Nephroprotection
Pathophysiological considerations: The kidney has a vital role in the homeostasis of
magnesium; renal Mg excretion is highly adaptive, but it is impaired when renal function
declines significantly. In chronic kidney disease (CKD) of moderate severity, the increase
in Mg2+ excretion largely compensates for the loss of the glomerular filtration rate, and
normal serum magnesium levels are maintained. However, in more advanced forms of
the disease, this compensatory mechanism becomes inadequate, so hypermagnesemia
frequently develops in patients with creatinine clearance below 10 mL/min (as less Mg2+
is filtered through the glomeruli to be excreted). The treatment of hyperphosphatemia
also contributes to hypermagnesemia [ 32]. In fact, CKD can also be associated with
hypomagnesemia [12]. Both patients with polycystic kidney disease and end-stage renal
disease on dialysis usually have normal serum Mg, and sometimes even hypomagnesemia.
Human studies: Observational studies showed that patients with polycystic kidney
disease have severely depressed intestinal Mg2+ absorption, probably due to a deficiency
of active vitamin D, and in end-stage renal disease the adaptive increase in active intestinal
absorption of magnesium is impaired [13].
An interventional study showed that a higher level of proteinuria was associated with
greater urinary Mg excretion. Mg oxide administration significantly increased serum Mg
levels after one year, but only among patients with a urinary protein-to-creatinine ratio of
less than 0.3 g/g, while there was no change in serum Mg in those with greater levels of
proteinuria, suggesting that hypomagnesemia is a consequence of tubular injury [33].
Experimental studiesdemonstrated the protective effect of magnesium on the nephrotox-
icity of colistin, decreasing serum urea and creatinine, but increasing the concentration of
malondialdehyde, and improving renal histopathological aspects [34]. A low-magnesium
diet exacerbated kidney damage induced by the high-phosphate diet. Increasing dietary
magnesium may be helpful to attenuate phosphate-induced renal injury in mice [35].
Magnesium is known to protect against phosphate-induced tubular cell damage
in vitro [36].
4.2. Zinc—Role in Hepatoprotection and Nephroprotection
Also, in the case of zinc, results of different studies support both the idea of zinc
deficiency as an element associated with liver or kidney pathology, and the idea of the
opportunity of dietary zinc supplementation in various forms of kidney pathology and
hepatic disorders.
Medicina 2024, 60, 611 8 of 12
4.2.1. The Role of Zinc in Hepatoprotection
The association of zinc deficiency with liver failure is clearly proven in experimental
models and in clinical studies. The idea of dietary zinc supplementation appears to be
supported by both observational and interventional clinical studies.
Since the 1950s, observational studies have demonstrated that serum Zn levels are
associated with liver pathology. Vikbladh (1950; 1951) [14,15] reported that serum zinc was
low in many chronic diseases, and in 1956, Bartholomay et al. [ 16] reported that serum
Zn concentration was low in patients with liver cirrhosis and suggested that this was a
consequence of hyperzincuria (increased urinary Zn excretion in such a condition being
somewhat paradoxical).
Interventional studies have shown that zinc supplementation improves various liver
conditions.
Some cirrhotic patients who experienced night blindness did not respond to vitamin
A supplementation, but responded to zinc administration [ 37]. Zinc supplementation
ameliorated liver fibrosis in patients with early cirrhosis [38], and supplementation with a
zinc-acetate formulation significantly improved liver function [24]. Zinc therapy has been
shown to be beneficial in subjects with hepatic encephalopathy [39].
Their results are reinforced by experimental studiesthat demonstrated the protective
effect of zinc on liver damage induced by D-galactosamine or nickel in rats [ 40,41]. Pre-
treatment with zinc chloride (50 or 100 mg/kg daily, 36 days) reduced hepatic toxicity of
glyphosate, ameliorated numerous biochemical parameters (such as increases in serum en-
zymes associated with hepatobiliary injury), but were ineffective in preventing histological
lesions [42].
The mechanism underlying the association between zinc deficiency and liver dys-
function is insufficiently elucidated. These reports indicate an association between zinc
deficiency and organ damage due to fibrosis and oxidative stress [43].
4.2.2. The Role of Zinc in Nephroprotection
The association of zinc deficiency with renal failure, especially in hemodialyzed
patients, is clearly proven, and so are the beneficial effects of zinc in various forms of renal
pathology.
Observational studies have shown that serum zinc levels tend to decrease with the
progression of CKD [17,18]. Survival analysis showed that zinc deficiency is a risk factor
for progression to end-stage renal disease and death [19].
Interventional studieshave shown that zinc supplementation improves the response to
erythropoietin therapy in dialysis patients [44], and beneficial effects of zinc supplementa-
tion have been observed in children and adolescents with kidney disease [23]. A clinical
trial demonstrated that zinc supplementation reduces urinary albumin excretion in type
2 diabetes patients with microalbuminuria [ 45]. In patients with low Zn levels, the risk
of progression of primary kidney disease was lower if zinc-containing compounds were
administered during the observation period [19].
Experimental studiesdemonstrated that in diabetic rats, zinc supplementation sup-
presses pathological changes associated with tubulointerstitial and glomerular damage [46].
Pretreatment with zinc chloride (50 or 100 mg/kg daily, 36 days) reduced renal and
hepatic toxicity of glyphosate, and ameliorated numerous biochemical parameters (serum
accumulation of creatinine), but did not alleviate histological damage in rats [42].
4.2.3. Mechanisms Involved in Zinc Hepatoprotection and Nephroprotection
The mechanism underlying the association between zinc deficiency and renal dys-
function remains unclear. Various fundamental studies have shown that zinc is a regulator
of oxidative stress, in its capacity as a cofactor of superoxide dismutase; its deficiency
induces oxidative stress and kidney damage through nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide
phosphate (NADPH) oxidase [47]. Evidence indicates that oxidative stress is the common
denominator among major pathways involved in the development and progression of
Medicina 2024, 60, 611 9 of 12
kidney diseases [48], with NADPH oxidase being identified as a major source of oxidative
stress in kidney diseases. An intervention study in healthy individuals also demonstrated
that zinc supplementation reduced oxidative stress [ 8]. Zinc deficiency promotes renal
fibroblast activation and leads to interstitial fibrosis in diabetic mice [49].
Supplementation with zinc and/or magnesium should be recommended in patients
undergoing long term antibiotherapy, combined with antipyretic administration. The
idea is also sustained by the low price and low toxicity of such compounds, and by their
beneficial effect on the immune system [5,8,50].
5. Conclusions
The hepatotoxicity of the antipyretic and analgesic drug acetaminophen is potentiated
by ciprofloxacin administration in rats, but both zinc gluconate and magnesium chloride
slightly alleviate the combined toxicity of the mentioned substances (diminish the elevated
level of liver enzymes and creatinine). Especially in the case of the zinc compound, where
the effect is slightly higher, this protection seems to partially associated with the potentiation
of the antioxidant effect.
Administration of dietary supplements with magnesium and especially zinc may
represent an easy, yet efficient way to reduce the toxicity of antibacterials associated with
cyclo-oxygenase’s inhibitors.
