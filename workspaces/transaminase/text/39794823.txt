Abstract
Clinical studies have suggested that tirzepatide may also possess hepatoprotective effects; however, the molecular 
mechanisms underlying this association remain unclear. In our study, we performed biochemical analyses of serum 
and histopathological examinations of liver tissue in mice. To preliminarily explore the molecular mechanisms 
of tirzepatide on metabolic dysfunction-associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD), liquid chromatography-mass 
spectrometry (LC-MS) was employed for comprehensive metabolomic, lipidomic, and proteomic analyses in 
MAFLD mice fed a high-fat diet (HFD). The results demonstrated that tirzepatide significantly reduced serum levels 
of alanine transaminase (ALT) and aspartate transaminase (AST), as well as hepatic triglycerides (TG) and total 
cholesterol (TC), indicating its efficacy in treating MAFLD. Further findings revealed that tirzepatide reduced fatty 
acid uptake by downregulating Cd36 and Fabp2/4, as well as enhance the mitochondrial-lysosomal function by 
upregulating Lamp1/2. In addition, tirzepatide promoted cholesterol efflux and reduced cholesterol reabsorption 
by upregulating the expression of Hnf4a, Abcg5, and Abcg8. These results suggest that tirzepatide exerts its 
therapeutic effects on MAFLD by reducing fatty acid uptake, promoting cholesterol excretion, and enhancing 
mitochondrial-lysosomal function, providing a theoretical basis for a comprehensive understanding of tirzepatide.

Introduction
Metabolic dysfunction-associated fatty liver disease 
(MAFLD) is widely recognised as a major cause of 
chronic liver disease, affecting nearly 30% of the global 
population [ 1]. Its prevalence is escalating annually, 
driven by the increasing incidence of obesity and type 2 
diabetes [2, 3]. MAFLD triggers a spectrum of liver dis -
orders, from simple hepatic steatosis (MAFLD) to more 
advanced metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepa -
titis (MASH), which can progress to liver fibrosis, cir -
rhosis, liver failure, and hepatocellular carcinoma [ 4, 5]. 
Moreover, accumulating evidence suggests that MAFLD 
has systemic repercussions escalated with cardiovascu -
lar disease, chronic kidney disease, and various extrahe -
patic malignancies [ 6, 7]. Current treatment options for 
MAFLD focus primarily on lifestyle interventions, such 
as dietary changes and physical activity, which pose chal -
lenges for long-term adherence owing to the difficulty 
in maintaining these lifestyle changes over time. These 
underscore the urgent need for effective therapeutic 
strategies for MAFLD.
Recently, there have been notable progress in the field 
of metabolic diseases, particularly in the demonstrated 
therapeutic potential of glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-
1) and glucose-dependent insulinotropic peptide (GIP) 
receptor agonists [8]. These peptides have been shown to 
effectively reduce hepatic steatosis in preclinical models 
[9–13]. Tirzepatide, a dual GIP/GLP-1 receptor agonist, 
has been approved for the management of type 2 diabe -
tes and obesity [ 14], demonstrating superior efficacy in 
terms of glycemic control and weight reduction com -
pared with monospecific receptor agonists [ 15, 16]. The 
dual-action mechanism of tirzepatide makes it a candi -
date for treating MAFLD, a condition intimately associ -
ated with metabolic dysregulation.
Although preclinical and clinical data are promising, 
the detailed molecular mechanisms by which tirzepatide 
influences MAFLD remain unclear. Recent research has 
shed light on the roles of GIPR and GLP1R agonists in 
the regulation of postprandial lipid metabolism [ 17–19] 
and inflammatory responses [20, 21]; however, the mech-
anisms of action of tirzepatide in MAFLD have not been 
extensively investigated. Therefore, a thorough exami -
nation of the molecular mechanisms of tirzepatide in 
MAFLD is essential to elucidate the mechanism of action 
of this drug and establish a foundation for the develop -
ment of targeted therapeutic strategies for MAFLD.
The incorporation of multiomics technologies has sig -
nificantly enhanced our understanding of complex bio -
logical systems and their regulatory mechanisms [ 22]. 
Advances in mass spectrometry (MS), particularly in pro-
teomics and metabolomics, have provided robust tools 
for exploring the molecular mechanisms underlying vari -
ous diseases. In this study, we used ultra-performance 
liquid chromatography coupled with Orbitrap tandem 
mass spectrometry (UPLC-Orbitrap-MS/MS) for com -
prehensive metabolomics, lipidomics, and proteomics 
analyses with the aim of elucidating the potential molec -
ular mechanisms through which tirzepatide alleviates 
MAFLD in mice fed a high-fat diet (HFD). This innova -
tive approach provides scientific evidence for the appli -
cation of tirzepatide in MAFLD treatment and highlights 
its transformative potential in managing this prevalent 
liver disorder.
Methods
Animal model
29 Male C57BL/6J mice, aged 5 weeks, were procured 
from Guangdong Gempharmatech Co., Ltd. (Guang -
zhou, China). Housed in an SPF-certified facility, all mice 
were subjected to a consistent 12-h light/dark cycle, with 
a stable temperature of 24 °C (± 2) and humidity level of 
approximately 60% (± 10%). After a 7-d acclimatisation 
phase, the subjects were assigned to two distinct dietary 
groups: a normal diet group (NCD group, n = 10) and an 
HFD group (n = 19; diet obtained from Dyets, HF60, 60% 
calories from fat). Following a 20-week nutritional pro -
tocol, the HFD group was further subdivided into two 
groups: the HFD control group (HFD, n = 9) and the tirz-
epatide intervention group (HFD + tirzepatide, n = 10). 
The mice in the intervention group received subcutane -
ous injections of tirzepatide (Eli Lilly and Company, Indi-
anapolis, Indiana) with dose escalation: initially, 0.03 mg/
kg for the first 4 weeks, followed by 0.1  mg/kg for the 
subsequent 4 weeks, culminating at 0.3  mg/kg for the 
final 4 weeks, with administrations twice weekly. Coun -
terparts of the NCD and HFD groups were administered 
placebo with 40 mM Tris-HCl buffer. During the investi -
gational period at week 32, the mice were sedated via an 
intraperitoneal injection of pentobarbital sodium (40 mg/
kg) for humane euthanasia. Blood and liver samples were 
collected for subsequent examination.
Analysis of the fatty liver model
Following a 20-week period of the specified dietary pro -
tocol, the mice were subjected to in-depth ultrasound 
assessment of their liver tissue using a Vevo 3100 system 
(FUJIFILM Visual Sonics, Toronto, Canada). The ultra -
sound results were analysed via the Vevo Lab software 
(FUJIFILM VisualSonics, Toronto, Canada) to compare 
the brightness of the ultrasound scans between the liver 
and kidneys, enabling the evaluation of lipid deposition 
in the liver.
Biochemical analysis
Serum was isolated from blood samples by centrifuga -
tion, and the concentrations of alanine transaminase 
(ALT), aspartate transaminase (AST), triglycerides (TG),

Liang et al. Lipids in Health and Disease             (2025) 24:8 
total cholesterol (TC), high-density lipoprotein choles -
terol (HDL-C), and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol 
(LDL-C) were quantified via a 7180-ISE automated bio -
chemical analyser (Hitachi, Tokyo, Japan).
Histopathological analysis
The liver samples were preserved in 10% paraformal -
dehyde, sectioned, and embedded in paraffin via stan -
dard procedures. Paraffin-embedded tissues were cut 
into 5-µm sections and stained with haematoxylin and 
eosin (HE). In addition, liver tissues embedded in OCT 
were cut into 10-µm sections and stained with Oil Red 
O (ORO). The stained sections were then scanned via 
the Tissue FAXS SL Spectra imaging system (Tissue 
Gnostics, Vienna, Austria). Finally, t Strata Quest soft -
ware (Tissue Gnostics, Vienna, Austria) was employed to 
quantify lipid deposition areas and calculate the percent -
age of lipid deposition (ORO staining).
Untargeted metabolomic and lipidomic analyses
Fresh liver tissues (50 mg) were homogenised with 1 mL 
of ice-cold extraction solvent (methanol: water = 4:1 v/v; 
containing 3  µg/mL[13  C-methyl]-L-methionine as an 
internal standard). The homogenate was centrifuged at 
14,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant (850 
µL) was collected and transferred to Eppendorf tubes. 
These supernatants were stored at -20  °C overnight, 
followed by a second centrifugation at 14,000  rpm for 
10 min at 4 °C to remove residual particles. Appropriate 
volumes of all samples were pooled for quality control 
(QC). Lipid extraction involved adding 1 mL of ice-cold 
solvent (methyl tert-butyl ether: methanol = 10:3) to the 
precipitate from the initial centrifugation, homogenis -
ing, standing at room temperature for 30 min, and cen -
trifuging at 14,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C. The resulting 
supernatants (400 µL) were concentrated under vacuum 
at room temperature and reconstituted in 120 µL of ace -
tonitrile/water (1:1). A final centrifugation at 14,000 rpm 
for 10  min at 4  °C ensured particle removal, with a QC 
sample prepared by pooling appropriate volumes from all 
samples.
Untargeted metabolomic and lipidomic analyses were 
performed via a UHPLC U3000 system coupled with a 
QE HF-X mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 
Waltham, MA, USA). Polar compounds were separated 
via an HILIC column (Agilent ZORBAX HILIC Plus, 
3.0 mm × 100 mm, 1.8 μm), and lipid compounds were 
separated via a C18 column (Thermo Hypersil Gold 
C18, 2.1 mm × 100 mm, 1.9 μm). The mobile phases for 
the HILIC positive-ion mode consisted of 95% acetoni -
trile with 5 mM ammonium formate and 0.1% formic 
acid (A), and 50% acetonitrile containing 5 mM ammo -
nium formate and 0.1% formic acid (B). In HILIC nega -
tive-ion mode, the mobile phases were 95% acetonitrile 
with 5 mM ammonium formate (A) and 50% acetoni -
trile containing 5 mM ammonium formate (B). The C18 
reverse-phase analysis was performed using solvents 
A (acetonitrile: water = 6:4, 2 mM ammonium formate) 
and B (acetonitrile : isopropanol = 1 : 9, 2 mM ammo -
nium formate). The ion source parameters included a 
spray voltage of -2.8 kV for negative polarity and + 3.5 kV 
for positive polarity. The spectral resolution was set to 
120,000 for the full mass and 15,000 for the dd mass. The 
mass spectral acquisition ranged from 70 to 1050 Da.
Proteomic analysis
Tissue samples (20  mg) were homogenised in a buffer 
containing 50 mM Tris-HCl, 50 mM NaCl (pH 8.0), 1% 
NP-40, 0.1% SDS, and a protease and phosphatase inhibi-
tor cocktail (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The homogenate 
was clarified by ultracentrifugation, and the supernatant 
was used for BCA protein concentration measurements. 
Proteins were reduced with 10 mM TCEP and alkylated 
with 25 mM IAM. Following protein precipitation, the 
samples were reconstituted in 100 mM TEAB with 8 M 
urea (pH 8.0), and subsequently diluted with eight vol -
umes of 100 mM TEAB to reduce the urea concentration 
below 1 M. Trypsin was added at an enzyme-to-substrate 
ratio of 1:50 overnight digestion at 37 °C. After digestion, 
the peptides were desalted, dried, and reconstituted in 
0.1% formic acid. Peptide concentrations were measured 
via a NanoDrop spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher Sci -
entific) and iRT peptides (Biognosys, Schlieren, Switzer -
land) were used for LC-MS/MS analysis.
Chromatographic separation was performed as previ -
ously described. The samples (1.5 µL) were loaded onto 
a trap column (Acclaim PepMap 100, 75  μm × 20  mm, 
C18) and then separated on an analytical column (75 μm 
× 250 mm, C18, 1.9 μm) via a 110-min gradient of A (ace-
tonitrile : water = 4 : 1; 0.1% formic acid) (5–80%) and B 
(water; 0.1% formic acid) at a flow rate of 400 nL/min. 
The Q Exactive HF-X mass spectrometer was operated in 
the data-independent acquisition (DIA) mode, with each 
cycle comprising one full scan and 23 DIA scans covering 
a mass range of 300–1200 Th. The full scan was set to a 
resolution of 60,000 with an AGC target of 3e6 and an 
IT of 50 ms, followed by DIA scans with a resolution of 
30,000 and an NCE set to 30  .
Validation experiment based on parallel reaction 
monitoring (PRM)
To further validate our proteomics data, we selected pro -
teins related to lipid synthesis (Cd36, Fabp2, Fabp4, Plin2, 
Plin4, and Plin5), fatty acid oxidation (FAO) (Cpt1a, 
Acaa1b, and Cyp4a10), the mitophagy-lysosome path -
way (Bnip3, Sqstm1, Optn, Map1lc3b, Lamp1, Lamp2, 
and Atp6v0d1), cholesterol metabolism (Abdg5, Abcg8, 
Cyp7a1, and Hnf4a), and the oxidative stress response

Liang et al. Lipids in Health and Disease             (2025) 24:8 
(Gstm2, Hmox1, and Hspb1) for targeted proteomics 
analysis. Q Exactive HF-X mass spectrometer operating 
in PRM mode was employed for the analysis. Prior to 
PRM analysis, data-dependent acquisition (DDA) data 
obtained from earlier experiments were analysed via 
Thermo Proteome Discoverer software (version 2.4.1) 
to select specific peptides of the target proteins. The 
selected peptides were used to create the PRM method 
list, which included the precursor ion (m/z), charge state, 
and retention time window (Table S1). Based on the 
established method list, PRM data acquisition was per -
formed via the Q Exactive HF-X mass spectrometer, with 
the MS parameters set identically to those of the previ -
ously described proteomics experiments. Quantitative 
analysis of the fragment ions of the target peptides in the 
PRM data was conducted via Skyline software (version 
24.1). By analysing the peak area and signal intensity of 
the fragment ions, the presence and expression levels of 
the target proteins were confirmed.
Data processing
Untargeted metabolomic and lipidomic data processing  
The MS data underwent a series of pretreatment steps, 
such as peak picking, peak grouping, and retention time 
correction, via XCMS software. The raw LC-MS data 
files were initially converted into mzXML format and 
subsequently processed via XCMS, CAMERA, and the 
metaX toolbox [ 23] implemented within the R software 
environment. The intensity of each peak was recorded, 
resulting in a three-dimensional matrix comprising arbi -
trarily assigned peak indices (retention time-m/z pairs), 
sample names (observations), and ion intensity details 
(variables). Subsequent preprocessing of the peak inten -
sity data was conducted via the metaX software. Features 
detected in less than 50% of the QC samples or 80% of 
the biological samples were excluded the remaining 
peaks with missing values were imputed with the k-near -
est neighbor algorithm to further improve the data qual -
ity. Metabolome data was normalized using Probabilistic 
Quotient Normalization [ 24]. In addition, we evaluated 
the technical reproducibility with QC samples [ 25]. Low 
quantitative quality metabolic features mainly caused by 
technical error was filtered with more than 50% coeffi -
cient of variance across all QC samples [ 23]. To annotate 
the metabolites, the online Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes 
and Genomes (KEGG) and Human Metabolome Data -
bases (HMDB) were used to match the exact molecular 
mass data (m/z) of the samples with those in the data -
bases. When the mass difference between the observed 
values and database entries was less than 10 ppm, the 
metabolite was annotated. For further validation of the 
metabolite identification, a combination of fragment 
databases, including Lipidblast (version 37), MassBank, 
HMDB (version 4.0), and an in-house fragment spectrum 
library was utilised.
One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was con -
ducted to detect differences in metabolite and lipid 
concentrations among the three groups, with statistical 
significance determined by a p-value threshold of 0.05. 
To visually illustrate the differences among groups, prin -
cipal component analysis (PCA) was performed via the 
metaX software. The variable importance in the projec -
tion (VIP) values were calculated, and a VIP threshold 
of 1.0 was used to select significant features. Further 
comparisons between the two independent sample 
groups were conducted via Student’s t-tests. Differential 
metabolites were identified on the basis of a VIP > 1, a 
fold change (FC) > 1.5 or < 1/1.5, and an adjusted p-value 
(Benjamini-Hochberg) < 0.05.
Proteomic data processing  The MS/MS spectra were 
analysed via DIA-NN (version 1.8). The analysis param -
eters included fixed modifications for carbamidometh -
ylation (C), variable modifications for oxidation (M), 
enzyme specificity for trypsin, and a maximum of two 
missed cleavages. The search results were filtered to 
achieve a false discovery rate (FDR) of less than 1% at the 
protein and precursor ion levels. The remaining identifi -
cations were used for quantification.
PCA was conducted to explore the separation between 
groups. Subsequent comparisons between the two inde -
pendent sample groups were performed via Student’s 
t-tests. Differential proteins were identified on the basis 
of a fold change (FC) > 1.5 or < 1/1.5, and a p-value < 0.05.
Bioinformatics ( https:/ /www.bi oinform atic s.com.cn) 
was utilised for the visualisation of metabolomics, lipido -
mics, and proteomics data. The other statistical analyses 
were conducted using the GraphPad Prism software (ver-
sion 9.5.1) in this study. One-way ANOVA was used to 
compare statistics, followed by Dunnett’s post-hoc analy-
sis to identify specific distinctions. The results are pre -
sented as the mean ± standard error of the mean (SEM), 
and statistical significance was set at p < 0.05.
Results
Tirzepatide alleviated the blood lipid profile and liver 
damage in the HFD-induced MAFLD model
To evaluate the efficacy of establishing a mouse model 
of fatty liver, we recorded the weekly weight changes of 
the mice as an indicator of model success. Compared 
with the NCD group, the HFD group exhibited a rapid 
and significant increase in body weight starting from the 
6th week ( p < 0.05) (Supplementary Fig.  1A). Further -
more, we performed ultrasound imaging on 29 mice after 
20 weeks of feeding to validate the development of fatty 
liver. Imaging results (Supplementary Fig.  1B) indicated 
that in the NCD group, the kidneys were more echo -
genic than the liver, whereas in the HFD group, the liver

echogenicity was notably higher than that in the kidneys. 
This increased liver echogenicity correlated with lipid 
accumulation, indicating the development of fatty liver. 
quantified the grayscale ratio of liver parenchyma to renal 
cortex echo, which was recorded as the hepatorenal index 
(HRI). Quantification of the greyscale ratio between the 
hepatic parenchyma and renal cortical echoes confirmed 
these observations (Supplementary Fig. 1C).
To assess the effect of tirzepatide on MAFLD, we also 
recorded the weekly weight and food intake of the mice 
after tirzepatide treatment. Body weight significantly 
decreased in the 1st week of tirzepatide treatment, and 
by the 12th week, the body weight of HFD + tirzepatide 
group approached that of the NCD group (Fig.  1A). The 
weekly food intake of the HFD + tirzepatide group was 
significantly lower than that of the HFD group (Fig.  1B). 
To further verify the therapeutic effects of tirzepatide, 
we weighed the livers of the mice after 12 weeks of treat -
ment. The liver weight significantly decreased in the 
HFD + tirzepatide group compared with the HFD group 
(Fig. 1C). These findings demonstrate the efficacy of tirz -
epatide in reducing body weight and liver fat accumula -
tion in the HFD-induced MAFLD model.
To evaluate the effects of tirzepatide on liver damage, 
we measured serum levels of TG, TC, HDL-C, LDL-C, 
ALT and AST after 12 weeks of treatment. The levels 
were significantly higher in the HFD group than in the 
NCD group. After treatment, the TG, TC, HDL-C, and 
LDL-C levels were significantly decreased (Fig.  1D-G), 
indicating an alleviation of dyslipidaemia following the 
tirzepatide treatment. Tirzepatide also mitigated liver 
damage, as indicated by reduced serum ALT and AST 
levels (Fig. 1H, I).
Tirzepatide reduced hepatic steatosis and inflammation in 
the HFD-induced MAFLD model
Liver histology and quantification results are shown in 
Fig. 2A-D. HE staining and quantitative analysis revealed 
a significant increase in the number and volume of fat 
vacuoles, as well as inflammatory infiltration, in the liver 
tissues of HFD-fed mice. Treatment with tirzepatide 
notably ameliorated these histopathological changes, as 
evidenced by a reduction in both fat vacuoles and inflam-
matory infiltration (Fig. 2A, C). Furthermore, ORO stain-
ing was employed to quantify the hepatic lipid content. 
The results demonstrated a significant increase in lipid 
accumulation within the hepatocytes of the HFD group 
compared with those of the NCD group, with liver fat 
constituting approximately 50%. This pronounced lipid 
accumulation indicated severe fatty liver degeneration 
in the HFD group. However, treatment with tirzepatide 
significantly reduced hepatic lipid droplet deposition 
(Fig. 2B, D).

Effects of tirzepatide on liver metabolic profiling and 
pathways
Using UHPLC-MS/MS in both the ESI (+) and ESI (-) 
modes to ensure comprehensive metabolite coverage, 
we identified 2,268 metabolites that were subsequently 
categorised into 17 superclasses across all samples 
(Supplementary Fig.  2A). The detected metabolites pre -
dominantly included 613 lipids and lipid-like molecules 
(27.03%), 521 organic acids and their derivatives (22.97%), 
and 334 organoheterocyclic compounds (14.73%). The 
separation of metabolites among the NCD, HFD, and 
HFD + tirzepatide groups is depicted in the PCA score 
plots (Fig. 3A). The results indicated that the NCD, HFD, 
and HFD + tirzepatide groups were distinctly separated 
based on their metabolic characteristics, demonstrating 
inter-group differences. In addition, the QC samples con-
firmed the reliability of the experimental procedure and 
the stability of the instrumentation. A total of 926 differ -
ential metabolites were identified across the three groups 
via one-way ANOVA. Hierarchical clustering (Supple -
mentary Fig.  2B) and K-means clustering (Fig.  3B) anal-
yses revealed that lipids and lipid-like molecules were 
significantly elevated in the HFD group compared with 
the NCD group. This elevation was significantly reversed 
following tirzepatide treatment. Similarly, organic acids 
and their derivatives were significantly reduced in the 
HFD group compared with the NCD group, and this 
reduction was also significantly reversed by tirzepatide 
treatment. These results indicate that tirzepatide may 
exert its therapeutic effects by modulating lipid metabo -
lism and organic acid metabolism.
To assess the effects of tirzepatide on MAFLD metabo -
lomics, a comparative analysis was performed between 
the HFD and NCD groups, and between the HFD + tirz-
epatide and HFD groups. The results revealed a total 
of 636 significant differential metabolites between the 
HFD and NCD groups (169 upregulated and 467 down -
regulated), as illustrated in the heat map (Supplementary 
Fig.  2C). The disrupted metabolic pathways primarily 
included protein digestion and absorption, glycerophos -
pholipid metabolism, central carbon metabolism in can -
cer, and metabolic pathway (Fig. 3C).
In the protein digestion and absorption pathway, we 
observed that in the HFD group, the levels of several 
amino acids, including L-serine, proline, L-isoleucine, 
L-histidine, and L-glutamic acid, were significantly 
downregulated (Fig.  3D). The metabolic disruption of 
these amino acids may lead to abnormalities in glucose

tomicrograph area. Significant differences were noted, with *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001, and ****p < 0.0001 compared with the HFD group

regulation of L-isoleucine may result in branched-chain 
amino acid metabolism disorders, subsequently affecting 
insulin signalling and glucose metabolism [26]. Addition-
ally, the decreased levels of L-glutamic acid and L-serine 
may impair glutamine synthesis [ 27] and one-carbon 
metabolism [ 28]. Meanwhile, in the analysis of nucleo -
sides, nucleotides, and their analogues, we found that the 
levels of cytidine, deoxycytidine, adenosine, and adenos -
ine diphosphate (ADP) tended to decrease in the HFD 
group (Fig.  3E). This downregulation of metabolites may 
be attributed to decreased amino acid levels affecting 
one-carbon metabolism, thereby inhibiting nucleotide 
synthesis pathways, which in turn impacts cellular energy 
metabolism and DNA/RNA synthesis.
Conversely, compared with the HFD group, after tirz -
epatide treatment, we identified 526 significant metabo -
lites (377 upregulated, 149 downregulated), as shown in 
the heat map (Supplementary Fig.  2D). Among these, 
56 metabolites were upregulated in the HFD group 
compared with those in the NCD group and were sub -
sequently reduced after tirzepatide treatment. 241 
metabolites were downregulated in the HFD group 
and then increased in the HFD + tirzepatide group. 
The altered metabolic pathways post-treatment mainly 
included protein digestion and absorption, glycero -
phospholipid metabolism, central carbon metabolism in 
cancer, as well as taurine and hypotaurine metabolism 
(Fig.  3F). These pathways are primarily involved in the 
metabolism, digestion, and absorption of proteins and 
lipids, highlighting the broad metabolic effects of tirzepa-
tide treatment.
Effects of tirzepatide on liver lipidomic profiling and 
pathways
The analysis identified 1,378 lipid molecules through 
UHPLC-MS/MS in both ESI (+) and ESI (-) modes, fur -
ther classified into 70 distinct lipid species (Fig.  4A). The 
most prevalent lipid species were 160 TG (11.61%), 136 
phosphatidylcholines (PC, 9.87%), and 114 ether-linked 
lysophosphatidylethanolamines (Ether PE, 8.27%). A total 
of 772 differential lipids were identified across the three 
groups (NCD, HFD, and HFD + tirzepatide) via one-way 
ANOVA. The PCA score plot showed distinct clusters 
among the groups (Fig.  4B), and the clustering of QC 
samples indicated the stability of the experimental pro -
cess. Further hierarchical clustering analysis showed sig -
nificant differences in the lipid profiles among the three 
groups (Fig. 4C).
In addition, differential analysis was conducted 
between the HFD and NCD groups, as well as between 
the HFD + tirzepatide and HFD groups. In total, 490 sig -
nificantly different lipids were identified between the 
HFD and NCD groups. Among these differential lipids, 
TG represented 12.65%, PC 12.24%, and Ether PE 9.59% 
(Fig.  4D). Between the HFD + tirzepatide and HFD 
groups, 420 differential lipids were identified, with 280 
upregulated and 140 downregulated. The major differen -
tial lipids identified were TG (15.71%), Ether PE (10.71%), 
and PC (6.43%) (Fig.  4E). The relative contents of fatty 
acids (FA), phosphatidylinositol (PI), and phosphatidyl -
glycerol (PG) were significantly upregulated in the HFD 
group compared to those in the NCD group. Conversely, 
PC, phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), and lysophophati -
dylcholine (LPC) levels were downregulated. In the HFD 
group, the profiles of Triglycerides (TG, 66.13%) and dia -
cylglycerol (DG, 26.67%) were upregulated (Supplemen -
tary Fig.  3A). In the HFD + tirzepatide group, the relative 
levels of PC, PE, and LPC were significantly upregulated 
compared with those in the HFD group, whereas the lev -
els of DG, PI, and FA were downregulated. Furthermore, 
the TG levels (65.15%) were also decreased (Supplemen -
tary Fig.  3B). These results indicated that tirzepatide 
treatment induced a notable shift in circulating lipid 
profiles, suggesting potential therapeutic effects on lipid 
metabolism in MAFLD.
Identification of key protein targets and potential 
mechanisms of tirzepatide
A total of 6838 quantifiable proteins were identified via 
LC-MS/MS. Visualisation of protein separation between 
the HFD and NCD groups, as well as the HFD + tirzepa-
tide and HFD groups, was accomplished using PCA score 
plots (Fig.  5A, B). The plot showed that the protein pro -
files were distinctly segregated, indicating considerable 
variability, primarily through two principal components.
The study identified 753 differentially regulated pro -
teins (356 upregulated and 397 downregulated) in the 
HFD group compared with the NCD group (Supplemen -
tary Fig.  4A), and 794 differentially regulated proteins 
(511 upregulated and 283 downregulated) in the HFD 
group compared with the HFD group (Supplementary 
Fig.  4B). Among these, 162 upregulated proteins in the 
HFD group were modulated by tirzepatide treatment 
and 201 downregulated proteins in the HFD group were 
restored to normal levels by tirzepatide treatment (Sup -
plementary Fig. 4C).
To further understand the biological functions and key 
pathways involved in tirzepatide treatment for MAFLD, 
we conducted functional enrichment analysis via Gene 
Ontology (GO) and KEGG. Compared with the NCD 
group, the HFD group exhibited significant changes in 
biological processes (BP) such as cellular lipid metabo -
lism and fatty acid metabolic. In the cellular component 
(CC) category, enrichment analysis revealed significant 
alterations in peroxisome and autophagosome mem -
brane. Molecular function (MF) analysis indicated sig -
nificant changes in oxidoreductase activity and catalytic 
Page 9 of 17
Liang et al. Lipids in Health and Disease             (2025) 24:8 
activity (Fig.  5C). KEGG pathway enrichment analysis 
further revealed that the differential proteins were pri -
marily involved in key pathways such as retinol metab -
olism, steroid hormone biosynthesis, PPAR signalling 
pathway, lysosome, and fatty acid degradation, all of 
which are closely related to lipid metabolism and protein 
degradation (Fig. 5D).
In the PPAR signalling pathway, the expression of FA 
transport proteins (Cd36), fatty acid-binding proteins 
(Fabp2, Fabp4), and perilipins (Plin2, Plin4, and Plin5)

Liang et al. Lipids in Health and Disease             (2025) 24:8 
associated with lipid accumulation were significantly 
increased. This was consistent with the lipidomic results 
showing increased FA and TG in the HFD group. Fur -
thermore, the upregulation of FAO related proteins such 
as Cpt1a, Acaa1b, Ehhadh, and Cyp4a10 suggests that the 
liver is attempting to counteract lipid accumulation by 
increasing FAO.
Additional differential enrichment analysis found 
that proteins related to the mitophagy pathway, such 
as Sqstm1, Bnip3, Map1lc3b, and Optn, were signifi -
cantly upregulated, suggesting an increase in mitochon -
drial damage. However, in the lysosomal pathway, most 
acid hydrolases and Atp6v0d1 were downregulated. The 
downregulation of Atp6v0d1 indicates a potential reduc -
tion in the conversion of ATP to ADP , which may affect 
the pH of lysosomes. Metabolomics data also showed 
decreased ADP levels, further supporting the hypothesis 
of altered lysosomal pH.
Compared to the HFD group, tirzepatide treatment 
exhibited significant changes in various BP , particularly 
in cellular lipid catabolic and peroxisomal transport. In 
the CC category, enrichment analysis revealed significant 
changes in the microbody membrane and peroxisomal 
membrane, suggesting the critical role of these mem -
brane structures in metabolic regulation. MF analysis 
indicated that tirzepatide treatment significantly regu -
lated steroid hydroxylase activity and acyl-CoA hydrolase 
activity. These changes in enzyme activity may directly 
impact lipid metabolic pathways (Fig. 5E).
KEGG pathway enrichment analysis indicated that 
the differential proteins following tirzepatide treatment 
were primarily enriched in key metabolic pathways 
such as PPAR signalling pathway, lysosome, cholesterol 
metabolism, retinol metabolism, and fatty acid degrada -
tion (Fig.  5F). Within the cholesterol metabolism path -
way, we observed a significant upregulation of Abcg5 
and Abcg8 after tirzepatide treatment. Furthermore, the 
protein Hnf4a, a regulator of cholesterol metabolism, was 
markedly upregulated. These findings suggest that post-
treatment, there was an increased transport of choles -
terol to the gallbladder, potentially reducing cholesterol 
accumulation. Thus, these findings imply that tirzepatide 
may reduce lipid accumulation and protect hepatocytes 
through multiple mechanisms.
In addition, we employed the STRING database to per -
form a protein-protein interaction (PPI) network analyses 
on 188 proteins enriched in significant KEGG pathways 
(p < 0.05) between the HFD group and the HFD + tirzepa-
tide group. Subsequently, we visualised the network using 
Cytoscape software (Fig.  5G). This analysis showed that 
several critical proteins, including Cyp7a1, Scarb1, Pck1, 
Abcg5, Abcg8, and Nr1h4 were significantly upregulated 
after post-treatment, indicating enhanced liver func -
tion and bile acid metabolism. In contrast, proteins such 
as CD36, Acox3, Acaa1b, Ehhadh, Cyp4a10, Hsd17b4, 
Adipoq, and Lipe were significantly downregulated, sug -
gesting reduced lipid peroxidation and inflammation. 
These proteins are known for their substantial roles in 
liver metabolism, lipid transport, and the inflammatory 
response.
Integration analysis of the mechanistic effects of 
tirzepatide in MAFLD
To further investigate the molecular mechanisms through 
which tirzepatide alleviates MAFLD, we conducted a 
comprehensive analysis of liver tissues via metabolomics, 
lipidomics, and proteomics. Our findings indicate that 
tirzepatide treatment reverses the key disrupted meta -
bolic and mitophagic pathways identified in MAFLD 
mice, as shown in Fig.  6. After treatment with tirzepa -
tide, the expression of free fatty acids (FFA) and FA trans-
port proteins (Fabp2, Fabp5, and Cd36) was significantly 
downregulated, potentially reducing hepatic lipid uptake. 
In addition, the levels of DG, TG, and lipid droplet pro -
teins (Plin2, Plin4, and Plin5) were significantly reduced, 
which was consistent with the observed decrease in 
hepatic lipid accumulation. Further analysis revealed that 
key proteins involved in gluconeogenesis, pentose phos -
phate pathway, and glycogen synthesis were significantly 
upregulated after administration, indicating the resto -
ration of glucose metabolism. FA oxidation-associated 
proteins (Ehhadh, Acaa1a, Acaa1b, and Cyp4a10) were 
downregulated after tirzepatide treatment, suggesting a 
reduction in compensatory lipid oxidation. This may have 
a positive effect on alleviating oxidative stress and pro -
tecting the mitochondria from damage. Furthermore, the 
lysosome-related compounds D-mannose-6-phosphate 
(M6P) and Tcirg1 protein were upregulated ( p < 0.05), 
ensuring proper transport and activity of lysosomal acid 
hydrolases. Concurrently, the metabolic disturbances in 
phospholipids (PC, PI, PG, and PS), amino acids, choles -
terol, and bile acids were corrected ( p < 0.05) following 
tirzepatide treatment. In summary, tirzepatide alleviates 
MAFLD pathology through multiple pathways, includ -
ing the improvement of cholesterol, glucose, and lipid 
metabolism, as well as the enhancement of mitophagy.
Validation of multiple mechanisms of tirzepatide 
treatment in MAFLD mice
To further elucidate the molecular mechanisms by which 
tirzepatide treats MAFLD in mice, we conducted PRM 
experiments on liver tissues to verify the reliability of 
protein expression levels.
In the HFD group, the expression levels of Cd36, Fabp2, 
Fabp4, Plin2, Plin4, and Plin5 were significantly upregu -
lated. After tirzepatide treatment, the expression of these 
proteins was significantly reduced (Fig.  7A). FAO-related 
proteins Cpt1a, Acaa1b, and Cyp4a10 were significantly

Liang et al. Lipids in Health and Disease             (2025) 24:8 
upregulated in the HFD group (Fig.  7B), along with anti -
oxidant stress proteins Gstm2, Hmox1, and Hspb1. In 
the tirzepatide treatment group, the expression of these 
proteins was significantly reduced, suggesting that tirz -
epatide can alleviate oxidative stress (Fig.  7C). Mito -
chondrial autophagy-related proteins (Bnip3 and Optn) 
were significantly elevated in the HFD group, while 
lysosome-related protein Atp6v0d1 was significantly 
downregulated. After tirzepatide treatment, mitochon -
drial autophagy-related protein Optn was downregu -
lated, and lysosome-related proteins (Lamp1 and Lamp2) 
were upregulated (Fig.  7D). Additionally, we found that 
proteins involved in cholesterol metabolism, such as 
Abcg5, Abcg8, Cyp7a1, and Hnf4a, were significantly 
upregulated after tirzepatide treatment (Fig.  7E), which 
increased the direct transport of cholesterol to the gall -
bladder and its excretion via faeces, thereby reducing the 
amount of cholesterol in systemic circulation.
Discussion
MAFLD is significantly influenced by unbalanced 
dietary habits, such as high-fat and high-sugar intake 
[29, 30]. Our study demonstrated that the HFD mouse 
model exhibits notable hepatic fat accumulation, which 
increases the risk of MAFLD. MAFLD is strongly asso -
ciated with the development of NASH, liver cirrhosis, 
hepatocellular carcinoma [31], along with cardiovascular 
diseases [ 32] and type 2 diabetes [ 33]. Although lifestyle 
modifications such as dietary management and physical 
activity can enhance MAFLD outcomes, sustaining these 
alterations over extended periods is often difficult for 
individuals. Presently, no medication has gained wide -
spread approval for MAFLD therapy; however, certain 
pharmaceuticals have demonstrated potential in clinical 
trials [34–36].
Our results indicated that tirzepatide significantly 
decreased liver damage and lipid metabolism disruption 
in MAFLD mice ( p < 0.05), as evidenced by a decrease in 
body weight and serum concentrations of ALT, AST, TC, 
TG, and LDL-C ( p < 0.05). Histopathological evaluations 
revealed a reduction in hepatic lipid accumulation, con -
sistent with previous research suggesting the potential of 
tirzepatide for the therapeutic treatment of fatty liver [37, 
38].
Individual GLP-1R [ 39, 40] or GIPR [ 41] agonists may 
exert their effects through the central nervous system, 
stimulating receptors on neurones that regulate appetite 
to decrease food consumption and appetite, and enhance 
satiety. Recent studies have indicated that GIPR/GLP1R 
agonists stimulate these neurones more potently than 
single agonists, resulting in substantial reductions in food 
intake and body weight [ 15, 38, 42]. This, at least partly, 
accounts for the additional decrease in hepatic steatosis 
observed with tirzepatide treatment, likely by diminish -
ing the flow of nutrients to the liver.
Through comprehensive metabolomics, lipidomics, 
and proteomics analyses, we identified that the PPAR 
pathway plays a crucial role in lipid metabolism regula -
tion and the progression of MAFLD. Specifically, in com-
parison with the NCD group, the expression of proteins 
associated with PPAR pathway activation was mark -
edly elevated in the HFD group, including Cd36, Fabp2, 
Fabp4, Plin2, Plin4, Plin5, Capt1a, Acaa1b, and Cyp4a10 
(p < 0.05) [43]. Reports have shown that the upregulation 
of Cd36 contributes to lipid accumulation and triggers 
inflammatory responses through the activation of the 
JNK pathway [ 44]. Cd36 is a key protein involved in the 
uptake of free FFA by the liver. Increased Cd36 expres -
sion suggests enhanced hepatic uptake of FFAs, indicat -
ing an increased influx of lipids. Fabp2 and Fabp4 are 
fatty acid-binding proteins that facilitate intracellular 
transport of these FA, further explaining the elevated lev-
els of FFAs such as palmitelaidic acid, palmitic acid, oleic 
acid, and cis-8,11,14,17-eicosatetraenoic acid in the liver. 
In addition, the significant upregulation of Plin2, Plin4, 
and Plin5 in the HFD group, which are lipid droplet-asso-
ciated proteins, promotes steatosis. Hepatic lipidomic 
results revealed elevated levels of TG, PI, and PG, indi -
cating significant lipid accumulation. Proteins involved 
in FAO, such as the FA β-oxidation proteins Capt1a and 
Acaa1b and the FA ω-oxidation protein Cyp4a10, were 
significantly increased in the HFD group, suggesting 
that the liver attempts to reduce lipid accumulation by 
enhancing FAO. However, this compensatory increase in 
FAO can lead to mitochondrial overloading and subse -
quent damage, resulting in increased oxidative stress and 
inflammatory responses [45, 46].
We also found a significant increase in the expression 
of proteins related to antioxidative stress, such as Gstm2, 
Hspb1, and Hmox1, in the HFD group ( p < 0.05), further 
confirming that the compensatory increase in FAO may 
stimulate oxidative stress and inflammation regulation 
[47, 48]. In conclusion, our findings suggest that while the 
activation of the PPAR pathway helps reduce lipid accu -
mulation and inflammatory responses, the compensatory 
upregulation of FAO may exacerbate oxidative stress and 
inflammation by overproducing reactive oxygen species 
(ROS) [49].
Post-treatment with tirzepatide, resulted in a signifi -
cant reduction in the levels of key proteins and metabo -
lites (p < 0.05). This suggests that tirzepatide may alleviate 
oxidative stress and inflammation by downregulating 
proteins involved in lipid synthesis and FAO, thereby 
reducing overall FAO and ROS production.
The PRM results also revealed that the concentrations 
of proteins involved in mitophagy, such as Bnip3 and 
Optn, were significantly higher in the high-fat diet (HFD) 
Page 14 of 17
Liang et al. Lipids in Health and Disease             (2025) 24:8 
group compared to the NCD group ( p < 0.05), indicat-
ing enhanced mitophagy [ 50]. Increased mitophagy is 
typically associated with elevated mitochondrial dam -
age, which aids in the clearance of dysfunctional mito -
chondria and maintains cellular stability. Given the close 
connection between mitochondrial damage and oxidative 
stress [51, 52], the elevation of mitophagy could also indi-
cate an escalation in the internal oxidative stress levels 
within the liver. Mitophagy, a vital aspect of autophagy, 
is an essential degradation and recycling mechanism 
within cells. After autophagosome formation, fusion with 
lysosomes forms autolysosomes, where lysosomal hydro -
lases degrade the enclosed material and recycle small 
molecules, such as amino acids and nucleotides [ 53]. The 
fusion of autophagosomes and lysosomes is mediated by 
Snare proteins [ 53]. In our study, we detected a signifi -
cant downregulation of the key lipid PE, which promotes 
the interaction between Snare and LC3-I, indicating 
impaired fusion of autophagosomes and lysosomes [ 54]. 
Moreover, the results demonstrated a significant upreg -
ulation of Sqstm1 (P62, which is inversely related to 
autophagic activity) protein in the HFD group, suggesting 
that the autophagic process might be hindered [ 55]. The 
accumulation of P62 protein generally reflects a blockage 
in autophagic flux, meaning that autophagosomes cannot 
effectively fuse with lysosomes for degradation. Recent 
reports [ 56] have shown that Cd36 can recruit Ubqln1 
to promote Snare protein degradation, providing further 
evidence for the inhibition of autophagosome-lysosome 
fusion.
In addition, enrichment analysis indicated disrup -
tions in the lysosomal pathway within the HFD group, 
where the expression levels of some acidic hydrolases 
were decreased. Atp6v0d1, which converts ATP to ADP , 
was significantly downregulated ( p < 0.05), affecting the 
pH balance within lysosomes [ 57]. Metabolomic data 
revealed a significant downregulation in the expression of 
ADP , amino acids (such as L-serine, proline, L-isoleucine, 
L-histidine, and L-glutamic acid), as well as nucleosides, 
nucleotides, and their analogues (including Cytidine, 
Deoxycytidine, and Adenosine). These findings further 
suggest defects in autolysosomal function. Post-treat -
ment with tirzepatide led to a downregulation of Optn 
expression level, potentially indicating reduced mito -
chondrial damage. Concurrently, there was a significant 
upregulation in Lamp1 and Lamp2 (Proteins involved 
in the regulation of lysosomal pH) [ 58], lysosomal acidic 
hydrolases, and metabolites such as PE and M6P (a sig -
nalling molecule for the transportation of newly syn -
thesised lysosomal enzymes to lysosomes) [ 59], while 
Sqstm1 protein levels were notably downregulated. This 
indicates that the drug may enhance lysosomal func -
tion and facilitate the fusion of autophagosomes and 
lysosomes, thereby restoring normal lipid and protein 
degradation and autophagic function. This may indicate 
the capacity of the drug to enhance lysosomal function 
recovery and the fusion of autophagosomes and lyso -
somes, thereby facilitating the normal degradation of lip -
ids and proteins and restoration of autophagic function.
Furthermore, we observed significant changes in cho -
lesterol metabolism following tirzepatide administration, 
as indicated by the proteomics and metabolomics results 
(p < 0.05). Metabolomics data showed that, compared to 
the NCD group, the HFD group exhibited a significant 
increase in the expression of primary bile acids (cho -
lic acid) and their conjugated form (taurocholic acid), 
as well as the bile acid-sensing nuclear receptor Nr1h4 
antagonist (tauro-β-muricholic acid) ( p < 0.05) [ 60]. 
Conversely, the expression of Cyp7a1, the key enzyme 
responsible for converting cholesterol into bile acids, was 
significantly downregulated ( p < 0.05). The downregula -
tion of Cyp7a1, crucial for cholesterol to bile acid con -
version, resulted in a reduced efficiency of this process 
and subsequent cholesterol accumulation in the liver. 
Reports [61] indicate that heightened expression of Cd36 
enhances chronic inflammatory signalling, reduces cho -
lesterol excretion, leads to hepatic cholesterol accumula -
tion, and contributes to fatty liver disease. This suggests 
a potential disruption in cholesterol-bile acid metabo -
lism, where cholesterol accumulation and reduced bile 
acid synthesis may trigger inflammatory responses and 
hepatocyte damage [ 62]. In the HFD + tirzepatide group, 
the expression of the cholesterol transporter Abcg5 and 
Abcg8 was significantly increased ( p < 0.05), thereby 
enhancing cholesterol efflux capacity [ 63]. The upregula-
tion of Hnf4a, Abcg5, and Abcg8 was accompanied by a 
significant decrease in taurocholic acid levels. The upreg -
ulation of Hnf4a not only optimised bile acid metabolism 
directly but also promoted the expressions of Abcg5 and 
Abcg8 by regulating related genes. These findings suggest 
that tirzepatide significantly improves cholesterol and 
bile acid metabolism and excretion by upregulating key 
transporters and nuclear receptors, thereby alleviating 
the pathological state of fatty liver disease.
Conclusion
Our study provides evidence for the potential of tirzepa -
tide to alleviate lipid accumulation and maintain hepato -
cyte function in the HFD mouse model, underscoring its 
application prospects in treating metabolic diseases. By 
integrating metabolomics, lipidomics, and proteomics 
analyses, combined with PRM validation, we identified 
that tirzepatide exerts its effects through multiple mech -
anisms. These mechanisms include reducing FA uptake 
and lipid accumulation, enhancing mitochondria-lyso -
some function, improving lipid metabolism, and regu -
lating cholesterol metabolism. Collectively, these effects
