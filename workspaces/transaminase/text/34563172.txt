Abstract 
Background: The unnatural amino acid, L-2-aminobutyric acid (L-ABA) is an essential chiral building block for various 
pharmaceutical drugs, such as the antiepileptic drug levetiracetam and the antituberculosis drug ethambutol. The 
present study aims at obtaining variants of ω-transaminase from Ochrobactrum anthropi (OATA) with high catalytic 
activity to α-ketobutyric acid through protein engineering.
Results: Based on the docking model using α-ketobutyric acid as the ligand, 6 amino acid residues, consisting of 
Y20, L57, W58, G229, A230 and M419, were chosen for saturation mutagenesis. The results indicated that L57C, M419I, 
and A230S substitutions demonstrated the highest elevation of enzymatic activity among 114 variants. Subsequently, 
double substitutions combining L57C and M419I caused a further increase of the catalytic efficiency to 3.2-fold. 
This variant was applied for threonine deaminase/OATA coupled reaction in a 50-mL reaction system with 300 mM 
L-threonine as the substrate. The reaction was finished in 12 h and the conversion efficiency of L-threonine into L-ABA 
was 94%. The purity of L-ABA is 75%, > 99% ee. The yield of L-ABA was 1.15 g.
Conclusion: This study provides a basis for further engineering of ω-transaminase for producing chiral amines from 
keto acids substrates.

Background
L-ABA is an essential chiral building block for various 
pharmaceutical drugs, such as the antiepileptic drug 
levetiracetam and the antituberculosis drug ethambu -
tol, etc. [1–3]. The Asymmetric synthesis of L-ABA with 
both chemocatalytic and biocatalytic strategies has been 
developed and the biocatalytic methods have attracted 
growing attention due to environmental and social 
demands for green processes in the chemical industry 
recently [4]. The most intensively studied biocatalytic 
methods for the synthesis of L-ABA focus on enzyme-
based kinetic resolution of (R, S)-2-aminobutyric acid 
and amination of α-ketobutyric acid using L-amino dehy-
drogenase [5] or transaminase [6]. In the reductive ami -
nation process with dehydrogenase using L-threonine as 
the precursor, formate dehydrogenase (FDH) is added to 
regenerate NADH. However extra  NAD+ must be added 
to the mixture during the reaction in a timely fashion to 
guarantee the complete bioconversion of L-threonine 
to L-ABA [7]. Hence, the high cost of  NAD+ limited its 
application in the industry.
On the other hand, transaminases are pyridoxal-5′ 
phosphate (PLP)-dependent enzymes [8] that are 
involved in reversible transfer of amino groups from 
amino donors to carbonyle of amino receptors.

Transaminases display high reaction rates, broad sub -
strate spectrum, and no requirement of cofactor regen -
eration [2], which render these enzymes attractive for 
industrial process development [4, 9]. In 2001, Fother -
ingham’s group developed a three-enzyme system includ-
ing threonine deaminase, tyrosine aminotransferase, and 
acetolactate synthase to produce L-ABA with L-aspartic 
acid and L-threonine as starting materials. L-threonine 
was converted by threonine deaminase of E. coli to obtain 
α-ketobutyric acid, which in turn, converted to L-ABA 
using the aromatic transaminase of E. coli encoded by 
tyrB, with L-aspartate as the amino donor. Meanwhile, 
acetolactate synthase from Bacillus subtilis 168 elimi -
nates pyruvate and alanine, which are the by-products of 
aspartate transamination. The overall yield of L-ABA was 
54% [10]. Zhu et al. optimized this method by introduc -
ing alanine racemase and D-amino acid oxidase into the 
system [11]. In 2009, Shin et al. chose a ω-transaminase 
(ω-TA) from Vibrio fluvialis JS17 to catalyze the asym -
metric synthesis of L-ABA using 2-oxobutyric acid and 
benzylamine as starting materials in an extractive bipha -
sic reaction system [1]. In 2018, Heuson et  al. realized 
both enantiomers of ABA were efficiently prepared in an 
equilibrium shifted reaction using glutamine as amine 
donor [8]. In 2010, Park et al. established a cost-effective 
TD/ω-TA coupled one-pot method to produce L-ABA. 
L-threonine is deaminized with threonine deaminase 
(TD, EC4.2.1.6) encoded by ilv A gene of E. coli to gen -
erate α-ketobutyric acid in the first step. Next, L-ABA 
was synthesized through reductive amination with ben -
zylamine as amino donor. (S)-selective ω-TA from Ochro-
bactrum anthropi (OATA) was employed to catalyze this 
process. The conversion yield reached 91% with 10 mM 
L-threonine and 20 mM benzylamine. Park modified this 
process by using isopropylamine as amino donor (2013). 
OATA has exceptionally high activity for isopropylamine 
and the deamination product of isopropylamine is ace -
tone, a non-reactive amino acceptor easily removable 
owing to high volatility. Therefore, this reaction over -
came the unfavorable equilibrium. Park’s study demon -
strated a TD/OATA coupled reaction using L-threonine 
(100  mM) and isopropylamine (2 Equiv.) to generate 
L-ABA and gained 99% conversion yield with 99% ee in 
1 h. Preparative scale synthesis with L-threonine (1.79 g, 
15 mmol) and isopropylamine (1.94 mL, 22.5 mmol) in a 
50-mL reaction system, conversion efficiency of over 99% 
was attained within 12 h [12].
In the TD and OATA cascade reaction, the reaction 
catalyzed by TD was much faster than that of OATA. 
Asymmetric synthesis of chiral amines using OATA has 
suffered from an unfavorable reaction equilibrium when 
a high concentration of substrate was used [13–15]. 
Therefore, OATA determines the conversion yield of 
the whole process. To overcome this limitation, creating 
OATA variants with high turnover efficiency for asym -
metric amination of α-ketobutyric acid is necessary [16–
18]. In the present study, we performed substrate docking 
simulations to identify key active-site residues around 
α-ketobutyric acid and performed saturation mutagen -
esis to these amino acid residues. The result indicated 
that L57C, M419I and A230S substitutions demonstrated 
the highest elevation of enzymatic activity and double 
substitutions combining L57C and M419I caused a fur -
ther increase of the catalytic efficiency. This variant was 
applied for TD/OATA coupled reaction in a 50-mL reac -
tion system and demonstrated higher conversion effi -
ciency in comparison with wild-type OATA.
Results
Molecular docking and engineering of OATA 
Substrate docking simulation using α-ketobutyric 
acid as the ligand is shown in Fig.  1 (Additional file  2: 
Table  S1). The active site harboring an inward-point 
arginine (R417) was used for docking simulation [24]. 
The structure of OATA with pyruvic acid as substrate 
was used as the template. When R417 adopts an out -
ward conformation, the large pocket becomes too 
contracted to recognize the carboxyl group. On the 
contrary, the large pocket is able to accumulate a big -
ger group, such as keto acid group of α-ketobutyric acid

when R417 adopts inward conformation. Therefore, we 
chose an inward conformation of R417 for docking sim -
ulation. For the docking simulation, the ethyl group of 
α-ketobutyric acid is located in a small pocket while the 
carboxyl group is located in a large pocket. The ethyl 
group was wrapped by amino acid residues including 
Y20, F86, Y151, and A230. It is worth noting that W58 
and R417 in the large pocket formed multiple hydrogen 
bonds with the carbonyl oxygen and carboxyl group of 
the substrate, which implied the importance of those 
two amino acids.
Based on the result of docking simulation, 6 amino 
acid residues, consisting of Y20, L57, W58, G229, 
A230 and M419, lying within a 5 Ǻ - distance from the 
bound α-ketobutyric acid were selected for saturation 
mutagenesis and all the 114 possible variants with a sin -
gle mutation were generated. The activity of all OATA 
variants for α-ketobutyric acid was tested with thin layer 
chromatography (TLC). The result of TLC indicated 
that L57A, L57C, A230S, M419I, M419W, M419C, and 
M419A displayed an obvious increase in the conversion 
efficiency of α-ketobutyric acid to L-ABA while M419T, 
and M419V showed a slight elevation in comparison 
with wild-type OATA (Additional file  1: Figure S1). 
Consistent with the docking model, W58 is an impor -
tant amino acid residue and all the substitutions of W58 
failed to improve the activity of OATA.
Mutants showing obviously improved activity were 
purified (Additional file  1: Figure S2) and their activities 
were analyzed with HPLC. The result indicated that three 
variants L57C, M419I and A230S demonstrated the most 
obvious improvement, which were 2.7, 1.8 and 1.7-fold, 
respectively (Fig.  2). To achieve further improvements, 
these three mutations were combined to generate three 
double mutants, L57C/A230S, L57C/M419I and A230S/
M419I. Among them, OATA L57C/M419I showed the most 
obvious improvement. Its catalytic efficiency increased 
3.2-fold in comparison with wild-type OATA. Both 
L57C/A230S and A230S/M419I variants demonstrated 
an elevation of specific activity compared with wild-type, 
but reduced activity against single mutants (Fig. 2).
Kinetic analysis of L57C/M419I variant
The kinetic parameters of the wild-type OATA and 
OATA L57C/M419I was investigated (Table  1, Additional 
file 1: Figure S5, Additionl file 2: Table S2). The  Km of the 
mutant was similar to that of the wild-type enzyme. On 
the contrary, the catalytic turnover increased 2.2-fold in 
comparison with the wild-type enzyme, leading to a 2.3-
fold increase in the k cat/Km for the transaminase. This 
result indicated that the double mutation affected the 
catalytic efficiency of OATA.
Mechanism analysis for the improved activity of OATA L57C/
M419I
In comparison with the docking location of α-ketobutyric 
acid in the wild-type enzyme, the substrate in the mutant 
active site spun clockwise and the ethyl group oriented to 
I419 (Fig.  3A). This translocation allowed a new hydro -
gen bond formed between the carbonyl oxygen of the 
substrate and PMP while the preexisting hydrogen bonds 
between W58 and the substrate were concurrently lost. 
Meanwhile, hydrophobic interaction formed between 
I419, A230, and ethyl group of the substrate attributed 
new forces to stabilize the substrate. The altered bind -
ing of α-ketobutyric acid in the active site of the mutant 
led to a significant decrease in the distance between car -
bonyl carbon of the substrate and the PMP from 4.420 to 
3.455Ǻ, which might contribute to the increased catalytic 
activity.

and the impact of protein motions on catalysis [20]. To 
obtain more details about the interactions between 
α-ketobutyric acid and the amino acid residues in the 
active site of the L57C/M419I variant, we performed a 
molecular dynamic simulation using YASARA. Before 
the molecular dynamic simulation, the docking simu -
lation of α-ketobutyric acid in the active site of OATA 
L57C/M419I was accomplished using YASARA. The con -
formation of the substrate with the lowest energy was 
chosen for molecular dynamic simulations (Fig.  3B). 
The result of molecular dynamic simulation indicated 
C57 stabilized α-ketobutyric acid in the active site and 
shortened the distance between the carbonyl oxygen of 
α-ketobutyric acid and the amino group of PMP . Dur -
ing the approaching of the substrate to the active site, the 
hydrophobic interaction between I419 and the substrate 
was broken, and a hydrogen bond formed between C57 
and α-ketobutyric acid, resulting in the translocation of 
carbonyl carbon of the substrate toward PMP (Fig.  3C). 
The increased accessibility and stability between the sub -
strate and the active site of the variant might lead to an 
improved kcat.
The stability of the mutants
The enzyme variants need to retain the intrinsic stabil -
ity of the wild-type enzyme or gain enhanced stability for 
their practical applications. Therefore, time-course moni-
toring of the enzyme activities was performed at 37 °C for 
96  h in 50  mM phosphate buffer (pH7.5). M419I single 
mutation improved the stability of OATA (Fig.  4). This 
variant retained almost all activity after 24-h incubation 
at 37 °C and approximately 80% of its activity after 96-h 
treatment. On the other hand, L57C and L57C/M419I 
variants displayed similar thermostability as wild-type 
OATA in the first 48 h and became less stable than wild-
type with longer treatment (Fig. 4).
Application of OATA L57C/M419I to the TD/OATA coupled 
reaction to generate L-ABA
OATA L57C/M419I was utilized for small-scale TD/OATA 
coupled reaction using L-threonine as the precursor 
(Fig.  5, Additionl file 2: Table  S3). In comparison with 
wild-type, the conversion efficiency of the double mutant 
was significantly elevated. The conversion efficiency of 
L-threonine into L-ABA was 94% in 12 h. The purity of

L-ABA was 75%, > 99% ee. The yield of L-ABA was 1.15 g. 
However, using wild-type OATA shown in our work only 
obtained ~ 74% completion, while the previous report 
reached 99% conversion efficiency [12]. We speculate the 
acetone or ammonia by product without volatilization 
could inhibit the activity of OATA.
Discussion
With the increasing demand for chiral amines, ω- 
Transaminase has a broader application prospect. How -
ever, the natural ω-transaminase still displays drawbacks 
at stability, and catalytic efficiency. To meet the needs 
of industrial applications, ω-transaminase and variants 
with high catalytic activity were obtained through gene 
mining and protein engineering. The present study is 
aimed to elevate the catalytic activity of OATA towards 
α-ketobutyric acid through rational design and satura -
tion mutagenesis. ω-transaminase carries two binding 
pockets, i.e. large and small pockets. The small pocket is 
found to display a steric constraint prohibiting entry of a 
substituent larger than an ethyl group, whereas the large 
pocket can accept a bulk substituent, such as a phenyl 
group through a hydrophobic interaction [21]. Previous 
reports indicated L57 is located in the large pocket and 
exhibits steric interference with the substrate substitu -
ent bound in the small pocket [22, 23]. L57A substitu -
tion removed this hindrance and resulted in a mutant 
with improved specificity towards a large number of 
bulky substrates [24–26]. In the present study, we found 
L57C substitution, which has never been reported pre -
viously, improved the conversion efficiency of OATA 
to α-ketobutyric acid. Considering L57 is located at the 
interface the OATA dimer, we proposed that an extra 
disulfide bond was formed between two monomers 
due to L57C mutation and increased the stability of the 
enzyme. The protein bearing L57C substitution was 
purified as described in the methods section but with -
out the presence of β-mercaptoethanol. However, MS 
(mass spectrum) result indicated no novel disulfide bond 
was formed (data not shown). The result of molecular 
dynamic simulation indicated C57 formed a novel hydro-
gen bond with α-ketobutyric acid in the active site and 
shortened the distance between the carbonyl oxygen 
of α-ketobutyric acid and the amino group of PMP , in 
turn, promoted the transamination. Meanwhile, M419, 
a residue away from the active site, is also proved to be 
important to the enzymatic activity of OATA. the struc -
ture of OATA (5GHF) indicated M419 is located at the 
entrance of the active site (Fig. 1). Therefore, M419 inter-
acts with α-ketobutyric acid before it enters the active 
site. This theory may explain why the substitutions of 
M419 to nonpolar amino acids, such as Ala, Val, and 
Ile are all able to improve the activity of OATA while all 
substitution of charged amino acid residues decreases its 
activity. Among them, M419I showed the most obvious 
effect. The molecular dynamic simulation demonstrated 
hydrophobic interaction was formed between Ile and 
α-ketobutyric acid, which facilitated the entrance of the 
substrate to the active site. Since I419 and C57 interact 
with α-ketobutyric acid individually during the approach 
of the substrate to PMP , these two substitutions have syn-
ergistic effect in improving the activity of OATA.
Conclusion
In conclusion, the present study is another successful 
example for the engineering of ω-Transaminase and the 
result of the present study expands the pool of amino 
acid residues for future protein engineering of ω-TA. 
OATA L57C/M419I showed the most obvious improvement 
of catalytic efficiency in comparison with wild-type 
OATA. In the future, we will apply this mutant to other 
ketone acids and ketone substrates to broaden its indus -
trial application.

using the T5 exonuclease mediated cloning method [27]. 
The ORF encoding OATA (GenBank accession number: 
WP_011982390.1) was optimized based on the codon 
usage preference of E. coli without changing the amino 
acid sequence and synthesized by Sangon (China). The 
ORF was also cloned into the pET28a vector using the 
T5 exonuclease mediated cloning method. To facilitate 
the purification, the recombinant TD and OATA were 
expressed with a 6×His tag fused to their C-termini. 
The recombinant plasmids were identified with DNA 
sequencing and named pET28a-TD-His6 and pET28a-
OATA-His6, respectively.
Luria–Bertani (LB) medium for the cultivation of E. 
coli was prepared as described in the Manual of Molec -
ular Cloning [28]. L-threonine, α- ketobutyric acid, and 
isopropylamine were purchased from Aladdin (China). 
All other chemicals were analytical reagents.
Expression and purification of recombinant TD and OATA 
To induce the expression of the target gene, the transfor -
mants were incubated at 37  °C to  OD600 of 0.6–0.8 and 
then induced with 1 mM of IPTG at 18 °C for 24 h. Cells 
were collected and resuspended in lysis buffer (50  mM 
Tris–HCl; 50  mM NaCl; 1  mM β-mercaptoethanol; 
0.1  mM PMSF; 0.5  mM PLP; pH7.0). The samples were 
ultrasonicated to break the cells. The crude cell lysate was 
collected after centrifugation at 12,000×g for 30 min. The 
supernatant was applied to Ni–NTA beads for affinity 
purification. The column was washed twice with 10 col -
umn volume of wash buffer (50  mM Tris–HCl; 50  mM 
NaCl; 0.5 mM PLP; 20 mM Imidazole, pH7.0). Ten column 
volume of elution buffer (20  mM  Na3PO4, 0.5  M NaCl; 
0.5  mM PLP; 200  mM Imidazole, pH7.0) was used to 
recover the target protein. The sample was then collected 
and dialyzed with a Millipore 30-kDa cut-off membrane at 
4 °C to remove imidazole and salts, followed by resuspend-
ing with storage buffer (50  mM  Na3PO4, 0.15  M NaCl; 
0.5 mM PLP; pH7.0). The protein concentration was deter-
mined by Bradford Protein Assay Kit (Beyotime).
The determination of protein concentration by Bradford 
Assay kit
Dilute BSA gradient with storage buffer of OATA to make 
the final concentration of BSA 0.125, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1 mg/
mL and 1.5  mg/mL, respectively. Take diluted samples 
(5 μL) to 96 well plates, followed by adding 250 μL G250 
staining solution in triplicates for each sample, and then 
determine the absorbance at  OD595 with a microplate 
reader. Take the absorbance value as the vertical axis and 
the BSA standard protein concentration as the horizontal 
axis, fit the BSA linear standard curve, calculate the linear 
regression equation, and then calculate the protein con -
centration of OATA according to the standard equation.
Molecular modeling and selecting of mutation sites
The crystal structure of OATA (PDB ID: 5GHF) was used 
for the molecular simulation. The 1–31 amino acids of 
chain A in OATA was constructed using the Modeler 
module (version 9.8) with chain B as the template. Dock -
ing simulation was performed with the Discovery Studio 
(version 20.1.0). Docking simulation with α-ketobutyric 
acid as the ligand was accomplished using the Flexible 
Docking (the active site defined by the Binding-Site mod-
ule, under a default setting of 2000 steps at 700  K for a 
heating step; 5000 steps at 300 K for a cooling step; 8 Å 
grid extension). The docking locates most similar to the 
previous report using pyruvic acid [29] as a ligand was 
chosen as the docking model.
The active-site models of the L57C/M419I variants were 
built by amino acid substitution and energy minimization 
(2000 steps; dielectric constant 4) of the mutation sites.
Site-directed mutagenesis
To generate each OATA variant, a pair of oligonu -
cleotides including the substitutions (Additional file  1: 
Table  S1) were synthesized and used for reverse PCR 
with pET28a-OATA as a template (Additional file  2: Fig-
ure S1). The PCR product was digested with DpnI, fol -
lowed by transformation of E. coli DH5α. The mutations 
were identified with DNA sequencing (Sangon, China).
Analysis of the enzymatic activity of OATA 
The enzyme activity was measured with α-ketobutyric acid 
and isopropylamine as substrates. Briefly, 10 µL of enzyme 
sample (2.5 mg/mL) was added to 90 µL of reaction mixture 
containing 300 mM α-ketobutyric acid and 450 mM isopro-
pylamine in 50 mM phosphate buffer (pH7.5), followed by 
incubating at 37 °C for 30 min. The reaction was terminated 
with 100 µL of acetonitrile and the sample was centrifuged 
at 14,000×g for 10 min. The supernatant was diluted 5 times 
with 400  µL of deionized  H2O, followed by analysis with 
HPLC. All experiments were done in triplicate.
Molecular dynamics simulations of OATAL57C/M419I
The model structure of OATAL57C/M419I was used for 
molecular dynamics simulations. Molecular dynamics 
simulations were performed with the YASARA(v18.4.24). 
Introducing α-ketobutyric acid as a ligand into the recep-
tor was similar to the docking simulation (the active site 
defined by the Binding-Site module, under a default set -
ting of pH7.5 for the environmental pH.; 8 Å grid exten -
sion; energy minimization with the protein).
Kinetic analysis
To obtain kinetic parameters for α-ketobutyric acid, a 
pseudo-one-substrate kinetic model was used as described 
previously [25]. The kinetic parameters were determined

Zhang et al. BMC Biotechnol           (2021) 21:55 
 
from three independent initial rate measurements per -
formed with the same batch of purified enzymes. The con-
centration of α-ketobutyric acid was 50 to 650 mM while 
the concentration of isopropylamine was fixed to 1 M. The 
initial rate was measured by HPLC analysis of produced 
L-ABA. Initial rate data were fitted to a Michaelis–Menten 
equation, and the  Km and kcat values were calculated from 
the slope and y-intercept of the double-reciprocal plot.
Screening of OATA mutants with high activity
To prepare the α-ketobutyric acid substrate for the enzyme 
assay of OATA variants, E. coli BL21 (DE3) strain bearing 
pET28a-TD-His6 was incubated in 200  mL of LB media 
at 37  °C until  OD600 reached 0.6–0.8, followed by inducing 
with 1 mM of IPTG at 18 °C for 12–16 h. The cells were col-
lected and added to 200 mL of reaction mixture containing 
300 mM L-threonine and 450 mM isopropylamine in 50 mM 
of phosphate buffer (pH7.5). The reaction was carried out at 
37 °C for 2 h. Thin-layer chromatography (TLC) with Silica 
TLC gel  60F10-20 cm from Haiyang Chemical Co., Ltd. (Qing-
dao, China) was performed to monitor the progress of the 
reaction. After L-threonine was conversed to α-ketobutyric 
acid, the supernatant was collected by centrifugation at 
10,000×g for 10 min. E. coli BL21 (DE3) strains bearing vari-
ous pET28a-OATA-His6 variants were incubated in 8  mL 
of LB media at 37 °C until  OD600 reached 0.6–0.8, followed 
by inducing with 1 mM of IPTG at 18 °C for 14 h. The cells 
were collected and added to 1 mL of α-ketobutyric acid pre-
pared as above mentioned. The reaction was carried out at 
37 °C for 1 h, followed by detection with thin-layer chroma-
tography using Silica TLC gel  60F10-20 cm. The solvent system 
contained A solution and B solution in a ratio of 4:3 (v/v). A 
solution was 1% (w/v) ninhydrin in N-butanol and B solution 
was acetic acid in deionized  H2O (1:2, v/v). After the chro-
matography, the sildes were dry with a hair drier and the 
dotes of L-ABA show red color.
HPLC analysis and chiral analysis of L-ABA
HPLC analysis were performed on a Shimadzu HPLC 
system (Japan). Analysis of L-ABA and α-ketobutyric 
acid were performed using YMC-Pack Diol-120-NP col -
umn with isocratic elution with 80% Acetonitrile-20% 
 NH4H2PO4 (10  mM, pH 2.0) at 1  mL/min. The column 
oven temperature was set to 40  °C, UV detection was 
done at 200 nm (Additional file  1: Figure S3). To analyze 
the chirality of L-ABA, L-ABA was derivatized using 
D-glucopyranosyl isothiocyanate (GITC) [30, 31] and 
detected using a C18 symmetry column (Waters, USA) 
with 50% methanol and 50% water (containing 0.1%TFA) 
at a speed of 1  mL/min. The column oven temperature 
was set to 40  °C. UV detection was done at 254  nm 
(Additional file 1: Figure S4).
TD/ω-TA coupled reactions
The coupled reaction for the synthesis of L-ABA was per-
formed at 37 °C with 300 mM L-threonine, 450 mM isopro-
pylamine, 0.5 mM PLP in 50 mM phosphate buffer (pH7.5). 
The concentrations of TD and OATA were 0.2 mg/mL and 
1 mg/mL, respectively. L-ABA was analyzed for measure-
ments of conversion yield and enantiomeric excess.
Purification of L-2-aminobutyric acid
At the end of the reaction, the reaction solution was heated 
at 60 °C for 30 min (denature and precipitate the enzymes), 
followed by centrifuging at 12,000  rpm for 30  min. The 
supernatant was collected and filtrated by a 0.45-μm fil -
ter membrane. The filtrate solution was subjected to cat -
ion-exchange by Dowex 50WX8 cation-exchange resin 
(50 g) in a 50-mL column with rotation for 2 h, followed 
by washing with 0.1 N HCl (120 mL) and water (120 mL) 
sequentially. The product was eluted with 145 mL of 10% 
ammonia solution [12]. The elution was transferred to the 
rotary evaporator for rotary evaporation at 60–70 °C. After 
the water was evaporated, the precipitated crystals are 
washed for three times with ethanol. After each cleaning, 
L-ABA is obtained by suction filtration.
Statistical analysis
Experiments were performed in triplicates. The statisti -
cal analyses were processed in originlab 2019b, and the 
structural analysis of OATA was carried out by Discovery 
Studio 2016 and YASARA (v18.4.24).
