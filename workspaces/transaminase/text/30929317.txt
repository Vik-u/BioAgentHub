Abstract
Background: Cardiac involvement in Danon disease typically manifests as left ven-
tricular hypertrophy (LVH) and ventricular preexcitation. This study aimed to iden-
tify patients with Danon disease among patients with LVH and concurrent 
electrocardiographic preexcitation.
Methods: Electrocardiographic preexcitation was identified in 10 of 197 patients 
with unexplained LVH in whom genetic testing was performed using next‐genera-
tion sequencing.
Results: Three (3/10, 30%) patients with Danon disease were found in association 
with different mutations in the gene of lysosome‐associated membrane protein 2 
(LAMP2). Compared to seven patients without Danon disease, these three patients 
presented with distinctive clinical phenotypes, including onset at an earlier age 
(20 ± 2 years vs. 53 ± 9 years, p < 0.001), more neurological involvements (100% 
vs. 0, p = 0.008), higher electrocardiographic voltages (10 ± 1 mV vs. 5 ± 1 mV, 
p < 0.001), wider QRS complexes (163 ± 5 ms vs. 115 ± 20 ms, p = 0.006), less 
common asymmetric hypertrophy (0% vs. 86%, p = 0.033), and more frequent eleva-
tion of three serum enzymes (creatine kinase, aspartate aminotransferase, and lactate 
dehydrogenase). Intracellular vacuoles accumulation with deficiencies of LAMP2 
protein was found in both cardiac and skeletal myocytes of patients with Danon 
disease.
Conclusion: In patients with coexistent LVH and ventricular preexcitation, Danon 
disease is common with distinctive clinical presentations. Comprehensive assess-
ment of these resemble patients can provide valuable findings for early identification 
and clinical decision making of patients with Danon disease.

1 | INTRODUCTION
Danon disease, caused by the mutations in the gene of lysosome‐
associated membrane protein 2 (LAMP2,OMIM*309060), is 
an X‐linked dominant disorder classically characterized by 
the triad of cardiomyopathy, skeletal myopathy, and intel-
lectual disability (Danon et al., 1981; Nishino et al., 2000; 
Tanaka et al., 2000). Cardiomyopathy typically manifests a 
hypertrophic phenotype; ventricular preexcitation is the most 
frequently encountered ECG abnormality in such patients 
(D'souza et al., 2014). The pathological hallmark of Danon 
disease is intracytoplasmic vacuole accumulation containing 
glycogen granules and autophagic materials which lead to 
cardiac hypertrophy (Arad et al., 2005; Cheng et al., 2012; 
Nishino et al., 2000). Because of similar echocardiographic 
features, Danon disease could be misdiagnosed as hypertro-
phic cardiomyopathy (HCM) caused by genetic defects in 
cardiac structural proteins. Unlike HCM, however, individ-
uals with Danon disease frequently experience rapid clinical 
deterioration from no or little symptoms and preserved sys-
tolic function to end‐stage heart failure (Maron et al., 2009). 
It is therefore important to distinguish myocardial hypertro-
phy associated with LAMP2 mutations from that due to other 
disease‐causing genetic defects. The objective of this study 
was to identify patients with Danon disease among patients 
with coexistent unexplained left ventricular hypertrophy 
(LVH) and electrocardiographic preexcitation, and compare 
the clinical, electrocardiographic, and echocardiographic fea-
tures of patients with or without Danon disease.
2 | METHODS
2.1 | Ethical compliance
The investigation was approved by the ethics committees of 
Guangdong General Hospital and performed in accordance 
with the declaration of Helsinki. An informed and written 
consent was obtained from all study subjects.
2.2 | Study subjects
A total of 197 patients with unexplained LVH were enrolled 
between October 2015 and January 2018 at Guangdong 
General Hospital, Guangzhou, China (Table S1). All patients 
were evaluated on the basis of medical history, physical ex-
amination, 12‐lead ECG, and transthoracic echocardiogra-
phy. LVH was defined by a wall thickness of at least 15 mm 
in one or more left ventricular myocardial segments on 
echocardiography (Elliott et al., 2014). Asymmetric hyper-
trophy indicated LVH with ratio between maximal thickness 
of interventricular septum (IVS) and left ventricular posterior 
wall (LVPW) more than 1.3. Ventricular preexcitation was 
typically characterized by short PR intervals (PR < 120 ms), 
initial QRS slurring (delta wave), or both during sinus 
rhythm. In standard 12‐lead ECG, left ventricular voltage 
was reported as the maximal S wave in V1 or V2 plus maxi-
mal R wave in V5 or V6 (S
V1 or S V2 + RV5 or R V6). When 
available, pathological specimens were examined.
3 | MOLECULAR GENETIC 
ANALYSIS
Ten patients with coexistent LVH and ventricular preexci-
tation underwent genetic testing to identify Danon disease. 
Genomic DNA was extracted from peripheral blood lympho-
cytes using a commercial kit (QIAGEN Co., Ltd, CA) for ge-
netic screenings with next‐generation sequencing (KingMed 
Diagnostics, Guangzhou, China). The MiSeq Reagent Kit v3 
(Illumina, San Diego, CA) was used to prepare DNA librar-
ies. Targeted enrichment was performed using the TruSight 
One Sequencing Panel on the MiSeq platform (Illumina, San 
Diego, CA) which was designed to cover 12 Mb of genomic 
content with up to 62,000 exons in 4,813 clinical disease‐
associated genes. In addition to comprehensive coverage 
of the major exon regions, the panel provided coverage of 
exon‐flanking regions as well. Genomic targets were deter-
mined based on information in the Human Gene Mutation 
Database (HGMD), the Online Mendelian Inheritance in 
Man (OMIM), the GeneTests, Illumina TruSight sequencing 
panels, and other available sequencing panels. The full list of 
these genes is available online (www.illumina.com/content/
dam/illumina-marketing/documents/products/gene_lists/
gene_list_trusight_one.zip).
All sequencing data was processed with Burrows–
Wheeler Aligner for alignment with a reference sequence of 
hg19 and Genome Analysis Toolkit for variant calling. The 
ANNOVAR tool was used to analyze Variant Call format 
files and annotate potential variants. ANNOVAR utilized 
annotation databases including the 1,000 Genomes Project, 
dbSNP, ClinVar database, Polyphen‐2, and SIFT.
Candidate variants identified by the next‐generation se-
quencing were further validated by direct Sanger sequenc-
ing using an ABI 3500 Dx Genetic Analyzer (Applied 
Biosystems, Foster City, CA). The sequences of the wild‐
type LAMP2 gene were obtained from the National Center

3.1 | Histological and 
immunofluorescent analysis
Specimens of muscle were biopsied from the right IVS via 
the right internal jugular vein, the quadriceps femoris muscle, 
or both. Specimens were fixed either in formalin for stain-
ing with hematoxylin and eosin and Masson's trichrome, and 
LAMP2 immunofluorescent analysis or in glutaraldehyde 
for transmission electron microscopy (JEM1400‐Plus, JEOL 
Ltd., Tokyo, Japan). Immunofluorescent staining of LAMP2 
was performed with a mouse monoclonal antibody (H4B4, 
ab25631, abcam, Cambridge, UK).
3.2 | Statistical analysis
Continuous variables were reported as mean ± standard 
deviation or median and minimum and maximum val-
ues, and comparisons between groups were based on an 
unpaired Student's t  test (parametric) or Mann–Whitney 
U test (non‐parametric), as appropriate. A Shapiro–Wilk 
test was carried out to determine normality of data distri-
bution and variance homogeneity. Categorical variables 
were summarized as counts and percentages and compared

4 | RESULTS
4.1 | Clinical findings
Ventricular preexcitation was present in 10 (10/197, 5%) un-
related patients with unexplained LVH in whom genetic test-
ing identified three (3/10, 30%) Danon disease patients with 
different LAMP2 mutations. In the remaining seven patients, 
one mutation in the gene encoding α‐galactosidase A (Fabry's 
disease), two in beta‐myosin heavy chain (MYH7), one in 
alpha‐tropomyosin (TPM1), and 1variant with unknown 
clinical significance in the gene encoding titin were, respec-
tively, found in five patients, and the test result was negative 
in two patients. In this group, nobody had double or more 
genetic abnormalities. Of the seven patients without Danon 
disease, delta wave was positive in leads I and aVF and nega-
tive in lead V1 in three patients indicating a probable right 
anterosepal location of accessory pathways, and initial R 
wave in lead V1 was present in the remaining four patients 
indicating left‐side location (Figure S1).
Of the three patients with Danon disease, all were male 
aged 17–23 years at diagnosis. The initial presentations 
at admission were variable, including exertional dyspnea, 
syncope, chest pain on exertion, and aborted cardiac arrest. 
They all had mild intellectual disability, mainly causing

learning disorders, but only one patient had complaints of 
muscle weakness. Surface 12‐lead ECGs were strikingly 
abnormal, with short PR intervals, delta waves, or both 
and high voltage consistent with ventricular preexcitation; 
transthoracic echocardiography showed concentric LVH 
(Figure 1). Additionally, patient 1 experienced episodes of 
AV block with the longest R–R interval of 3.26 s; patient 3 
presented with spontaneous ventricular fibrillation on am-
bulatory ECG monitoring during an aborted cardiac arrest. 
Laboratory abnormalities were present in all three patients 
and included significant elevation of N‐terminal pro‐brain 
natriuretic peptide (14‐ to 89‐fold over upper limit of nor -
mal range), creatine kinase (6‐ to 8‐fold), aspartate ami-
notransferase (9‐ to 14‐fold), lactate dehydrogenase (5‐ to 
6‐fold), and cardiac troponin T (14‐ to 377‐fold). Individual 
clinical details of the three patients with Danon disease are 
summarized in Table 1.
Compared to the remaining seven patients without Danon 
disease, the patients with Danon disease were younger (20 ± 2 
years vs. 53 ± 9 years, p  < 0.001) and more likely to have 
symptoms of intellectual disability (100% vs. 0, p  = 0.008), 
and presented with higher left ventricular voltage (10 ± 1 mV 
vs. 5 ± 1 mV, p < 0.001), wider QRS complexes (163 ± 5 ms 
vs. 115 ± 20 ms, p = 0.006), and more prominent increase 
in LVPW thickness (26 ± 4 mm vs. 11 ± 2 mm, p < 0.001). 
Asymmetric hypertrophy was less common in patients with 
Danon disease than non‐Danon disease patients (0% vs. 86%, 
p = 0.033). Additionally, the occurrence of creatine kinase, 
aspartate aminotransferase, and lactate dehydrogenase more 
than threefold the upper limit of normal range was more com-
mon in patients with Danon disease than non‐Danon disease 
patients. The baseline characteristics of patients with and with-
out Danon disease are summarized and compared in Table 2.
4.2 | Molecular genetic analysis
Two frameshift mutations and one splicing mutation of 
LAMP2 gene were identified in three patients (Figure 2). 
In patient 1, a 1‐bp duplication in exon 8 (c. 973dupC) was 
found, leading to a frameshift mutation and a putatively 
truncated protein (p. L325PfsX24). In patient 2, there was 
an A‐to‐G substitution in the splice‐acceptor site of intron 1 
(IVS 1‐2A > G), being predicted to delete exon 2 residues 
and cause a frameshift (Arad et al., 2005; Cetin et al., 2016). 
In patient 3, a 7‐bp duplication (c. 29‐35dupCGGGCTC) in 
exon 1, which resulted in a novel frameshift mutation and a 
putatively truncated protein (p. V15RfsX19).
4.3 | Histological and 
immunofluorescent analysis
Skeletal muscle biopsy and endomyocardial biopsy were both 
available in patient 1 and patient 3, while only endomyocardial 
biopsy was performed in patient 2. Light microscopy evalu-
ation of the three patients’ cardiac tissue revealed signifi-
cant enlargement of myocytes with profound intracellular 
vacuolation, absence of myofiber disarray, and mild or no

croscopy showed myofibrillar disruption and intracytoplas-
mic vacuoles containing autophagic material and glycogen 
in both skeletal muscle and endomyocardial tissue (middle 
and lower panels in Figure 3). Immunofluorescent staining 
of skeletal muscle sections revealed no detectable LAMP2 
protein in the sample from patient 1 (Figure 4). Compared 
to control sections from the heart of an age‐matched auto 
accident victim, staining with the antibody against LAMP2 
protein showed a severe decrease in expression of this pro-
tein in both skeletal and cardiac muscle samples of patient 3 
(Figure 4).
5 | DISCUSSION
In this study, genetic testing of 10 patients with unex-
plained LVH and preexcited ECG patterns led to the iden-
tification of three (30%) individuals with Danon disease 
caused by different LAMP2 mutations, including a previ-
ously unreported mutation (p. V15RfsX19). Deficiencies 
of LAMP2 protein with resultant intracellular vacuoles 
accumulation in both cardiac and skeletal myocytes were 
found to account for the development of the disease in our 
patients. Although Danon disease is considered as a rare 
entity with unknown prevalence in general population, but 
cases have been frequently reported in 4% to 33% of se-
lected populations (Arad et al., 2005; Charron et al., 2004; 
Cheng et al., 2012; Fanin et al., 2006; Fu et al., 2016), in 
accordance with the finding of our study, suggestive of 
Danon disease's frequency closely related to the associated 
clinical phenotypes. To the best of our knowledge, this is 
the first study reporting the prevalence of Danon disease 
in patients with coexistent LVH and electrocardiographic 
preexcitation.
Ventricular preexcitation is a common clinical finding, 
the majority of which arises from failure of the annulus fi-
brosus to fully insulate the atrial and ventricular chambers 
due to the presence of accessory pathways, and also termed 
Wolff–Parkinson–White (WPW) syndrome if associated 
with paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia (Page et al., 
2016). It is usually sporadic and of unknown etiology in most

cases. In the past two decades, however, a preponderance of 
evidence suggests a large genetic contribution to this condi-
tion when observed in the setting of cardiomyopathy, includ-
ing mutations in the gene of LAMP2 (Liu, Xue, Wu, & Hu, 
2016). The reported incidence of electrocardiographic preex-
citation of patients with Danon disease is 68.2% and 26.7% in 
men and women, respectively (Boucek, Jirikowic, & Taylor, 
2011). The underlying mechanism responsible for ventricular 
preexcitation in Danon disease is still confounded by con-
tradictory clinical interpretations. Some studies reported that 
these individuals had WPW syndrome with catheter ablation 
required (Bottillo et al., 2016; Boucek et al., 2011; Cheng et 
al., 2012; Csányi et al., 2016; Samad et al., 2017), but neither 
electrophysiological details of these pathways nor surface 
ECGs after ablation were available; others believed that the 
ECG pattern demonstrating shortened PR interval with QRS 
slurring was associated with enhanced atrioventricular nodal 
conduction or “pseudo preexcitation” instead of ventricular 
preexcitation caused by accessory atrioventricular pathways 
(Konrad et al., 2017; Lines et al., 2014). However, our recent 
study proved that ventricular preexcitation in Danon disease 
was because of the presence of fasciculoventricular pathways 
characterized by bidirectional conduction and take‐off from 
the proximal His bundle, rather than the WPW syndrome 
and enhanced atrioventricular nodal conduction (Liu et al., 
2018). Genetic defects in cardiac structural proteins, despite 
accounting for up to 60% of adolescents and adults with un-
explained LVH (Elliott et al., 2014), have not been identi-
fied as causative for ventricular preexcitation. In the present 
study, concurrent ventricular preexcitation in patients with 
MYH7, titin, or TPM1variants, therefore, is more likely to be 
uncommon comorbidity rather than an inherited disorder.
Male predominance typically characterizes Danon dis-
ease because of haploinsuffciency of the X‐linked LAMP2 
gene, while affected female patients generally have less se-
vere cardiomyopathy and later onset of symptoms (Boucek 
et al., 2011). Early identification of Danon disease in male 
is extremely important for patient care because rapid clin-
ical deterioration leading to cardiac death occurs in young 
men before 25 years of age if no timely cardiac transplan-
tation considered (Maron et al., 2009). A previous study by 
Arad et al. suggested that Danon disease is distinguishable 
from cardiomyopathy due to PRKAG2 or sarcomere‐protein 
defects by male sex, early onset of symptoms, massive con-
centric LVH, asymptomatic elevations of serum‐chemistry 
values, and electrocardiographic abnormalities, particularly 
ventricular preexcitation (Arad et al., 2005). In a study of 
36 patients with concentric LVH, Cheng et al. reported that 
Danon disease should be suspected especially when electro-
cardiographic preexcitation and/or elevated serum biomark -
ers is present (Cheng et al., 2012). Our data demonstrated that 
onset at an early age, neurological involvements, prominent 
electrocardiographic voltages with broad QRS complexes, 
marked concentric LVH, and abnormal elevation of serum 
enzyme levels including creatine kinase, aspartate amino-
transferase, and lactate dehydrogenase provided important 
clues to further distinguish LVH and concurrent ventricu-
lar preexcitation associated with LAMP2 mutations from 
that due to defects of other disease‐causing genes in male. 
The peculiar ECG profile (wider QRS complex) observed

in our patients with Danon disease can be explained by the 
fact that severe myocardial hypertrophy, especially signifi-
cant increase in LVPW thickness, necessitates taking longer 
for ventricular depolarization, while significant elevation of 
serum enzyme levels could be contributable to the nature of 
multisystem involvements of Danon disease.
On the basis of these findings, we would like to stress 
that the association of LVH with ventricular preexcitation, 
especially in the male teenager with prominent electrocardio-
graphic voltages, wide QRS complexes, concentric LVH, and 
extracardiac involvements, should highly raise suspicion of 
Danon disease.
5.1 | Limitations
Systematic evaluation was not performed in family members 
of Danon disease patients. However, increasing the number 
of affected subjects in a family does not necessarily represent 
an efficient strategy because of the low penetrance of ven-
tricular preexcitation in female patients.
6 | CONCLUSIONS
In patients with coexistent LVH and ventricular preexcita-
tion, Danon disease is common and easily distinguished by 
distinct clinical presentations. Comprehensive assessment 
of these resemble patients can provide valuable findings for 
early identification and clinical decision making of patients 
with Danon disease.
