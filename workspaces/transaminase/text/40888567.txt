ABSTRACT: Selective catalysis is a key objective in organic synthesis, and reactions with
differing kinetic and thermodynamic products present the opportunity for divergent reaction
outcomes with a single catalyst. We report a biocatalytic method in which a single
transaminase can form either cis or trans cyclohexylamines in high diastereoselectivity. With
the model substrate 4-methylcyclohexanone, E. coli cells expressing WT-Vf-ATA form either
diastereomer of the amine product in >10:1 dr and >70% conversion, depending on reaction
conditions, stereodivergence that also extends to a range of substrates. In the case of α(2)-
substituted ketones, a concurrent dynamic kinetic resolution enables conversion of racemic
ketones into cis or trans amines that are enantiomerically and diastereomerically enriched.
Supplementation (or not) of the PLP cofactor in the reaction was found to be key in directing
the stereochemical outcome and informed the development of a modified preparation of cells
expressing the transaminases that included a metabolic precursor to the PLP cofactor,
resulting in cells with more holo ATA catalyst and higher catalytic activity. This research
demonstrates a rare, but operationally simple, example of highly stereodivergent reactions effected by a single catalyst and sheds new
light on the PLP cofactor as a handle to optimize biocatalysis by transaminases.
1. INTRODUCTION
Selective catalysis is a key tool for efficiency in organic
chemistry and is underpinned by both kinetic and thermody-
namic effects. Transition state barriers determine which of
multiple products form the fastest, whereas the relative
energies of the products determine which is thermodynami-
cally favored. Differentiated kinetic and thermodynamic
control becomes particularly interesting when one product is
kinetically favored, while a different product is thermodynami-
cally favored (Figure 1A). This scenario potentially allows a
single catalyst to produce either of two products depending on
the reaction conditions. Although an omnipresent concept in
organic chemistry, it is an outcome that, in practice, is rarely
achieved in full.
1−4
The Diels−Alder

and aldol

reactions
are among examples where reaction conditions such as shorter
reaction times and lower reaction temperatures may lead to a
kinetic isomer, while higher temperatures, longer reaction
times, and/or higher catalyst loading may afford thermody-
namic isomers. In select cases, this has been achieved (Figure
1B). Despite its theoretical simplicity, the need for catalysts
that both facilitate the reaction reversibly and have kinetic
preference for a nonthermodynamic product are among the
challenges to designing selective reactions according to these
principles.
Enzymes are known to catalyze a range of reactions in both
directions, suggesting their potential for the aforementioned
divergent reaction paradigm. Transaminases (ATAs) in
particular are a class of enzymes with significant synthetic
value, owing to their potential to form stereodefined amines,
which are useful building blocks for pharmaceuticals.
11−15
While transaminases are most often applied in enantiomer-
selective reactions, forming products with equal energy, they
have also been studied in diastereomer-selective reactions,
which result in products of differing energy and therefore
potential for kinetic and thermodynamic products. For
example, transaminases have been applied in the synthesis of
stereodefined, 4-substituted cyclohexylamines from cyclo-
hexanones. Cyclohexylamines form the core of biologically
active compounds and known pharmaceuticals, including
Ambroxol,
16
Neltenexine,
17
and Cariprazine.

The trans-
amine products of such reactions should be thermodynamically
favored, owing to the diequatorial placement of both
substituents in the chair conformation. Previous research,
outlined next, also suggests that the cis product, at least for
some substrates, may be kinetically favored.
For example, Tessaro et al. showed that various ATAs,
including Vibrio fluvialis (V
f
-ATA), catalyze substrate-con-

be resolved kinetically by immobilized ATAs in flow reactors,
yielding nearly diastereopure trans amines for four substrates.
20
Through this work, the authors observed that, in addition to
the reconsumption of the cis amine to ketone, there was some
degree of dynamic isomerization, with the mole fraction of the
trans product increasing by up to 20% during the reaction,
depending on the substrate. This work suggests that when a
mixture of amines is generated by a prior reaction, a
transaminase can both selectively convert the cis amine to
the ketone (kinetic resolution) and then may also convert
some of that ketone into the thermodynamically favored trans
amine product.
Together, these findings, conducted prior to and con-
currently with our studies described here, suggest the potential
to implement a single catalyst in the one-pot conversion of a
cyclohexanone into either its cis (kinetic) or trans (thermody-
namic) amine product. To achieve such a reaction paradigm,
pseudo-irreversible reaction conditions (such as using an
excess amine donor) could lead to the kinetically favored cis
product. On the other hand, reversible reaction conditions
(maintained, for example, by using a smaller excess of amine
donor) might initially give rise to the cis product but eventually
reach equilibrium, in which the trans product predominates.
Here, we report the one-pot, one-catalyst, diastereodivergent
conversion of ketones into pseudo-asymmetrical cis or trans
amines catalyzed by whole cells expressing the transaminase
fromVibrio fluvialis (V
f
-ATA).
21−27
Our findings show that
manipulation of the concentrations of the alanine amine donor,
and more unexpectedly, the PLP cofactor, enables reversal of
the selectivity of the reaction of 4-methylcyclohexanone from
95% conversion and >95% cis product to 70% conversion and
>90% trans product (Figure 1C). This phenomenon readily
extends to a range of 4-substituted cyclohexanones with both
small and large substituents, furnishing cis and trans
diastereomers with high selectivity for both isomers. Several
enantioenriched, 3-substituted cyclohexanones were also found
to react in the same reaction paradigm, leading to cis or trans
isomers of the products depending on reaction conditions
(Figure 1D). Moreover, in the case of 2-substituted cyclo-
hexanones, we found that racemic substrates can be submitted
to the reaction, and enantioenriched samples of either cis or
trans cyclohexyl-1(S)-amine products can be formed (Figure
1D). In a secondary finding, supplementing the cells expressing
transaminases with pyridoxine (PYP) was found to increase the
effectiveness of those cells in whole-cell catalysis, enabling
more rapid equilibration of sterically hindered substrates to
thermodynamic products.

Cyclohexylamines. To investigate the potential for trans-
aminases to catalyze diastereodivergent reactions, we started
with the model reaction of 4-methylcyclohexanone (1A),

Vibrio fluvialis (Vf) (Figure 2A). Beyond studies pertaining to
cyclohexanones and cyclohexylamines, V
f

21−26,28
is a
widely studied transaminase for which there is immense data
on its structure, reactivity, and mutability, which made it an
attractive choice as we initiated our studies. Typical conditions
for transaminase-catalyzed reactions of ketones include an
excess of alanine (or other amine donor) along with a catalytic
amount of exogenous PLP cofactor (Figure 2A). Under these
conditions, we found that the reaction of 4-methylcyclohex-
anone in the presence of BL21(DE3) E. coli cells expressing
wild-type V
f
-ATA afforded the amine products 1B and 1C in
>90% conversion and low diastereomer selectivity (∼2:1
trans:cis).
Considering these initial results, we hypothesized that using
a smaller excess of alanine might increase the reversibility of
the reaction toward the thermodynamic product. The expected
impact of the [PLP] was less clear. PLP functions as a catalytic
cofactor as well as a structural cofactor that binds at the
interface of the dimeric enzyme; higher [PLP] may increase
the concentration of holo (active) catalytic sites and/or
dimeric transaminase structures,
26,28−30
which could lead to
more effective equilibration to the thermodynamic product
through higher rates of reaction and/or longer catalyst lifetime.
Conversely, reducing, or even omitting, PLP might help trap
the reaction at the kinetic product. Thus, we evaluated the
outcome of a series of reactions using varied concentrations of
PLP and alanine over time to elucidate the effects of these two
variables.
The outcomes of experiments reflecting the two extremes of
these conditions (either 30 eq. alanine with no supplemental
PLP or 2.5 eq. alanine with 0.1 eq. PLP) are shown in Figure
2B. Initially, both conditions produced cis amine. However, the
reaction with high [alanine] and no exogenous PLP retained
the cis amine for 24 h, whereas the distribution of compounds
in the reaction with less alanine and supplemental PLP shifted
from ∼70% cis amine to ∼70% trans amine over 24 h. When
only the amount of either alanine or PLP was changed,
equilibration to the trans product was also observed in both
cases, but at a slower rate. These results suggested that
[alanine] and [PLP] are key factors in the dynamic reaction
and that their levels alone may be sufficient to direct a single
catalyst to form either the cis or trans product selectivity.
From these initial findings, we sought to optimize the
outcome of the reaction toward each diastereomer. Additional
studies on the reaction time, buffer, pH, and eq alanine
revealed that when using 30 eq. of alanine and a reaction buffer
of 100 mM NaPi, pH = 8.0, cis-1B formed in 95% conversion
and 30:1 dr (Figure 3). Moreover, these same reaction
conditions (now referred to as “kinetic” conditions) enabled
reactions of a series of ketones 1A-9A to proceed efficiently
with high conversion and with selectivity for the cis
diastereomer (Figure 3). While previous studies found
substrate-dependent selectivities (substrates with small R
groups leading to trans products and substrates with large R
groups leading to cis products),
19,20
the kinetic conditions
reported here enable ketones with substituents from Me to Ph
to all be converted to the cis product with high selectivity.
Reactions using 0.25−1.0 mmol ketone occurred similarly to
those on an analytical scale, and the products could be isolated
from the whole-cell reactions in 73−79% yield. Isolated yields
from 0.25 mmol scale reactions producing volatile amines, such
as 9B, were lower than those producing the same amines on a
1.0 mmol scale (79% versus 56%) due to modest product
losses while evaporating the solvent.
With effective conditions in hand to favor the kinetic
products, we turned to optimizing the reaction toward the
thermodynamic/trans isomers. Using the same buffer, but with
just 2.5 eq. of alanine and the inclusion of 0.1 eq. of PLP, 1A
reacted with 70% conversion and 11:1 dr favoring the trans 1C
product, a near-complete reversal of the selectivity from the
kinetic conditions (Figure 4A).
Despite the more modest excess of alanine, the conversion
remained reasonably high, which we hypothesized to be due to
the consumption of pyruvate by cellular metabolism, drawing
the reaction to the products side (Figure 2A). Under the same
reaction conditions, several other 4-substituted cyclohexanones
also reacted effectively, resulting in a high fraction of the trans
product. However, a few substrates, such as 4-CO
2
t
Bu (3),
4-
i
Pr (5), 4-Ph (8) reacted more slowly, resulting in lower
conversion and/or a lower diastereomer selectivity for the trans
product; ketone 3 was not observed to favor the trans product
under these reaction conditions.
2.2. The Key Role of PLP in Diastereodivergence.
Seeing the critical role of PLP in the reaction dynamics, and
given previous research suggesting the importance of the
interface-bound PLP to the structure, dimerization, and
stability of transaminases,
21,26,28−30
we considered that the
activity of the whole cells might be limited by the [PLP]
produced naturally by theE. coli cells during the overexpression
of the transaminase. If protein expression outpaces PLP
biosynthesis, production of apo or partially apo ATA
monomers or dimers that are unstable or insoluble may
reduce the yield of enzyme per cell, even if PLP is added
exogenously after the expression to backfill apo enzymes. To

increase the availability of cellular PLP during the expression of
the transaminase, we cultured the cells in the presence of 1.7
mM PYP, the hydroxyl metabolic precursor to PLP. When
using cells cultured with PYP in catalytic reactions of 1A, we
observed the reactions equilibrated more quickly to the
thermodynamic product (Figure 5). Furthermore, when the
reactions were conducted in vials with air-permeable
membrane closures, rather than airtight caps, the reactions
also equilibrated to the thermodynamic product more quickly,
further indicative of the importance of aerobic pyruvate
metabolism in reaction dynamics.
Seeing these results, we used PYP-supplemented cells in
reactions of sterically hindered substrates under the thermody-
namic conditions and achieved higher conversions and higher
trans:cis ratios (Figure 4B) than in the reactions using cells
expressed without PYP. For example, the dr of the product
from the 4-phenyl substrate improved from 2:1 to 8:1 trans to
cis. These data show that the singular WT V
f
-ATA can
effectively catalyze one-pot conversion of sterically varied
ketones into either cis or trans products in high selectivity.
However, we also wondered whether mutants of the enzyme
could better facilitate the cis-to-trans isomerization process.
Previous studies have shown that V
f
-ATA is amenable to
mutation at a number of sites in the large and small binding
pockets, with mutants displaying higher selectivities or reaction
rates.
14,21,23,25,26
In the presence of PYP, we expressed a library
of ATA variants with mutations to positions F19, L56, W57,
V153, and I259. I259V was found to be a highly effective
mutation, without or in combination with the mutation W57L,
for increasing the total amine formed and/or the final
diastereomer selectivity that was attained (Figure 4). For
example, the 4-CO
2
t
Bu substrate reversed selectivity from
0.08:1 trans:cis to 4.4:1 trans:cis when using I259V/W57L as
opposed to WT ATA.
For other substrates, conversions and/or selectivities also
increased with the mutant I259V, without further improve-
ment when adding W57L. In 0.25 mmol scale reactions of 7A-
9A, conducted in round-bottom flasks with air-permeable
covers, we observed that equilibration to the thermodynamic
product occurred as or more readily than in analytical-scale
reactions, with all reactions reaching the same or higher dr.
Modest loss of the more volatile 9A resulted in the only
isolated yield below 50%.
2.3. Diastereodivergent Synthesis of 3-R-Cyclohexyl-
amines. Given this success in producing diastereomerically
enriched 4-substituted cyclohexylamines, we considered how
other cyclohexanones would react under the same sets of
reaction conditions. First, we examined 3-substituted cyclo-
hexanones, which contain an existing, nonepimerizable stereo-
center (Figure 6). As such, each enantiomer of the ketone can
undergo an independent, diastereomer-selective reaction with
one cis and one trans isomer possible. Previous research has
shown that purified WT V
f
-ATA in the presence of 20 eq. of
alanine and 1 mol % PLP (a hybrid of our kinetic and
thermodynamic conditions) leads to a roughly equal mixture of
cis and trans amines from (S)-3-methylcyclohexanone, while
divergent mutagenesis of the transaminase gives rise to
mutants that favor each diastereomer.
22
In the case of (R)-3-
methylcyclohexanone, the trans product was favored by both
WT and all mutated transaminase.
22
Given that enantioen-
riched 3-substituted cyclohexanones can be prepared by
methods such as asymmetric conjugate addition,
31−37
further
stereoselective elaboration of these types of compounds could
be synthetically valuable, and we wondered if cis and trans
diastereomers could be formed from a single catalyst, without
the need to customize the catalyst for each targeted
diastereomer.
The change to a 3-substituent introduces key differences to
our previous reaction paradigm. First, the bis-equatorial
(thermodynamic) product is cis, rather than trans, in
configuration. Second, the lack of molecular symmetry in the
substrate means the amine is introduced as a true, rather than
pseudo, stereocenter in either R or S configuration. Depending
on the configuration at the 3-position, the cis (thermodynamic)
product may have (1R, 3S) or (1S, 3R) stereochemistry,
meaning the thermodynamically favored configuration of the

1-amine stereocenter may match or mismatch the natural
stereochemical preference of the (S)-selective V
f
-ATA.
As a model substrate, we studied the reaction of the
enantiopure (R)-3-methylcyclohexanone (R)-11. Under the
previously kinetic conditions, (R)-11 did indeed form the trans
(1R, 3R) product in 95% conversion and 18:1 dr (Figure 6). A
similar result (10:1 dr) was obtained in the aforementioned
prior work.
22
Therefore, for this substrate, the presence of the
small, remote stereodefined methyl group did not invoke the
native “S” selectivity of V
f
-ATA, with the (1R, 3R) product
forming under kinetic conditions. Under thermodynamic
conditions, equilibration to the cis (1S, 3R) diastereomer was
also successfully attained with the same catalyst (62%, 11:1
dr).
Derivatization and separation of the four stereoisomeric
products from reactions of racemic substrates allowed us to
determine the outcome of the reaction of (S)-11 and both (R)
and (S)-12 (Figure 6), bearing a 3-CF
3
substituent. Reactions
of 12 showed that both enantiomers of this substrate display
diastereodivergent behavior under the two reaction conditions,
leading to all four possible stereoisomers of the product from a
single biocatalyst when using the correct enantioenriched
reagent and reaction condition. The potential to accumulate
the (R)-amine as the thermodynamic product from the (S)-3-
CF
3
again suggests that the ketone behaves as a pseudoachiral
reactant. Similarly, the (S)-3-methyl ketone yielded the cis
(1R,3S) product (54% conversion, 8:1 dr). However, this
substrate was unselective at all time points under the kinetic
conditions, suggesting unselective binding leading to proto-
nation from either face, and a mixture of cis and trans products
that, under thermodynamic conditions, undergo a diaster-
eomer-selective equilibration to the cis product.
Not unexpectedly, desymmetrizing the ketone with a larger
3-Ph group resulted in a stronger, catalyst preference to form
the (S) amine (Figure 6). Under kinetic conditions, both (S)
and (R) 3-phenyl (S−13 and R−13) ketones reacted in nearly
full conversion to the cis (1S, 3R) and trans (1S, 3S) amine,
respectively. Ketone (R)−13 remained cis-selective under the
thermodynamic conditions, while (S)−13, whose cis (1R, 3S)
product is a mismatch for the S-preference of the transaminase,
slowly equilibrated to favor the 1R-cis product but only reached
1.2:1 dr after 72 h. While not a particularly selective final
outcome, it strongly contrasts the 31:1 diastereomer selectivity
for the trans product attained under the kinetic conditions and
shows that even with a large R group, there is potential for the
transaminase to equilibrate to thermodynamic products that
oppose its natural S enantiopreference.
2.4. Enantioselective Catalysis via Dynamic Kinetic
Resolution. Finally, we examined 2-substituted cyclohex-
anones. Like 3-substituted cyclohexanones, these substrates are
chiral, and there are four possible stereoisomers from the
reaction of a racemic 2-substituted cyclohexanone. However,
the presence of the substituent at the α position to the
carbonyl enables the potential for dynamic kinetic resolution,
either by spontaneous racemization in solution or racemization
via the imine or enamine intermediates formed upon
condensation of the ketone with PMP (Figure 2A).
38−40
Therefore, it is possible for a racemic ketone to be fully
converted to a single stereoisomer of the amine product. This
would require multiple modes of selectivity to be operative, as
the two enantiomers of each diastereomer are equal in energy
(Figure 7A). A singular product could arise if the enzyme
reacted with high enantiomer selectivity for one of the two
interconverting enantiomers of the substrate and then, with
high diastereomer selectivity, introduced the amine group cis
or trans to the existing methyl group.
Previous research examined the outcomes of reactions of 2-
methylcyclohexanone with two (S)-selective transaminases and
one (R)-selective transaminase in reactions containing 10 eq.
of alanine and endogenous PLP. In reaction times sufficient to
achieve at least 40% conversion, they found that Cv-ATA
formed the cis (1S, 3R) product in 7:1 dr, Pp-ATA formed the
trans (1S, 3S) product in <2:1 dr, and Ar(R)Mut11 formed the
opposite trans (1R, 3R) product in <2:1 dr.
40
Before studying catalytic reactions, we used an H/D
exchange experiment to assess the conditions under which
the methyl group of 2-methylcyclohexanone would epimerize
(Figure 7B). When the substrate was incubated in D
2
O, NaPi
buffer prepared in D
2
O, or PLP alone in D
2
O, we did not
observe incorporation of deuterium alpha to the carbonyl.
However, when the substrate was incubated in the presence of
the cells expressing the ATA, deuteration of all three alpha
hydrogens was observed by GC-MS and
1
H NMR (Figure 7B).
Because deuterium presumably incorporates through deproto-
nation of the alpha proton, which would epimerize the
stereocenter, these data suggested the potential for dynamic
kinetic resolution of these substrates.

12661
To observe if this proposed dynamic kinetic resolution
occurred in practice, 2-methyl (14A), 2-ethyl (15A), 2-allyl
(16A), and 2-phenyl (17A) cyclohexanone were subjected to
reactions under the aforementioned kinetic and thermody-
namic conditions, catalyzed by cells expressing WT and
mutated V
f
-ATAs (Figure 7C,D). In the case of all mutants
tested, the major products that formed had 1S stereochemistry,
suggesting that the increased proximity of the point of
asymmetry in 2- versus 3-substituent substrates was sufficient
to increase the pseudoenantioselective behavior of the enzyme
to furnish (S) amines. Nonetheless, the reactions, regardless of
mutation, still underwent dynamic equilibration of cis amines
to trans amines over the course of the reaction under
thermodynamic, and to a lesser extent, kinetic, conditions, if
extended reaction times were used. While the enzyme
appeared to exhibit a kinetic preference for the reaction of
the (R)-ketone for ketones 14−16, initially accumulating the
less stable cis (1S, 2R) product, over time, that cis product was
reconsumed in a diastereomer-selective fashion, such that the
product that accumulated over time was the trans (1S, 2S)
amine, characterized by epimerized stereochemistry at the
methyl group. The dr for the trans products ranged from 6:1 to
40:1, higher than that attained in previously reported reactions
containing higher levels of alanine (10 equiv).
40
Differing
mutants were found to either more effectively trap the cis
product (I259V + L56I) or to equilibrate the reaction more
effectively to the trans product (I259V + W57L or G). Ketone
17, bearing a bulky phenyl substituent, required the W57G
mutation for high reactivity. Though no mutant was identified
to form the cis product with high selectivity, the trans product
was remarkably formed with 79% conversion, 18:1 dr, and
>98% ee on an analytical scale and with a comparable outcome
on a 0.25 mmol scale.
Two pieces of data more specifically indicated an operative
DKR. First, the leftover ketone was observed to be racemic.
Second, >50% conversion to a single stereoisomer was
observed in several reactions. For example, in the case of 2-
methylcyclohexanone, thermodynamic conditions converted
72% of the racemic ketone specifically to the trans (S,S) isomer
of the product. In the cases of 2-ethyl, 2-allyl, and 2-phenyl
substrates, 74−78% conversions to single enantiomers of the
trans products were observed.
2.5. Elucidation of Reaction Dynamics Leading to
Diastereodivergence. The transamination reaction in whole
cells involves a complex equilibrium including not only the
ketone reactant, the amine donor, the amine product, and the
ketone byproduct, but also the PLP (aldehyde) cofactor and its
PMP (amine) counterpart, which facilitate the ping-pong
mechanism of the transaminase (Figure 2). In addition, whole-
cell catalysis enables further metabolism of reaction compo-
nents, in particular the pyruvate derived from the amine donor
being metabolized to CO
2
. Having uncovered the described
approach to diastereodivergent synthesis, we sought further
insight into the origin of selectivity.
First, we investigated the relative rates of the cis and trans
amines reacting in the reverse reaction. According to our initial
hypothesis, the trans product accumulates because it reacts
more slowly in the reverse reaction. To verify this, we
incubated the cis (7B) and trans (7C) 4-
t
Bu amines, whose
lower overall reactivity facilitated the measurement, in the
presence of 7.5 eq. of pyruvate and found that 7B fully reacts
back to the ketone in less than 5 min, whereas the reaction of
7C is much slower (Figure 8).
Another significant finding was the specific importance of
the PLP cofactor and alanine concentrations to the stereo-
divergent outcomes of these reactions despite the use of a
single biocatalyst. While our original studies quantified the
relative concentrations of the ketone reactant and amine
products over time, they did not examine the PLP (aldehyde)
cofactor and its PMP (amine) counterpart, the alanine
reactant, the pyruvate byproduct, and the various possible
metabolic derivatives of pyruvate. To comonitor all these
species over time, we examined the reaction of 9A in the
presence of
13
C-alanine (2.5 or 30 equiv) and PLP (0 or 0.1
equiv) by
19
F and
13
C NMR and UV−vis spectroscopy (Figure
9A−F).
Analysis of the reaction over time by
13
C NMR revealed no
observable accumulation of pyruvate; the only species
observed by
13
C NMR were alanine and bicarbonate, which
decayed and formed at proportional rates, respectively (Figure
9C,D). This suggests that pyruvate is rapidly metabolized in
the reaction, rather than accumulating as a byproduct to
facilitate the hypothesized reverse reaction of the kinetic amine
products. Interestingly, in studies of the reverse reaction by
13
C
NMR (using
13
C pyruvate), we found that pyruvate was
rapidly metabolized to a range of metabolites, including lactate,
bicarbonate, and alanine, suggesting a different metabolic fate
for pyruvate when it is slowly generated in the forward reaction
versus added in a large quantity to initiate a reverse reaction,
such as in Figure 9A.
Monitoring the reaction by UV−vis revealed that over the
course of the reaction, the resting state of the PLP cofactor
switches from PLP to PMP, owing to reaction with alanine in
the first half of the ping-pong mechanism. PLP and PMP could
only be detected in the thermodynamic reactions in which
supplemental PLP was added (Figure 9E,F). However, given
that the kinetic condition has an even larger excess of alanine
and less (only endogenous) PLP, it is reasonable to think that
this is true to an even greater extent under the kinetic
conditions.
Taken together, these data suggest that the isomerization of
the kinetic to the thermodynamic product may not involve
complete reversal of the kinetic amine to the ketone, but rather
the re-reaction of the amine product with the PLP cofactor to
form the quinonoid intermediate. When the quinonoid re-
releases the amine product, it can release it with epimerized

stereochemistry, either at the amine group (in the case of 4-
and 3- substituted ketones) or at the substituent (in the case of
2-substituted ketones) (Figure 10). Such a mechanism would
not require pyruvate (which was not observed to accumulate in
13
C NMR studies) and would also be unfavored under the
kinetic conditions, in which excess alanine would push the
limited PLP cofactor to the PMP resting state, depleting the
reaction of the PLP needed for the amine to isomerize.
Another finding of our studies was that the supplementation
of the expression media with PYP led to cells that more
effectively equilibrated the reactions toward the thermody-
namic products. To investigate this effect, we purified the
transaminases produced with and without the addition of PYP
to the cell culture. For WT and mutant V
f
-ATAs, we obtained
3.5−5 times more holo (active) enzyme per cell weight when
expressing the ATA with supplemental PYP (Figure 11A). This
was due to both higher yields of the transaminase enzyme and
a higher percent holo of the transaminase that was produced.
Of note, for cases when the cells containing mutated
transaminases outperformed the WT cells, the amount of
ATA per cell was actually found to be lower when expressing
mutants than when expressing WT-ATA, showing that the
reason for the enhanced activity of the mutants was not simply
due to more catalyst in the reaction. In fact, the mutants
contained less catalyst per reaction than the WT.
Finally, we compared the outcomes of reactions using the
kinetic and thermodynamic conditions when purified enzyme,
rather than whole cells, was used as the catalyst. Incidentally,
the quantification of the enzyme present in the whole cells also
allowed us to estimate the catalyst loading of the whole cells’
reaction to be approximately 0.05 mol % for the WT enzyme,
and therefore this catalyst loading was also used in the
reactions of the purified enzyme for a consistent comparison.
We found that, to a degree, similar dynamic phenomena
were observed using purified V
f
-ATA; however, the levels of
conversion were negligible compared to those attained using
the whole-cell catalysts, and the level of selectivity was also not
as high, though still divergent within the two conditions

(Figure 11B). These results are not surprising given existing
literature on effective reaction conditions for pure trans-
aminases. Without supplemental PLP, as in the kinetic
conditions, there is little active catalyst to catalyze product
formation, and accumulating pyruvate could promote the
reverse reaction, leading to the degradation of cis product
before it can accumulate at a high level. Conversely, under the
thermodynamic condition, the absence of either a high excess
of amine donor or a secondary enzyme to consume pyruvate
means that the equilibrium position is not shifted to the
products side, explaining why conversion reaches only 10%.
To supplement these findings, we tested the purified enzyme
under a third set of conditions, in which high alanine and high
PLP were both used. When using purified enzymes under these
conditions, comparable selectivity for the trans product was
attained as when using whole cells, but the conversion, while
higher than under the earlier conditions, was nonetheless
∼50% of that attained with the whole-cell reactions under the
same conditions. No set of conditions using the pure enzyme
resulted in high selectivity for the kinetic product using the
methyl substrate.
Reactions of the slower-reacting 8A with the purified
enzyme reflected similar, but reversed, limitations to that of
1A. Only trace product was observed under the thermody-
namic and kinetic conditions described here. Under conditions
with high Ala and added PLP, the reaction occurred with
modest conversion (25%) with high selectivity for the kinetic
product. No condition with the pure enzyme afforded high
conversion or high selectivity for the trans product. Therefore,
while these studies suggest that the transaminase alone can
affect the general reaction dynamics discussed here, these
results also show that, at least as this study was designed, the
whole-cell environment is essential in achieving the goal of a
single catalyst that can lead to the formation of either the
kinetic or thermodynamic product in high selectivity and
conversion, because it allows the reaction to be conducted
successfully with either high Ala/no PLP conditions or low
Ala/high PLP conditions.

3. CONCLUSION
Transaminase-catalyzed reactions provide a synthetic method
to produce biologically and medicinally valuable, stereodefined
amines. Owing to their reversible reaction mechanism, we
considered their suitability for stereodivergent reactivity under
varied reaction conditions. We found that a high excess of
alanine (amine donor) combined with the omission of
endogenous PLP cofactor created pseudo-irreversible reaction
conditions that afford the kinetic stereoisomers of reactions of
2-, 3-, and 4-substituted cyclohexanones in high stereo-
selectivity. In contrast, limiting the equivalents of alanine and
supplementing the reactions with PLP affords reversible
reaction conditions that enable equilibration to the thermody-
namic products. In the case of 2-substituted substrates,
concurrent DKR enabled the production of enantio- and
diastereo-enriched amines from racemic substrates when four
stereoisomers were possible. Moreover, this study prompted
our investigation of PYP as a key additive to the media when
expressing transaminases in order to increase the yield of
recombinant expression and the percent of enzymes binding
PLP. Together, these results are poised to inform further
development of both transaminases as biocatalysts and other
biocatalytic methods that, owing to their reversibility, may be
directable by kinetic and thermodynamic control.
