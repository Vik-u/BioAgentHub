1 Introduction
Plastics are materials that possess a high molecular weight
and are composed of repeating organic molecules (monomers).
Plastics play essential and ubiquitous roles in modern life.
Synthetic plastics are commonly producedvia polymerization
of petrol-based chemicals; this process consumes approximately
8% of the annual petroleum production (Carpenter 2020).
Polyester (PE) and polyamide (PA) plastics are the two most
important classes of commercial plastics, and the monomers of
each plastic are joined by an ester (-O-CO-) and an amide (-CO-
NH-) linkage, respectively. Both plastics can be synthesized as
homopolymers (e.g., PA12 laurolactam, polylactic acid from
lactic acid) or copolymers (e.g., PA 12.12 from 1,12-
diaminododecane, dodecanedioic acid or polybutylene
succinate from succinate and 1,4-butanediol). For PA, the
monomers are α,ω-fatty dicarboxylic acids (α,ω-diacids) and
α,ω-fatty diamines (α,ω-diamine) or ω-amino fatty acids (ω-
AFA), while for PE, the monomers areα,ω-diacids andα,ω-fatty
dialcohols ( α,ω-diol) or ω-hydroxy fatty acids ( ω-HFAs)
(Schaffer and Hass 2014 ). Compared to the short-chain
(C
2– C6) plastics, medium-chain (C8– C14) repeating monomers
exhibit high-performance properties, including ﬂexibility,
chemical resistance, low moisture absorption, and resistance
to stress cracking ( Supplementary Figure S1A )( Albanese
et al., 2016). At present, C
12 monomers for aliphatic PA and
PE are almost exclusively produced via chemical processes,
which have several disadvantages, including limitations in the
range of products, use of multi-step conversion processes
(Supplementary Figure S1B ), dependence on non-renewable
feedstocks, and generation of hazardous waste and emissions,
which induce severe environmental problems, such as global
warming and pollution.
Biotechnology offers innovative approaches to overcome the
disadvantages involved in the chemical processing of medium-
chain polymeric monomers. Yeast biocatalysts can oxidize the
terminal (ω) carbons of medium- to long-chainn-alkanes, fatty
alcohols, and fatty acidsvia the ω-oxidation pathway (Craft et al.,
2003; Van Bogaert et al., 2011 ), thereby converting the
compounds to their corresponding α,ω-diacids or ω-hydroxy
fatty acids (ω-HFAs). The yeasts Candida tropicalis and Y.
lipolytica have been used as industrial biocatalysts to produce
lipophilic products. Y. lipolytica is classiﬁed and genetically
recognized as safe (GRAS) and can utilize the ω-oxidation
pathway to oxidize hydrophobic substrates, generating
corresponding α,ω-bifunctional metabolites (α,ω-diacids, α,ω-
diol, and ω-hydroxy fatty acids) that can be used as polymer
building blocks (Figure 2A). For plastic monomers with amino
residues such asα,ω-diamines andω-AFA, ω-oxidation reactions
are connected to ω-transamination. Several studies have been
performed to produceω-AFAs from fatty acids usingEscherichia
coli expressing multi-enzyme cascade pathways, including
heterologous monooxygenases and ω-transaminase ( Ladkau
et al., 2016; Ahsan et al., 2018; Ge et al., 2020). Sung et al.
(2018)
produced ω-AFAs from hydroxy fatty acids or α,ω-
diamines from α,ω-diols using Escherichia coli containing
heterologous alcohol dehydrogenase and ω-transaminase.
Recently, Citoler et al. (2019) reported the biocatalytic
amination of fatty acids through a one-pot tandem cascade
catalyzed by a carboxylic acid reductase (CAR) and a
transaminase ( ω-TA). However, the use of yeast in
synthesizing medium- to long-chain α,ω-diamines or ω-AFAs
from low-cost raw materials has not yet reached its proof-of-
concept stage.
Here, we present the construction of platform strains ofY.
lipolytica, a cheese-ripening yeast, for direct biotransformation of
hydrocarbons into medium- to long-chain α,ω-fatty diamines
[NH
2-(CH2)n-NH2] and ω-amino fatty acids [NH 2-
(CH2)n-COOH], which are building blocks for high-
performance polymers ( Carpenter 2020 ), via metabolic
engineering of endogenous fatty acid ω- and β-oxidation
pathways and introducing heterologousω-transaminase (ω-TA).
2 Materials and methods
2.1 Yeast strains and plasmids
Y. lipolytica strains, plasmids, and oligonucleotides used in
this study are listed in Supplementary Table S1 . Genetic
engineering was performed according to the standard
procedures. All oligonucleotides were synthesized by
Cosmogenetech Co., Ltd., (Daejeon, South Korea). Plasmids
and DNA fragments were prepared using Qiagen kits
(Germany), and other chemicals were purchased from Sigma-
Aldrich (United States).
2.2 Genome engineering ofY. lipolytica
Genome modiﬁcation of Y. lipolytica was based on the
homologous recombination and 5-ﬂuoroorotic acid (5-FOA)
selection using URA3 as a recyclable selection marker (Figure
1). URA3 was ampliﬁed fromY. lipolytica,and pop-out regions
were used with glutamate production gene or histidine-related
gene from the pGEM T easy cloning vector (Table 1) using the
PCR using primers listed in Supplementary Table S2 .T o
construct the gene disruption cassettes, the 5′- and 3′-ﬂanking
regions of each gene listed in Supplementary Table S2 were
ampliﬁed from the genomic DNA ofY. lipolytica through PCR
using the XXX_F1/XXX_R1 and XXX_F2/XXX_R2 primers
(Supplementary Table S1). These homologous regions for the
deletion and pop-out cassettes were obtained using overlap PCR,
and the bipartite fragments were transformed into yeast cells by
using a one-step transformation method. The 5-FOA selection
and uracil marker rescue were performed. The successful

disruption of a gene was veriﬁed using PCR using the primers
XXX_F1/XXX_R1 and XXX_F2/XXX_R2. To introduce ω-
transamination into Y. lipolytica, ω-transaminase (ω-TA) from

the engineered Y. lipolytica strain. Genomic DNA from the
transformants was extracted using the Gene All DNA
extraction kit (Gene all biotechnology, Korea). A Biometra
T3000 thermocycler with Prime Star DNA polymerase

(Qiagen, Germany), and DNA fragments were recovered from
the agarose gels using the QIAquick gel extraction kit (Qiagen,
Germany).
2.3 Biotransformation condition
A single colony of the engineeredY. lipolyticastrains was pre-
grown in a test tube containing 3 ml yeast extract Bacto-pepton
dDextrose (YPD) medium overnight at 30°C with shaking at
200 rpm. One milliliter of pre-cultured broth was inoculated
into a 500 ml baf ﬂed ﬂask containing 100 ml of growth
medium (pH 6.0) containing 50 g/L glucose, 10 g/L yeast
extract, 6.7 g/L yeast nitrogen base without amino acids, 5 g/L
(NH
4)2SO4, and .05 g/L uracil. The cultures were incubated
o v e r n i g h ta t3 0°C with rotation at 200 rpm. When an OD600 of
40– 50 was reached, 50 ml of the culture broth was transferred to
250 ml bafﬂed ﬂasks containing 50 ml of the conversion medium
(pH 7.6) containing 30 g/L glucose, 3 g/L yeast extract, 6.7 g/L
YNB w/o amino acids, 5 g/L (NH
4)2SO4, .05 g/L uracil, and 1 g/L
substrate (fatty alkane, fatty alcohol, or fatty acid) with .05% Tween
80. This biotransformation was performed for 2 days at 30°Ci na
shaking incubator (200 rpm). To investigate the effect of multiple
gene knock-out on cell growth,Y. lipolyticawas incubated in a
yeast extract-peptone medium (YPD) containing 10 g/L yeast
extract and 20 g/L Bacto-peptone in sterile 24-well PS plates
(Falcon, Corning, NY). Each well contained 400 µl of YP media
with 2 µl of the pre-cultured Y. lipolytica. The Y. lipolytica
culturing was done in 20 ml of YPD medium in 250 ml bafﬂed
ﬂask incubated overnight at 30
°C. The plate was incubated on a
shaking plate reader (Tecan, Männedorf, Switzerland) at 30°Ca t
200 RPM, and the turbidity of each well was measured every
15 min (no sampling of the culture).
2.4 Analytical methods
The biomass was measured using a UV spectrophotometer
(Uvikon XL, Secomam, France) at 600 nm absorbance. To
analyze the subcellular localization of ω-CvTA
ER and ω-
CvTAcytosol introduced into Y. lipolytica , cells were
prepared, and ﬂuorescence microscopy observations were
performed. PDI monoclonal antibody (MA1-10032) was
used as the primary antibody for ω-CvTA (Abfrontier
company, Seoul, Republic of Korea) for the ER marker, and
t h eg o a ta n t i - m o u s eI g G 1( H & L ;A l e x aF l u o r

with an Agilent 7890A) equipped with a quadrupole mass
selective detector on electroionization (EI) operated at 70 eV.
An Agilent HP-5MS column (30 m length, .25 mm inner
diameter, .25 μm ﬁlm thickness) was used at a 10:1 split
ratio, helium was used as a carrier gas, and the oven
temperature was 150
°C– 172°C. The substrates and products
were extracted and prepared for GC-MS analysis according to
the corresponding methods shown in Supplementary Figure
S2.B r i eﬂy, extraction was performed from acid-or base-
treated culture broth using an equivalent volume of diethyl
ether or chloroform. Methanol dissolved in 2.2% hydrochloric
acid and 10% toluene was added to the reacted samples (1:1, v/
v) and the mixture was incubated for 1 h at 100
°C. After
heating, the mixture was acidiﬁed with H2SO4 to convert the
ionized ω-amino fatty acid toω-amino fatty acid and directly
extracted with diethyl ether. For sialylation, N,O-
bis(trimethylsilyl)tri ﬂuoroacetamide was mixed with the
extracted samples (1:1, v/v) and the mixture was incubated
for 20 min at 60
°C. Tetradecane was used as an internal
standard.
3 Results
3.1 Genome engineering ofY. lipolytica
Multiple genes are involved in each step of ω-a n dβ-
oxidation ( Supplementary Table S2 ). Therefore, genome-
wide modi ﬁcations are required to engineer a strain of Y.
lipolytica suitable to produce α,ω-bifunctional monomers
with amino residues, aliphatic polymeric monomers with
amino residues, and hydrophobic substrates. In Y. lipolytica,
non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ) is used more than
homologous recombination (HR) for the repair of double-
strand breaks in DNA ( Krtezschmar et al., 2013 ; Verbeke
et al., 2013). To improve HR efﬁciency, we used the strains
with the disrupted KU70 responsible for NHEJ-based
double-strand break repair, and then we performed a
bipartite PCR-based gene-targeting method using URA3 as
a recyclable selection marker ( Figure 2 ). The bipartite
deletion cassettes used to remove target genes
(Supplementary Table S1 ) were speci ﬁcally inserted into
sites in the genome via URA3 split-marker recombination.
The sites of integration were conﬁrmed by PCR, which was
followed by pop-out of URA3 via selection of the 5 ′-FOA
plate. This strategy allowed for the deletion of several genes
and the construction of various strains possessing ω-/β-
oxidation pathways ( Table 1).
3.2 Y. lipolytica platform strains forα,ω-
bifunctional monomers with amino
residue
To biosynthesize α,ω-bifunctional monomers with amino
residues in Y. lipolytica, ω-oxidation was combined with ω-
transamination reactions. Thus, we intended to oxidize the
terminal end of the hydrophobic substrate into an aldehyde
group by ω-oxidation and convert thea l d e h y d eg r o u pi n t oa n
amino group by ω-transaminase (ω-TA), which catalyzes the
amination between the ω-positioned ketone and amine
groups. However, as shown in Figure 1A , ω-oxidation
pathway in Y. lipolytica oxidizes hydrocarbons substrates
such as alkanes, fatty alcohols and acids to their
corresponding terminal carboxy function ( C r a f te ta l . ,
2003). Fatty acid synthesized by the ω-oxidation pathway
or introduced as a substrate can be further oxidized
through the same ω-oxidation pathway to the
corresponding α,ω-diacids. Finally, both fatty acids and
α,ω-diacids are metabolized through the β-oxidation
pathway to yield energy, CO
2,a n dw a t e r(Poirier et al., 2006).
To block β-oxidation, we consecutively deleted six genes
(POX1-6) encoding the acyl-CoA oxidase. TheΔPOX strain did
not grow on fatty alkanes, fatty alcohols or acids as sole carbon
sources (Supplementary Figure S3 ). To block the oxidizing

aldehyde group into the carboxylic group inω-oxidation, we
eliminated four fatty aldehyde dehydrogenase genes (FALDH1-
4) and inserted ω-CvTA (Klatte and Wendisch 2015) from
Chromobacterium violaceum DSM30191 into the genome of
the ΔPOX ΔFALDH strain (Figure 3A). The ω-CvTA was
placed under the control of Y. lipolytica- derived
EXP1 promoters (Blazeck et al., 2011), and its expression in
two forms was designed with or without the ER targeting leader
sequence (ERTLS) ( Iida et al., 1998 ) from ALK1 at its
N-terminus. Confocal microscopy conﬁrmed that two forms
of ω-CvTA were successfully expressed in Y. lipolytica; and
one form (ω-CvTA with ERTLS, ω-CvTAER) was exclusively
localized to the ER and the other (ω-TA without ERTLS, ω-
CvTAcytosol) to the cytosol (Figure 3B).
3.3 The effect of multiple gene knock-out
on cell growth
The effect of multiple gene knock-out on cell growth was
investigated by monitoring the growth of each mutant using a
plate reader. Time-pro ﬁles of the monitored cell growth
(Figure 4) were ﬁtted to the Gompertz model ( Zwietering
et al., 1990 ) by least squares regression, which could
determine the maximum speciﬁc growth rate (μmax) and lag
time (λ) of each mutant. Compared to Pol1g strain, all mutant
showed the lower μmax, representing a theoretical maximum
growth rate based on the inﬂection point of the curve, and
more increased λ, the adaptation time. However, a remarkable
toxic effect on all mutants was not observed.

3.4 Production ofα,ω-bifunctional
monomers with amino residue inY.
lipolytica
The ΔPOXΔFALDH strains withω-CvTAER or ω-CvTAcytosol
successfully accumulated the corresponding 1,12-diaminododecanes
into the culture medium in a shakingﬂask culture with 1 g/L of
dodecane or dodecanol as C12 hydrocarbon substrates (Figures 5A, B,
Supplementary Figure S4), but the strain withω-CvTAER produced
more than 2-fold of 1,12-diaminododecanes (8.32 ± .70 mg/L, from
dodecane as a substrate and 5.81 ± .40 mg/L from dodecanol) than
those withω-CvTA
cytosol(3.62 ± .46 mg/L and 2.43 ± .49 mg/L from
dodecane and dodecanol, respectively). To examine whether the strains
could convert FAs to the correspondingω-AFAs, these strains were
cultivated in a shakingﬂask with 1 g/L of dodecanoic acid. These strains
successfully accumulated 12-aminododecanoic acids in the culture
medium (Figure 5C, Supplementary Figure S5). Similar to 1,12-
diaminododecanes, the strain withω-CvTAER also produced more
than 2-folds of 12-aminododecanoic acids (7.94 ± .54 mg/L) than those
with ω-CvTAcytosol (1.91 ± .65 mg/L). Surprisingly, 12-
aminododecanoic acids were produced from dodecane (1.91 ±
.18 mg/L forω-CvTA
ER and .77 ± .28 mg/L forω-CvTAcytosol)a n d
dodecanol (1.11 ± .58 mg/L forω-CvTAER and .48 ± .16 mg/L forω-
CvTAcytosol)( Figures 4A, B), which may be resulted from the
overoxidation of some cytochrome P450s as described previously
(Lu et al., 2010). These strains also produced 1,12-dodecanedioic
acids and 12-hydroxydodecanoicacids as by-products, and their
amounts were similar to those in theΔPOX strains.

When substrates were expanded to an odd number (C11)o r
long chain (C16), both ΔPOX and ΔFALDH strains with ω-
CvTAER or ω-CvTAcytosol also produced the correspondingω-
AFAs (1.91 ± .18 mgC11 ω-AFAs/L and .77 ± .28 mgC16 ω-AFAs/L for
ω-CvTAER and 1.91 ± .18 mgC11 ω-AFAs/L and .77 ± .28 mgC16 ω-
AFAs/L for ω-CvTAcytosol)( Figure 6A ). To increase the
production of αω-FDs and ω-AFAs with amino residues, we
engineered Y. lipolytica strain by knocking out fatty alcohol
oxidase and increasing the copy numbers of ω-CvTA.
Interestingly, only FAO1-deleted strains produced 1,12-diols,
indicating that FAO1 plays an important role in the
degradation of alcohol groups, which increased the production
of α,ω-diamines and ω-amino fatty acids (Figure 6B). These
ﬁndings were similar with previous studies (Gatter et al., 2014;
Iwama et al., 2015).
4 Discussion
Biotransformation of hydrocarbons into polymeric monomers
with amino residues has mainly been attempted using whole-cell
systems of E. coli by introducing heterologous CYP genes.
However, attempts encountered some problems, such as CYP
expression and hydrophobic substrate uptake inE. coli-based
whole-cell biotransformation. In particular, the correct
expression of CYP inE. coli requires a heme precursor such as
expensive δ-ala-leuvenic acid (Wu et al., 2006; Ichinose and
Wariishi 2013 ). The n-alkane-assimilating yeasts with an
endogenous CYP belonging to the CYP52 family and a
reductase provide an advantageous approach forω-oxidation of
hydrocarbons. The diploid yeastC. tropicalisproduces 174 g/L C
14
diacid from methyl ester C14 fatty acid and 153 g/L of C13 α,ω-
diacids from tridecane ( Picataggio et al., 1992 ). Cathay
Biotechnologies Inc. (China) used C. tropicalis to industrially
produce C 11– C16 α and ω-diacids from petroleum-based
n-parafﬁn. Lu et al. (2010)reported high-level production ofω-
hydroxy fatty acids usingC. tropicalisthrough a modiﬁcation of
the α-a n dβ-oxidation pathways.
In this study, we needed genome-wide modiﬁcation and thus
selected an alternativen-alkane-assimilating haploidY. lipolyticaas a
starting strain sinceC. tropicalisis an obligate diploid (Seevai et al.,
2013). We successfully generatedα,ω-diamines andω-amino fatty
acids from hydrocarbons by oxidizing the terminal of the
hydrophobic substrate into an aldehyde groupvia ω-oxidation
and converting an aldehyde group into an amino group byω-
transaminase, which catalyzes the amination between the ω-
positioned ketone and amine group. To the best of our
knowledge, this study is theﬁrst to establish aY. lipolytica-based
biocatalytic system for the production ofα,ω-diamines orω-amino
fatty acids fromn-alkanes, fatty alcohols and acids. Although whole-
cell catalytic systems usingE. colih a sb e e nr e c e n t l yd e v e l o p e d(Yoo
et al., 2022), the systems have the critical disadvantages including
CYP expression and hydrophobic substrate uptakes. Firstly, CYP
expression inE. colirequires a heme precursor, which supplements
culture medium withδ-ala-leuvenic acid, an expensive commodity
(Wu et al., 2006; Cheesman et al., 2013; Ichinose and Wariishi, 2013;
Ichinose et al., 2015). Furthermore,E. colishows limited uptake of
hydrophobic substrates, which can lower the productivity.
In conclusion, with the commercially available α,ω-diacid
bioprocess, this yeast biosynthesis that produces medium- and
long-chain α,ω-diamines andω-amino fatty acids could complete
the yeast platform technology generating all medium- and long-
chain aliphatic polyamide monomers, α,ω-biofunctionalized
with one or both of carboxylic acid or amino residues
(Figure 7). Therefore, although the use of plant oils has been
focused on manufacturing biodiesel, this study will contribute in

advancing the inexpensive plant oil-derived fatty acids or
alcohols as substrates while producing high-value products
[for example, from dodencanoic acid or dodecanol (US$
1– 1.5/kg) to 1,12-dodecanedioc acid, 1,12-dodecanediamine,
and 1,12-dodecanediol (above US$ 7/kg)]. In this study,
however, the low production of α,ω-diamines and ω-amino
fatty acids was limited due to over-oxidized by-products
(1,12-diacids and 12-hydroxy fatty acids). In our future
studies, we will conduct the engineering of the CYP protein to
reduce over-oxidation activity and develop fermentation and
puriﬁcation processes forα,ω-diamines andω-amino fatty acids.
