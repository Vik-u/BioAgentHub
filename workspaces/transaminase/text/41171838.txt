Abstract 
Objective
Preclinical studies, including animal and in vitro experiments, have suggested 
that imeglimin, a novel antidiabetic drug, may have beneficial effects on metabolic 
dysfunction- associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD). However, its effect on 
MASLD in individuals with type 2 diabetes remains unclear. This study aimed to eval-
uate whether imeglimin has beneficial effects in individuals with type 2 diabetes and 
hepatic enzyme abnormalities.
Methods
This multicenter, retrospective, single-arm study included 49 individuals with type 
2 diabetes who newly initiated imeglimin treatment and continued it for six months. 
Individuals with chronic liver diseases other than MASLD were excluded. Treatment 
efficacy for liver function was defined as an ALT reduction of ≥11 IU/L, corresponding 
to the upper interquartile range of ALT reduction. Logistic regression analysis was 
performed to identify predictors of this treatment efficacy.
Results
Body mass index (BMI) and hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) levels significantly decreased 
after six months of imeglimin treatment. Additionally, both alanine aminotransferase 
(ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) levels significantly decreased (ALT: 
21.0 IU/L [13.0–39.0] vs. 17.0 [12.5–28.0], p = 0.002; AST: 21.0 IU/L [17.0–30.0] vs. 
18.0 [16.0–26.0], p = 0.010, respectively). Logistic regression analysis showed that

baseline ALT and AST levels were significant predictors of treatment efficacy for 
liver function, after adjusting for HbA1c and BMI levels (OR 1.06, 95% CI 1.02–1.12, 
p = 0.006; OR 1.12, 95% CI 1.06–1.23, p = 0.002, respectively). Furthermore, the 
receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve for baseline ALT as a predictor demon-
strated excellent discriminatory performance (Area under the curve: 0.905, p = 0.004). 
A cutoff value of 25 IU/L yielded 100% sensitivity and 77.8% specificity.
Conclusion
This exploratory study suggests that imeglimin may have beneficial effects in indi-
viduals with type 2 diabetes and elevated ALT (≥25 IU/L), potentially associated with 
MASLD. Randomized controlled trials are needed to confirm these findings.
Introduction
Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD), formerly referred 
to as non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, is a growing global health concern [1]. MASLD 
is characterized by hepatic steatosis accompanied by at least one cardiometabolic 
risk factor, such as an elevated body mass index (BMI), increased waist circum-
ference, impaired glucose tolerance, dyslipidemia, or hypertension [2]. Metabolic 
dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH) represents the inflammatory and 
fibrotic spectrum of MASLD and signifies a more severe progression of the underly-
ing metabolic liver disease [1]. MASH is recognized as an independent risk factor for 
cardiovascular disease [1,3] and is increasingly acknowledged as a leading cause 
of cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in the general population [1,4]. The 
Standards of Care in Diabetes—2025, issued by the American Diabetes Association 
(ADA) recommend appropriate screening for MASLD in patients with type 2 diabetes 
to prevent future cirrhosis, HCC, liver transplantation, and all-cause mortality [5]
Lifestyle interventions, such as dietary modifications and exercise, have been 
shown to improve MASLD [5,6]. Additionally, several pharmacological agents, 
including vitamin E, sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors, glucagon-like 
 peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs), and pioglitazone, have demonstrated effi-
cacy in MASLD, and their use is supported by clinical evidence [5,6]. Nevertheless, 
given the multifactorial pathogenesis of MASLD, treatment responses are heteroge-
neous and many patients do not achieve sufficient improvement, indicating a continu-
ing unmet need for additional therapeutic options.
Imeglimin is a novel antidiabetic agent with a unique chemical structure that bears 
some resemblance to metformin. Preclinical and clinical studies have demonstrated 
that imeglimin improves both insulin resistance and insulin secretion. In addition, 
imeglimin has been reported to have a lower risk of lactic acidosis [7–11]. These fea-
tures suggest that imeglimin exerts its antidiabetic effects through novel mechanisms 
of action, although these mechanisms have not yet been fully elucidated.
Beyond improving glycemic control, several animal studies have indicated 
that imeglimin may reduce hepatic fat accumulation in obese mice fed a high-fat,

high-sucrose diet [12,13]. Furthermore, imeglimin has been shown to attenuate inflammation and oxidative stress and to 
prevent hepatic fibrosis in non-diabetic mice with MASH induced by a choline-deficient, high-fat diet [14]. These findings 
raise the possibility that imeglimin could serve as a novel therapeutic option for MASLD in patients with type 2 diabetes. 
However, clinical evidence regarding the effects of imeglimin on liver function remains limited. This study aims to evaluate 
whether imeglimin has beneficial effects in individuals with type 2 diabetes and elevated liver enzyme levels.
Materials and methods
Participants
We conducted a multicenter, retrospective, single-arm observational study to examine the effect of imeglimin treatment 
on liver function in a real-world clinical setting among individuals with type 2 diabetes. A total of 49 individuals with type 2 
diabetes receiving medical care at Kurume University Hospital, Social Insurance Tagawa Hospital, Yame General Hospi-
tal, and Chikugo City Hospital were recruited from December 2021 to April 2024. All participants were newly treated with 
imeglimin and continued treatment for six months. In accordance with recent consensus statements [15,16], MASLD is 
defined as hepatic steatosis in the presence of cardiometabolic risk factors such as type 2 diabetes. Because hepatic 
steatosis could not be confirmed by imaging or histology in this study, we defined MASLD clinically as the presence of 
type 2 diabetes with elevated ALT (≥25 IU/L), alcohol consumption below the threshold for alcohol-related liver disease 
(<women: 350 mg/week, men: 420 mg/week), and the absence of other chronic liver diseases. Patients with viral hepati-
tis, autoimmune hepatitis, drug-induced liver injury, or primary biliary cholangitis were excluded based on medical history, 
laboratory data available in clinical records, and physician judgment. However, systematic serological testing for viral 
and autoimmune markers was not performed in all participants. All procedures were conducted in accordance with the 
ethical principles outlined in the Declaration of Helsinki. This multi-center study was conducted under a single central-
ized approval granted by the Clinical Research Ethics Committee of Kurume University Hospital (approval no. 22034). All 
participating institutions relied on this central approval in accordance with their institutional policies; therefore, separate 
local approvals were not required. This study utilized data from the “Development and Analysis of a Diabetes Registry in 
Chikugo”, and eligible participants were identified by reviewing their medical records. Data were accessed for research 
purposes between May 2024 and December 2024. The authors had access to identifiable information during data collec-
tion; however, all data were anonymized prior to analysis.
Data collection
All data were retrospectively collected from medical records. Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) levels were measured using a 
standard high-performance liquid chromatography method and reported according to the National Glycohemoglobin 
Standardization Program. The Fibrosis-4 (Fib-4) index was calculated using the following formula: age (years) × aspartate 
aminotransferase (AST) (U/L)/ [platelet count (10⁹/L) × √alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (U/L)]. Hypertension was defined 
as a systolic blood pressure >140 mmHg, diastolic blood pressure >90 mmHg, or the current use of any antihyperten-
sive medication. Hyperlipidemia was defined as a serum concentration of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) 
≥120 mg/dL and triglycerides ≥150 mg/dL, in accordance with Japan Atherosclerosis Society criteria, or the current use 
of lipid- lowering agents. Macrovascular disease was defined as a history of acute myocardial infarction, angina pectoris 
confirmed by clinically significant obstruction on coronary angiography, revascularization via angioplasty or coronary artery 
bypass surgery, cerebral infarction, and peripheral vascular disease.
Statistical analyses
Continuous variables are presented as mean ± standard deviation (SD) or median (25th-75th percentile), while categorical 
variables are presented as numbers and percentages. Differences between groups were analyzed using the unpaired 

PLOS One | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0335888 October 31, 2025 4 / 12
t-test or the Wilcoxon signed-rank test for continuous variables and the chi-squared test for categorical variables. Changes 
in concomitant medication use between baseline and study completion were evaluated using Bowker’s test for paired cat-
egorical data. Logistic regression analysis was performed to identify predictors of treatment efficacy, aiming to determine 
which populations benefit most from the treatment. Treatment efficacy for liver function was defined as an ALT reduction in 
the upper interquartile range (corresponding to an ALT reduction of ≥11 IU/L, S1 Fig). Statistical analyses were performed 
using JMP version 18.2.1 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA). A two-sided p-value < 0.05 was considered statistically 
significant.
Results
The characteristics of the 49 participants are summarized in Table 1. After six months of imeglimin treatment, significant 
reductions were observed in body weight, body mass index (BMI), and HbA1c levels (64.7 ± 17.0 kg vs. 63.7 ± 16.6 kg, 
p = 0.034; 24.8 ± 5.2 kg/m2 vs. 24.4 ± 5.0 kg/m2, p = 0.033, 8.2% [7.6–9.1] vs. 7.4% [7.0–7.9], p < 0.0001). Serum ALT and 
AST levels also significantly decreased (ALT: 21.0 IU/L [13.0–39.0] vs. 17.0 IU/L [12.5–28.0], p = 0.002; AST: 21.0 IU/L 
[17.0–30.0] vs. 18.0 IU/L [16.0–26.0], p = 0.010). During the observation period, three adverse events were observed. All 
were gastrointestinal symptoms, which required dose reduction but did not lead to treatment discontinuation.
Liver function improvement was defined as a reduction in ALT ≥ 11 IU/L, corresponding to the upper interquartile range 
of ALT reduction (S1 Fig). In univariate analysis, baseline ALT and AST were the only variables significantly different 
between the efficacy and non-efficacy group (ALT: 42.0 IU/L [36.0–65.5] vs 15.5 IU/L [12.0–22.8], p < 0.0001; AST: 38.0 
IU/L [27.0–56.0] vs 20.0 IU/L [17.0–23.8], p = 0.0001) (Table 2). Logistic regression analysis demonstrated that base-
line ALT and AST levels remained significantly associated with treatment-related improvements in liver enzymes, even 
after adjustment for HbA1c and BMI. (ALT: Odd ratio [OR] 1.06, 95% Confidence Interval [CI] 1.02–1.12, p = 0.006; AST: 
OR 1.12, 95%CI 1.06–1.23, p = 0.002) (Table 3). Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis demonstrated 
excellent predictive performance of baseline ALT and AST levels for treatment efficacy, with area under the curve (AUCs) 
of 0.905 and 0.862, respectively. The optimal cutoff values were 25 IU/L for ALT and 23 IU/L for AST (Fig 1). Since ALT 
yielded a higher AUC, it may be a more reliable predictor of hepatic improvement, with the cutoff value of 25 IU/L provid-
ing 100% sensitivity and 77.8% specificity.
In participants with baseline ALT ≥ 25 IU/L, both ALT and AST levels significantly decreased after treatment (ALT: 42.0 
IU/L [32.5–59.5] vs. 29.0 IU-L [19.5–46.5], p = 0.001; AST: 32.0 IU/L [25.0–52.0] vs. 25.0 IU/L [18.0–38.5], p = 0.015). In 
contrast, no significant changes were observed in the ALT < 25 IU/L group (ALT: 13.5 IU/L [12.0–18.8] vs. 13.5 IU/L [11.0–
16.8], p = 0.374; AST: 18.0 IU/L [16.0–20.8] vs. 17.0 IU/L [15.0–19.0], p = 0.236) (Fig 2A, 2B). Moreover, the Fib-4 index 
was significantly decreased in the ALT ≥ 25 IU/L group (1.6 [1.0–2.1] vs. 1.4 [0.9–1.7], p = 0.030), but not in the ALT < 25 
IU/L group (1.2 [0.9–1.6] vs. 1.4 [0.9–1.6], p = 0.815) (Fig 2C).
Finally, the influence of concomitant glucose-lowering therapies was investigated in the ALT ≥ 25 IU/L group. At base-
line, 52.3% were treated with SGLT2 inhibitors and 38.1% were using GLP-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs); only one 
 participant was using pioglitazone. To isolate the effect of imeglimin, participants who initiated or discontinued SGLT2 
inhibitors, GLP-1RAs and dual GLP1/GIP RAs during the study period were excluded, resulting 9 participants in the 
SGLT2 inhibitor non-user group, 8 in the SGLT2 inhibitor user group, 11 in the GLP-1RAs non-user group, and 6 in the 
GLP-1RAs user group. Significant reductions in ALT, AST and the Fib-4 index were observed in both non-user groups 
(S2A – S2F Fig). In contrast, no significant reductions were observed in the GLP-1RA user groups, whereas a significant 
reduction in ALT was observed in the SGLT2 inhibitor user group. (S2A, S2D- S2F Fig).
Discussion
Preclinical studies, including animal and in-vitro experiments, have suggested that imeglimin may exert beneficial effects 
on MASLD [12–14]. However, clinical evidence showing its effects on MASLD in individuals with type 2 diabetes remains

limited. In the present study, we demonstrated that the efficacy of imeglimin in improving liver function was significantly 
associated with baseline AST and ALT levels. ROC curve analysis identified a baseline ALT cutoff value of 25 IU/L as 
an excellent predictor of treatment response. Imeglimin significantly reduced both ALT and AST levels in individuals with 
ALT ≥ 25 IU/L, potentially indicative of MASLD, while no significant reduction was observed in those with ALT < 25 IU/L. 
Furthermore, a significantly reduction in the Fib-4 index was observed only in the ALT ≥ 25 IU/L group.
According to the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD), ALT levels exceeding 30 IU/L may 
suggest the presence of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease [17]. In a biopsy-based study, Castera et al. demonstrated that

men with ALT ≥ 30 IU/L and women with ALT ≥ 20 IU/L had a higher prevalence of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis and liver 
fibrosis [18]. Based on these findings, it is plausible that the ALT ≥ 25 IU/L group in our study included individuals with 
hepatic steatosis, inflammation, or fibrosis, in whom imeglimin exerted beneficial effects.
The pathogenesis of MASLD and MASH is complex and multifaceted. Only 5–10% of MASLD patients progress to 
MASH, while the majority (90–95%) present with simple steatosis, commonly referred to as fatty liver [19]. The widely 
accepted multiple-hit hypothesis implicates insulin resistance as the central mechanism, promoting hepatic de novo lipo-
genesis (DNL) and increasing circulating free fatty acids (FFA) via enhanced adipose tissue lipolysis [20]. These FFAs are 
taken up by the liver, contributing to triglyceride accumulation, mitochondrial dysfunction, and the generation of reactive 
oxygen species (ROS) and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, which further drive hepatic inflammation and injury [21].

Imeglimin has demonstrated multifaced hepatic effects in preclinical models. It ameliorated hepatic steatosis by 
enhancing fatty acid oxidation, stimulating glucagon secretion, and suppressing DNL, while also improving mitochon-
drial function [12,13]. Specifically, imeglimin partially inhibits mitochondrial Complex I and restores Complex III activity 
in hepatocytes, resulting in reduced ROS production and increased ATP levels [12]. These mitochondrial effects may 
contribute to the observed hepatoprotection, as ROS overproduction and ATP depletion are associated with hepatocyte 
injury [22]. Kaji et al. reported that imeglimin attenuated steatosis, inflammation, and fibrosis in a non-diabetic MASH 
mouse model induced by a choline-deficient, high-fat diet (CDA-HFD) [14]. Imeglimin increased hepatic expression of fatty 
acid oxidation markers, such as peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-α (PPAR-α), carnitine palmitoyltransferase I 
(CPT-1), and acyl-CoA oxidase 1 (ACOX1), and decreased hepatic oxidative stress markers, including 4-hydroxynonenal 
(4-HNE) and malondialdehyde (MDA). It also suppressed hepatic macrophage infiltration and proinflammatory cytokines, 
such as tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and interleukin-6 (IL-6), while reducing fibrosis markers, including collagen type 
1, α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA), and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1 (TIMP-1), and galectin-3 expression. These 
findings suggest that imeglimin may directly attenuate hepatic steatosis, inflammation, and fibrosis.
In addition to these preclinical observations, recent clinical studies have also reported hepatic benefits of imeglimin in 
patients with type 2 diabetes. Uto et al. [23] demonstrated improvements in liver enzyme levels and elastography-based 
indices after six months of imeglimin therapy. Tanaka et al. [24] observed reductions in noninvasive fibrosis markers, 
including Fib-4 index and aspartate aminotransferase to platelet ratio index (APRI), particularly among patients at higher 
baseline fibrosis risk. Furthermore, Fukunaga et al. [25] showed that imeglimin improved ALT, AST, and fibrosis-related 
indices such as FIB-4 and FAST score, although no significant changes were detected in liver fat content or stiffness. 
These findings are consistent with the present results, while our study extends prior work by demonstrating that improve-
ments in ALT, AST and FIB-4 were confined to patients with elevated baseline ALT (≥25 IU/L), thereby highlighting the 
potential clinical utility of ALT as a simple marker for stratifying treatment response.
In the present study, the observed reduction in ALT in the ALT ≥ 25 IU/L group may reflect improvements in hepatic 
steatosis and inflammation, as suggested by both preclinical studies and recent clinical trials reporting decreases in Fib-4 
following imeglimin therapy [24,25]. The Fib-4 index levels in this group decreased from 1.6 [1.0–2.1] to 1.4 [0.9–1.7], 
slightly above the normal range [5,26]. Although the Fib-4 index is useful noninvasive marker of liver fibrosis, its diagnostic 
performance is reportedly reduced in individuals with type 2 diabetes [27,28]. Thus, while our findings hint at a potential 
antifibrotic effect of imeglimin, further investigation is warranted to substantiate this.

With regard to combination therapy, trends toward reduced ALT and AST levels were observed in individuals concur-
rently using SGLT2 inhibitors or GLP-1 receptor agonists. However, a statistically significant reduction was observed only 
in ALT levels among those using SGLT2 inhibitors. This limited significance may be due to the small sample size and does 
not exclude a possible synergistic effect, particularly in patients receiving GLP-1 receptor agonists. The effect of imeglimin 
was also observed in the subgroup using SGLT2 inhibitors. While both agents have been associated with enhanced fatty 
acid oxidation, the underlying mechanisms appear to differ: imeglimin improves mitochondrial function and thereby facil-
itates more efficient fatty acid oxidation at the cellular level [12], whereas SGLT2 inhibitors induce a systemic substrate 
shift from glucose toward fatty acid and ketone body utilization through glucosuria-induced energy loss [29]. In addition, 
preclinical studies have suggested that both agents may attenuate hepatic inflammation and fibrosis through mitochon-
drial protection, oxidative stress reduction, or metabolic modulation [12,14,29], although the extent to which these effects

overlap remains uncertain. Taken together, these findings suggest that the hepatic benefits of imeglimin under concomi-
tant SGLT2 inhibition are mediated by complementary and at least partly independent mechanisms. Further studies with 
larger cohorts are warranted to clarify these interactions more definitively.
This study has several limitations. First, it was conducted as a one-arm, uncontrolled study, limiting our ability to ascribe 
causality to imeglimin. Second, although we used serum ALT as a representative marker of liver function to stratify patients, 
we recognize that ALT is only a surrogate marker and does not directly reflect hepatic steatosis, inflammation, or fibrosis. 
Objective assessment using imaging modalities such as MRI or ultrasonography would be required to confirm hepatic fat 
reduction. However, because this was a retrospective, real-world, multicenter analysis, standardized imaging data were 
unavailable. Therefore, our findings should be interpreted as statistical associations based on biochemical surrogates rather 
than direct evidence of histological or imaging-based improvement. In addition, the threshold of ALT reduction (≥11 IU/L) 
used to stratify treatment response was derived from the statistical distribution (upper interquartile range) rather than from 
an established clinical cutoff, and should be regarded as an exploratory criterion. Third, the small sample size and short 
duration reduce the generalizability of our findings. In addition, the possibility of regression to the mean cannot be completely 
excluded, as patients with higher baseline ALT levels are more likely to show a reduction. Nevertheless, elevated baseline 
values do not necessarily normalize spontaneously, and the significant decrease observed only in patients with high ALT 
suggests a clinically meaningful therapeutic effect of imeglimin. Fourth, although patients with viral hepatitis, autoimmune 
hepatitis, drug-induced liver injury, and other chronic liver diseases were excluded based on medical history and available 
clinical data, systematic serological testing for viral and autoimmune markers was not performed in all participants. Moreover, 
HCC was not systematically ruled out in this cohort; although no participants had clinical or imaging findings suggestive of 
HCC in their records, the possibility of unrecognized subclinical liver disease, including HCC, cannot be completely excluded.
Conclusion
This exploratory study suggests that imeglimin may improve liver enzyme levels and the Fib-4 index in individuals with 
type 2 diabetes who exhibit elevated ALT levels (≥ 25 IU/L), potentially indicating coexisting MASLD. These findings sup-
port the need for large-scale, randomized controlled trials to confirm the hepatic benefits of imeglimin and to clarify its role 
in MASLD treatment.
