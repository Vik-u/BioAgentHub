Biocatalytic transamination in a monolithicﬂow
reactor: improving enzyme grafting for enhanced
performance†

 *a
Transaminases were immobilized onto macrocellular silica monoliths and used for carrying a continuous
ﬂow mode transamination reaction. Monoliths were prepared via an emulsion-templated sol –gel
method and functionalised by amino-moieties (3-aminopropyl-triethoxysilane, APTES) in order to
covalently immobilize the enzymes, using glutaraldehyde as a cross-linking agent. In order to obtain
higher performance and improved reproducibility, we investigate the key parameters of APTES
functionalisation and of enzyme grafting. Four functionalisation protocols were studied. We show that
enhancing the homogeneity of the APTES grafting and controlling the moisture level during
functionalisation led to a 3-fold increase in activity as compared to the previously reported data, and
greatly improved the reproducibility. Additionally, we report a strong beneﬁcial eﬀect of running the
enzyme immobilisation at room temperature instead of 4
/C14 C, further enhancing the obtained activity.
Finally, the popular method which consists of stabilizing the covalent attachment of the enzyme by
reducing the imine bonds formed between the enzyme and the functionalised surface was investigated.
We highlight a strong enzyme deactivation caused by cyanoborohydride, making this strategy irrelevant
in this case. The improvements presented here led to more active macrocellular monoliths, of general
interest for continuousﬂow mode biocatalysis.
Introduction
The use of enzymes for catalysing chemical transformations is
of increasing interest, especially in the perspective of greener
synthesis of high-value chemicals.
1–3 Indeed, enzymes oen
work with high eﬃciency and (enantio)-selectivity, and in mild
conditions.4 In this vibrant eld of research, the biocatalytic
synthesis of chiral amines using transaminase enzymes is
a good example of an application for which tremendous
achievements have been made, both at the fundamental and
applied levels.
5–9
In the perspective of practical applications, immobilizing
enzymes on a solid carrier allows for their facile recovery (e.g. by
ltration or centrifugation) so that the enzymes can then be
reused several times. 10–12 Among the various methods for
enzyme immobilisation, 13 covalent anchoring on porous
carriers is probably the most successful approach, allowing
a robust attachment of the enzyme.
11 Importantly, the immo-
bilisation of enzymes onto solid supports allows envisaging
continuous ow biocatalytic processes to replace discontinuous
batch processes.14–16 Such transfer from batch mode to contin-
uous ow mode usually allows to increase the global produc-
tivity and to lower the environmental cost of chemical
processes.
17–20
Instead of the classical powdery materials that can be used as
carriers and packed in axed bed reactor, a seducing approach for
ow chemistry is to use self-standing porous monoliths.21–23 Inor-
ganic or polymer monoliths containing intricate pore networks
can be obtained in various desired shape and provide unique
advantages such as fast kinetics and high throughput.
21 Porous
monolithic materials can have a high void fraction, thereby
provoking only low pressure drop during the passage of auid.
24,25
In particular, macrocellular silica monoliths have been
extensively investigated because they can be obtained with
tailored texture, structure, and surface functionalities, using
bottom up sol– gel chemistry methods.
26–28 In ow biocatalysis,
for example, Brunet al.29 have reported on the use of macro-
cellular silica monoliths– coined “Si(HIPE)”– for theow mode
transesterication of crude oil using immobilized lipase.
Si(HIPE) monoliths27 are obtained using a concentrated oil-in-
water emulsion as a template. Their surface can then be func-
tionalised, for example with epoxide or amine functions which
serve as anchoring points for enzyme immobilisation.
Recently, we reported on the use of Si(HIPE) monoliths for
the ow mode kinetic resolution of chiral amines using

PAPER

immobilized transaminases. 30 The enzyme was e ﬀectively
anchored using a well-known strategy: 31 glutaraldehyde is
employed as a coupling agent between the lysine residues and
the amino groups brought on the silica surface by functionali-
sation with 3-aminopropyl-triethoxysilane (APTES). The role of
APTES was shown to be decisive in the performance of these
functional materials. Yet, neither the APTES functionalisation,
nor the enzyme graing were optimized.
In the present paper, we report signicant improvements
that can be obtained in the production of monolithic bio-
catalysts exhibiting enhanced activity. First, we inspect the
spatial homogeneity of the APTES functionalisation and we
propose a method leading to a more homogeneous distribution
of the amino groups throughout the materials and subse-
quently to enhanced catalytic performance. Second, we address
repeatability issues by controlling the water content during
functionalisation. Third, we discuss the role of temperature
during the enzyme gra ing step. Finally, we consider the
possibility to reduce the hydrolysable imine bonds formed in
the covalent graing process, to ensure a more robust immo-
bilisation. We discuss the pertinence of these strategies in the
context ofow biocatalysis.

(PTFE) tube was purchased from RS Components. Codexis
generously supplied ATA-117 transaminase. Distilled water was
applied for all synthesis and treatment processes.
Silica monolith synthesis
Porous monoliths synthesis was performed according to Ungur-
eanu et al.:
32 6 g of a concentrated hydrochloric acid solution (37%
wt) were introduced in 16 g of a TTAB aqueous solution (35% wt).
Then 5 g of TEOS was added. The aqueous phase was stirred until
a monophasic hydrophilic medium was obtained. 35 g dodecane
was then added dropwise while stirring to form an emulsion. The
latter was cast into a polypropylene 10 mLask, allowed to
condense for 1 week at room temperature. Resulting material was
washed three times with 50 mL of a THF/acetone mixture (1 : 1 v/v)
(each washing lasted 24 h) and then gently dried in air during 3
days before calcined at 650
/C14 C for 6 h (heating rate of 2/C14 Cm i n/C0 1
with arst plateau at 180/C14 C for 6 h). Porous monoliths were stored
in a desiccator at room temperature.
Monolith functionalisation
Graed samples were denotedAxY where ‘A’ stands for APTES
graing, ‘x’ is the APTES concentration in the functionalisation
solution (in mM), and‘Y’ is the functionalisation method used
for the monolith (method A, B, C or D).
Method A. 2 monoliths (approximately 0.15 g each) were
added into 25 mL of a toluene/APTES solution of desired
concentration. Dynamic vacuum was applied to force the solu-
tion into the pores of the monoliths, until e ﬀervescence
stopped. Static vacuum was then maintained for 24 h. Mono-
liths were separated from the toluene/APTES solution and
washed three times with 25 mL of a toluene/acetone mixture
(1 : 1 v/v). For each washing, wet monoliths were soaked into the
washing solvents by applying dynamic vacuum until eﬀerves-
cence stopped and then static vacuum for 2 h. Functionalised
monoliths were dried under vacuum at 60
/C14 C for 24 h and then
stored in a desiccator at room temperature.
Method B.This protocol is similar to“Method A”, but right
aer the eﬀervescence stops, monoliths were removed from the
graing solution, and disposed on a grid in toluene-saturated
atmosphere for 24 h (in a closed-desiccator containing
a toluene ask for atmosphere saturation). APTES concentra-
tion used for this “dry impregnation” method was typically
higher than in Method A. The monoliths were then washed,
dried and stored in the same way as in Method A.
Method C.A re-hydroxylation protocol was applied (adapted
from Zhuravlev)
33 before functionalisation: monoliths were
soaked in water at room temperature. Dynamic vacuum was
applied until the eﬀervescence stopped (to force the solution
into the pores of the monolith). The wet monoliths were then
inserted in a closed glass bottle, and maintained at 100
/C14 C for
24 h. Monoliths were then dried at 190 /C14 C for 24 h under
vacuum on a glass Petri plate, and then cooled to room
temperature (still in vacuum). Monoliths were then graed with
APTES following the procedure described in Method B.
Method D.The monoliths were dried at 120
/C14 C for 24 h under
vacuum before functionalisation. Aer cooling to room temper-
ature (still under vacuum), monoliths were functionalised as in
Method B, but using a water-saturated APTES solution.
Characterisation
Attenuated total reectance – infrared spectroscopy (ATR-
FTIR). Samples were analysed using a Bruker Equinox 55 with
a Platinum ATR cell, with a diamond crystal, and Trans DTGS
detector. 100 scans were taken for both background and
samples, with a resolution of 2 cm
/C0 1. ATR correction was
applied (number of ATR reection is 1; angle of incidence is 45/C14 ;
mean re ection index of sample is 1.5). Monoliths were
systematically crushed, unless otherwise stated.
Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). Samples were dried
under vacuum at 105/C14 C for 24 h. TGA was performed under air
ow (50 mL min/C0 1) with heating rate of 10/C14 C min/C0 1 from 30/C14 C

until 900/C14 C with a TGA/SDTA-851e Mettler Toledo equipment.
Data analysis was performed using the STARe soware.
Thermo-programmed water desorption. Crushed samples
were analysed using a Catlab-PCS Hiden Analytical equipped
with a QGA mass spectrometer. The argonow rate was 30
mL min
/C0 1. Temperature program was: (i) plateau at 50/C14 C for 10
minutes, (ii) heating to 700/C14 C (heating rate 3/C14 C min/C0 1), (iii)
plateau at 700/C14 C for 10 minutes. Detected mass/charge ratios
were: 17 and 18 (H2O), 28 (CO), 32 (O2), 40 (Ar) and 44 (CO2).
Transamination reaction
Batch mode. A model reaction was used to assess catalytic
activity of ATA-117: the transamination of pyruvate with racemic
BMBA, to produce BAP and
D-alanine. As the enzyme only
accepts theR-enantiomer of BMBA as a substrate, this reaction
is a kinetic resolution (Fig. 1). Typical conditions were 30/C14 C,
phosphate buﬀer 0.1 M pH 8, pyridoxal phosphate 2.02 mM,
sodium pyruvate 10 mM, racemic BMBA 10 mM, DMSO 5%.
Batch reactions were carried out in 5 mL round bottom glass
asks under moderate magnetic stirring.
Flow mode. A monolith was inserted into a heat-shrinkable
PTFE tube, which perfectly ts the monolith shape when
heated, preventing preferentialows along monolith sides. The
heat-shrinkable PTFE tube was also shrunk around stainless steel
male connectors (surrounded by PTFE tape to ensure sealing),
themselves connected to PTFE pipes. This device was connected
to a PP Terumo syringe used to deliver a controlled liquidow.
Monolithic reactors were placed in a thermo-regulated water bath
(Fig. S1†). Each reactor wasrst impregnated with 50 mL of a 1%
glutaraldehyde aqueous solution (ow rate of 1.4 mL min
/C0 1)a t
4 /C14 Co r3 0/C14 C. Then, the enzyme was graed in the monolith by
owing 50 mL of the buﬀered transaminase solution (0.2 g L/C0 1 in
potassium phosphate buﬀer 0.1 M pH 8, pyridoxal phosphate
2.02 mM, sodium pyruvate 10 mM) with a ow rate of 1.4
mL min/C0 1, with the water bath maintained at 4/C14 Co r3 0/C14 C. Aer,
the reactor was washed at 30/C14 Cw i t h5 0m Lb uﬀer, with aow
rate of 1.4 mL min/C0 1, until no enzyme is detected in the outow.
Practically, this was achieved aer using approximately 30 mL of
buﬀer solution. Sample denotation is based on the name of the
monolith (functionalised following Method A, B, C, or D) with
‘GA’ as a suﬃx and TA as a prex when the monolith has been
loaded with glutaraldehyde and with the transaminase. An
additional suﬃx ‘30d’ is added for the samples which have been
loaded with the enzyme at 30
/C14 C. The reaction medium (same
conditions as in batch reactions) was loaded in the syringe and
injected into the reactor with aow rate of 0.11 mL min
/C0 1.
Catalytic activity was determined by collecting the outows and
measuring BMBA consumption and BAP production in gas
chromatography. During enzymatic reaction, actualow rates
were continuously monitored allowing an accurate determina-
tion of contact time.
Conversion was determined on 100mL samples taken from
the reaction medium. 10 mL of sodium hydroxide (2 M) was
added and the mixture was vortexed for 1 second. 500mLo f
dichloromethane was then added to the aqueous phase and
vortexed for 10 seconds to allow extraction of BAP and BMBA
into the organic phase. This extraction step was repeated twice
and the organic phase was collected and analysed by gas chro-
matography (Bruker Scion 456 GC with a WCOT fused silica BR-
5 column (30 m/C2 0.32 mm ID/C2 1.0 mm) and helium as carrier
gas (25 mL min
/C0 1), oven temperature at 150/C14 C, split ratio of 20,
injector temperature at 250 /C14 C, ame ionisation detector
temperature at 300 /C14 C (air ow 300 mL min/C0 1,H 2 ow 30
mL min/C0 1)). The yield is dened as the proportion of rac-BMBA
converted into 4 0-bromoacetophenone (BAP; in %). The
maximum yield for the kinetic resolution is 50%.
Enzyme quanti cation. Enzymatic concentrations were
assessed by a modied Bradford method, 34,35 using bovine
serum albumin protein as a standard. 500mLo fs a m p l ew e r e
added to 1500 mLo fB r a d f o r dr e a g e n t .Aer 10 minutes
incubation at room temperature, absorbance was read at 595
and 470 nm with a spectrophotometer ThermoScienti c
Genesys 10S-Vis. Enzyme loading in the monoliths was
determined by assessing the di ﬀerence of enzyme concen-
t r a t i o ni nt h ei nows and the outows. The immobilisation
eﬃciency can be calculated as the ratio between the calcu-
lated loading and the amount of enzyme used in the graing
step (10 mg). It varied from a few percent to 20% maximum
depending on the method used to functionalise the
monoliths.
Results and discussion
Functionalisation (Method A) and APTES dispersion
In our recent work,30 we demonstrated the feasibility of immo-
bilizing a transaminase (ATA-117, from Codexis) on macro-
cellular silica monoliths for the enantioselective
transamination in continuousow. The enzyme was covalently
attached to the amino-functionalised silica monolith (with
APTES), using glutaraldehyde as a coupling agent. In the best
conditions, using a monolith functionalized according to the
protocol here called “Method A” and with a contact time of
10 min, we obtained a stable BAP yield of 6%, with excellent
enantiospecicity (only R-BMBA was converted).
Aer the reaction, the monolith was cut lengthwise, and
a brownish crust was observed (Fig. 2). This crust was not
observed when a blank was used (no APTES in the functionali-
sation solution). This visually indicates that the APTES disper-
sion throughout the monolith is not homogeneous. We propose
that this colour is linked to the reaction between the amino-
propyl groups graed in excess and the reactant BMBA in the
presence of glutaraldehyde (Fig. 2c).
ATR-FTIR and TGA analyses were performed on the inner
and outer layers of the APTES functionalised monolith. TGA
analyses (Fig. 3) conrmed an uneven APTES dispersion in the
monolith functionalised by Method A. Clearly, the weight loss
(associated to graed aminopropyl moieties) was much higher
from the sample scratched from the outer layers than from the
Fig. 1 Model reaction: kinetic resolution of S-BMBA.

inner layer. This was also conrmed by ATR-FTIR analyses as
the C– H stretching band was detected around 2900 cm/C0 1 only
for the outer layer and not for the inner layer (Fig. 3).
Our interpretation of the heterogeneity of the APTES graing
was linked to the method of functionalisation. During the
functionalisation process with Method A, the monolith was
soaked into a large excess of the graing solution. Thus, the
porosity of the monolith waslled with an APTES solution of
relatively low concentration, and the external environment was
also composed of the same APTES solution. During the 24 h of
functionalisation, APTES molecules could continuously diﬀuse
from the excess solution and enter into the monolith, thereby
functionalizing mostly the outer part of the monolith. In this
way, a radial APTES gradient was established. It appears
reasonable to put forward that a more homogeneous APTES
functionalisation throughout the monolith would lead to
a more eﬀective enzyme immobilisation and possibly, to higher
biocatalytic performance. This is why Methods B, C, and D were
proposed as attempts to improve the quality of the APTES
functionalisation step.
Improving APTES-functionalisation
Dry impregnation (Method B).In Method B the monoliths
were briey dipped in the graing solution under vacuum and
then removed from the solution. The solution was more
concentrated (500 mM) in APTES than in Method A. The mono-
liths were then placed on a grid and maintained in a toluene-
saturated atmosphere for 24 h. They then followed the same
procedure for the washing, drying, storage, loading of glutaral-
dehyde, enzyme immobilisation, and then they were tested in the
kinetic resolution of BMBA (vide infra). The monoliths were cut
lengthwise aer the catalytic reaction inow. APTES dispersion
appeared to be homogeneous throughout the monoliths as no
crust was observed (Fig. 4). Instead, a homogeneous yellow col-
ouring was observed throughout the monolith. In order to
conrm the homogeneous APTES dispersion, ATR-FTIR and TGA
analyses were performed on the inner and outer layers of the
samples functionalised by Method B. TGA analyses (Fig. 5)
showed that Method B achieved a homogeneous functionalisa-
tion throughout the monolith since the same organic content
was measured in both layers. This was conrmed by ATR-FTIR
analysis (Fig. 5) as the signal attributed to C –H stretching
(2900 cm
/C0 1) was detected with similar intensity in both layers.
Eight TA-A500B-GA monoliths were prepared independently
following strictly the same procedure used to load the enzyme

and were tested in the kinetic resolution of BMBA. The catalysts
showed on average a yield of 11%, signicantly higher than the
6% yield obtained with Method A samples (Fig. 6). A 2 mg
loading was obtained in average forA500
B-GA samples (stan-
dard deviation, RSD, was 57% for the loading measurement on
the eight monoliths).
Thus, the better dispersion of APTES throughout the
monoliths seems to be benecial for the enzyme anchoring.
However, the repeatability was poor (RSD was 40% for thenal
yield obtained with the eight independent monoliths prepared
via Method B, see error bar in Fig. 6). This may be assigned to
a relatively high variability of the silanol content on Si(HIPE)
monoliths from batch-to-batch. Indeed, according to Zhur-
avlev,
33 dehydroxylation of the silica surface should be expected
to occur during monolith calcination. In contrast, water from
air humidity could slowly re-hydroxylate the silica surface
before the functionalisation procedure is applied. This rehy-
droxylation step was not controlled in Method B and may have
varied from one experiment to the other. Yet, those silanols are
the anchoring points for the gra ing of the aminopropyl
groups. Thus, Method C was implemented in order to increase
the silanol surface density and to control the rehydroxylation
step.
Rehydroxylation prior to silanisation (Method C).Si(HIPE)
monoliths re-hydroxylation was inspired by Zhuravlev
33 (Fig. 7):
aer soaking in water, monoliths were heated at 100 /C14 Ci n
a closed glass recipient. The monoliths were then dried at
190
/C14 C under vacuum, in order to remove excess water, while
maintaining a large amount of hydroxyl groups. Temperature-
programmed desorption of water has been performed on
rehydroxylated samples. Water desorption is followed by mass
spectrometry when the samples are gradually heated under
argon atmosphere. Above 400
/C14 C, water desorption is assigned
to silanol condensation. A higher amount of water was shown to
desorb from the rehydroxylated sample, conrming that the
rehydroxylation procedure indeed allowed creating more silanol
groups at the silica surface (Fig. S2†).
Beneting from a higher surface density of hydroxyl groups,
it was expected that more APTES molecules could be graed.
One the one hand, TGA analyses conrmed the presence of
a larger organic content on the samples that have been rehy-
droxylated (A500
C versus A500B, see Fig. S3†). One other hand,
ATR-FTIR analyses did not allow evidencing a higher intensity
for organic moieties in the sample prepared by Method C as
compared to Method B (not shown).
In theow mode transamination reaction, theTA-A500
C-GA
biocatalysts showed a slightly lower yield (8.4%) as compared to
A500B-GA (Fig. 6). The method still showed a low repeatability
(RSD on the yield was 35% when three diﬀerent monoliths
functionalised by Method C were tested independently). Thus,
although Method C seems to allow increasing the silanol
surface density on the silica monoliths, it did not allow to
increase the eﬃciency of the APTES functionalisation, and the
biocatalytic performance obtained aer subsequent enzyme
graing were not improved either. Moreover, the reproduc-
ibility on thenal yield remained poor.
Controlling water availability (Method D).The presence of
water during silanisation reactions is known to be a critical
parameter. Indeed, a little amount of water is needed to catalyse
the silanisation reaction.
36 Yet, the presence of higher amounts
of water is known to provoke the polymerisation of APTES
molecules leading to a non-uniform APTES distribution that
could explain the variability in the biocatalytic reaction.

Regarding the functionalisation of the silica monoliths, it was
expected that these highly porous solids adsorb water (from
ambient humid air) aer the calcination step. This was identi-
ed as a possible cause for a lack of reproducibility in the
functionalisation step. Also, dried toluene used for APTES
graing could absorb variable water amounts from ambient
humidity, as soon as the bottle was opened. Thus, Method D
was applied as an attempt to strictly control the presence of
water throughout the functionalisation process.
On the one hand, Si(HIPE) monoliths were dried at 120
/C14 C
under vacuum for 24 h in order to remove excess water from the
monolith. Aer cooling under vacuum, functionalisation of the
monolith was applied without further delay. On the second
hand, the APTES functionalisation solution was prepared using
water-saturated toluene as the solvent, so that the water input
was strictly the same for all samples. The preparation was
repeated independently on three diﬀerent silica monoliths.
TGA analyses of samples functionalised with APTES by
Method D conrmed that the organic content was higher than
in the blank sample (which has undergone the same function-
alisation procedure but without APTES; Fig. 8). However, the
organic content did not increase markedly with the APTES
concentration and instead seemed to level oﬀ, suggesting that
the monoliths are saturated, already upon impregnation with
100 mM APTES solution. The organic content was similar as
that obtained with Method C ( /C24 15%). ATR-FTIR analyses
(Fig. 9) showed a slight increase in C– H vibration band absor-
bance with the presence of APTES. Moreover, similar to Method
C, the primary amine scissoring band appeared (at 1570 cm
/C0 1)39
with APTES functionalisation.
Despite relatively low enzyme loading (0.7 mg per monolith
maximum, see Fig. S4 †), the biocatalysts prepared from
monoliths functionalised via Method D showed high perfor-
mance. The yield reached 19% on average with a much
improved repeatability (e.g. RSD on thenal yield was 9.2% for
three diﬀerent TA-A500D-GA monoliths, see Fig. 6). Yields
increased quite linearly with the APTES concentration in the

APTES concentration, the catalytic yield dropped. This trend
was related to the loading of enzyme that is immobilised,
depending on the APTES concentration (Fig. S4†). The loading
also reached a maximum forTA-A500D-GA and then decreased.
From these measurement, it appears interesting to notice that
the enzyme loading was high both for the pristineTA-Si(HIPE)
sample and for theTA-A0
D-GA (i.e. the blank without APTES).
This suggests that the enzyme was immobilized in large
amounts by simple adsorption, but that it was markedly deac-
tivated upon such simple physisorption. Indeed, it is well
documented that enzyme conformation– crucial for catalytic
properties – could be altered during simple adsorption.
12,13 In
contrast, APTES graing is suggested to confer a favourable
environment to preserve enzyme activity (even if the total
loading is lower). Hydrophobic eﬀects brought by APTES gra-
ing have been already highlighted in the literature to help pre-
venting the deformation of the structure.
40
When comparing the yields obtained with monoliths graed
by Method C and D, we observed that Method D allowed
a higher yield asA500C and A500D exhibit respectively 8.4% and
19% yield. Thus, despite similar results in IR and TGA, Method
D provides monoliths with higher biocatalytic activity. This may
be due to a better control on the APTES dispersion throughout
the monolith with Method D. This conrms the crucial role of
water in such silanisation reaction. With this method in hand, it
is possible to obtain macrocellular monoliths, which exhibit
much higher biocatalytic yield, together with a highly improved
repeatability. An APTES concentration of 250 – 500 mM was
identied as the best compromise to ensure that enough
organic moieties are graed and to optimize both the enzyme
loading and the catalytic yield in theow reaction. Table 1
summarizes the main improvements obtained by adapting the
functionalisation method.
Improving the enzyme immobilisation eﬃciency
Eﬀect of temperature.Classically, enzymes are manipulated
in cold conditions to prevent natural deactivation (e.g. due to
residual protease activity).
41 Accordingly, in the present work
enzyme immobilisation was initially carried out at 4 /C14 C.
However, the graing occurred as covalent bonds were created
between the enzyme and the functionalised support, and
therefore, temperature may play an important role. Thus we
have also performed the same immobilisation procedure on the
A250
D monolith at 30/C14 C (sample denotedTA-A250D-GA-30d). In
this case, the catalytic performance multiplied by two, as the
yield reached/C24 30% (Fig. 10).
This result maynd two explanations. First, the kinetics of
the reactions that led to the graing of the enzyme (imine bonds
formation between the lysine and the aldehyde) was probably
enhanced at higher temperature, leading to a more eﬃcient
graing. Indeed, a higher enzyme loading was measured forTA-
A250
D-GA-30d (0.7 mg) as compared to theTA-A250D-GA (0.2
mg). Second, the lower activity obtained aer immobilisation at
4 /C14 C can tentatively be explained by the so-called“cold disso-
ciation” phenomenon.42 Indeed, it is important to note that
transaminases are homo-dimeric enzymes, with the active site
formed only when two monomers assemble (Fig. S5 †).
43
According to Privalov,42 under low temperatures, some multi-
meric enzymes may be dissociated to the monomers. In this
case, a higher proportion of the inactive monomers would have
been immobilized on the monolith instead of the active dimers.
Once two monomers are immobilized on diﬀerent graing
sites, reforming the active dimer is impossible. Moreover, the
immobilisation of monomer could have occurred through the
lysine residue located on the active site, thereby locking the
enzyme with the active site towards the support surface,
blocking the access for the reactants. Thus, it is clear that
enzyme graing should be done at 30
/C14 C instead of 4/C14 C and we
suggest that further optimisation of the graing temperature
could lead to further increase in the performance.
Imines reduction. A slight deactivation was observed over
time: TA-A250D-GA-30d samples exhibited 85% of its initial

activity aer 300 minutes on stream (Fig. 10). This can be an
indication of a progressive deactivation of the immobilized
enzymes or of a slow leaching of the immobilized enzymes from
the monolith surface (yet, experimentally, no enzyme activity
was detected in the outows). In fact, the imine bond formed
during enzyme anchoring (Fig. S6†) can in principle be hydro-
lysed, leading to enzyme detachment. A classical strategy to
avoid such reaction is to reduce the imine to the amine, using
for example sodium cyanoborohydride (NaBH
3CN) as
a reducing agent.11,31,44,45
In a rst attempt (Red1), the reducing agent was injected
right aer the enzyme immobilisation (aer washing). In this
case, a poor activity level was obtained as compared to the
reference experiment without reduction (Fig. S7†). As already
reported for PLP-dependent enzymes,
46,47 deactivation by cya-
noborohydride was suspected. In a control batch reaction, we
indeed observed that NaBH3CN strongly deactivates the trans-
aminases (Fig. S8†). It should be noted that therst step of the
transamination reaction mechanism (Fig. S9†) is the formation
of an imine between the aldehyde group of the cofactor (PLP)
and the essential primary amine of the enzyme active site (from
a lysine residue). The reducing agent could therefore attack the
imine bond, leading to the irreversible formation of a secondary
amine, permanently locking the cofactor into the active site,
and leading to deactivation.
In a second attempt (Red2) the transaminase solution (con-
taining PLP in the buﬀer) was injected through the reactor for
enzyme immobilisation, and then, the PLP was washed prior to
the reduction with NaBH
3CN. By doing so, it was hypothesized
that the locking of PLP into the active site could be minimized.
Before starting the reaction by injecting the reactants together
with PLP, the reducing agent was washed. However, this
procedure also led to poor yield (Fig. S7†). It can be put forward
that PLP remained in the vicinity of the active site, despite the
washing step.
Looking back at the batch experiments (Fig. S8 †), we
observed that the reaction medium could act as a protective
agent for the active site: no deactivation occurred when the
reducing agent was added directly in the reaction medium. One
possible explanation is that the reactants (having a strong
aﬃnity for the active site and being present in relatively high
concentrations, well above theK
M) tend to protect the active
sites simply by keeping them less accessible for the reducing
agent. Thus, in a last attempt to reduce imine bond while
keeping the biocatalysts active (Red3), the reducing agent was
fed to the ow reactor during the ow transamination. This
system showed some activity (Fig. S8†); yet, the yield was still
much lower than for the reference sample (no reduction). Thus,
the negative impact of the reducing agent on the active sites was
still present in this case. In relative terms, however, the reduc-
tion (Red3) could allow to very slightly decrease the deactivation
on stream since the decrease in yield as a function of time was
slightly slower (Fig. 10).
Conclusions
Starting with the proof-of-concept for carrying ow mode
transamination reactions in a silica macrocellular monoliths
loaded with transaminase enzymes, we here identify the
essential parameters which allow reaching high catalytic
performance; (i) functionalisation mode (dry versus wet), (ii)
water availability during the functionalisation process and (iii)
immobilisation temperature. In practice, briey dipping the
monolith in the functionalisation solution followed by aging in
a solvent-saturated atmosphere allowed to obtain a homoge-
neous APTES dispersion throughout the entire monolith
(conrmed by IR and TGA). Total water control during the
process (by using dried monoliths and water-saturated solvent)
allowed to minimize the batch-to-batch variability which aﬀects
enzyme immobilisation and biocatalysts eﬃciency. An attempt
to reduce the imine bond formed upon enzyme immobilisation
with APTES and glutaraldehyde was performed in order to
minimize any putative enzyme leaching. It appeared that
transaminases were irreversibly deactivated by the reducing
agent, which disqualies this strategy. Finally, we highlighted
a strong benecial eﬀect of carrying out the immobilisation at
30
/C14 C instead of 4/C14 C. This immobilisation temperature could
advantageously be optimized in a future study. All in all, the
optimized method presented here allowed to reach a 5-fold
increase in activity for the studied transamination reaction.
