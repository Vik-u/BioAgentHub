Background. There has been significant research on the genetic and environmental factors of congenital heart defects (CHDs),
but few causes of teratogenicity, especially teratogenic mechanisms, can be clearly identified. Metabolomics has a potential
advantage in researching the relationship between external factors and CHD.Objective. To find and identify the urinary
potential biomarkers of pregnancy (including in the second and third trimesters) for fetuses with CHD based on modified
gas chromatograph-mass spectrometer (GC-MS), which could reveal the possibility of high-risk factors for CHD and lay
the foundation for early intervention, treatment, and prevention.Methods. Using a case-control design, we measured the
urinary potential biomarkers of maternal urine metabolomics based on GC-MS in a population-based sample of women whose
infants were diagnosed with CHD (70 case subjects) or were healthy (70 control subjects). SIMCA-P 13.0 software, principal
component analysis (PCA), orthogonal partial least squares-discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA), Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney
test, and logistics regression were used to find significant potential biomarkers.Result. The 3D score graph of the OPLS-DA
showed that the CHD and control groups were fully separated. The fitting parameters were R
2x=0.78 and R2y=0.69, and the
forecast rate was Q2=0.61, indicating a high forecast ability. According to the ranking of VIPs from the OPLS-DA models, we
found 34 potential metabolic markers with a VIP>1, and after two pairwise rank sum tests, we found 20 significant potential
biomarkers,whichwerefurtherusedinmultifactorlogisticregressions. Significantsubstances,including4-hydroxybenzeneacetic
acid (OR=4.74, 95% CI: 1.06-21.06), 5-trimethylsilyloxy-n-valeric acid (OR=15.78, 95% CI: 2.33-106.67), propanedioic acid
(OR=5.37, 95% CI: 1.87-15.45), hydracrylic acid (OR=6.23, 95% CI: 1.07-36.21), and uric acid (OR=5.23, 95% CI: 1.23-22.32),
were associated with CHD. Conclusion. The major potential biomarkers in maternal urine associated with CHD were 4-
hydroxybenzeneacetic acid, 5-trimethylsilyloxy-n-valeric acid, propanedioic acid, hydracrylic acid, and uric acid, respectively.
These results indicated that the short chain fatty acids (SCFAs) and aromatic amino acid metabolism may be relevant with
CHD.

1. Introduction
Congenitalheartdefects(CHDs)arethemostcommontypes
of birth defects (BDs), accounting for nearly one-third of
all BDs [1, 2]. Only 15% of heart defects can be attributed
t oak n o w nc a u s e[ 3 ] .Th ec a u s e so fC H Da r ec o m p l i c a t e d
and include environmental factors, genetic susceptibilities,
and their interactions [4]. However, given the complicated
causes of CHDs, there is little research on how multiple
external influencing factors could induce CHDs in fetuses
or how the pathogenesis of CHD correlates with external
factors. Metabolomics is a new tool that could enlarge the
effects of external environmental factors [5] and, thereby,
indirectly deduce the mechanisms of how external envi-
ronmental factors induce CHDs. Compared to genomics,
whichrequires the disclosure of personal information and is
expensive, metabolomics is lower cost and noninvasive [6].
Metabolomics have been used in the field of obstetrics and
gynecology which may allow physicians to identify possible
associatedetiologies thataffectthemotherduringpregnancy
and lead to associated complications affecting the offspring
[5, 7]. Therefore, metabolomics research is an important
approach for studying some mechanisms of CHD and is a
futuredevelopmental trend [8].
Given the nature of the sample, the purpose of the
experiment, and the chemical and physical properties of the
metabolites, different analysis and identification techniques
wereselected.
Presently, the most commonly used separation meth-
ods include nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), liquid
chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS), gas chroma-
tography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS), etc. [9, 10]. GC-
M Si sam a s ss p e c t r o m e t r yt e c h n o l o g yu s e df o rt h es e p -
aration and identification of volatile substances [11]. It is
complemented by a relatively complete National Institute
of Standards and Technology (NIST) database and high
throughput,sensitivity, selectivity, andresolution capabilities
[12]. Relative to LC-MS, GC-MS has certain advantages in
the identification ofmetabolites [13].Thedifficulties and key
of GC-MS are sample pretreatment and processing. We self-
developed metabolomics methods for sample pretreatment
(patent number: 2012101142462) on the basis of traditional
GC-MS. This method optimizes the impurity removal and
chemical derivatization process, improves the derivatization
efficiency, and protects components that are not stable and
easily volatilize at high temperatures. The GC-MS method
canbeusedtoanalyzeaminoacids,organicacids,fattyacids,
amides,nucleosides, sugars,andothersmallmoleculesatthe
same time, including in particular, semivolatile metabolites
ofSCFAs,suchashydracrylicacid,propanedioicacid,andso
forth[14].
To our knowledge, until now, there has been only one
study that included a comprehensive metabolomic anal-
ysis for the prediction of fetuses with CHD in the first
trimester [15]. It is worth mentioning that it was reported
that the maternal gut microbiota in late pregnancy and
early lactation was stable [16]. However, it is difficult to
findCHDcases in the first trimester using four-dimensional
echocardiographywhichistheonlydiagnosticmethodavail-
able, excludingsome very complicated cases. Inthe findings,
we present the search for potential metabolic biomarkers
during midterm pregnancy (including the second and third
trimesters) based on advanced GC-MS and discuss the
association between CHDs and the mother’s metabolism in
vivo.
2. Materials and Methods
2.1. Patient Recruitment and Sample Collection.This study
wasapprovedbytheEthicsCommitteeofMaternalandChild
Care, Hospital of Hunan Province. Each recruited pregnant
w o ma ns i gn e dawri t t e nco n se n t .
Thepregnantwomenincludedinthestudyhadnohistory
of antibiotic use in the last three months and no history of
abortion, diabetes, gestational diabetes, digestive system dis-
eases, liver and renal disease, thyroid disease, chromosomal
disorders,familyhistory,orpickyeating.Theresearchperiod
was the optimal time for screening for CHD, during gesta-
tional weeks 22-24 and 30-32. The patients were diagnosed
with a CHD fetus by highly professional doctors with four-
dimensional echocardiography. Thecontrols werediagnosed
as normal, and health was confirmed after delivery at the
Maternal and Child CareHospital of HunanProvince.Urine
samples werecollected inclean containers fromboththe last
urination ofthe night andthe firsturination of themorning,
andtheexacttimeofcollectionwasrecorded.Theurinefrom
the night needed to be frozen in the refrigerator. The next
morning,thefirsturination wassenttothetestcenterwithin
twohours,along with theurinefromthe previousnight.The
two urine samples from the same individual were combined
into one sample. Each urine sample was enriched with filter
paper and stored at -80
∘C immediately after collection until
analysis.
2.2. Sample Pretreatment.The samples were pretreated as
described in the research of Xiong X Y [17]. Urine samples
were briefly thawed at room temperature and centrifuged (at
3000 g) for 10 min, and 100𝜇L urine samples (containing
2.5mmol/Lcreatinine) werefirsttreated with 30.0𝜇Lurease
(1.2 U/𝜇L) at 37∘C for 30 min to remove interfering urea
a n dt h e ns p i k e dw i t hh e p t a d e c a n o i ca c i d( 0 . 5m g / m L ,5 0
𝜇L). Proteins, including the added urease, were precipitated
with 800 𝜇L ethanol and removed after 15 min of cen-
trifugation (12000 r/min). Forty microliters of 0.04 mol/L
hydroxylamine hydrochloride and 60 𝜇L of 0.05 mol/L
Ba(OH)
2were added to the deproteinized solution, and the
mixture was then incubated at room temperature for 15-20
min. Subsequently, the mixture solution was evaporated to
dryness, and the compounds in the dried residue were con-
verted into TMS derivatives with 100𝜇Lo fM S T F A / T M C S
(100:1)andanalyzed byGC-MS(ZL201210114246.2).Quality
control (QC) samples, used for monitoring the repeata-
bility and stability of the analytical method, were pre-
pared by mixing all the urine samples and tested 5 times
repeatedly.

2.3. GC-MS Analysis. An Agilent GC-MS system (7890-
5975C)wasusedtoanalyze thederivative samples. Asample
(1 𝜇L) was injected with a split ratio of 20:1 into the GC and
then separated with a fused silica HP-5capillary column (60
m, 0.25 mm inside diameter, 0.25𝜇m thickness of the inner
liquid in the column). The injector temperature was set to
250
∘C. High purity nitrogen was used as a carrier gas at a
constant flow rate of 1.5mL/min. The column temperature
was initially kept at 60
∘Cf o r2m i n ,r a m p e du pt o3 0 0∘Ca t
5.5∘C/min, and then heldfor 10 min. The interphase and ion
sourcetemperatureswere280 ∘Cand230 ∘C,respectively.Ions
were generated by electronic impact (EI) at 70 eV. Masses
wereacquiredfrom50to1000 m/z.Thedrifto fthereten tio n
time of each peak was minimized by locking heptadecanoic
acid at 36.00 min using retention time locking technology
(RTL, Agilent). GC-MS ChemStation software was used for
auto-acquisition of GC total ion chromatograms (TICs) and
fragmentationpatterns.Eachcompoundhadafragmentation
patterncomposedofaseriesofsplitmolecularions;themass
charge ratios and their abundance were compared with a
standardmasschromatogramintheNIST(NationalInstitute
of Standards and Technology) mass spectra library by the
ChemStation software. Peaks with a similarity index greater
than 70% were assigned compound names, and compounds
with a matching rate<70%wereexcluded.
2.4. Statistical Analysis.After GC-MS analysis, each sample
was represented by a GC-MS TIC, and the ion peak areas
of compounds were integrated. The results were expressed
as ratios to the urinary creatinine concentration. Statistical
analysis wasusedforthe comparison ofthemetabolite levels
to determine significant differences between the CHD and
control groups.
Data were exported from the GC-MS ChemStation soft-
ware, including all information regarding the TICs after the
above process, into SIMCA-P 13.0. PCA and OPLS-DA were
used to differentiate the samples. PCA scores are unsuper-
vised as a basis for OPLS-DA which is supervised. R
2and
Q2provideameasureofmodelreliabilityofPCAandOPLS-
DA [18]. The OPLS-DA model was assessed by the intercepts
of R2and Q2in Permutation test to avoid the overfitting.
The criteria for model validity include two conditions: (1)
all Q2values on the permuted data set to the left are lower
than the Q2values on the actual data set to the right and
(2) the regression line (line joining the point of observed
Q2to the centroid of a cluster of permuted Q2values) has
a negative value of intercept on they-axis [19]. Through the
variable importance for the projection (VIP) of the OPLS-
DA model, the potential biomarker was found with VIP>1.
A larger VIP indicated a more important biomarker. The
Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test was used to verify the signifi-
cantdifferenceinpotentialbiomarkersbetweentheCHDand
control groups. Based on the Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test,
logistic wasusedtoscreen the biomarkers with𝛼
in=0.05and
𝛼out=0.1. The two-class criteria of all independent variables
in the logistic model were confirmed through the ROC
curve. P values of<0.05 were considered to be statistically
significant.

3.1. Study Population.A total of 70 patients (CHDs were
diagnosed by 4D color ultrasound) treated at the Ultrasonic
Department, Hunan Provincial Maternal and Child Health
Care Hospital between 2016.7.1 and 2017.7.30 were included.
An additional 70 qualifying normal pregnant women were
randomlyselected.Therewasnostatistical significanceinthe
maternal age, gestational weeks, progestation BMI (kg/m
2),
BMI(kg/m2)atinspectiontime,andincreaseinBMI(kg/m 2)
(P>0.05)(Table1).
Among the 70 patients, there were 27 VSDs (38.57%),10
TOFs (13.73%), 8 aortic abnormalities (11.43%), and so on
(Table 2).
3.2.Screening Potential UrinaryBiomarkers.Beforeanalysis,
some data treatments were made. Firstly, after NIST library
searching and credibility screening, there were 220 metabo-
lites. Secondly, delete the metabolites which are not present
in the 80% of the population. Finally, 130 metabolites were
retained which mainly were organic acid (49%), saccharides
(26%),amino acid (13%),and soon (Figure1).Thirdly, these
metabolites were parametric but not normal. After some
transformations includinglogtransformation, thesedatastill
nottobe normal.
The separation between groups (Figure 2) can be
observed on thePCA3Dscore,andthe modelfitting param-
eter was R
2x=0.57 with a forecast rate of Q2=0.46. Although
somesampleswereoverlappedinthePCAscoreplot,samples
showed separation pattern between groups, indicating that
metabolite profilesoftwo groupswere different.
OPLS-DA modeling yielded two principal components,
and 3D score maps (Figure 3) showed the CHD and control
groups were fully separated. Through a permutation test
repeated200times,Q
2andR2valueswerefoundtobehigher
than their original values, proving suitability and validity of
this model (Figure 4). The fitting parameters were R
2x=0.78
and R2y=0.69, and the forecast rate was Q2=0.61, indicating

fromthe OPLS-DAmodels,we found34potential metabolic
biomarkerswithVIP >1(Table3),whichmainlywereorganic
acid (59%), saccharides (20%), amino acid (9%), and so on
(Figure5).
After the Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test, we found 20
significant potential biomarkers, which are listed in Table 3
(P<0.05). We also listed their diagnostic predictive value
through the ROC curve, which is the two-class standard.
If the value of the potential biomarker was more than the
predictive value, it was judged to be “1.” If it was less than
the predictive value, it was judged to be “0” in the logistic
model. The results of the logistic regression showed that
thesignificantsubstances,including4-hydroxybenzeneacetic
acid (OR=4.74, 95% CI: 1.06-21.06), 5-trimethylsilyloxy-
n-valeric acid (OR=15.78, 95% CI: 2.33-106.67), propane-
dioic acid (OR=5.37, 95% CI: 1.87-15.45), hydracrylic acid
(OR=6.23, 95% CI: 1.07-36.21), and uric acid ( OR=5.23,
95% CI: 1.23-22.32), were associated with CHD (Table 4).
The five compounds were further qualitatively analyzed by
comparingtheirretentiontimeandfragment-ionofthechro-
matogramsbetween theurinesampleandthecorresponding
standards (Figures 6–11; see Supplementary Material). All of
the data support the identification of the five compounds as
4-hydroxybenzeneacetic acid, 5-trimethylsilyloxy-n-valeric
acid, propanedioic acid, hydracrylic acid, and uric acid,
respectively.
4. Discussion
Our study showed that the separation between groups
c o u l db eo b s e r v e du s i n gP C Aa n dO P L S - D Am o d e l i n g .W e
found 34 potential metabolic markers with a VIP>1, and
after two pairwise rank sum tests, we found 20 signifi-
cant potential biomarkers. The significant substances were
4-hydroxybenzeneacetic acid, 5-trimethylsilyloxy-n-valeric
acid, hydracrylic acid, propanedioic acid, and uric acid
after further multifactor logistic regression. This result is
similartotheresearchofBahado-SinghRO,whichconcluded
that abnormal lipid metabolism was a significant feature of
CHD pregnancy [15]. The main meaning and the relative
mechanism ofthese potential makers asfollows.
In our study, 4-hydroxybenzeneacetic acid was higher
i nt h eC H Dg r o u pt h a ni nt h ec o n t r o lg r o u p(OR=4.74,95%
CI: 1.06-21.06). As reported, tyrosine is converted from
phenylalanine under the action of intestinal bacteria [20],
and tyrosine decarboxylation is further converted into 4-
hydroxybenzeneacetic acid [21]. It can be seen that the
increase in 4-hydroxybenzeneacetic acid in the case group
may be due to a disorder of microecological bacteria in
the pregnant mother of the CHD fetus or the increasing of
tyrosine.
5-Trimethylsilyloxy-n-valeric acid from enterogenous
SCFAs was higher in the CHD group than in the con-
trol group (OR=15.78, 95% CI: 2.33-106.67). SCFAs mainly
include acetic acid, propionic acid, butyric acid, pentanoic
acid, and so on [22]. After traveling to the liver through
the bloodstream, SCFAs participate in biotransformation
reactions,suchasoxidation,reduction,hydrolysis,andconju-
gation [23].Thus,all kindsofSCFAsproducealarge amount
of intermediate or terminal metabolites, such as propionic
acid, which produces acrylic acid, beta-hydroxypropionic
acid,malonicacid,propionylglycine,etc.[23,24].Valericacid
produces 5-trimethylsilyloxy-n-valeric acid, valerylglycine,
and so on [23]. Without special dietary conditions, 5-
trimethylsilyloxy-n-valeric acid may be derived primarily
from valeric acid via omega-oxidative metabolism (valeric
acid is similar to the omega-oxidative metabolic pathway
of valproate (VPA) [25]. The excessive concentration of 5-
trimethylsilyloxy-n-valeric acidintheurineofthecasegroup

may indicate valproate metabolic disorders in the pregnant
mother of the CHD fetus. When there are too many SCFAs,
such as valeric acid, CHD can be induced by exerting
physiological effects similar to VPA, such as deacetylase
inhibitors [26, 27], secondary demethylation enhancement
[28],and folicacid antagonists [29].

theCHDgroupthan inthecontrol group( OR=6.23,95%CI:
1.07-36.21), (OR=5.37, 95% CI: 1.87-15.45). Hydracrylic acid
and malonic acid are mainly derived fromintestinal-derived
propionic acid [30]. Propionic acid enters the epithelial
cells of the intestine to provide energy, dehydrogenation
into acrylic acid, addition of water to produce Hydracrylic
acid, and then dehydrogenation, thiolysis reactions into
malonate [31]. In the study, the increase in hydracrylic acid
and propionic acid in the maternal urine of mothers with
CHD fetuses may be caused by too much propionic acid
in the intestinal microecology. Propionic acid, one of the
mostimportant components of SCFAs, isthe major product
of the fermentation of undigested carbohydrates, such as
oligosaccharides, nonstarch polysaccharides, and resistant
starches by Clostridium species IV and XIV [32]. When
there are too much propionic acid, CHD can be induced by
exerting physiological effects similar to VPA. In additional,
this suggests that the CHD group may be associated with an
excess ofClostridium generaIVandXIV inthethick-walled
bacteria inthe intestinal tract.
Uric acid was higher in the CHD case group than in the
normal control group (OR=5.23, 95% CI: 1.23-22.32). Uric

purine metabolism, abnormal energy metabolism, and renal
excretion of uric acid can cause either an increase (hype-
ruricemia) or decrease (hypouricemia) in plasma uric acid
concentration [33]. More studies have shown that metabolic
diseases,suchasobesity ,canaffecttheriskofh yperuricemia.
Changes in intestinal flora may affect purine metabolism
by altering certain body characteristics [33]. Animal exper-
iments have also shown that probiotics can reduce the levels
ofserumuricacidinmice[34],mainlyduetothereductionof
serumendotoxinandtheincreaseofxanthineoxidaseactivity
caused by probiotic treatment, which in turn reduces uric
acid production and decreases serum uric acid levels [35]. It
canbespeculatedthattheoccurrenceofCHDmayberelated
to a disorder in purine metabolism caused by the imbalance
ofintestinalflorainthemother(thespecificmechanismisnot
yet clear).
In our study, the pretreatment technology of GC-MS is
simpler and produces a more accurate result, especially in
semivolatile metabolites from SCFAs, such as hydracrylic
acid, propanedioic acid, etc. In addition, several statistical
methods were combined to seek out potential biomarkers in

our study has some limitations at the same time. First, for

the case-control study, we could not make an inference of
causal association between the significant biomarkers and
CHD but it gave us some clue about the mechanism of
CHD. Second, the samples size is limited; we could not
make subgroup comparison. We will collect more samples
and make subgroup comparison in the next step. Thirdly,
although the model of OPLS-DA was validated, there may
be some overoptimistic view of the separation between
groups.So,thestudywasadiscovery-phaseworthyoffurther
study.
5. Conclusions
In sum, the major potential biomarkers in maternal urine
associated with CHD were 4-hydroxybenzeneacetic acid, 5-
trimethylsilyloxy-n-valeric acid, hydracrylic acid, propane-
dioic acid, and uric acid. The occurrence of CHD was
modestly associated with the preternatural gut microbiota
of pregnant mothers and the metabolism of SCFAs. These
are new directions for CHD research and more energy for
research isneeded.
