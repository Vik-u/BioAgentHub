metabolism for 3-hydroxypropionate 
production

Abstract 
Background With unique physiochemical environments in subcellular organelles, there has been growing interest 
in harnessing yeast organelles for bioproduct synthesis. Among these organelles, the yeast mitochondrion has been 
found to be an attractive compartment for production of terpenoids and branched-chain alcohols, which could be 
credited to the abundant supply of acetyl-CoA, ATP and cofactors. In this study we explored the mitochondrial poten-
tial for production of 3-hydroxypropionate (3-HP) and performed the cofactor engineering and flux control at the 
acetyl-CoA node to maximize 3-HP synthesis.
Results Metabolic modeling suggested that the mitochondrion serves as a more suitable compartment for 3-HP 
synthesis via the malonyl-CoA pathway than the cytosol, due to the opportunity to obtain a higher maximum yield 
and a lower oxygen consumption. With the malonyl-CoA reductase (MCR) targeted into the mitochondria, the 3-HP 
production increased to 0.27 g/L compared with 0.09 g/L with MCR expressed in the cytosol. With enhanced expres-
sion of dissected MCR enzymes, the titer reached to 4.42 g/L, comparable to the highest titer achieved in the cytosol 
so far. Then, the mitochondrial NADPH supply was optimized by overexpressing POS5 and IDP1, which resulted in an 
increase in the 3-HP titer to 5.11 g/L. Furthermore, with induced expression of an ACC1 mutant in the mitochondria, 
the final 3-HP production reached 6.16 g/L in shake flask fermentations. The constructed strain was then evaluated 
in fed-batch fermentations, and produced 71.09 g/L 3-HP with a productivity of 0.71 g/L/h and a yield on glucose of 
0.23 g/g.
Conclusions In this study, the yeast mitochondrion is reported as an attractive compartment for 3-HP production. 
The final 3-HP titer of 71.09 g/L with a productivity of 0.71 g/L/h was achieved in fed-batch fermentations, represent-
ing the highest titer reported for Saccharomyces cerevisiae so far, that demonstrated the potential of recruiting the 
yeast mitochondria for further development of cell factories.

Background
The yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae has been extensively 
engineered for synthesis of biofuels and other non-eth -
anol bioproducts [1, 2]. Most synthetic pathways are 
targeted to the cytosol due to its big volume, high cover -
age of metabolic enzymes and metabolites [3, 4]. Recent 
studies have revealed that the yeast mitochondrion could 
be attractive to produce terpenoids, fumarate, ornithine, 
and branched-chain alcohols [5–7]. With the mevalonate 
pathway and sequential synthetic genes targeted into the 
mitochondria, researchers have greatly improved the 
titers of isoprene, patchoulol, valencene, amorphadiene, 
linalool and santalene [8–12]. Moreover, mitochondrial 
compartmentalization of the 2-ketoacid elongation path -
way has obtained 1.24  g/L isopentanol, the highest titer 
reported in yeast [13]. Therefore, there has been growing 
interest in exploring the potential of mitochondrial com -
partmentalization of synthetic pathways.
The improved production of subcellular compartmen -
tation may be ascribed to physical separation, which 
concentrates overexpressed enzymes and substrates in a 
smaller volume to reduce the amount of the byproducts 
or the toxicity of some intermediate metabolites. Spe -
cially for mitochondrial compartmentation, there are 
more acetyl-CoA, ATP and NADH available compared 
with the cytosol. Furthermore, the mitochondrial matrix 
has a higher pH and redox potential than the cytosol, and 
this environment could be more suitable for bacterial 
enzymes [14]. Taking together, the mitochondrial com -
partment could be a promising alternative for production 
of 3-hydroxypropionate (3-HP), which could be synthe -
sized from acetyl-CoA via the malonyl-CoA pathway 
catalyzed by acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC) and a bacte -
rial enzyme malonyl-CoA reductase (MCR). 3-HP serves 
as a promising platform chemical to produce various 
C3-based chemicals, including acrylic acid and its deriva-
tives, which are wildly used in the fields of plastics, phar -
maceuticals and agriculture. Extensive studies of 3-HP 
bioproduction have been performed [15–17].
Previous studies on the malonyl-CoA pathway have 
been performed in yeast cytosol and revealed several 
crucial factors for 3-HP synthesis, including efficient 
supply of acetyl-CoA and malonyl-CoA, balanced sup -
ply of redox cofactor NADPH, and improved activities 
of MCR enzymes [18– 20]. The native cytosolic acetyl-
CoA synthesis is highly ATP demanding, and engi -
neering efforts on acetyl-CoA biosynthetic pathways 
have been performed and enhanced 3-HP production 
by up to fivefold [21, 22]. Cytosolic malonyl-CoA is 
mainly involved in fatty acid synthesis, which is regu -
lated stringently at multiple levels. The acetyl-CoA car -
boxylase Acc1 functions as one of the important nodes 
in fatty acid metabolism and is stringently regulated 
transcriptionally and post-translationally [23, 24]. 
With malonyl-CoA biosensor established in yeast, it 
has been found that overexpression, dynamic control 
and mutagenesis of dephosphorylation sites of Acc1 
can direct more malonyl-CoA to 3-HP synthesis rather 
than fatty acid synthesis [25– 27]. Combined with these 
strategies for enhanced precursor supply, engineering 
redox metabolism for optimized NADPH supply fur -
ther improves 3-HP production [20– 22]. Moreover, it 
has been reported that MCR engineering with domain 
dissection and balanced expression of the two dis -
sected parts can significantly improve 3-HP production 
from 0.107 to 3.72 g/L in E. coli [ 28, 29]. With the dis -
sected enzymes expressed in yeast cytosol, a significant 
improvement of 3-HP production is also achieved from 
0.6 to 2.4 g/L, suggesting MCR as another limiting fac -
tor for 3-HP [18].
Compared with cytosolic precursor supply, the mito -
chondrial acetyl-CoA derived from pyruvate dehydro -
genase (PDH) is used as fuel of the TCA cycle and is 
reported to be 10 times more concentrated than its cyto -
solic counterpart, which renders the mitochondria great 
potential for 3-HP synthesis. Mitochondrial acetyl-CoA 
can be converted to malonyl-CoA by Hfa1 [30, 31]. This 
mitochondrial isoform Hfa1 shares 72% sequence simi -
larity with Acc1, and is essential for synthesis of mito -
chondrial fatty acids, especially lipoic acid cofactor [30]. 
Its initiation regulation is reported to be translated from 
non-canonical initial site with a mitochondrial targeting 
sequence at its N terminal [32]. So far, it remains unclear 
whether Hfa1 contains any regulation sites, and it would 
be interesting to investigate its effects on the synthesis of 
malonyl-CoA derived bioproduct.
While the cytosolic NADPH is mainly derived from the 
reactions catalyzed by glucose-6-phosphate dehydroge -
nase Zwf1, acetaldehyde dehydrogenase Ald6 and isoci -
trate dehydrogenase Idp2, the mitochondrial NADPH 
is relying on the reactions catalyzed by  NAD+/NADH 
kinase Pos5 and  NADP+ dependent enzymes, includ -
ing acetaldehyde dehydrogenases Ald4 and Ald5, isoci -
trate dehydrogenase Idp1, and malic enzyme Mae1 [33, 
34]. Pos5 is considered as the main source of mitochon -
drial NADPH and possesses higher NADH kinase activ -
ity than NAD kinase activity [35, 36], suggesting active 
NADPH synthesis from NADH with ATP consumed, 
both of which are abundant in the mitochondriona. Tak -
ing together, the yeast mitochondrion seems to be a suit -
able subcellular compartment for 3-HP production.
Here we explored yeast mitochondrion for its potential 
in 3-HP production via the malonyl-CoA pathway. Engi -
neering efforts were performed to enhance both malonyl-
CoA and NADPH supply (Fig.  1). The work presented 
here gains a better understanding for harnessing the

yeast mitochondrion for synthesis of acetyl-CoA derived 
biochemicals, especially those with NADPH as a cofactor.
Materials and methods
Construction of plasmids and strains
The E. coli DH5α strain was used for plasmid construc -
tion. The yeast strain CEN.PK 113-5D was used as the 
background strain. Genetic manipulations, including 
gene integration, knockout and promoter replacement, 
were performed using the GTR-CRISPR system [37]. 
Plasmids used in the study were constructed with Golden 
Gate methods if not specified [38]. The strains and plas -
mids used and constructed were listed in Additional 
file 1.
The intact MCR  from Chloroflexus aurantiacus was 
cloned in pMCR1, while its dissected parts of MCR-N  
and MCR-C were cloned in pMCR2 in a previous study 
for mitochondrial localization [39]. The plasmid pMCR-
mC was constructed to introduce the mutations N940V, 
K1106W, and S1114R into MCR-C by assembling 3 frag -
ments amplified with primers MP1–4 from pMCR2 [39] 
into the vector pUGG1. The plasmid pMCR3 was con -
structed by assembling the fragments of MCR-N  ampli-
fied with primers MP5&6 and MCR-mC amplified with 
primers MP7&8 into pUGG1. The plasmid pPOS5 was 
constructed to overexpress POS5 under the control of 
TDH3 promoter. The TDH3p fragment amplified with 
primers MP9&10 and the fragment containing POS5 and 
its terminator amplified with primers MP11&12 using 
yeast genomic DNA as the template were assembled 
into pUGG1. The plasmid pALD4 was constructed to 
overexpress ALD4 under the control of PGK1 promoter. 
The PGK1p fragment amplified with primers MP13&14 
and the fragment containing ALD4 and its terminator 
amplified with primers MP15&16 were assembled into 
pUGG1. The plasmid pIDP1 was constructed to over -
express IDP1 under the control of TEF1 promoter. The 
TEF1p fragment amplified with primers MP17&18 and 
the fragment containing IDP1 its terminator amplified 
with primers MP19&20 were assembled into pUGG1. 
The plasmid pMaeA* was constructed to overexpress 
MaeA* from E. coli under the TEF1 promoter. The frag -
ments containing TEF1p and the mitochondrial tag 
CoxIVm were amplified from pSSB02 [40] with primers 
MP21–24. The mutated MaeA fragments were ampli -
fied with primers MP25–28 from the E. coli genomic 
DNA. The ADH1t fragment was amplified with primers 
MP29&30 from yeast genomic DNA. Then, these frag -
ments were assembled into pUGG1.
Mitochondrial overexpression of ACC1  was achieved 
using different promoters of varied strength and types, 
including TEF1p, CYC1p, CUP1p and GAL1p. The frag -
ments containing ACC1 S659A, S1157A  were amplified from 
pCfB376 [27] with primers MP31–35 and MP29. The

fragments containing TEF1p and CoxIV m were ampli -
fied from pSSB02 with primers MP21–24. Then, the 
two fragments were assembled into pUGG1 to generate 
pACC1**_TEF1p. Then, ACC1S659A, S1157A was mutated to 
the wild-type ACC1 by assembling two fragments ampli -
fied with primers MP36&37 and MP38&39, generating 
pACC1_TEF1p. Based on pACC1_TEF1p, TEF1p was 
replaced to CYC1p by assembling the fragment amplified 
with primers MP40–43 using the NEBuilder assembly 
to generate pACC1_CYC1p. Based on pACC1**_TEF1p, 
TEF1p and 2μ ori were replaced to CUP1pI and CEN4/6, 
respectively, by assembling the fragments amplified with 
primers MP44–51 using the NEBuilder assembly to gen -
erate pACC1**_CUP1p. Based on pACC1_TEF1p and 
pACC1**_TEF1p, TEF1p was replaced to GAL1p using 
NEBuilder assembly to generate pACC1_GAL1p and 
pACC1**_GAL1p. Based on pACC1**_CUP1p, CUP1p 
was replaced to GAL1p using the NEBuilder assembly to 
generate pACC1**_GAL1p_CEN.
For genome integration, reported integrative sites 
were used, including XI-3, X-4 and Int14 [41–43]. 
Intact MCR was integrated at XI-3 using pCas9_XI-3.3 
and donor DNA amplified from pMCR1 with primers 
MP54&55. Dissected MCR was integrated at XI-3 site 
using pCas9_XI-3.3 and donor DNA fragments ampli -
fied from pMCR2 or pMCR3 with primers MP55&56. 
MCR-N and MCR-mC were integrated at X-4 and Int14 
with donor DNA fragments amplified with MP57&58, 
and MP60&61, respectively. Moreover, several native 
promoters were replaced with strong constitutive pro -
moters to enhance their expression. POS5p was replaced 
to TDH3p using pCas9_POS5p and donor DNA ampli -
fied with MP63&64. IDP1p was replaced to TEF1p using 
pCas9_IDP1p and donor DNA amplified with MP66&67. 
MAE1p was replaced to TDH3p using pCas9_MAE1p 
and donor DNA amplified with MP69&70. HFA1p was 
replaced to TEF1p using pCas9_HFA1p and donor DNA 
amplified with MP72&73. Meanwhile, IDH1 was deleted 
using pCas9_idh1 and donor DNA amplified with prim -
ers MP75&76. IDH2 was deleted using pCas9_idh2 and 
donor DNA amplified with primers MP78&79. CIT1 was 
deleted using pCas9_cit1 and donor DNA amplified with 
primers MP81&82. GAL80 was deleted using pCas9_
gal80 and donor DNA amplified with primers MP85&86.
Media and cultivation condition
E. coli strains were cultivated in LB medium supple -
mented with 80  mg/L ampicillin when needed. Yeast 
strains were cultivated in YPD medium, or SC-URA 
medium to maintain URA3-marked plasmids, as previ -
ously described in [44]. Fermentation medium for 3-HP 
production in shake flasks was composed of 7.5  g/L 
 (NH4)2SO4, 14.4  g/L  KH2PO4, 0.5  g/L  MgSO4·7H2O, 
20 g/L glucose, trace metal solution and vitamin solution 
as described in [45] and 40 mg/L uracil was added when 
needed. For induction for the CUP1 promoter, 300  μM 
 CuSO4 was supplemented at 24  h during the fermenta -
tion. For all shake flask experiments, 20 mL cultures were 
cultivated in 100 mL shake flasks with the initial  OD600 of 
0.1 at 30 °C and 200 rpm.
For fed-batch cultivations in 5  L bioreactors, the 
medium was composed of 5  g/L  (NH4)2SO4, 3  g/L 
 KH2PO4, 0.5  g/L  MgSO4·7H2O, 20  g/L glucose, as well 
as the trace metal solution and vitamin solution as 
described in [45]. The seed was pre-cultured using the 
same medium in the 500 mL shake flasks, and then inoc -
ulated into the bioreactors with 2 L medium with the ini -
tial  OD600 of 0.4. During the fermentation, the dissolved 
oxygen (DO) concentration was controlled above 15% by 
adjusting the stirring speed within 200–700 rpm and aer -
ation with 0.5–1 vvm. pH was controlled at 5.0 by feeding 
 NH3·H2O, and the temperature was controlled at 30 °C. 
The feed medium was added when glucose was almost 
exhausted, composing 5.6  g/L  K2SO4, 15  g/L  KH2PO4, 
2.8 g/L  MgSO4·7H2O, 700 g/L glucose, trace metal solu -
tion (7 ×) and vitamins solution (7 ×), and the feed rates 
were continuously adjusted to remain low glucose resi -
due and ethanol residue in the culture.
Measurement of biomass and extracellular metabolites
The optical density was measured at 600  nm  OD600 by 
GENESYS 30 Visible Spectrophotometer (Thermo Elec -
tron Scientific, Madison, USA).
Extracellular metabolites analysis was performed using 
the HPLC (Shimadzu LC-20AT, Japan) equipped with 
RID detector and PDA detector using Aminex HPX-87H 
column (Bio-Rad). The culture samples were centrifuged, 
and the supernatant was filtered by 0.22  μm membrane 
and stored in − 20 °C until analysis. The eluent of 0.5 mM 
 H2SO4 was used at a flow rate of 0.5  mL/min with the 
column temperature of 65 °C for the measurement of glu-
cose, ethanol and 3-HP . Glucose, ethanol and 3-HP were 
quantified using LabSolution Software (Shimadzu).
Flux balance analysis
The maximum theoretical 3-HP yields with the malonyl-
CoA pathway expressed in the cytosol and mitochondria 
were calculated using flux balance analysis (FBA) [46] 
with the yeast genome-scale metabolic model Yeast8 
[47], which was correspondingly modified by adding the 
malonyl-CoA pathway in the cytosol and mitochondria. 
The glucose uptake rate was fixed at 1 mmol/g DCW/h 
and the 3-HP secretion rate was maximized, and the 
simulated flux distribution can be then used to determine 
the active reactions, i.e., those whose flux is non-zero. 
The simulations were performed in MATLAB using the 
Page 5 of 11
Zhang et al. Biotechnology for Biofuels and Bioproducts           (2023) 16:64 
 
Cobra toolbox v.3.0 [48], and the simulated flux distribu -
tions were then used to calculate the maximum theoreti -
cal yields.
Results and discussion
Mitochondrial localization of MCR enhanced 3‑HP 
synthesis
Flux balance analysis was performed based on the 
genome scale metabolic model of S. cerevisiae Yeast8 
[47], to calculate the maximum theoretical yields of 
3-HP for cytosolic and mitochondrial synthesis. A theo -
retical 3-HP yield of 1.71 mol/mol glucose was obtained 
with the oxygen requirement of 0.88  mol/mol glucose 
for mitochondrial synthesis, compared with those of 
1.62  mol 3-HP/mol glucose and 1.15  mol  O2/mol glu -
cose for cytosolic synthesis (Additional file  2). The higher 
theoretical yield and lower oxygen requirement could 
be credited to the rich acetyl-CoA and ATP source in 
the mitochondria, as cytosolic acetyl-CoA synthesis was 
highly ATP demanding, rendering mitochondrial synthe-
sis great potentials for future engineering in both basic 
and applied research.
In our previous research, we noticed that when the 
mitochondrial MCR was expressed in an episomal plas -
mid, the 3-HP titer reached 0.27  g/L  [39], compared 
to the titer of 0.09  g/L when the cytosolic MCR was 
expressed  [21], suggesting the yeast mitochondrion as 
an attractive subcellular compartment for 3-HP syn -
thesis. With mitochondrial CaMCR integrated into 
the XI-3 site of the chromosome, the strain mMCR1 
produced 0.11  g/L 3-HP , suggesting that CaMCR activ -
ity was crucial for 3-HP production. Therefore, dissected 
forms of CaMCR with higher enzymatic activities were 
then expressed in the mitochondria, including MCR-
N&MCR-C, and MCR-N&MCR-mC with amino acid 
mutations. With the dissected genes integrated at XI-3 
site, the constructed strains NC1 and NmC1 produced 
3-HP at the titers of 0.43  g/L and 1.29  g/L, respectively 
(Fig.  2A). After a 2nd round integration of MCR-N & 
MCR-mC at the X-4 site in NmC1, the titer of the con -
structed strain NmC2 increased to 3.64  g/L, with its 
70.6% accumulated during the ethanol phase, when the 
repressed mitochondrial activities were relieved. These 
results suggested that glucose derepression under glu -
cose depletion conditions [49], contributed greatly to 
3-HP synthesis in the presence of increased MCR activi -
ties. It also revealed that the MCR activity was a limiting 
factor for the mitochondrial 3-HP synthesis.
A previous study in E. coli showed that functional 
balance between MCR-N and MCR-mC could greatly 
enhance 3-HP synthesis by expressing three copies of 
MCR-N with chromosomal integration and MCR-mC 
in a high copy number plasmid. We then investigated 
whether altering the expression of MCR-N and MCR-mC 
could benefit 3-HP production in yeast mitochondria. 
However, neither of the constructed strains exhibited 
significant improvements in cell growth or 3-HP produc -
tion (Fig.  2B), suggesting that the current expression of 
MCR-N and MCR-mC might be well-balanced (Addi -
tional file  3: Fig. S1). With a third integration of MCR-N

and MCR-mC at the Int14 site of NmC2, the constructed 
strain NmC3 reached a titer of 4.42  g/L at 60  h, which 
was comparable with the highest titer achieved with the 
production in the yeast cytosol with a substantially engi -
neered yeast chassis [18].
Mitochondrial redox factor engineering for sufficient 
NADPH regeneration
Mitochondrial NADPH is generated from NADH by 
Pos5, whereas re-generation of NADPH from  NADP+ 
is carried out by  NADP+-dependent dehydrogenases 
including Ald4, Idp1 and Mae1 [33, 50, 51]. These 
enzymes were overexpressed under strong promoters 
to increase the availability of mitochondrial NADPH for 
3-HP biosynthesis.
Indeed, when the plasmid pPOS5 for POS5 overexpres-
sion was transformed into the strain NmC2, the 3-HP 
titer increased by 23.4%, while the biomass decreased 
by 13.6% (Fig.  3A). Yet, when ALD4 was overexpressed 
in a high copy plasmid pALD4 into NmC2, no signifi -
cant improvements were observed in 3-HP synthesis and 
cell growth. Similarly, when MAE1 was overexpressed 
in NmC2 with its native promoter switched to a strong 
promoter TDH3p, 3-HP titer decreased from 3.42 to 
2.56  g/L, which might be resulted from the decrease in 
cell growth. Nevertheless, with the native promoter 
replaced with a strong promoter TEF1p, IDP1 over -
expression in the strain NmC2 resulted in an increase 
in 3-HP production to 3.90  g/L, as well as a moderate 
improvement in cell growth. It has been reported that 
these dehydrogenases were transcriptionally regulated, 
and the varied effects of their overexpression on cell 
growth and 3-HP synthesis suggested that there might be 
other regulatory mechanisms involved in their activities.
With co-overexpression of POS5 and IDP1 in NmC2, 
the 3-HP titer of the constructed strain N2IP increased 
to 4.55  g/L, which was 33% higher than that of the 
strain NmC2. These results revealed that two routes for 
NADPH regeneration from NADH or  NADP+ could syn-
ergistically boost 3-HP titer, with the one from NADH 
catalyzed by Pos5 as the main contributor. Then, both 
IDP1 and POS5 were overexpressed under strong pro -
moters in the strain NmC3, generating the strain N3IP , 
with 3-HP titer increasing from 4.42 to 5.11 g/L (Fig. 3B).
However, overexpression of the native MAE1 sig -
nificantly slowed down cell growth and reduced 3-HP 
titer (Fig.  3A). To test whether the adverse result of 
MAE1  overexpression for 3-HP production is caused by 
its cofactor preference of  NAD+ over  NADP+, a mutated 
malic enzyme MaeA* that prefers  NADP+ as the cofac -
tor [52], was expressed in the mitochondria of the strain 
N3IP  pMaeA*. Yet, the cell biomass and 3-HP titer still 
reduced by 17% and 20% (Fig. 3B), respectively. The nega-
tive effect on cell growth of malic enzyme overexpression 
might be that it drained TCA cycle intermediates and 
slowed down the operation of the TCA cycle, which pro -
vided essential energy for cell growth and maintenance.
Limited flux of TCA cycle resulted in acetate overflow 
and impaired growth
Mitochondrial acetyl-CoA is dedicated to fuel the TCA 
cycle to provide energy for cell growth and maintenance. 
To redirect acetyl-CoA to 3-HP synthesis, attempts were 
made to limit the TCA cycle flux. The first reaction of the

TCA cycle catalyzed by citrate synthase Cit1 is consid -
ered as the rate limiting step. Therefore, we first down -
regulated CIT1 transcription by transforming a plasmid 
harboring dCas9 protein and two gRNAs targeting the 
CIT1 promoter. However, CIT1 downregulation resulted 
in a decrease in 3-HP titer from 3.75 to 3.11 g/L (Fig. 4A). 
When CIT1 was deleted in the strain N3IP , the mutant 
showed significantly reduced growth and 3-HP pro -
duction. The final biomass and 3-HP production were 
56.0% and 24.4% of those in the strain N3IP , respectively. 
Meanwhile, acetate was accumulated during the cultiva -
tion of the mutant, which reached to 4.8 g/L (Additional 
file 3: Fig. S2). These results suggested that the disrupted 
TCA cycle resulted in acetate overflow, probably due to 
insufficient ATP production. The flux between 3-HP 
synthesis and the TCA cycle is, therefore, needed to be 
well-balanced.
Then another key enzyme of the TCA cycle, isocitrate 
dehydrogenase, that catalyzes the oxidation of isocitrate 
to alpha-ketoglutarate, was engineered to limit the TCA 
flux. Mitochondria contain both  NAD+-dependent and 
 NADPH+-dependent isozymes encoded by IDH1/2 and 
IDP1, respectively. These two isozymes are regulated 
independently as they played different roles [53, 54], and 
both of them could tune the mitochondrial TCA activity 
[55, 56]. When the strain NmC2 was transformed with 
a plasmid harboring the dCas9 protein and gRNAs tar -
geting IDH1 and IDH2 promoters, the mutant exhibited 
impaired cell growth with 3-HP production decreased by 
20.7% and 20.1%, respectively (Fig.  4B). Similarly, in the 
strain NmC2 with IDP1 overexpressed IDH1 and IDH2 
deletion also decreased 3-HP production by 21.1%, and 
16.2%, respectively (Fig.  4B). Meanwhile, a bigger bio -
mass decrease observed in a CIT1 deletion strain may 
have resulted from acetate overflow, which accumu -
lated to 1.65 g/L in the culture. In the strain NmC2 with 
IDP1 and POS5 overexpressed, IDH1 and IDH2 deletion 
resulted in decreases in 3-HP titer by 21.1%, and 17.9%, 
respectively, yet no decreases in cell growth (Fig.  4B). 
Although IDH1/2 downregulation and deletion resulted 
in impaired cell growth in the two strains, their deletion 
did not cause significant growth reduction in the strain 
with IDP1 and POS5 overexpression, probably because 
NADPH supply might still be the key factor for cell 
growth and 3-HP production in these strains.
Fine‑tuned acetyl‑CoA carboxylase expression provided 
sufficient malonyl‑CoA
Besides sufficient acetyl-CoA supply, sufficient malonyl-
CoA supply is required for production of malonyl-CoA 
derived product, including cytosolic fatty acids and 3-HP 
expression [22, 27], as ACC1  was stringently regulated 
in different levels. The regulation of the mitochondrial 
acetyl-CoA carboxylase Hfa1 has not been investigated 
in detail, and its impact on mitochondrial 3-HP produc -
tion needs to be investigated. As shown in Fig.  5A, HFA1 
overexpression in the strains mMCR1, NC1 and NmC1 
boosted 3-HP production by 2.65-fold, 1.63-fold, and 
1.79-fold, respectively. These results revealed that HFA1 
overexpression greatly improved 3-HP synthesis during 
the ethanol growth phase (after 24  h). Yet, when HFA1 
was overexpressed in the strain NmC2, it could not sig -
nificantly improve the 3-HP titer. The results indicated 
that HFA1 might also be regulated to maintain the home-
ostasis of mitochondrial malonyl-CoA.
We, therefore, overexpressed ACC1  in the mitochon -
dria under the control of strong and weak promoters 
using TEF1p and CYC1p, respectively. Yet, impaired

3-HP synthesis was observed in both strains, with 
the overexpression under the strong promoter gave 
even lower titers compared with expression under the 
weak promoter (Fig.  5B), suggesting that ACC1  over -
expression might impose great burden, or it may also 
be regulated post-translationally in the mitochondria. 
Therefore, we overexpressed an Acc1 mutant ACC1**  
abolishing posttranslational regulations, yet the con -
structed strain exhibited similar production as the 
strain with ACC1  overexpression but with impaired 
cell growth (Fig.  5B). Meanwhile, it was also observed 
that the strain with ACC1 ** overexpressed under 
TEF1p grew much slower, and the final 3-HP titer was 
achieved at 96 h compared with 60 h for other strains 
(Additional file 3 : Fig. S3).
To release burden during early cell growth phase, 
ACC1** was then overexpressed in the mitochon -
dria under the control of induced promoters CUP1p  
and Gal1p, respectively. In the strain N3IP , induced 
ACC1** expression with 300 μM  Cu2+ supplemented at 
24 h improved 3-HP titer from 5.01 to 5.50 g/L, while 
decreased 3-HP titer to 4.31  g/L without  Cu2+ sup -
plemented (Fig.  5C). The reduced biomass and 3-HP 
synthesis without  Cu2+ supplemented at 24 h might be

resulted from a basal expression as the medium con -
tains 6  μM  Cu2+ as a trace element. With the GAL1  
promoter and 20 g/L galactose supplemented at 24 h, 
ACC1** overexpression in the strains NmC2 and N3IP 
improved 3-HP titer by 28.7% and 10.3%, respectively, 
while ACC1 overexpression failed to improve 3-HP 
synthesis (Fig.  5D). Then, GAL80 was deleted in N3IP 
strain to release glucose regulation on the GAL1 pro -
moter [57]. In the constructed strain N3IP_2, the 3-HP 
titer increased by 18.6% to the final titer of 6.16  g/L 
(Fig.  5E), suggesting that fine-tuned ACC1 * overex -
pression could coordinate malonyl-CoA requirements 
for cell growth and 3-HP synthesis, which thereof ben -
efited 3-HP production in the mitochondria.
To further evaluate 3-HP production of the con -
structed strain, fed-batch cultivations were performed 
in 5  L bioreactors. To sustain the derepressed mito -
chondrial activity, continuous feeding was controlled 
under glucose limited conditions after 11 h, when glu -
cose was almost exhausted (Fig.  6). The final 3-HP titer 
of 71.09  g/L was achieved at 100  h when the biomass 
reached 71.6  g/L, which was higher than the reported 
titer achieved through cytosol-based production so far. 
The 3-HP productivity reached 0.71  g/L/h, indicating 
its potential applications in industrial production. As 
shown in Additional file  3: Table  S1, the titer and the 
productivity of N3IP_2 represented the highest values 
reported in S. cerevisiae via the malonyl-CoA path -
way, suggesting that the yeast mitochondrion could be 
a suitable subcellular compartment for 3-HP produc -
tion Yet, the yields on glucose of the strain N3IP_2 were 
0.31  g/g and 0.23  g/g in the shake flask and fed-batch 
fermentation, respectively, compared with the maxi -
mum theoretical yield of 0.86  g/g. During the fed-
batch cultivations, we observed that the 3-HP yield on 
glucose could reach as high as 0.40  g/g  according to 
3-HP production versus glucose consumption, sug -
gesting that better feeding might improve 3-HP yields. 
Moreover, the yields could be further improved with 
better-tuned mitochondrial metabolism. As observed 
in this study, the flux distribution among the TCA 
cycle and 3-HP synthesis might require further inves -
tigation to balanced minimal growth requirements and 
maximum 3-HP production. In addition, it would be 
interesting to explore potential transporters involved 
in 3-HP transportation across the mitochondrial mem -
branes and cytomembranes, as efficient transportation 
might relieve product inhibition and facilitate product 
synthesis.
Conclusions
Metabolic modeling revealed that the malonyl-CoA path-
way targeted into the mitochondria could synthesize 
3-HP with a higher yield and a lower oxygen consump -
tion. Overexpression of the mitochondrial MCR enzymes 
obtained the comparable 3-HP titer and yield with the 
highest level reported in the cytosol, indicating great 
potentials in harnessing the mitochondrial for 3-HP pro -
duction. With further engineering on the mitochondrial 
NADPH metabolism and flux control at the acetyl-CoA 
node, the constructed strain obtained increased 3-HP 
titer by 39.4% in shake flask fermentations, and a final 
3-HP titer of 71.06 g/L with a productivity of 0.71 g/L/h 
in fed-batch fermentations, the highest levels reported in 
S. cerevisiae so far. The high 3-HP productivity could be 
greatly credited for the controlled glucose limited condi -
tions during the process, as the derepressed mitochon -
drial activities not only provide sufficient acetyl-CoA and 
cofactor but also finely tune flux toward malonyl-CoA for 
3-HP synthesis.
