poly(3HB-co-3HP) fermentation by engineered
Shimwellia blattae from glycerol
Shunsuke Sato1, Björn Andreeßen1 and Alexander Steinbüchel1,2*
Abstract
Poly(3-hydroxybytyrate- co-3-hydroxypropionate), poly(3HB- co-3HP), is a possible alternative to synthetic
polymers such as polypropylene, polystyrene and polyethylene due to its low crystallinity and fragility. We
already reported that recombinant strains of Shimwellia blattae expressing 1,3-propanediol dehydrogenase
DhaT as well as aldehyde dehydrogenase AldD of Pseudomonas putida KT2442, propionate-CoA transferase Pct
of Clostridium propionicum X2 and PHA synthase PhaC1 of Ralstonia eutropha H16 are able to accumulate up
to 14.5% (wtPHA/wtCDW) of poly(3-hydroxypropionate), poly(3HP), homopolymer from glycerol as a sole carbon source
(Appl Microbiol Biotechnol 98:7409-7422, 2014a). However, the cell density was rather low. In this study, we optimized
the medium aiming at a more efficient PHA synthesis, and we engineered a S. blattae strain accumulating
poly(3HB- co-3HP) with varying contents of the constituent 3-hydroxypropionate (3HP) depending on the
cultivation conditions. Consequently, 7.12, 0.77 and 0.32 g PHA/L of poly(3HB-co-3HP) containing 2.1, 8.3 and
18.1 mol% 3HP under anaerobic/aerobic (the first 24 hou rs under anaerobic condit ion, thereafter, aerobic
condition), low aeration/agitation (the minimum stirring rate required in medium mixing and small amount of aeration)
and anaerobic conditions (the minimum stirring rate required in medium mixing without aeration), respectively, were
synthesized from glycerol by the genetically modifiedS. blattaeATCC33430 strains in optimized culture medium.

Introduction
Polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHA) are polyesters synthesized
by a wide range of microorganisms (Anderson et al.,
1990). Most of PHA are produced from renewable
resources like sugars, plant oils, glycerol, and carbon diox-
ide (CO2). As these polyesters are biodegradable, they
have been expected to play an important role in environ-
mental protection and in reduction of CO2 emissions, a
cause of global warming (Steinbüchel and Füchtenbusch,
1998). There have been many attempts to investigate
industrial production of such polymers to ascertain if they
are environmently friendly or biocompatible materials (Lee,
1996; Steinbüchel, 2001). In nature, poly(3-hydroxybuty-
rate), poly(3HB), a homopolymer of (R)-3-hydroxybutyric
acid (3HB), is the most abundant PHA. However, because
poly(3HB) is highly crystalline, hard and brittle, its practical
applications are limited. Many studies have been under-
taken to improve these properties. For example, among
other PHA, poly(3-hydroxybutyrate-co-3-hydroxyvalerate),
poly(3HB-co-3HV), poly(3-hydroxybutyrate-co-3-hydroxy-
hexanoate), poly(3HB-co-3HH), and poly(3-hydroxybuty-
rate-co-3-hydroxypropionate), poly(3HB-co-3HP) are much
more flexible and less crystalline than poly(3HB)
(Andreeßen et al., 2014b; Chen et al., 2000; Doi et al.,
1995; Shimamura et al., 1993; Shimamura et al.,
1994). The flexibility depends on the ratio of the con-
stituents in the copolymer. Therefore, these copoly-
mers are accordingly expected to have a broader range
of applications in packaging, agriculture and medical
materials (Chen et al., 2000). Among these copolymers,
poly(3HB-co-3HP) is considered to be very promising
due to its benefiting material properties (Andreeßen
and Steinbüchel, 2010).

The global glycerol production has increased rapidly
during the last decade due to the increase of biodiesel
production. Concomitant with the conversion of about
10 million tons of vegetable oil into biofuel, about 1 mil-
lion tons of glycerol were produced as a by-product in
2011 (Quispe et al. 2013). Therefore, the aim of this
study was the development of strains for poly(3HB-co-
3HP) synthesis from glycerol as sole carbon source.
Some processes for synthesis of poly(3HB- co-3HP)
have already been reported by Shimamura et al., 1994,
Fukui et al., 2009, Wang and Inoue, 2001 and Wang
et al., 2013. However, in these studies the use of expen-
sive 3HP as precursor of 3HP-CoA (Shimamura et al.,
1994; Wang and Inoue, 2001), insufficient 3HP contents
to reduce the crystallinity (Fukui et al., 2009) and the
requirement of high cost vitamin B12 are major draw-
backs (Wang and Inoue, 2001; Wang et al., 2013).
Vitamin B12 is a cofactor of the glycerol dehydratase
(Martens et al., 2002), which converts glycerol to 3-
hyrdoxypropionaldehyde (3HPA), a precursor of 3HP-
CoA (Wang et al., 2013), to produce 1,3-propanediol
(1,3PD). However, only few bacteria are capable of syn-
thesizing vitamin B12 (Sun et al., 2003). To solve this
problem, we used the enteric bacteriumShimwellia blat-
tae ATCC33430 (Burgess et al., 1973; Priest and Barker,
2010) which cannot naturally produce PHA but synthe-
sizes vitamin B12 (Andres et al., 2004) and converts gly-
cerol to 1,3PD.
Recently, we reported that S. blattae expressing 1,3-
propanediol dehydrogenase ( dhaT) and aldehyde de-
hydrogenase ( aldD)o f Pseudomonas putida KT2442,
propionate-coenzyme A (propionate-CoA) transferase
(pct)o f Clostridium propionicum X2, and PHA synthase
(phaC1)o f Ralstonia eutropha H16 accumulates poly
(3HP) from glycerol as a sole carbon source up to 14.5%
(wtPHA/wtCDW) (Andreeßen et al., 2014a; Heinrich et al.,
2013). Here, 1,3PD produced by S. blattae is oxidized
first to 3HPA by DhaT and subsequently to 3HP by
AldD. 3HP is then activated by addition of coenzyme A
by Pct. In order to synthesize poly(3HB-co-3HP) from
glycerol in S. blattae, we co-expressedphaA and phaB1
from R. eutropha H16 (Budde et al., 2010) together with
the enzymes for the already mentioned artificial poly
(3HP) pathway (Heinrich et al., 2013). Two molecules of
acetyl-CoA are condensed to acetoacetyl-CoA by a β-
ketothiolase (PhaA) and acetoacetyl-CoA is then re-
duced by an ( R)-specific acetoacetyl-CoA reductase
(PhaB1) to generate ( R)-3HB-CoA. As a result, the
recombinant S. blattae (Sb6BP) is capable of synthesiz-
ing poly(3HB-co-3HP) (Figure 1).
However, the residual cell density was less than 6 g/L
and therefore too low to produce much poly(3HB-co-
3HP). Since PHA are accumulated inside the cells, low
residual cell density result in only low PHA productivity.
For example, even if 90 % (wtPHA/wtCDW) of poly(3HB-
co-3HP) is accumulated in a cell, less than 54 g/L of
polymer is produced under such conditions.
Therefore, an optimized culture medium was needed
to overcome this problem. In this study, we report on a
new strategy for synthesis of poly(3HB- co-3HP) using
optimized cultivation medium and glycerol in genetically
modified S. blattae without the addition of vitaminB12
and 3HP into the culture.

were cultivated in 250-mL Erlenmeyer flasks at an agita-
tion of 125 rpm and at 30°C. High cell density fed-batch
cultivation of S. blattae were conducted in a 2 L jar
fermenter (Biostat B plus, Sartorius AG, Göttingen,
Germany) containing 1.5 L of basal medium (BM)
(Andreeßen et al. 2014a,b) or MMB medium with 300 mM
of glycerol as carbon source.
Glycerol was intermittently added to the culture
medium to maintain a concentration between 50 and
300 mM. 500-mL flasks containing 100 mL BM or
MMB medium, 300 mM of glycerol and 50 μg/L of
kanamycin were used for seed cultivations. Dissolved
oxygen was monitored and pH was controlled in the
range of 6.8 – 6.9 by using a 7.5% aqueous solution of
ammonium hydroxide.

Optimization of cultivation medium
When optimizing the medium, we thought yeast extract is
not necessary, because cultivations in complete synthetic
medium have been made for bacteria such asKlebsiella
pneumonia (Brandl et al., 1998), E. coli (Enayati et al.,
1999) orR. eutropha(Sato et al., 2013). Therefore, several
different concentrations of yeast extract were tested as
described below.
250-mL Erlenmeyer flasks containing 50 mL MMB
medium with 0, 0.2 or 2.0 (g/L) of yeast extract, respect-
ively were used to cultivateS. blattae ATCC33430. The
optical density at 600 nm and the pH were measured in
samples withdrawn from the culture. In order to decide
which yeast extract concentration is favorable for high
cell density cultivation, 2 L bioreactors containing 1.5 L
of MMB medium with 300 mM of glycerol and 0.2, 0.67
or 6.7 g/L of yeast extract and Sb6BP were used. Cell
densities (g CDW/L) and polymer contents (% wt PHA/
wtCDW) were measured.
Synthesis and purification of poly(3HB-co-3HP)
PHA was synthesized in a 2 L bioreactors containing
1.5 L of BM or MMB medium for 72 or 48 h. Gly-
cerol was used as sole carbon source. Generally,
enteric bacteria also S. blattae synthesize 1,3PD only
under anaerobic condition. Thus, 4 different cultiva-
tion conditions (aerobic, anaerobic, low aeration/agita-
tion and two-step) were conducted to optimize poly
(3HB-co-3HP) synthesize condition in recombinant
S. blattae (SB6P).
The operating conditions were as follows: Aerobic
condition means an agitation at 800 rpm and an aer-
ation rate of 2.0 L/min. An aerobic conditions were
maintained at an agitation of 150 rpm without any
aeration whereas low aeration/agitation conditions
were provided at a stirring rate of 150 rpm and an
aeration rate of 0.4 L/min. 150 rpm was the mini-
mum stirring rate required in medium mixing. The
two-step fermentation (the first 24 hours under an-
aerobic condition, thereaft er, aerobic condition) was
performed according to Heinrich et al., 2013.
Cell harvest and extraction of poly(3HB-co-3HP)
After separating the cells from the culture broth, cells
were frozen at−30°C and freeze dried. Poly(3HB-co-3HP)
or poly(3HB) was isolated from the pulverized dry cell
matter by digestion of non-PHA biomass employing a
13% (vol/vol) sodium hypochlorite solution (Heinrich
et al., 2013, Heinrich et al., 2012).
Determination of poly(3HB-co-3HP)
Analysis of polymer content and purity of the extracted
polymer was done by gas chromatography (GC). For this
dried cell mass or samples of isolated poly(3HB-co-3HP)
and poly(3HB) were exposed to acidic methanolysis as
described before (Brandl et al., 1998; Timm et al., 1990).
For microscopic analysis of PHA-granules cells were
stained with Nile red (Spiekermann et al., 1999)
(Figure 2).
Determination of glycerol and 1,3PD
Concentrations of glycerol and 1,3PD in the media
were monitored by HPLC analysis. For this, superna-
tants were assayed using a Lachrom Elite HPLC-
System (VWR-Hitachi, Darmstadt, D) chromatograph
with a RI-detector (Type 2490 VWR, Darmstadt, D)
and a Metacarb 67H-column (300 × 6.5 mM, VWR-
Varian, Darmstadt, D) at 75°C and at a flow rate of 0.8 ml/
min for 20 min. The mobile phase was 4.5 mM sulfuric
acid.
Results
Synthesis of poly(3HB-co-3HP) influenced by cultivation
conditions
In order to develop a process for poly(3HB-co-3HP) pro-
duction by a newly engineeredSb6BP strain, cultivation
was conducted under four different conditions (aerobic,
two-step, low aeration/agitation and aerobic conditions).
(i) Aerobic condition occurred at high aeration and agi-
tation, (ii) the two-step condition occurred during the
first 24 hours under anaerobic condition and thereafter
under aerobic condition, (iii) for low aeration/agitation
condition a minimum stirring rate was applied together
with low rate of aeration and (iv) for anaerobic condition
was a minimum stirring rate was applied without aeration.
Glycerol supplementation started from 8 to 16 hours
of cultivation in every culture when glycerol concentra-
tion became lower than 100 mM. In most cases, glycerol
consumption rate became lower than supplementation
rate after 18 h cultivation. If this was the case, the sup-
plementation rate was regulated to maintain a glycerol
concentration between 50 and 300 mM during the culti-
vations. In case of 1,3PD, it might not be effectively
transported into the cell after it was transiently formed
and excreted into the medium before it could be
Sato et al. AMB Express (2015) 5:18 Page 4 of 9
incorporated into the polymer via 3-hydroxypropionyl-
CoA; thus the 1,3PD concentration was not so affected
during cultivations. Moreover, the reduction of 1,3PD
concentration in the later phase of the cultivation period
could also occur due to a dilution effect (Figures 3 and 4).
The amount of 1,3PD that was converted into 3-
hydroxypropionyl-CoA and polymerized into poly(3HB-
co-3HP) was too small to affect the 1,3PD concentration
of the culture medium in these studies. We already con-
firmed that 1,3PD supplemented to the culture medium
was converted to 3-hydroxypropiony-CoA which is
polymerized into poly(3HB-co-3HP) in the recombinant
strain in whichdhaT was heterologously expressed. How-
ever, efficiency was very low (data not shown). Therefore,
most of the 3HP monomer in the accumulated polymer
was provided directly from 3-hydroxypropionaldehyde via
3-hydroxypropionate and 3-hydroxyproionyl-CoA by
AldD and Pct, respectively.
Strain Sb6BP was confirmed as a poly(3HB-co-3HP)
producer (Table 2). Moreover, strainSb6BP synthesized
the poly(3HB-co-3HP) copolymer only under anaerobic,
two-step and low aeration/agitation conditions. Under

aerobic condition no 3HP were incorporated as consti-
tuent. The productivity for poly(3HB- co-3HP) in BM
medium ranged from 4 mgPHA/L/h to 25 mgPHA/L/h and
was highest under the two-step condition. No copolymer
but poly(3HB) homopolymer was formed under aerobic
conditions, and the productivity for poly(3HB) was higher
in comparison to poly(3HB-co-3HP) in both BM and
MMB medium. The polymer content was also highest in
the two-step fermentations (29.9% in BM and 30.7%
wtPHA/wtCDW in MMB, respectively), and lowest (14.7% in
BM and 17.2% wtPHA/wtCDW in MMB, respectively) in the
anaerobic fermentation. On the other hand, poly(3HB-co-
3HP) with the highest 3HP content was obtained
(16.6 mol% in BM and 18.1 mol% in MMB, respectively)
in anaerobic fermentations.
The time courses of polymer synthesis for each cul-
tivation condition in BM medium were as follows
(Figure 3): (1) Anaerobic: cell growth and addition of
ammonium hydroxide almost stopped after 48 h culti-
vation time. The highest 3HP composition (20.2 mol%),
1,3PD concentration (242 mM) and polymer production
was recorded after about 40 h cultivation time. These data
indicate that 3HP-CoA and 1,3PD synthesis occurred only
during exponential cell growth. Moreover, it was indicated
that both, (R)-3HB-CoA and 3HP-CoA are not supplied
after the stop of cell growth, because the 3HP content was
very stable after 40 h. (2) Low aeration/agitation: the time
courses of every parameter except 3HP monomer fraction
were very similar when compared to anaerobic conditions
as explained above. The highest molar 3HP monomer
fraction was recorded earlier than 12 hour of culture time.
The residual cell mass was only marginally influenced by
aeration, but the 3HP monomer content of the polyester
was decreased to less than 50% in comparison to anaer-
obic condition. (3) Two-step: Interestingly, the highest
molar 3HP fraction in the copolymer was recorded at the
time when the cultivation conditions were just switched.
After that, the fraction of 3HP moieties rapidly dropped
but the cell dry weight (CDW) increased on the other
hand. Formation of 1,3PD was maintained for some hours

after the cultivation condition was changed from anaer-
obic to aerobic and then stopped. (4) Aerobic: only the
poly(3HB) homopolymer was synthesized under aerobic
conditions. Furthermore, the cell density (12.6 gCDW/L)
and the PHA productivity (96.6 mgPHA/L/h) were the
highest. Only a small amount of 1,3PD (10 to 15 mM) was
synthesized after 24 h of cultivation, and the 3HP mono-
mer was not detected by GC analysis at any period.
GPC analysis of the isolated poly(3HB-co-3HP) obtained
in BM after two-step cultivation for 72 h revealed an aver-
age molecular weight of 765,293 Da with a polydispersity
index (Mw/Mn)o f2 . 4 9 .
Optimization of the medium for cultivation
Although cells of strainSb6BP could be successfully cul-
tivated, poly(3HB-co-3HP) productivity was still low due
to a low residual cell mass. The cell density was only
12.6 gCDW/L under aerobic condition in BM medium.
From these results it was suspected that some sub-
stances required for cell growth were missing or that at
least a severe shortage had occurred in BM medium.
Therefore, the medium was optimized.
It was confirmed that the growth rate of the cells was
influenced by the concentration of yeast extract in the
medium (Figure 5). The growth rates (μ) of the cells in
MMB between 0 to 12 h cultivation time containing 0,
0.2 or 2.0 g/L of yeast extract were 0.32, 0.36 and 0.41 h−1,
respectively. It was also confirmed that the trace element
solution used in this study is necessary for cell growth
(Figure 5A). These results indicate in contrast to our
expectations that yeast extract is very important for cell
growth ofS. blattae. Yeast extract contains many vitamins
like biotin, 4-aminobenzoic acid, pantothenic acid, pyri-
doxine, riboflavin and thiamine (data from DIFCO) in
addition to amino acids and some of these compounds are
likely to be growth limiting.
Although yeast extract was confirmed as a key factor
for growth of S. blattae, the optimum concentration
could not be identified in flask culture experiments since
cell growth stopped after 24 h of cultivation time when
the pH had dropped below 5. Therefore, higher cell
density cultivations were conducted in 2 L fermenter in
order to determine the optimum concentration of yeast
extract. The cell densities obtained in aerobic cultiva-
tions in MMB containing 0.2, 0.67 and 6.7 g/L of yeast
extract were 14.6, 27.3 and 44.6 g CDW/L, respectively
(Figure 5B, Table 3).
With regard to the cost, we chose of 0.67 g/L to obtain
27.3 gCDW/L.
Synthesis of poly(3HB-co-3HP) in MMB medium
Improved productivities for PHA synthesis were between
1.9 and 5.8 times higher in MMB than in BM; the highest
poly(3HB-co-3HP) productivity was obtained in two-step
cultivation (25 mgPHA/L/h in BM medium in comparison
to 148 mgPHA/L/h in MMB) (Table 2). The positive effect
of MMB medium was highest in two-step cultivation
experiments. This is explained by the fact that cell growth
was very high after the culture conditions were changed
(Figure 4).
Conversely, these effects were less under anaerobic
and low aeration/agitation conditions. An explanation is
most probably because the rate-limiting factor was oxy-
gen and not one of the compounds included in yeast
extract. These observations could not be confirmed in

MMB under aerobic condition as there was no poly
(3HB-co-3HP) accumulated. The polymer content and
the 3HP fraction in the copolyester were not so much
influenced under anaerobic and low aeration/agitation
conditions whereas the 3HP fraction in two-step condi-
tion dropped rapidly from 8.6 to 2.1 mol% after the cul-
tivation conditions were changed (Figure 4). These
results indicate that the decrease of 3HP fraction might
be due to a relative decrease of the monomer composition
by additional accumulation of 3HB and/or poly(3HB),
because, after switching the conditions, cell growth started
again and 3HB-CoA provision via acetoacetyl-CoA was
started as well. In addition, it was confirmed that the net
3HP amount increased until 30 h; thereafter no increase
occurred in case of two-step cultivation when using the
MMB medium. Therefore, there is a possibility that the
resulting polymer was likely a blend of poly(3HB) and
poly(3HB-co-3HP).
Poly(3HB-co-3HP) with the highest 3HP fraction
(18.1 mol%) was obtained during anaerobic condition;
however, the polymer productivity and cell density were
only 6.6 mgPHA/L/h and 1.84 gCDW/L, respectively.
Discussion
In this study we engineered a recombinant strain ofS.
blattae ATCC33430 (Sb6BP), which is able to synthesize
poly(3HB) and poly(3HB-co-3HP). However, Sb6BP syn-
thesized the copolymer only under oxygen limiting con-
ditions because the cells produced only small amounts
of 1,3-propanediol (1,3PD) as a precursor of 3-hydroxy-
propionyl-CoA (3HP-CoA) under aerobic condition. In
any case, in comparison with the 1,3PD productivity
under oxygen limiting conditions, a lower productivity
of 1,3PD under aerobic condition causes non-accumula-
tion of poly(3HB-co-3HP).
However, successful production of poly(3HB-co-3HP)
in recombinant S. blattae was achieved, 3HP compos-
ition was rather low. The glass transition temperature of
poly(3HB-co-3HP) decreases rapidly from−3°C to−15°C,
and the melting temperature (Tm) decreases from 163°C
to 73°C as the 3HP fraction in the copolymer increased
from 25.6 to 36.3 mol% (Wang et al., 2013). In particular,
the poly(3HB-co-3HP) with a 3HP content exceeding
30 mol% is therefore much more flexible and less crystal-
line and is expected to approach that of conventional plas-
tics such as polypropylene, polystyrene, and polyethylene.
The low 3HP fraction indicates that the strain cannot
actively import 1,3PD from culture medium or that
3HP-CoA supply via 3-hydroxypropionaldehyde and
3-hydroxypropionate is insufficient.
This is the first report for the production of poly(3HB-
co-3HP) without using vitamin B12 and expensive com-
pounds such as 3-hydroxypropionate by recombinantS.
blattae. We achieved a poly(3HB-co-3HP) productivity
of 148 mgPHA/L/h in this study, which is the highest so
far reported (Shimamura et al., 1994; Fukui et al., 2009;
Wang and Inoue, 2001; Wang et al., 2013).S. blattae is
therefore one of the promising bacterial strains for poly
(3HB-co-3HP) production from glycerol.
However, the reported processes still require oxygen
limitation. Therefore, the polymer productivity is still very
low. In addition, the polymer produced by two-step cultiva-
tion method was likely a blend of poly(3HB) and poly
(3HB-co-3HP) owing to the conditional change from an-
aerobic to aerobic condition. The remaining challenges are
to achieve efficient utilization of 3HPA or 1,3PD and the
expression of the genes regulated bydha r e g u l o ni na e r o b i c
conditions for aerobic production of poly(3HB-co-3HP).
Moreover, an enhancement of the metabolite flow from 3-
hydroxypropionaldehyde to 3HP-CoA will be necessary to
increase the 3HP fraction in the copolymer. By using the
pduP gene from Salmonella enterica (Andreeßen et al.,
2010) or Salmonella typhimurium(Gao et al., 2014), the
provision of 3HP-CoA provision might be improved.
