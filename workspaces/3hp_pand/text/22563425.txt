Abstract
The Escherichia coli YhdH polypeptide is in the MDR012 sub-group of medium chain reductase/dehydrogenases, but its
biological function was unknown and no phenotypes of YhdH2 mutants had been described. We found that anE. colistrain
with an insertional mutation inyhdH was hyper-sensitive to inhibitory effects of acrylate, and, to a lesser extent, to those of
3-hydroxypropionate. Close homologues of YhdH occur in many Bacterial taxa and at least two animals. The acrylate
sensitivity of YhdH2 mutants was corrected by the corresponding, cloned homologues from several bacteria. One such
homologue is acuI, which has a role in acrylate degradation in marine bacteria that catabolise dimethylsulfoniopropionate
(DMSP) an abundant anti-stress compound made by marine phytoplankton. TheacuI genes of such bacteria are often linked
to ddd genes that encode enzymes that cleave DMSP into acrylate plus dimethyl sulfide (DMS), even though these are in
different polypeptide families, in unrelated bacteria. Furthermore, most strains of Roseobacters, a clade of abundant marine
bacteria, cleave DMSP into acrylate plus DMS, and can also demethylate it, using DMSP demethylase. In most Roseobacters,
the corresponding gene,dmdA, lies immediately upstream ofacuI and in the model Roseobacter strainRuegeria pomeroyi
DSS-3, dmdA-acuI were co-regulated in response to the co-inducer, acrylate. These observations, together with findings by
others that AcuI has acryloyl-CoA reductase activity, lead us to suggest that YdhH/AcuI enzymes protect cells against
damaging effects of intracellular acryloyl-CoA, formed endogenously, and/or via catabolising exogenous acrylate. To
provide ‘‘added protection’’ for bacteria that form acrylate from DMSP,acuI was recruited into clusters of genes involved in
this conversion and, in the case ofacuI and dmdA in the Roseobacters, their co-expression may underpin an interaction
between the two routes of DMSP catabolism, whereby the acrylate product of DMSP lyases is a co-inducer for the
demethylation pathway.

Introduction
The compatible solute dimethylsulfoniopropionate (DMSP) is
made by many marine phytoplankton, including dinoflagellates,
diatoms, and coccolithophores, several marine macroalgal sea-
weeds and a few land plants [1]. This zwitterion probably acts as
an osmolyte, although other anti-stress functions have been
suggested [2]. Its high concentrations in the producing organisms
(,0.5 M in some cases) coupled to their wide distributions in the
oceans, means that DMSP is one of the most abundant (,10
9 tons
made per annum) organic, sulfur-containing molecules on Earth.
Furthermore, the DMSP that is released following the death or
damage of the producing organisms provides an important
nutrient source for many marine microbes, including the
prodigiously abundant SAR11 clade, and it is therefore a key
component of the global sulfur cycle [3,4].
The catabolic fate of DMSP is complex, and varied. Some of
the eukaryotic DMSP producers can themselves cleave it into
acrylate plus the volatile dimethyl sulfide (DMS), as can many
marine bacteria, and a few fungi (see [5]). Although the enzyme
activity for this reaction is generically termed ‘‘DMSP lyase’’,
biochemical and genetic studies show that widely divergent
enzymes, which occur in different microbes, can cleave DMSP
into these products. To date, no less than five ‘‘Ddd’’ (DMSP-
dependent DMS) gene products (DddL, DddP, DddQ, DddW and
DddY) have been found in different marine bacteria, and although
they all catalyse the same cleavage of DMSP into acrylate plus
DMS, they are in different polypeptide families [6,7]. A sixth
bacterial ‘‘Ddd’’ enzyme, termed DddD, also generates DMS by
cleaving DMSP, but in this case, the resultant C3 compound is 3-
hydroxypropionate (3HP) [8].
In addition to these cleavage pathways, DMSP can also be
catabolised in a completely different manner, in which the initial
step involves demethylation to methylmercaptopropionate
(MMPA), which is then further catabolised to methane thiol and
acetate [9,10]. The gene responsible for the initial demethylation is
termed dmdA, which occurs in two groups of abundant marinea-
Proteobacteria, namely a lineage known as the Roseobacters and
also in the hugely populous SAR11 clade; thus, demethylation
accounts for most of the global DMSP catabolic flux, although it
does not liberate any DMS (see [7]).

In several bacteria, the ‘‘primary’’ddd genes, whose lyase
products act directly on DMSP, are in clusters, together with other
genes that are variously involved in the import of DMSP, in
downstream catabolic steps that feed into central metabolism, or in
their transcriptional regulation in response to the appropriate co-
inducer molecule (see Figure 1 for some examples of these).
In addition, several different ddd gene clusters, in a range of
bacteria, contain another gene, termedacuI (
acrylate utilisation).
First described in the a-Proteobacterium, Rhodobacter sphaeroides
strain 2.4.1 [11],acuI is the central gene of a three-gene operon
whose promoter-proximal acuR encodes a regulator in the TetR
family, and whose promoter-distal gene,dddL, encodes a DMSP
lyase that cleaves DMSP into acrylate plus DMS ([12], Figure 1).
Although R. sphaeroides does not grow well on acrylate as sole
carbon source, it can catabolise
14C-labelled acrylate substrate,
with the concomitant release of labelled14CO2. An AcuI2 mutant
of R. sphaeroides was less effective in this transformation, and,
strikingly, it was hypersensitive to the inhibitory effects of acrylate
compared to the wild type [11]. Significantly, acuI is not only
linked to other ddd genes that encode different types of DMSP
lyases, but is also next to the DMSP demethylation genedmdA in
the model Roseobacter strain,Ruegeria pomeroyi [6,13].
AcuI is in the ‘‘medium chain reductase/dehydrogenase’’
(MDR) family, members of which are widespread and occur in
all Domains of life. In a detailed sequence analysis, Hedlundet al.
[14] delineated 86 different MDR sub-families, with functions
ranging from quinone reductases to a f-crystallin in vertebrate
lens. According to this scheme, AcuI polypeptides are in the
MDR012 sub-family, which is also termed the YhdH group, in
recognition of theEscherichia coligene product of that name, which
is 54% identical to AcuI of Rhodobacter. The function of E. coli
YhdH is unknown and no mutant phenotypes have been reported.
Although the overall fold structure of the YhdH polypeptide
resembles that of quinone reductases, it has very little sequence
similarity to any known enzymes that act on quinones [15].
Furthermore, the YhdH polypeptide lacks a Zn co-factor, which
distinguishes it from the many zinc-containing alcohol dehydro-
genases and several other members of the MDR super-family
[14,15,16]. Thus, AcuI is not a ‘‘putative Zn-dependent
oxidoreductase’’, as suggested by its annotation (http://www.
ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/protein/ABA77575.1).
Recent biochemical evidence that complements these genetic
links between AcuI and acrylate has recently shown that AcuI of
Rhodobacter sphaeroides has acryloyl-CoA reductase activity, catalys-
ing the conversion of acryloyl-CoA to propionyl-CoA [13]. Here,
we present more insights into the function and distribution ofacuI-
like genes and their products in a wide range of bacteria, including
those that do and those that do not catabolise DMSP. We present
a model that indicates that AcuI-like enzymes have an unusual and
widespread general role in bacteria, as well as affecting how
DMSP can be catabolised.

A Bacterial Gene for Acrylate Resistance
PLoS ONE | www.plosone.org 2 April 2012 | Volume 7 | Issue 4 | e35947
Results
acuI-like genes are near some, but not all, theddd and
dmdA genes involved in DMSP catabolism
It had been noted that there wereacuI-like genes near some
bacterial ddd and dmdA genes involved in DMSP catabolism. In a
more thorough examination of these linkage relationships, we
found that the distributions ofacuI genes in relation to each of the
individual types of dmdA and ddd genes in different bacteria are
instructive, as follows.
Of the seven known enzymes that act directly on DMSP, either
demethylating it (DmdA) or cleaving it to release DMS (DddD,
DddL, DddP, DddQ, DddW and DddY), all but two of the
corresponding genes (dddQ and dddW) are closely linked toacuI in
at least one bacterial strain. These are considered individually in
the following section.
dmdA. The dmdA gene is largely confined to two groups of
marine bacteria (see [6,7]). One of these, the Roseobacters,
comprises several genera in a sub-group of the Rhodobacterales.
These are abundant and widespread in the oceans and coastal
waters and most of them can catabolise DMSP – indeed, several
individual strains can both demethylate it and cleave it, releasing
DMS [17]. This is due to their possession of both the DmdA
demethylase plus one or more DMSP lyases (DddD, DddL, DddP,
DddQ and/or DddW), each of which generates acrylate or 3HP
plus DMS. Individual Roseobacter strains have various portfolios
of these different lyases [6,18].
We found that all 37 of the searchable, genome-sequenced
Roseobacter strains listed in ‘‘Roseobase’’ (http://www.roseobase.
org/), contained a singleacuI gene, whose products mostly ranged
from 44%–57% identity to AcuI ofRhodobacter sphaeroides(bit score
.289); that ofCitreicella sp. SE45 was more closely related, being
85% identical (Figure 2). Of these Roseobacter strains, 26 contain
the DmdA demethylase and in all but two of these cases,acuI was
immediately 39 of, and likely co-transcribed with,dmdA. In the two
exceptions ( Phaeobacter gallaeciensis BS107 and Rhodobacterales
bacterium HTCC2255), acuI was elsewhere in the genome, and
in the former of these, it was adjacent to a gene whose product is
annotated as a betaine/carnitine/choline transporter (BCCT
family), which resembled DddT, a DMSP transporter in other
bacteria, such as Halomonas HTNK1 ([8]; see below). All 11
Roseobacter strains that lackdmdA also contain acuI, and in some
cases (e.g. Oceanicola granulosus HTCC2516 and Phaeobacter
gallaeciensis 2.10), it was next to a gene that resembleddddT,a s
in Phaeobacter gallaeciensis BS107 (see above).
The other major group of bacteria that contain DmdA
demethylase are species ofPelagibacter, in the SAR 11 clade; unlike
the Roseobacters, SAR11 bacteria lack any known DMSP lyases.
All three genome-sequenced strains of Pelagibacter have close
homologues of AcuI (which are ,40% identical to AcuI of
Rhodobacter sphaeroides), but none is closely linked todmdA; in turn,
none of theiracuI genes is near any genes known to be involved in
DMSP catabolism.
Turning to the linkages ofacuI to theddd genes that encode the
various DMSP lyases, these reveal a number of different patterns,
as follows.
DddD. The DddD enzyme is, so far, unique, since it
generates DMS plus 3HP as the 3C catabolite, in contrast to the
other DMSP lyases, which cleave DMSP into DMS plus acrylate.
The dddD gene occurs, sporadically, in a range of Proteobacteria.
In several of these, includingMarinomonas MWYL1, in which it was
first identified [19], it is clustered with other ddd genes with
ancillary functions involved in DMSP catabolism (transport,
regulation, subsequent catabolic steps).
To date, the onlydddD-containing cluster that includesacuI is in
Halomonas HTNK1 (Figure 1). Significantly, though, this c-
Proteobacterium grows on both DMSP and on acrylate as sole
carbon sources [8], unlike, for example, Marinomonas MWYL1,
which grows only on the former substrate. This ability is due to
conversion of acrylate to 3HP, via the activities of the products of
the acuN and acuK genes, which are also clustered withdddD and
the otherddd genes inHalomonas HTNK1 ([8]; Figure 1). To date,
all otherdddD-containing bacteria lackacuN and acuK, anywhere in
their genomes. In light of the postulated function of AcuI in
conferring resistance to acrylate-mediated toxicity, the association
of acuI with genes involved in the catabolism of this substrate is
unlikely to be coincidental (see below).
In several other bacteria that containdddD, there is no nearby
acuI, but, in nearly all such cases, there is a version of acuI
elsewhere in their genomes, unlinked to any other known gene
involved in DMSP catabolism. These include representatives of
the a- (e.g. Hoeflea), b-( Burkholderia) and c- (e.g. Marinomonas)
Proteobacteria.
Three Roseobacter strains, namely Sagittula stellata E-37,
Citreicella sp. SE45 and Rhodobacterales bacterium HTCC2083,
contain DddD homologues with predicted DMSP lyase activities.
All three contain close homologues of AcuI and, in strain
HTCC2083, the corresponding gene is downstream ofdmdA,a s
in many other Roseobacters (see above). However,Sagittula stellata
E-37 andCitreicella sp. SE45 are unusual among the Roseobacters
in that they lackdmdA and their versions ofacuI are not near any
genes that are known to be involved in DMSP catabolism.
One final point concerning dddD-containing bacteria is that
those strains in the family Rhizobiaceae that contain this gene,
namely Rhizobium leguminosarum WSM2304, Sinorhizobium fredii
NGR234 and Agrobacterium tumefaciens 5A, lack any detectable
acuI
homologue anywhere in their genomes.
DddY. The DMSP lyase product of dddY differs from the
other five DMSP lyases in that it is located in the bacterial
periplasm, not the cytoplasm. First described in the b-
Proteobacterium Alcaligenes faecalis M3A [20,21], dddY also occurs
occasionally in other sub-phyla, namely Arcobacter nitrofigilis
DSM7299 (e sub-phylum), Desulfovibrio acrylicus W218 (d) and in
the c-Proteobacteria Ferrimonas balearica DSM9799 and several
different species ofShewanella [20].
The Alcaligenes faecalis M3A acuI gene is immediately 59 of and
co-transcribed with dddY, under the control of an acrylate-
inducible promoter [20]. The cluster that contains these two
genes resembles that of Halomonas HTNK1, since it includes
regulatory genes (dddZ and dddR), downstream catabolic genes
(dddA, dddC) and theacuN and acuK genes, whose products act on
the acrylate, either supplied exogenously, or generated by cleavage
of DMSP by the DddY lyase (Figure 1).
The genome of the e-Proteobacterium Arcobacter nitrofigilis has
two dddY genes, one of which (locus tag Arnit_0113) lies
immediately 59 of an acuI-like gene (Arnit_0112), whose product
is in the MDR012 family, though somewhat divergently related to
the AcuI sequences of other bacteria (Figure 2; see below)
Of the nine species ofShewanella that containdddY, eight have a
nearby version ofacuI (Figure 1) the exception beingS. frigidimarina,
whose acuI gene is elsewhere in the genome (see below).
DddL. The DddL DMSP lyase cleaves DMSP into DMS plus
acrylate. To date,dddL is largely confined to strains of bacteria in
the Rhodobacterales and Rhizobiales families, with one
representative (Marinobacter sp. MnI7-9) in the c-Proteobacteria.
All these strains containacuI somewhere in their genomes, but the
only known example in which it is closely linked todddL is in the
originally described Rhodobacter sphaeroides strains 2.4.1,

ATCC17029 and WS8N, in which these two genes are co-
transcribed ([11,12]; Figure 1).
DddP. The dddP gene encodes a DMSP lyase in the M24
family of metallo-peptidases and is frequently found in the
Roseobacters, with the majority (24 out of 37) of the genome-
sequenced strains harbouring this gene [6,22]. As described above,
the acuI gene of most strains in this clade is 39 of dmdA, and in no
case was there tight linkage betweenacuI and dddP in any of the
Roseobacters. There is evidence for horizontal gene transfer of
dddP to some c-Proteobacteria (Vibrio orientalis and Oceanimonas
doudoroffii, the latter which has two differentdddP genes [23]), to
Candidatus Puniceispirillum marinum (a member of the abundant
SAR116 clade ofa-Proteobacteria), and even to some Ascomycete
fungi [22]. In strains ofCandidatus P. marinum, acuI lies upstream
of dddP (Figure 1), the only case in whichdddP and acuI are closely
linked in any known bacterium.
DddQ. The DMSP lyase encoded bydddQ is confined, so far,
to the Roseobacters, in which it occurs in seven different strains
[6]. In none of these isdddQ near anacuI-like gene, but we did note
that the dddQ of R. pomeroyi DSS-3 and the adjacentdddQ1 and
dddQ2 genes inRoseovarius nubinhibens ISM [24] were closely linked
to and likely co-transcribed with a gene (SPO1593 inR. pomeroyi
DSS-3 and ISM_14095 in Roseovarius nubinhibens) whose product
was in the MDR super-family. However, this polypeptide was
predicted to be in the MDR028 sub-family and is markedly
divergent to the MDR012-type AcuI polypeptide described here
(Figure 2 and see below).
DddW. To date,dddW is only seen in two Roseobacter strains,
namely R. pomeroyi DSS-3 and Roseobacter sp. MED193 [25]; in
neither of these was it linked to anacuI-like gene.
Widespread distribution of AcuI-like gene products in
Bacterial phyla
Apart from those MDR028 versions that are neardddQ, all the
acuI-like genes that are tightly linked to the variousddd and dmdA
genes encode MDR012 sub-family medium chain reductase/
dehydrogenases, as judged by the sequence similarities of their
products to at least one member of this sub-group, listed by
Hedlund et al.[14]. However, it is clear that these AcuI proteins do
not comprise a particular out-group that is distinct from many
other MDR012 polypeptides that occur in other bacteria, in a
range of taxa, and which have no known link with DMSP and/or
acrylate catabolism. This is illustrated in Figure 2, which shows a
maximum likelihood tree of a range of different AcuI-like
polypeptides; the gene products that were included in the tree
were chosen either because they had been shown, above, to
correct the acrylate sensitivity of AcuI
2 and/or YhdH2 mutants,
or had sequences that closely resembled such ratified polypeptides,
or because their corresponding genes were closely linked toddd or
dmdA genes or, finally, because they were from a range of different
Bacterial phyla. Some of these are described in more detail, below.
With the exception ofCitreicella sp. SE45 (see above) the AcuI
polypeptides of the Roseobacters are all very similar to each other
(,80% identical) whether theiracuI gene is downstream ofdmdA or
not. Their closest matches are in bacteria with no known role in
DMSP catabolism, includingPolymorphum gilvum SL003B-26A1 (a-
Proteobacterium) and Thioalkalivibrio sulfidophilus (c-Proteobacter-
ium), whose homologues are respectively ,80% and ,66%
identical to the AcuIs in the Roseobacters. Of the AcuI
polypeptides encoded by the loci near the variousddd genes, the
Roseobacter AcuIs are more similar ( ,60% identical) to the
product of theacuI that adjoinsdddP in Candidatus Puniceispirillum
marinum IMCC1322 than to those that are linked to any of the
various dddY genes and to dddD of Halomonas. And, as shown in
Figure 2, the AcuI of the Roseobacters, exemplified by that ofR.
pomeroyi, is closely related to those of Candidatus Pelagibacter
ubique, and the eponymous YhdH polypeptide ofE. coli.
The original AcuI of Rhodobacter sphaeroides strain 2.4.1 more
closely resembles that ofCitreicella sp. SE45 (86%) and some other,
more taxonomically distant strains, such as theb-Proteobacterium
Pusillimonas sp. T7-7 and the Verrucomicrobiae bacterium strain
DG1235 (,65%) than it does to the polypeptides encoded by the
acuI genes near dmdA of the Roseobacters (53%) or dddY of
Alcaligenes (60%) ordddD of Halomonas HTNK1 (62%) (Figure 2). In
turn, the respective AcuI products in these last two strains most
closely resemble homologues in organisms with no links with
DMSP, namely the b-Proteobacterium Dechloromonas aromatica
RCB (78% identical) and the c-Proteobacterium Alkalilimnicola
ehrlichii MLHE-1 (61%), two species that are unusual in having two
separate genes for AcuI-like polypeptides (Figure 2).
The sequences of the AcuI polypeptides in all but one of the
Shewanella strains that harbourdddY form a closely related group,
with 75–94% identify to each other, and closely resembling YhdH
of E. coli. The exception, Shewanella frigidimarina, is the only one
whose acuI gene is not linked todddY; its AcuI polypeptide is rather
different to the others in this genus and is closely related to that of
Halomonas HTNK1 (Figure 2).
Finally, the product of theacuI gene Arnit_0112 that abutsdddY
in Arcobacter nitrofigilis[26] is less closely related to the polypeptides
encoded by any of the otheracuIs that are linked toddd or dmdA
genes, and range from 37% identity (to those in the Roseobacters)
to 43% (inHalomonas HTNK1). As with the examples above, the
closest homologues to the Arnit_0112 gene product more closely
resemble homologues in strains that are not involved in DMSP
catabolism, such as Psychrobacter cryohalolentis K5 (a˜-Proteobacter-
ium; 69% identical).
These observations show clearly that although the AcuI-like
polypeptides encoded by genes neardddD, dddL, dddP, dddY and
dmdA of different bacteria are all within the MDR012 sub-family,
their relatedness to each other is not necessarily congruent with
either the taxonomic status of the organisms, or with the particular
class of Ddd DMSP lyase encoded by the neighboring genes. For
example, the AcuI’s ofRhodobacter sphaeroides (a-Proteobacterium,
DddL), Alcaligenes faecalis M3A (b-Proteobacterium, DddY) and
Halomonas HTNK1 (c-Proteobacterium, DddD) are more closely
related to each other than they are to those encoded by the genes
downstream of dmdA in the Roseobacters or next to dddP in
Candidatus Puniceispirillum marinum (Figure 2).
It was also apparent from the examples above that AcuI-type
polypeptides in the MDR012 sub-family occur in a very wide
range of bacteria. This was further demonstrated when we used
bacteria that harbour AcuI homologues, several of which are closely related to those encoded by genes linked toddd or dmdA, and include some
genera (Xanthomonas, Streptomyces, Geobacter) in which only some strains contain AcuI homologues. (C./V. = Chlamydiae/Verrucomicrobia;a-, b-, d-,
c-, e- refer to the corresponding sub-phylum of Proteobacteria). Three strains have two separate AcuI homologues, as indicated forDechloromonas
aromatica, Alkalilimnicola ehrlichiiand Psychrobacter cryohalolentis. The tree with the highest log likelihoood is shown. The percentage of trees in
which the associated taxa clustered together is shown next to the branches. Initial tree(s) for the heuristic search were obtained automatically using
maximum parsimony method or by the BIONJ method with MCL distance matrix. The tree is drawn to scale, with branch lengths measured in the
number of substitutions per site.

A Bacterial Gene for Acrylate Resistance
PLoS ONE | www.plosone.org 5 April 2012 | Volume 7 | Issue 4 | e35947
BLASTP to interrogate the current NCBI listing of genome-
sequenced microbes, using AcuI ofRhodobacter sphaeroides as the in
silico probe. Close homologues were present in many Bacterial
phyla, with that ofArcobacter being the least similar (36% amino
acid sequence identity; bit score 211) as illustrated in Figure 2.
However, MDR102 family members were absent from all
Archaeal strains currently available, and from all but two
eukaryotes.
Within the Proteobacteria, MDR012 proteins are highly
prevalent, though not universal among thec-sub-phylum. Thus,
although all known, genome-sequenced Enterobacteriaceae (in-
cluding Escherichia coli – see below) and Vibrioonales contain an
acuI homologue, it is missing from the Pasteurellales, including
Haemophilus species. Interestingly, some individualc-Proteobacter-
ial genera include species that contain (e.g.Xanthomonas gardneri)o r
lack (X. campestrispv. campestris) a polypeptide of the MDR012 sub-
family. Similarly, in thea-, b-, d- and e-sub-phyla of Proteobac-
teria, acuI was present in only some species within a family (e.g. the
Rhizobiaceae {a}), or even a genus (Burkholderia {b}o rGeobacter {e}).
Thus, Rhizobium leguminosarum contains acuI, but strains of the
closely related Sinorhizobium, including NGR234, which harbours
dddD (see above) lack a close homologue. Intra-genus diversity also
occurs in other bacterial phyla; the much-studied Streptomyces
coelicolor lacks AcuI, but other strains in this Actinomycete genus
contain a homologue that closely resembles those described above
– the homologue inStreptomyces sp. SA3_actG is 70% identical to
that inHalomonas, for example (see Figure 2). It was also apparent
that some Bacteria, for example the Chlamydiae, Cyanobacteria
and Spirochaetes, have few or no strains with close homologues of
AcuI.
Intriguingly, there are also close AcuI homologues ( ,50%
identical to Rhodobacter AcuI) in two marine animals, namely the
Tunicate sea-slug Oikopleura dioica and the Cnidarian Clytia
hemisphaerica. For both species, these matches were seen to EST
sequences, showing that theiracuI-like genes are expressed. In the
case ofO. dioica, whose small (70 Mb) genome has been sequenced
[27], it was possible to deduce that the corresponding gene
(BACOIKO008_47) has two introns, precluding any possibility
that this sequence arose via bacterial contamination and strongly
pointing its acquisition by inter-Domain horizontal gene transfer.
The AcuI homologue YhdH inEscherichia coli protects
against the toxic effects of acrylate
The finding that mutations in acuI of Rhodobacter sphaeroides
caused hypersensitivity to the inhibitory effects of acrylate [11] was
the first reported phenotypic effect of mutations in any gene that
encoded a medium chain reductase/dehydrogenase in the
MDR012 sub-family in any bacterium. It therefore was of interest
to see if mutations in similar genes in other bacteria conferred a
similar phenotype. One such gene (see above) wasyhdH of E. coli
K-12, whose function was previously unknown.
We therefore obtained a YhdH
2 insertional mutant strain
JW3222-1, and compared it with its wild typeE. coliK-12 parental
strain BW25113 by growing both these strains on M9 minimal
agar plates containing glycerol as carbon source, plus varying
concentrations of acrylate. As shown in Figure 3 the YhdH
2
mutant was extremely sensitive to acrylate compared to the wild
type, being unable to grow at concentrations as low as 50
mM,
some 100–fold lower than the concentration that was tolerated by
the wild type.
We examined if the yhdH mutation affected growth in the
presence of other compounds with structural similarities to
acrylate and/or which might be metabolically converted to or
from acrylate; namely MMPA, propionic acid, 3HP, methacrylic
acid, 3-butenoic acid, 4-pentenoic acid, acrylamide and allyl
alcohol (Figure 4). Of these, the only one in which the wild type
and the YhdH2 mutant differed in their responses was 3HP.
Although less inhibitory to both strains than acrylate, the wild type
tolerated 40 mM 3HP in the medium, but the YhdH2 mutant
failed to form colonies at 5 mM.
We also exposed the wild type and YhdH2 mutant E. colistrains
for 24 hours to high levels (10 mM) acrylate in M9 buffer that
lacked any other carbon source and which therefore did not
support cell growth. Following this treatment, the cells were
washed, serially diluted, and plated on LB complete media and
incubated, before counting the numbers of colonies. Compared to
the control (buffer with no acrylate), exposure to acrylate did not
affect the survival of either strain. Thus, the effects of acrylate
appear to be bacteriostatic rather than bacteriocidal, and/or this
observation may mean that acrylate must be transformed to the
genuine inhibitory compound and that this only occurs in actively
metabolising cells.
Correction of the acrylate sensitivity of anE. coli YhdH2
mutant with clonedacuI from other bacteria
The finding of such a clear phenotypic difference in acrylate
tolerance in the wild type and a YhdH2 mutant ofE. colioffered a
facile way to establish if this phenotype could be corrected by the
cloned acuI-like genes from other organisms. We therefore
amplified and cloned the individual acuI genes from genomic
DNA ofE. coliitself and from several bacteria whoseacuI gene was
closely linked to different ddd genes or to dmdA. These were
Halomonas HTNK1 (next to dddD), Alcaligenes faecalis M3A (dddY),
Rhodobacter sphaeroides (dddL), Arcobacter nitrofigilis (dddY), Burkholderia
ambifaria (which has a distantly linked dddD gene [19]) and R.
pomeroyi DSS-3 (dmdA). We also examined the effects of the cloned
acuI gene of Rhizobium leguminosarum 3841, a strain with no known
links to DMSP catabolism, whose pRL120182 gene encodes a
polypeptide that is 53% identical to AcuI ofRhodobacter sphaeroides.
The resultant recombinant plasmids were each transformed into
the YhdH
2 E. coli mutant JW3222-1, and the transformants were
tested for acrylate tolerance, in comparison with the wild typeE.
coli strain BW25113. As shown in Figure 3, all the clones tested
could restore acrylate resistance to theE. coli YhdH2 mutant.
In contrast, a plasmid that contained theRoseovarius nubinhibens
ISM gene (ISM_14095) in thedddQ cluster of that strain and which
encodes an MDR028-type polypeptide (see above), failed to
correct the acrylate sensitivity of theE. coli YhdH
2 mutant.
Repercussions of the close linkage ofacuI and dmdA in
the model RoseobacterRuegeria pomeroyi DSS-3
R. pomeroyi DSS-3 was the first Roseobacter to be genome-
sequenced [28] and has had a relatively long history as a subject
for studies on DMSP catabolism. Earlier biochemical studies
showed that it can both demethylate DMSP and cleave it to
acrylate plus DMS, with the former pathway being relatively more
important at lower DMSP concentrations [17]. Genetic analyses
then showed that the demethylation pathway was mediated by the
DmdA demethylase, with the subsequent, sequential downstream
catabolic reactions being catalysed by the products of thedmdB,
dmdC and dmdD genes [9,10]. This strain also has no less than three
DMSP lyases, DddP, DddQ and DddW, all of which contribute to
the cleavage of DMSP to acrylate plus DMS [23].
As stressed by Reischet al.[7], any ‘‘switch’’ that modulates the
partitioning of the fluxes through the cleavage and demethylation
pathways may be important, not only for the individual strains and
species of Roseobacters, but more widely, with significant
A Bacterial Gene for Acrylate Resistance

environmental consequences. This is because the volatile DMS
product of the DMSP lyases is a major vehicle to transfer sulfur
from the seas to the atmosphere, thence back to land [29]. The
finding in many Roseobacter strains thatdmdA, a key gene in the
demethylation pathway is immediately 5 9 of acuI, which is
implicated in handling acrylate, a major product of the cleavage
pathway, suggests that there may be some intimate links between
these two catabolic routes in the Roseobacters, which may
impinge on this switch.
To further examine these links, we first generated insertional
mutations into dmdA and into acuI of R. pomeroyi DSS-3 (see
Materials and Methods). In light of the hypersensitivity of the
AcuI
2/YhdH2 mutants ofRhodobacter sphaeroidesand E. coli, it was
not unexpected to find that the insertion intoacuI of R. pomeroyi
conferred a similar phenotype. This mutant failed to grow on
minimal medium containing 0.2 mM acrylate, with or without the
alternative carbon source succinate, whereas wild typeR. pomeroyi
was unaffected for growth at acrylate concentrations greater than
5 mM.

A Bacterial Gene for Acrylate Resistance
PLoS ONE | www.plosone.org 7 April 2012 | Volume 7 | Issue 4 | e35947
Since catabolism of DMSP by one or more of theR. pomeroyi
Ddd DMSP lyases generates acrylate as one of the products, we
also examined if the mutation inacuI affected the growth of R.
pomeroyi when DMSP was in the medium. The wild type tolerated
concentrations greater than 20 mM, but growth of the AcuI2
mutant was strongly inhibited by this concentration of DMSP.
The insertional mutation intodmdA of R. pomeroyi led to similar
phenotypes as those in the AcuI2 mutant. Thus, growth of the
DmdA2 mutant was strongly inhibited on medium that contained
acrylate as low as 0.5 mM and on DMSP at 1 mM even in the
presence of the ‘‘regular’’ carbon source, succinate. There are two
likely contributing factors to explain why thedmdA mutation would
cause hypersensitivity to acrylate and to DMSP. First, the insertion
into dmdA is predicted to be polar on the expression of the
downstream acuI, which would abolish or reduce the AcuI-
mediated protective effects against acrylate, either added exoge-
nously, or generated by the cleavage of DMSP. Secondly, the
DmdA2 mutant would be expected to channel more of the DMSP
catabolic flux through one or more of the DMSP lyases, since the
demethylation pathway was blocked. Indeed, it was directly shown
by Howardet al.[9], that a DmdA2 mutant of this strain produced
more acrylate from DMSP than the wild type. Consistent with
this, we noted that production of DMS, the other product of the
cleavage pathway, was also enhanced,,5-fold, when our DmdA
2
mutant was assayed for DMSP lyase activity.
Further evidence for these explanations was obtained from a
series of complementation tests, using a series of separate plasmid
constructions as follows. We cloned theR. pomeroyi acuIand dmdA
genes, both individually and together, into the wide host-range
cloning vector pBIO1878 [25], and separately introduced the
resultant recombinant plasmids into the R. pomeroyi AcuI2 and
DmdA2 mutants in tri-parental conjugational matings. The
acrylate and DMSP sensitivities of both mutants were corrected
by the plasmids that contained acuI alone (pBIO2024) or in
tandem withdmdA (pBIO2022) but, significantly, the plasmid that
contained only dmdA (pBIO2021) did not overcome the sensitivity
to either of these compounds. Thus, the sensitivities to both
acrylate and to DMSP in the DmdA2 mutant must be due to the
effect of the insertional mutation on the expression of the
downstream acuI gene.
We noted a second link between acrylate and theR. pomeroyi
dmdA-acuI operon, which concerns its transcriptional regulation. In
the course of a microarray experiment, the expression levels of
both acuI and dmdA were substantially enhanced (,14-fold) when
the cells were grown in MBM minimal media in the presence of
5 mM DMSP. Significantly, when 5 mM acrylate was present in
the growth medium, the expression of these two genes was also
induced, and by a similar factor (,12-fold). This marked induction
of dmdA and of acuI by DMSP was not seen in a different
transcriptomic analysis of this strain by Bu¨rgmann et al.[30], most
likely because of the much lower concentration (80mM) of DMSP
that was added to the medium in that study.
To examine the expression of theR. pomeroyi DSS-3 dmdA-acuI
operon in more detail, we made twolacZ transcriptional fusion
plasmids, both based on the wide host-range reporter vector
pBIO1878 (See Figure 1). Both plasmids contained the promoter
region of thedmdA-acuI operon, but their 39 ends, fused to thelacZ
reporter, were either in dmdA (pBIO2020) or acuI (pBIO2021).
These two plasmids were each mobilised intoR. pomeroyiDSS-3 by
conjugation, and cultures of the transconjugants were each grown
in minimal medium, containing or lacking either acrylate or
DMSP (each at 5 mM) before assaying their b -galactosidase
activities. The results tallied with those in the microarrays; the
expression of both genes was markedly enhanced by both
compounds compared to the levels in the control medium, with
a ,10-fold increase with DMSP and,14-fold when acrylate was
in the growth medium. Thus, for the acuI-lacZ fusion, the b -
galactosidase activities were 5663 Miller Units in the control
medium, 502620 in the +DMSP and 780632 in the +acrylate
media. The finding that a breakdown product of the DMSP
cleavage pathway can induce the production of the DMSP
demethylase DmdA means that there is a regulatory tie-in between
the two pathways, with possible physiological consequences (see
below).
Discussion
Interest in the acuI gene stemmed from its close linkage to a
range of different ddd and dmdA genes that are involved in the
initial steps of DMSP catabolism in a wide range of bacteria. A
more direct link with DMSP, via one of its catabolites, acrylate,
came from observations on the acuR-acuI-dddL operon of
Rhodobacter sphaeroides; not only was its expression enhanced by
the co-inducer acrylate, but AcuI
2 mutants were less effective in
the breakdown of acrylate and were more sensitive to the growth-
inhibiting effects of this compound [11].
However, the bioinformatically and experimentally based
observations described here show that the role of theacuI gene
extends far beyond the realm of DMSP catabolism and DMSP-
catabolising bacteria. Furthermore, the recent demonstration that
AcuI of Rhodobacter sphaeroides has acryloyl-CoA reductase activity,
which converts acryloyl-CoA to propionyl-CoA [13], provides
significant, and highly relevant biochemical insights. Taken
together, these new data prompt us to propose a novel, and
potentially widespread, functional role for the AcuI-type gene
products, as follows.
In general terms, we suggest that the intracellular presence of a
compound that can be formed endogenously, but whose
production is elevated in cells that are grown with exogenous
acrylate, is extremely inhibitory to growth. The primary role of
AcuI is to act as a ‘‘cleansing agent’’ to reduce the concentrations
of this compound to sub-inhibitory levels. Given the enzymatic
activity of AcuI, the most likely suspect for this molecule is
acryloyl-CoA itself, whose cellular toxicity was alluded to by
Herrmann et al. [31]. Here, we consider the evidence in favour of
this model.
First, and most obviously, it explains why mutations inacuI of
Ruegeria, Rhodobacterand in the equivalent gene,yhdH,i nE. coliare
hypersensitive to the inhibitory effects of acrylate. Of the other
compounds tested, the AcuI
2/YhdH2 mutants were also sensitive
to 3-OH-propionate, consistent with its conversion to 3-OH-
propionyl-CoA, thence to acryloyl-CoA, as suggested by Schnei-
der et al. ([13]; see Figure 5). The fact that these hypersensitive
phenotypes of the E. coli YhdH
2 mutant were corrected by the
cloned acuI genes from a range of different bacteria confirmed that
these genes, too, are all functionally equivalent.
Acryloyl-CoA is predicted to be a very strong electrophile that
would react with other important molecules in the cell [31].
Although it was not demonstrated formally that acryloyl-CoA is
indeed the culprit that is responsible for the growth inhibition in
acrylate-grown cells (and, less so, in response to 3HP), there is a
precedent in which a related molecule, propionyl-CoA, was
reported to be a ‘‘suicide substrate’’ that inactivated a short-chain
acyl-CoA dehydrogenase, due to modification of its flavin adenine
dinucleotide (FAD) cofactor [32]. It is unlikely that the inhibitory
effects seen with acrylate are due solely to the interaction of
acryloyl-CoA with the FAD of bacterial acyl-CoA dehydrogenase
itself, since mutations in the E. coli fadE gene that encodes this
A Bacterial Gene for Acrylate Resistance

enzyme are capable of normal growth, unless forced to use a fatty
acid such as oleate as a carbon course [33]. However, if the more
reactive acryloyl-CoA did react with FAD of other enzymes that
contain this cofactor, or its reduced FADH2 form, then this might
form the basis of its inhibitory effects if such enzymes include any
that are needed for normal growth.
One implication of this model is that many bacteria (including
E. coli K-12) can convert exogenous acrylate to acryloyl-CoA.
There have been no reports of such an activity inE. coli, and, to
our knowledge this bacterium does not encounter acrylate in its
natural environment. The same holds true for many of the other
bacteria, in a range of different taxa, that also harbour close
homologues of AcuI. It therefore seems unlikely thatE. coli has a
dedicated acryloyl-CoA ligase activity. However, at least one
acetyl-CoA ligase enzyme has broad specificity and can attach
CoA to other substrates, including acrylate [34]. Indeed, we have
noted that when 1 mM14C acrylate was fed to mid-log phase
cultures ofE. coliBL21, ca. 75% of the counts appeared as14CO2
after 16 hours incubation, with concomitant loss of the original
labelled substrate (M.J. Sullivan, unpublished). So, E. coli, and
perhaps an unexpectedly wide range of bacteria, may be able to
catabolise acrylate in vivo, albeit rather inefficiently.
Concerning the linkage ofacuI with several different classes of
DMSP catabolic genes in different bacteria, we propose that this is
an adaptive response in which the AcuI enzyme may counter the
inhibitory effects of the acrylate that is obtained directly from the
environment and/or which is made by cleavage of DMSP by Ddd
lyase(s). Although the terms ‘‘acrylate’’ and ‘‘acrylic’’ are in
common parlance, this is largely because these are widely used
feed-stocks in the petrochemical industry. To our knowledge, the
only natural environments in which there are significant amounts
of acrylate are those, such as coral reefs, with very high levels of
DMSP, much of which is converted to acrylate by microbial action
[35,36].
As shown above, though, the acuI gene of many DMSP-
catabolising bacteria is not linked to the DMSP catabolic genes.
However, the features and distributions of thoseddd/dmdA genes
that do or do not have a closely linkedacuI gene are informative.
Most notably, the only case in whichacuI is near thedddD gene is
in Halomonas HTNK1, and this is the only knowndddD cluster that
also includes theacuN and acuK genes. Significantly, DddD is the
only known DMSP lyase that does not generate acrylate as its C3
product, so, in most bacteria that harbordddD, there is no need for
any dedicated protection system from the damaging effects of
acrylate and its subsequent catabolite(s). However, the possession
of the acuN and acuK genes confers on Halomonas HTNK1 the
ability to catabolise exogenous acrylate, converting it to 3HP, the
same initial catabolite as that generated by the action of DddD on
DMSP. Furthermore, acryloyl-CoA is a predicted transient
intermediate in the conversion of acrylate to 3HP, since the AcuN
polypeptide is in a family of acyl-CoA transferases. Therefore, this
unusual, dual-purposeddd/acu gene cluster ofHalomonas may have
recruited a closely linkedacuI gene for ‘‘added protection’’ [8].
Turning to DddY, another enzyme that does release acrylate
from DMSP, there are nearbyacuI genes in nearly all the diverse
bacteria that contain this lyase, the only exceptions, to date, being
in Shewanella frigidimarina NCIMB 400 and Ferrimonas balearica
DSM9799, both of which have acuI homologues, but these are
elsewhere in their genomes. InAlcaligenes faecalisM3A, the intimate
relationship of acrylate and itsacuI gene is further emphasised by
the fact that expression of its adjacentacuI-dddY genes is massively
increased when the cells were grown in the presence of acrylate
[20].
In contrast, concerning the genes for the four other DMSP
lyases, there are no acuI-like genes near
dddQ and dddW in any
bacteria to date, and only one case each in whichdddP (Candidatus
Puniceispirillum marinum) ordddL (Rhodobacter sphaeroides) is close
to acuI, even though all these genes encode DMSP lyases that
cleave DMSP into acrylate plus DMS. Our explanation for this is
that with the exceptions of the very few cases of horizontal gene
transfer, these four ddd genes are confined to the Roseobacters
and, in the majority of genome-sequenced strains of this clade,
Figure 5. AcuI-mediated conversion of acryloyl-CoA to propionyl-CoA.The pathway from 3-hydroxypropionate to propionyl-CoA is
adapted from Schneideret al.[13]. Also shown is how DMSP lyases can generate acrylate, which is postulated to be converted to acryolyl-CoA by a
CoA-ligase, as yet unidentified. The exact identity of the DMSP lyase is strain-dependent; e.g.,Rhodobacter sphaeroides has the DddL lyase, and in
Ruegeria pomeroyi, the acrylate can be generated from DMSP by DddP, DddQ and/or DddW.

A Bacterial Gene for Acrylate Resistance

their acuI gene is immediately downstream of theirdmdA genes.
The ability to catabolise DMSP, both by demethylation and by
cleavage, is part of the core lifestyle of the Roseobacters [18,37], as
witnessed by the fact that the great majority of them contain both
dmdA plus at least oneddd gene. However, the particular portfolio
of ddd gene varies considerably from strain to strain [18,23]. From
an adaptive point of view, it may therefore be most efficient ifacuI
is linked todmdA, so that its product can deal with the potentially
harmful consequences of the acrylate that is formed byany of the
DMSP lyases in the same strain. In the SAR11 clade, the other
major group of bacteria with the DmdA DMSP demethylase, their
acuI genes are not linked todmdA, consistent with the fact that these
bacteria do not cleave DMSP into acrylate plus DMS, so have no
need for a specialised acrylate protection system that connects to
DMSP catabolism.
The linkage and co-expression ofdmdA and the downstreamacuI
gene may also affect the ways in which the Roseobacters partition
the DMSP catabolic flux between the cleavage and the
demethylation routes. The relative importance of these pathways
in R. pomeroyi DSS-3 had been shown to be influenced by the
concentrations of the DMSP substrate, with a higher relative flux
through the cleavage route as the DMSP concentrations increased
[17]. Furthermore, DmdA
2 mutants produce proportionally more
acrylate and DMS from DMSP than does the wild type ([9]; see
above), due to the blockage of the demethylation pathways, which
results in more of the substrate being available for cleavage by the
DddP, DddQ and/or DddW DMSP lyases of this strain. However,
our new finding that the acrylate that is produced by these lyases is
itself a likely co-inducer ofdmdA means that there is also a more
direct regulatory link between the expression of the cleavage and
demethylation pathways. This could have a homeostatic outcome,
whereby, as the intracellular levels of acrylate rise due to lyase
activities, there is increased expression of the DmdA demethylase.
Thus, by increasing the flux through the demethylation pathway,
less DMSP substrate is available for the acrylate-generating action
of the Ddd lyases and by enhancing the levels of AcuI, there is
enhanced protection against the potential damage, most likely
inflicted by acryloyl CoA. Then as the acrylate levels drop, the
relative inputs of the various lyases rise, with a concomitant
increase in intracellular acrylate. The situation may be more
complex, though, for at least two reasons.
Firstly, the expression of one of the ddd genes, dddW,i s
considerably enhanced in cells ofR. pomeroyi DSS-3 grown in the
presence of DMSP, but acrylate is not a co-inducer for this gene
[25]. Secondly, although the demethylation pathway inR. pomeroyi
DSS-3 that was described recently [10] does not generate any
acrylate, a previously suggested catabolic scheme proposed that
MMPA, the initially demethylated product of DMSP, is subject to
demethiolation in a step that would yield acrylate plus methane
thiol [38,39]. Since this has not been formally precluded as
method for DMSP catabolism, albeit a minor one, it is possible
that some of the acrylate that acts as a co-inducer of thedmdA-acuI
operon may have originated by this route.
The very fact that a catabolic product (in this case, acrylate)
enhances the expression of an enzyme that acts on thesubstrate
(DMSP) is, in itself, an unusual phenomenon in bacterial gene
regulation. However, this mode of control is a feature of bacterial
catabolism of DMSP and was first noted in physiological
experiments, in which pre-growth of different bacteria in the
presence of DMSP or 3HP enhanced their levels of DMSP lyase
activity [5]. Since then, these DMSP catabolites were shown to be
co-inducers of ddd catabolic genes in other bacteria, such as
Halomonas and Alcaligenes [6]. Indeed, in Rhodobacter sphaeroides,
although the substrate DMSP appeared to induce itsdddL gene,
the DMSP had to be cleaved by the DddL lyase, forming thebona
fide co-inducer, acrylate [11]. It is striking that this phenomenon of
catabolite-responsive gene induction extends to the dmdA gene
involved in the demethylation pathway. Prompted by this
observation, we also investigated if MMPA, the demethylated
derivative of DMSP generated by the action of the DmdA
demethylase was a co-inducer of thedmdA-acuI operon; however,
there was no induction of thedmdA-lacZ or acuI-lacZ fusions when
strains of Ruegeria carrying the corresponding reporter plasmids
were pre-grown in the presence of 5 mM MMPA.
It is noteworthy that many bacteria do not have close
homologues of AcuI in their deduced proteomes. These may be
entire clades, such as the Chlamydiae Phylum or the Order
Pasteurellales within thec-Proteobacteria. Perhaps more striking-
ly, there are also several cases in which individual genera include
some strains that do and some that do not containacuI. Indeed, we
demonstrated directly that the cloned pRL120182 gene of
Rhizobium leguminosarum 3841, whose product is a predicted AcuI
enzyme, conferred acrylate resistance to the E. coli YhdH
2
mutant. Yet, a very closely related strain, Sinorhizobium fredii
NGR234, lacks an AcuI homologue but in our hands (unpub-
lished) was as tolerant of acrylate in the medium asR. leguminosarum
3841.
Do these various strains that lack AcuI have alternative methods
to circumvent the toxic effects of acrylate? In that connection,
Hetzel et al. [40] purified a heterotrimeric enzyme with acryloyl-
CoA reductase activity from Clostridium propionicum, but the N-
terminal sequences of none of the polypeptides resembled that of
AcuI. Similarly, the conversion of acryloyl-CoA to propionyl-CoA
by two other MDR family members has been reported in the
Crenarchaeota, Sulfolobus tokodaii [41] and the green non-sulfur
bacterium, Chloroflexus aurantiacus[42]. Both strains engage in CO
2
fixation, using a cycle that includes the conversion of acryloyl CoA
to propionyl-CoA. InChloroflexus, this is mediated by two adjacent
MDR-type domains within a multi-functional protein, but in the
Archaea, this reductive step was performed by a stand-alone MDR
polypeptide. However, the sequence similarities of both these
enzymes to the MDR012 class of AcuI/YhdH polypeptides
studied here is very limited.
Although acuI was first of interest because of its link with
acrylate in bacteria that synthesised this molecule via DMSP
catabolism, this is just one aspect of a wider and more important
role for this gene and its close relatives. This even extends to the
allocation of a function to anE. coligene whose current description
is ‘‘Putative quinone oxidoreductase, function unknown’’ (‘‘eco-
gene’’; http://ecogene.org/geneinfo.php?eg_id=EG11315). Al-
though the work described here includes the first example of a
phenotype that can been ascribed to mutations in theE. coli yhdH
gene, the molecular basis of the inhibitory effects of acrylate
remain to be formally confirmed as, indeed, does the proposal that
acryloyl-CoA is the toxic molecule. It will also be of interest to
establish if other enzymes, which do not resemble AcuI in their
sequence, but which mimic its role in conferring acrylate
resistance, occur in other organisms that do not have a
recognisable acuI gene in their genomes.

acrylate, each at 5 mM, prior to being assayed forb-galactosidase
as described in Rossen et al. [46]. The transcriptional fusion
plasmid vector was pBIO1878, which is based on pMP220 [47]
and includes a selectable Spc
R cassette to facilitate selection in
Roseobacters [25].
In vitro and in vivo genetic manipulations
General handling and manipulation of DNA were done as in
Wexler et al. [48]. Plasmids were conjugated into the RifR R.
pomeroyi strain J470 by triparental mating using helper plasmid
pRK2013 [49].
Gene amplification and construction of plasmids and
mutants
Fragments of genomic DNA containing the intactyhdH of E. coli
and the acuI genes of a selection of other bacteria, were each
amplified by PCR from genomic DNA obtained from theE. coli
K12 strain BW25113, Ruegeria pomeroyi DSS-3, Rhodobacter
sphaeroides 2.4.1 [50], Alcaligenes faecalis M3A [20], Halomonas sp.
HTNK1 [8], Rhizobium leguminosarum 3841 [51] and Burkholderia
ambifaria AMMD [19] using primers that contained appropriate
restriction sites (Table S2). Digested PCR products were then
ligated into pET16b, pET21a, pRK415 [52] or pBIO1878 and
transformed into E. coli strain 803 [53]. For cloning Roseovarius
nubinhibens ISM_14095, a 4 kbPstI fragment from pBIO1880 was
sub-cloned into pBluescript [54]. TheArcobacter nitrofigilis acuIgene
was identified by screening a genomic library in the cosmid vector
pLAFR3 [55] of this strain for any cosmids that corrected the
acrylate sensitivity of the YhdH
2 mutant.
To facilitate the cloning of theR. pomeroyi dmdAand acuI genes,
together with their promoter, a 2.4 kb PCR fragment containing
both these genes was first cloned into pBluescript usingXbaI and
BamHI sites in the primer sequences, yielding plasmid pBIO2019.
To construct thedmdA-lac fusion plasmid, pBIO2019 was digested
with XbaI andPstI, releasing a 350 bp fragment that contained the
dmdA/acuI promoter and whose 39 end was within dmdA. This
fragment was then cloned into pBIO1878 (Spc
R/TetR), forming
pBIO2020. To construct an acuI-lac fusion plasmid, pBIO2019
was digested withXbaI and NsiI, releasing a 1.4 kb fragment that
contained the dmdA/acuI promoter and whose 39 end was inacuI.
This fragment was cloned into pBIO1878 that had been digested
with XbaI plus PstI to form pBIO2021.
For the complementation tests with the AcuI
2 and DmdA2
mutants of R. pomeroyi DSS-3, the following plasmids were
constructed. The 2.4 kb fragment that contains intactdmdA and
acuI plus their promoter, which was used to construct pBIO2019
(see above), was released from that plasmid and cloned into
pBIO1878 to form pBIO2022. To cloneacuI alone, though still
under the control of its own promoter, plasmid pBIO2019 was first
digested withSphI, then religated in a procedure that removed three
SphI fragments internal todmdA, but which leavesacuI intact. The
deletant plasmid pBIO2023 was then digested with XbaI plus
BamHI and the released fragment was sub-cloned into pBIO1878,
forming pBIO2024. The plasmid that contained onlydmdA was
pBIO2021, described above. The dimensions and names of the
relevant plasmids are shown in Figure 1 and Table S1. All
recombinant plasmids were ratified by sequencing of the inserts,
performed by Genome Enterprise Ltd, Norwich Research Park,
Norwich, UK.
The insertional mutations intoacuI and intodmdA of R. pomeroyi
were made by a procedure in which fragments internal to each of
the two genes were cloned, separately, into the suicide plasmid
vector pBIO1879 [24], a Spc
R derivative of the suicide vector
pK19mob [56]. The internal dmdA fragment was made by
amplifying a 800 bp fragment fromR. pomeroyi DSS-3 genomic
DNA using forward and reverse primers (Table S2) which
respectively contain EcoR1 and PstI restriction sites, prior to
cloning into pBIO1879, cut with the same enzymes to form
pBIO1870. A 960 bpacuI internal DNA fragment was made by
digesting pBIO2019 withSalI, and this was then cloned intoSalI-
digested pBIO1879 to form pBIO2025. The two plasmids
pBIO1870 and pBIO2025 were then each conjugated to R.
pomeroyi DSS-3 in triparental matings, selecting RifR/SpcR/KanR
transconjugants, which should arise via a single cross-over event
within the corresponding genes. These mutants were confirmed by
colony PCR and Southern Blotting and were termed J527 (AcuI2)
and J471 (DmdA2).
The E. coli strains BW25113 and itsyhdH2 mutant derivative
JW3222-1 were obtained from the Keio collection ofE. coli K-12
in-frame, single-gene knockout mutants [57] through theE. coli
Genetic Stock Center, Yale University, New Haven, Connecticut.
Growth inhibition experiments
Starter cultures of the variousE. coli or R. pomeroyi strains were
grown to mid log-phase in complete medium. Cells were adjusted
to equivalent OD600 values, washed in minimal medium. ForE.
coli,1 0 ml aliquots were spotted onto plates of M9 minimal agar
medium containing varying levels of acrylate, DMSP or other
tester compounds. Growth was scored after incubation at 37uC for
20 hours. ForR. pomeroyi, cells were used to inoculate 5 ml MBM
minimal media containing 10 mM succinate as carbon source and
varying levels (50
mM to 10 mM) of acrylate or DMSP (200mM-
20 mM). Cultures were incubated at 28uC, with shaking and the
growth levels recorded after 48 hours.
In silico analysis
Sequence analysis was performed using BLAST at NCBI
(http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi) and ‘‘Roseobase’’
(http://www.roseobase.org/). Phylogenetic trees were produced
using the Maximum Likelihood method based on the JTT matrix-
based model [58]. Evolutionary analyses were conducted in
MEGA5 [59].
