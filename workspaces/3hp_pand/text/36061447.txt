Fluorine has become an important element for the design of synthetic
molecules for use in medicine, agriculture, and materials. The introduction
of ﬂuorine atoms into organic compound molecules can often give these
compounds new functions and make them have better performance.
Despite the many advantages provided byﬂuorine for tuning key molecular
properties, it is rarely found in natural metabolism. We seek to expand the
molecular space available for discovery through the development of new
biosynthetic strategies that cross synthetic with natural compounds.
Towards this goal, 2-ﬂuoro-3-hydroxypropionic acid (2-F-3-HP) was ﬁrst
synthesized using E. coli coexpressing methylmalonyl CoA synthase
(MatBrp), methylmalonyl CoA reductase (MCR) and malonate
transmembrane protein (MadLM). The concentration of 2-F-3-HP reached
50.0 mg/L by whole-cell transformation after 24 h. 2-F-3-HP can be used as
the substrate to synthesize other ﬂuorides, such as poly (2- ﬂuoro-3-
hydroxypropionic acid) (FP3HP). Being entirely biocatalytic, our procedure
provides considerable advantages in terms of environmental and safety
impacts over reported chemical methods.

Introduction
Organic ﬂuorides are important compounds that are widely
used in the ﬁelds of pharmaceuticals, molecular imaging, and
materials (Klopries et al., 2014; Wu et al., 2020a; Cheng and Ma,
2021). Fluorinated natural products are extremely rare in nature
(Cheng and Ma, 2021). However, the introduction ofﬂuorine
atoms into organic compound molecules can often give these
compounds new functions and make them have better
performance (Klopries et al., 2014; Ningning et al., 2020; Tu
et al., 2020). The target compounds doped with ﬂuorine are
endowed with stronger stability and activity (Tu et al., 2020),
longer half-life, and better bioabsorbability (Ningning et al.,
2020), especially in theﬁelds of pharmaceutical intermediates,
cancer treatment ( Lowe et al., 2019 ), antiviral agents,
photovoltaics, diagnostic probes ( Onega et al., 2010 ) and
bioinspired materials ( Ningning et al., 2020 ). For example,
Benjamin W. Thuronyi et al. reported the introduction of
ﬂuorine into poly (3-hydroxybutyric acid) (P3HB) to obtain
poly (2- ﬂuoro-3-hydroxybutyric acid-co-3-hydroxybutyric
acid) (poly (FHB-co-HB)), and the results show that the glass
transition temperature of poly (FHB-co-HB) is much lower than
that of P3HB (Thuronyi et al., 2017).
Despite the many advantages provided byﬂuorine for tuning
key molecular properties, it is rarely found in natural
metabolism, which limits the application of ﬂuorine-
containing compounds ( Thuronyi and Chang, 2015 ; Cheng
and Ma, 2021 ). Accordingly, the arti ﬁcial synthesis of
ﬂuorinated compounds has become an important alternative
in modern society. Nonetheless, these conventional chemical
synthesis methods required precious metals, toxic and
contaminating chemical reagents, high temperature and
pressure and extreme conditions (Berger et al., 2020; Rodrigo
et al., 2020). This is not conducive to the sustainable development
of green chemicals and the global economy.
In contrast, the biosynthesis methods are good supplements
in the ﬁeld of chemical synthesis, especially for ﬂuorinated
compounds (Wu et al., 2020a ). At present, of all enzyme-
catalyzed synthesis methods, the direct formation of the C-F
bond by ﬂuorinase is the most effective and promising method
(Cheng and Ma, 2021). Fluorinase can participate in biological
metabolic pathways and synthesize valuable organicﬂuorides,
such as ﬂuoroacetic acid (Li et al., 2010; Stephanie et al., 2019)
and 4- ﬂuorothreonine ( Wu et al., 2020b ). However, the
biosynthesis of organic ﬂuorides by ﬂuorinase is limited. On
the one hand, ﬂuoride ions have an inhibitory effect on the
growth ofE. coli(Last et al., 2016). On the other hand,ﬂuorinase
requires the expensive co-substrate S-adenosyl methionine
(SAM) (Li et al., 2010; Feng et al., 2021; Kittila et al., 2022),
and transmembrane transport of SAM requires the assistance of
transporters (Schafﬁtzel et al., 1998). These all limit the catalytic
efﬁciency of ﬂuorinase. Therefore, there are few studies on the
biosynthesis of organicﬂuorides.
3-Hydroxypropionic acid (3-HP) is an important platform
compound with a wide range of applications (Liu et al., 2016). It
is easy to synthesize a variety of chemical products through
different chemical reactions. For example, poly (3-
hydroxypropionic acid) (P3HP) can be synthesized by 3-HP
(Wang et al., 2013a; YongChang et al., 2014). Furthermore,
malonate, 1,3-propanediol, acrylic acid, propiolactone and
other products can be obtained through oxidation, reduction,
dehydration, cyclization and other reactions, and the obtained
products can be further used to synthesize products with higher
added value (Valdehuesa et al., 2013). In theory, 2-ﬂuoro-3-
hydroxypropionic acid (2-F-3-HP) also produces many
corresponding substances to expand the types of ﬂuorine-
containing organics, such as 2-ﬂuoroacrylic acid (Figure 1).
However, there is no biosynthetic pathway for 2-F-3-HP.
In this study, we constructed a four-gene, two-plasmid
system for the biosynthesis of 2-F-3-HP using 2-ﬂuoromalonic
acid (2-FMA) as the initial ﬂuorine source. 2-FMA is both
relatively inexpensive and capable of being produced through
enzymatic pathways while avoiding the acute organoﬂuorine
poisoning arising from the direct application ofﬂuoroacetate
to cells (Thuronyi et al., 2017). After whole-cell transformation,
2-F-3-HP (50.0 mg/L) wasﬁrst synthesized by the engineered
E. colicoexpressing methylmalonyl CoA synthase (MatBrp) from
Rhodopseudomonas palustris , methylmalonyl CoA reductase
(MCR) from Thermophilic Filiculture and malonate
transmembrane protein (MadLM) fromPseudomonas pf5 with
2-FMA as substrate (Scheme 1). The advantages of this method
over chemical methods mainly included the use of green and
cheap substrates, solvents and catalysts in mild and safe reaction
conditions, and no toxic waste was generated. This method may
be applicable to analogue of 2-F-3-HP, such as 2- ﬂuoro-3-

hydroxybutyric acid. Furthermore, according to the previous
research in our lab, manipulating the expression levels of 3-
hydroxybutyric acid (3-HB) and 3-HP pathways resulted in
biosynthesis of block copolymers P3HB-b-P3HP with varied
compositions, which improved properties of copolymers
(Wang et al., 2013b). Theoretically, 2-F-3-HP and 2-ﬂuoro-3-
hydroxybutyric acid (2-F-3-HB), which has already been
biosynthesized ( Thuronyi et al., 2017 ), could also achieve
similar results and possibly have better properties. In a word,
the 2-F-3-HP synthesized in this study has broad application
prospects.
Materials and methods
Materials
2-FMA and other chemicals were obtained from Aladdin
(Shanghai, China). A DNA gel extraction kit, plasmid
puriﬁcation kit, Primer STAR Max and DNA marker were
obtained from TAKARA (Japan). Protein markers and
T4 DNA ligase were obtained from Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc
(United States). M9 Minimal Salts (M9 buffer) were obtained
from Sangon Biotech (Shanghai, China). E. coli BL21 (DE3)
competent cells were purchased from Vazyme (Nanjing, China).
Construction of plasmids and strains
The MatBrp (WP_011155789.1), Mcr (AAS20429.1), MadL
(AAY95003.2), MadM gene (WP_011063986.1) were
synthesized by Beijing Genomics Institute (Beijing, China).
The synthesized MatBrp was digested with BglII, and the
synthesized Mcr was digested with BglII and BamHI. The
digested MatBrp and Mcr were ligated into the pET28a vector,
which was digested withNcoI, EcoRV and KpnI. The MadLM
gene was digested withBglII and XbaI, and the digested fragment
was ligated into the pBAD, which was digested with theEcoRI,
XbaI andHindIII. The constructed vector was transformed into
E. coli BL21 (DE3).
Enzyme activity analysis
E. coli cells BL21 (DE3) harboring recombinant plasmids
were incubated at 37 °C for 12 h in 5 ml of LB medium
(containing 100 μg/ml Amp and 34 μg/ml Cm, pH7.0). The
grown cells (5 ml) were then transferred into 50 ml of LB
medium (containing 100 μg/ml Amp and 34 μg/ml Cm,
pH7.0) and cultivated at 37
°C in the thermostatic incubator
(ZHICHENG ZWYR-D2403, China). When OD600 nm reached
0.6, 0.5 mM isopropyl beta-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG)
and 0.02% arabinose were added. The cells were harvested by
centrifugation (Himac CR21N, Japan) at 6,000 rpm for 5 min
and washed with 100 mM Tris-HCl (containing 10 mM MgCl2,
pH 7.8). After the cells (10 g of wet weight) were disrupted
by a high-pressure cell cracker (Constant systems One shot
40KPSI, England), the cell debris was discarded, the
supernatant (crude enzyme solution) was obtained by
centrifugation (10000 rpm, 30 min, 4
°C). The standard assay
was as followed: 1 mg/ml crude enzyme, 20 mM 2-FMA, 2 mM
NADPH, 2 mM ATP, 1 mM CoA, 100 mM Tris-HCl buffer
(10 mM MgCl2), pH 7.8, 30 °C, 200 rpm, 12 h. The reaction
solution was detected by LC-MS.
Whole-cell transformation
E. coli cells BL21 (DE3) harboring recombinant plasmids
were incubated at 37°C for 12 h in 5 ml of LB medium containing
appropriate antibiotics. The grown cells (5 ml) were then
transferred into 50 ml of LB medium containing appropriate
antibiotics and cultivated at 37
°C in the thermostatic incubator.
When OD600 nmreached 0.6, 0.5 mM IPTG and 0.02% arabinose
were added.
The cells were washed with M9 buffer (15.12 g/L
Na2HPO4·12 H2O, 3 g/L KH2PO4, 0.5 g/L NaCl and 1 g/L
NH4Cl, pH 7.0) to remove residual culture media and further
resuspended in M9 buffer. The typical assay to directly measure
reaction products was performed as follows: wet whole cells
(OD
600 nm = 30), 4 mM 2-FMA, 8% glucose and 10 mM MgSO4.
Reactions were performed in M9 buffer (pH 7.0) at 30°C with
persistent stirring at 200 rpm. After centrifugation, the
supernatants were analyzed by HPLC.

Results and discussions
Design of synthetic pathway for 2-F-3-HP
In this study, 2-FMA was used as a substrate to biosynthesize
2-F-3-HP by the catalysis of MatBrp and MCR. The synthetic
process of the 2-FMA was simple and mild. On the one hand, 2-
FMA can be synthesized by microorganisms (Thuronyi et al.,
2017). On the other hand, diethyl 2-FMA and lithium hydroxide
monohydrate are used as raw materials to synthesize 2-FMA by
chemical method, which is simple to operate and stable in
process conditions (Darren et al., 2021). Furthermore, 2-FMA
can be catalyzed by MatBrp to generate ﬂuoromalonyl-CoA,
therefore, theoretically, the conversion of 2-FMA to 2-F-HP
could be achieved by co-expressing MatBrp and MCR.
The malonate transporter MadLM fromPseudomonas can
transport 2-FMA into cells and improve the yield of
ﬂuoromalonyl-CoA (Schafﬁtzel et al., 1998; Thuronyi et al.,
2017). Therefore, MadLM was co-expressed with MatBrp and
MCR to verify the effect of MadLM on the yield of 2-F-3-HP. All
strains and plasmids used in this study listed inTable 1.
Expression levels of MatBrp and MCR
After induction, recombinant strain 2 (Bl21 (DE3)/
pACYCDuet1-MatBrp-Mcr/pBAD-madLM) was collected,
and soluble expression levels of MatBrp and MCR were detected
by SDS-PAGE. Compared with the control strain 1 (BL21 (DE3)/

pACYCDute1/pBAD), MatBrp (55 kDa) and MCR (135 kDa) were
expressed in the recombinant strain 2 (Figure 2). The soluble
expression of MatBrp is signiﬁcantly higher than that of MCR,
which may be that MatBrp has a small protein molecular weight and
is easier to fold correctly.
Enzyme activity analysis
Using the crude enzyme of the recombinant strain as
the catalyst, and NADPH, ATP and coenzyme A as the donors,
the purpose was to verify that 2-FMA could be catalyzed by MatBrp
and MCR to generate 2-F-3-HP. The formation of 2-F-3-HP was
analyzed by HPLC-MS and the results are shown inFigure 3.
Compared with strain 1, the reaction solution of strain 2 has a peak
in about 2.50 min. In the strain 1 reaction solution containing 2-F-3-
HP standard, the retention time of 2-F-3-HP was 2.5 min.
Compared with strain 1, the reaction solution of strain
2 contains the characteristic peak EIC m/z = 107.0000. The
results showed that MCR and MatBrp had the activity of
catalyzing the formation of 2-F-3-HP. The retention time of the
2-F-3-HP standard is 3.0 min, which may be the
complex environment of the crude enzyme system affecting the
retention time of 2-F-3-HP, resulting in that the retention time of 2-
F-3-HP in the sample was 2.5 min.
The concentrated reactionmixture was analyzed by
19F-NMR,
and allﬂuorometabolites present in the samples were scanned. The
same peak (similar chemical shift) as that of the standard was
detected in the sample, which indicated that 2-F-3-HP was
generated in the sample (Figure 4).
Whole-cell biocatalytic synthesis of 2-F-
3-HP
To assess the ability of strain 2 to produce the product, the
titer of 2-F-3-HP was detected after whole-cell biocatalytic
synthesis. Compared with strain 1, the concentration of 2-F-3-
HP in strain 2 was 50.0 mg/L by HPLC detection (Table 2).
The concentration of the product is very low, which may be the
low activity of the MatBrp and MCR for non-natural substrate, or
the toxicity of the 2-FMA to the cells. In the future, two key enzymes
can be rationally designed to improve the enzymatic activity for the
corresponding substrate.
Conclusion
In this study, 2-F-3-HP was ﬁrst synthesized by the
engineered E. coli coexpressing MatBrp, MCR and MadLM

with 2-FMA as substate. After whole-cell transformation, the
50.0 mg/L 2-F-3-HP was produced. 2-F-3-HP can be used as the
substrate to synthesize otherﬂuorides, such as poly (2-ﬂuoro-3-
