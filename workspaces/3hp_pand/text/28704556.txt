Abstract
Currently, little is known about the microbial diversity in the sediments of Pacmanus and
Desmos hydrothermal fields in Manus Basin. In this study, Illumina-based sequencing of
16S rRNA gene amplicons and metagenomic analysis were conducted to investigate the
microbial populations and metabolic profiles in the sediments from four different regions in
Pacmanus and Desmos hydrothermal fields. It was found that Gammaproteobacter ia and
Thaumarchaeota were the most abundant bacterial and archaeal populations, respectively.
The autotrophic prokaryotes in the four communities probably fixed CO

via four major path-
ways, i.e. Calvin-Benso n-Bassham cycle, reductive acetyl-CoA cycle, rTCA cycle, and 3-
hydroxypropionate /4-hydroxybutyrat e cycle. Ammonia-oxidizin g Thaumarchaeota, nitrifiers,
denitrifiers, and sulfur oxidizers belonging to the subgroups of Proteobacte ria (e.g., alpha,
beta, gamma, and epsilon), Nitrospira, and Nitrospina, and sulfate-reducin g Desulfobact er-
ales likely played critical roles in nitrogen and sulfur cycling, in which ammonia, sulfur com-
pounds, and hydrogen could be utilized as potential energy sources. These findings
revealed new insights into the operational mechanism of the microbial communities associ-
ated with Pacmanus and Desmos hydrothermal fields.
Introduction
Manus Basin is located behind the New Britain arc-trench system [1]. Pacmanus, Desmos, and
Susu Knolls are the three major hydrothermal fields in the eastern part of the basin [2,3]. The
Pacmanus field in Pual Ridge was discovered in 1991, which consists of five discrete high-tem-
perature hydrothermal sites (Roger’s Ruins, Roman Ruins, Satanic Mills, Tsukushi, and Fen-
way), a low-temperature diffuse vent site (Snowcap), and four new vent sites (Mimosa, Solwara
6, 7, and 8) [2–6]. The Snowcap area is heavily sedimented with hydrothermal precipitate/volca-
niclastic debris and covered by bacterial mats [5,7]. In Fenway, a large black smoker chimney

has been found to discharge the highest temperature fluids (358˚C) observed at the Pacmanus
field [5]. Solwara 8 is located southeast of Fenway and hosts black smoker chimneys releasing
high-temperature fluids [6].

directly through altered volcanic breccia and hydrothermal sediments composed of abundant
native sulfur and anhydrite [1]. The pH values range from 1.5 to 3.0 in low temperature fluids
(88~120˚C) in Desmos field and in high temperature fluids (241~358˚C) in Pacmanus field
[1,5,9]. The remarkable fluid acidity has been suggested to be due to the magmatic gases CO

,
SO

, and HF [1,5,10]. In addition, the acidic hydrothermal fluid likely contributes to the high
aluminum concentrations in the hydrothermal plumes collected from Desmos [8]. Studies on
mineral composition and hydrothermal fluid chemistry indicate magmatic contributions to
the hydrothermal activities in Pacmanus and Desmos [1,5,8,10,11].
To date, two studies on the microbes in the hydrothermal fields of Manus Basin have been
documented [12,13]. In one of these studies, the distribution of microorganisms in the subsur-
faces of a hydrothermal vent in Papua New Guinea was investigated by using subvent rock
core samples, in which microbial cells were detected at depths of less than 99.4 m below the
seafloor [12]. In another study, the distribution of archaea in a black smoker chimney structure
in the Pacmanus site near Papua New Guinea was determined [13]. However, nothing is
known about the microbial populations in the sediments from Pacmanus and Desmos hydro-
thermal fields.
The primary goal of the present study was to investigate the composition, diversity, and
metabolism of the microbial communities inhabiting the sediments located at different regions
in Pacmanus and Desmos hydrothermal fields. To achieve this purpose, we employed Illumina
HiSeq-based sequencing, a technique frequently used to study microbial diversity in various
environments [14–16], and metagenomic approaches. The results of this study will facilitate
our understanding of microbial survival strategies in deep-sea hydrothermal systems.
Materials and methods
Sample collection
The samples used in this study were collected in June, 2015 during the cruise conducted by the
scientific research vessel KEXUE in Manus Basin. The cruise was approved by Chinese Minis-
try of Foreign Affairs and with permit from the relevant country. The sediment samples
approximately 100 m from active vents in Pacmanus and Desmos hydrothermal fields were
collected by push-cores on ROV equipped on KEXUE vessel. Samples PR1 (151˚40’11.608’’E,
3˚43’43.216’’S; 1680 m) and PR4 (151˚40’38.477’’E, 3˚44’02.482’’S; 1853 m) were from Pacma-
nus; samples DR7 (151˚52’49.685’’E, 3˚42’46.446’’S; 2003 m) and DR11 (151˚51’50.212’’E, 3˚
40’45.187’’S; 1906 m) were from Desmos. The temperature and concentrations of CO

and

of the sampling sites were in situ detected (Table 1). After sampling, the superficial 3–5
cm layer of each sediment core was removed on board before sediment division with sterile
operation. Surface sediments (upper 10 cm), which were used in the study, were contained in
aseptic sampling bags (Haibo, Qingdao, China). The samples were stored at -80˚C and kept on
dry ice during transportation.
Chemical analysis
Chemical compositions of the samples were analyzed by the Research Center of Analysis and
Measurement, Institute of Oceanology, Chinese Academy of Sciences. The details of sample
processing have been described previously [17,18]. The concentrations of total organic carbon

(TOC), total nitrogen (TN) and total sulfur (TS) were determined using an elemental analyzer
(Elementar, Germany). Metal elements were analyzed with an inductively coupled plasma
optical emission spectroscopy (Perkin Elmer, USA) using a strong acid digestion method [19].
DNA extraction
Approximately 0.3 g of each sample was used for total DNA extraction using TIANamp Soil
DNA Kit (Tiangen, Beijing, China) following the manufacturer’s protocol. DNA was qualified
using NanoPhotometer spectrophotometer (IMPLEN, CA, USA) and Qubit dsDNA Assay
Kit.
Sequencing and analysis of 16S rRNA gene amplicons
Total DNA was used as the template for PCR amplification of 16S rRNA gene using 6-nt bar-
coded primers 341F (5'-CCTAYGGGRBGCASC AG-3') and 806R (5'-GGACTACNNGGGT
ATCTAAT-3') which target hypervariable regions V3 to V4 of 16S rRNA gene [20]. Details of
amplification have been described by Zhang et al. [18]. The mixture of purified 16S rRNA
gene amplicons was used for library preparation. The library was constructed using TruSeq
1
DNA PCR-Free Sample Preparation Kit (Illumina, USA) following manufacturer’s recommen-
dations. The quality of the library was assessed with Qubit 2.0 Fluorometer (Thermo Scientific,
USA) and Agilent Bioanalyzer 2100 system. The library was sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq
2500 platform in Novogene (Tianjin, China). Paired-end (PE) raw reads were generated and
subsequently deposited in NCBI Sequence Read Archive (SRA) (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.go v/
Traces/sra/) database under accession SRP079171.
Sequence assembly and quality control processing of the raw reads were done as reported
previously [18]. The raw reads without barcodes and 16S rRNA gene primers were assembled
to raw tags using FLASH [21]. Low-quality tags were then filtered with QIIME V1.7.0 [22].
Chimera sequences were identified and excluded using UCHIME version 7.0.1001 [23] after
alignment with 16S reference database available at http://drive5.co m/uchime/gold.fa. Quality-
filtered tags were clustered into operational taxonomic units (OTUs) at 97% similarity using
UPARSE version 7.0.1001 [24]. Taxonomic assignment of representative OTUs was performed
using Blast program (e-value cutoff of 1 × 10
−5
) against the RDP database (v10) [25]. Before
alpha diversity calculations, the read numbers were normalized to that of the sample (DR11)
with the smallest read number (28772). Indexes (Shannon and Chao 1) of microbial diversity
and species richness were calculated with QIIME.
Metagenome sequencing and analysis
One microgram of total DNA per sample was fragmented into ~300 bp by sonication and used
to construct metagenomic library using NEBNext

USA) as recommended by the manufacturer. After quality control processing, the library was
sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq 4000 platform. PE raw reads were generated after sequencing,
and clean data were extracted from the raw reads following the removal of adaptor fragments
and low quality reads. High-quality clean reads were assembled using IDBA_UD [26] into
scaffolds. Scaftigs were generated after split of “N” sequences within the scaffolds, and scaftigs
shorter than 500 bp were filtered out. USEARCH version 7.0.1001 [27] was used to select
unique scaftigs with 100% identity from all metagenomic datasets. The abundance of unique
scaftigs in every metagenome was calculated, after mapping the corresponding clean data to
the unique scaftigs using SoapAligner (version 2.21) [28]. The open reading frames (ORFs)
contained in the unique scaftigs were predicted by MetaGeneMark [29]. The predicted ORFs
were clustered using CD-HIT (version 4.5.8) with  95% identity and  90% overlap [30,31],
and the representatives were selected subsequently and used for functional annotation. For
functional annotation, the deduced amino acid sequences of the ORFs were searched against
Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) database (Release 59.0) with the BLASTP
program (e-value  1 × 10
−5
) [32]. All metagenomic datasets have been deposited in the NCBI
SRA database under the accession number SRP079171.
Phylogenetic analysis
Query amino acid sequences were searched against the non-redundant protein database in
NCBI (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/ ) using BLASTP program, and the chosen closely related
reference sequences were either share an identity of >50% and a query cover of >90% with
the query sequence or rank top 10 in the Blast Hits (40% < identity <50% and query cover
>80%). Other subject sequences as in-groups which had relatively mediate or low identity
with query sequences were also obtained from the Blast Hits. Multiple sequence alignments
were completed with the CLUSTAL_X program [33]. Phylogenetic trees were constructed
with the Neighbor-Joining algorithm under the parameter settings of p-distance substitution
model and pairwise deletion for gap treatment in MEGA 6 [34], and bootstrap values were
based on percentages of 1000 replicates.
Results
Chemical characteristics of the sediment samples
Four sediment samples, two from Pacmanus hydrothermal field (named PR1 and PR4) and
two from Desmos hydrothermal field (named DR7 and DR11), were used in this study
(Table 1). The chemical compositions of the four samples are summarized in Table 2. The con-
tents of TOC and TN were similar in the four sediments, while the content of TS was approxi-
mately 3 to 8 folds higher in DR7 (0.205%) and DR11 (0.282%) than in PR1 (0.036%) and PR4
(0.069%). In all samples, the concentrations of Al, Fe, Ca, Mg, and Mn (over 11000 μg/g) were
much higher than that of Ba, Cu, Zn, As, Pb, and Co (19 to 878 μg/g) (Table 2). Aluminum
was the most abundant metal ion, ranging from 62510 μg/g to 75430μg/g in the four samples,
while cobalt was the least abundant, ranging from 19.5 μg/g to 30 μg/g. For heavy metals, Cu,
Zn, and Pb were most abundant in PR1, with concentrations being 878.1 μg/g, 352.0 μg/g, and
129.4 μg/g, respectively (Table 2).
Microbial diversity based on 16S rRNA gene sequence
Following sequencing 16S rRNA gene amplicons, 63071, 74331, 66522, and 76595 raw PE
reads were retrieved from PR1, PR4, DR7, and DR11 respectively (S1 Table). A total of 186041
high-quality reads (“effective tags”) from the four samples were used for further analysis. The

effective tags clustered into 1169, 1636, 1710, and 1617 OTUs in PR1, PR4, DR7, and DR11
respectively (S1 Table). There was no clear difference in Chao1 richness or Shannon diversity
among the four samples (S1 Table).
Proteobacteria was the dominant bacterial phylum (relative abundance ranging from 38.7%
to 55.8%) in all samples, and Thaumarchaeota was the dominant archaeal phylum (Fig 1A).
The abundances of Thaumarchaeota were 38.0%, 16.2%, 6.5%, and 5.6% in PR1, PR4, DR11,
and DR7, respectively. Other abundant phyla included Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Chloro-
flexi, Firmicutes, Acidobacteria, Fusobacteria, Elikeuryarchaeota, and Woesearchaeota (Fig
1A). Within Proteobacteria, Gamma- and Alphaproteobacteria were the dominant classes,
accounting for ~73% of the Proteobacteria community in the four samples, which were fol-
lowed in abundance by Delta- and Epsilonproteobacteria (Fig 1B). The relative abundance of
Deltaproteobacteria in PR1 (4.0%) was apparently lower than that in PR4 (7.5%), DR7 (7.1%),
and DR11 (6.9%). The relative abundances of Epsilonproteobacteria in the four samples ranged
from 4.8% to 6.8%.
At genus level, the most abundant genera in PR1, PR4, DR7, and DR11 were Nitrosopumilus
(37.9%), Nitrosopumilus (15.8%), unclassified endosymbiont of Escarpia laminate (6.2%), and
unclassified bacterium thiotrophic symbiont of Bathymodiolus aduloides (12.2%), respectively.
The relative abundances of Nitrosopumilus were 5.5% and 6.4% in DR7 and DR11, respec-
tively. Sulfurovum was also an abundant genus, accounting for 3.7%, 4.2%, 5.8%, and 3.7% in
PR1, PR4, DR7, and DR11, respectively. A genus-level heat map was drawn based on the top
35 most abundant genera (Fig 1C).
In the four samples, there existed microorganisms that potentially participated in oxidation
of ammonia and nitrite and reduction of nitrate. Of the OTUs associated with ammonia-oxi-
dizing microorganisms (AOM), most were related to the archaeal genus Nitrosopumilus, and
the rest were related to the archaeal genus Nitrososphaera and the bacterial genera Nitrosopira
and Phycisphaera (Fig 2A). Potential nitrite-oxidizing bacterial (NOB) genera were associated
with Nitrospira and Nitrospina (Fig 2B). The relative abundances of OTUs associated with
nitrate-reducing bacteria (NRB) varied in the samples (Fig 2C). Among the potential nitrate
reducers, Sulfurospirillum was dominant in PR1 and DR11, while Sulfurimonas was dominant
in PR4, DR7, and DR11. Arcobacter was next to Sulfurospirillum and Sulfurimonas in abun-
dance. These three genera belong to Epsilonproteobacteria. The relative abundance of AOM
was strikingly higher than that of NOB and NRB in each sample. AOM was relatively more
abundant in the Pacmanus samples PR1 (38.56%) and PR4 (16.41%) than in the Desmos
amples DR7 (6.53%) and DR11 (6.71%) (Fig 2D).
Bacteria potentially playing important roles in sulfur metabolism were also detected. At the
genus level, for sulfur-oxidizing bacteria (SOB), Sulfurovum was most abundant in the four

samples (3.7% to 5.8%), which was followed in abundance by Sulfurimonas, Cocleimonas, Arco-
bacter, and Thioprofundum (Fig 3A). For sulfur-reducing bacteria (SfurRB), Sulfurospirillum
and Pelobacter were detected. Sulfurospirillum was rare in PR4 (0.01%) and DR7 (0.01%) but
relatively abundant in PR1 (0.75%) and DR11 (0.88%); Pelobacter was absent in PR1 but pres-
ent in PR4 (0.01%), DR7 (0.01%), and DR11 (0.004%) (Fig 3B). For sulfate-reducing bacteria
(SfatRB), they included, in the order of decreasing abundance, Desulfofrigus, Desulfobacterium,
Desulfobulbus Desulfatitalea, Desulfopila, Desulfocapsa, and Desulforhopalus (Fig 3C). Desulfo-
frigus was only present in PR1 (0.076%), while Desulfobacterium was present in PR4 (0.059%),
DR7 (0.094%), and DR11 (0.073%) but not in PR1. Comparative analysis indicated that SOB
dominated in all samples, with relative abundance ranging from 4.6% to 7.8%, while the abun-
dances of SfurRB and SfatRB ranged from 0.02% to 0.88% and 0.08% to 0.26%, respectively.
Metabolic profiles of the microbial communities based on metagenomic
analysis
Using an Illumina HiSeq platform, we obtained 52.9 G metagenomic raw reads (~13.2 G per
sample) from the four samples. S2 Table summarizes the sequencing information. In average,
350335 high-quality scaftigs longer than 500 bp were obtained from each sample and used for
further analysis.

tricarboxylic acid (rTCA) cycle, reductive acetyl-CoA or Wood-Ljungdahl (WL) pathway,
3-hydroxypropionate (3-HP) cycle, dicarboxylate/4-hydroxybu tyrate (DC/4-HB) cycle and
3-hydroxypropionate/4-hydroxyb utyrate (3-HP/4-HB) cycle, are essential for microorganisms
[35,36]. In our study, we found that in all four metagenomes, the CBB cycle and WL pathway
were complete, while the 3-HP and 3-HP/4-HB cycles were incomplete. By contrast, complete
rTCA cycle was present in PR1, PR4, and DR7, while complete DC/4-HB cycle was only
present in DR7 and DR11. However, most key enzyme-coding genes in the autotrophic CO
2
fixation pathways were detected in the four metagenomic datasets (Table 3). The relative abun-
dance of rbcLS gene, which encodes the key enzyme ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase
of the CBB cycle, was higher in PR1 (0.0149%) than in PR4 (0.0076%), DR7 (0.0071%), and
DR11 (0.0089%). Phylogenetic analysis based on RbcL sequences indicated that the RbcL in

our samples was likely derived from uncharacterized taxa affiliated to the orders of Chroma-
tiales, Rhizobiales, Planctomycetales, Cytophagales, Oceanospirillales, and Sedimenticola/Thiotri-
chales (S1 Fig). In contrast to rbcLS, the relative abundance of cdh, which encodes the key
enzyme acetyl-CoA decarbonylase/synth ase in WL pathway, was higher in PR4 (0.0121%),
DR7 (0.0252%), and DR11 (0.0214%) than in PR1 (0.0002%). The deduced CdhA sequences
were similar to those from the archaeal taxa Candidatus Bathyarchaeota (75% similarity) and
Candidatus Thorarchaeota (84% similarity) (S2 Fig). Unlike rbcL and cdh, the acl gene encod-
ing the key enzyme ATP-citrate lyase in rTCA cycle was absent or very low in abundance in
the four metagenomic datasets (Table 3). Phylogenetic analysis based on AclA sequences
showed that the AclA in our samples was likely associated with uncharacterized Nitrospira and
Thermoplasmatales (S3 Fig). For the gene encoding the key enzyme 4-hydroxybutyryl-CoA
dehydratase (abfD) in DC/4-HB and 3-HP/4-HB cycles, its abundances in the four samples
were comparable (Table 3). These AbfD sequences were assigned to uncharacterized taxa

fied Dehalococcoidia, and Syntrophobacter (S4 Fig).
(ii) Genes involved in nitrogen metabolism. To examine the nitrogen metabolism path-
ways, we determined the relative abundances of the genes encoding the key enzymes for nitri-
fication, denitrification, and dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium (DNRA) (Fig 4).
The initial reaction in denitrification is catalyzed by nitrate reductase. Phylogenetic analysis
based on the sequences of respiratory nitrate reductase beta subunit (NarH) and periplasmic
nitrate reductase small subunit (NapB) indicated that these sequences were likely associated
with uncharacterized taxa belonging to the orders of Rhizobiales, Burkholderiales, Alteromona-
dales, Candidatus Methylomirabilis, Myxococcales, Nitrospirales, Nitrospinales, Candidatus
Brocadiales, Cellvibrionales, Pseudomonadales, Campylobactera les, Desulfobacterales, and Can-
didatus Rokubacteria (S5 Fig). Nitrification includes two processes of nitrite formation via
ammonia oxidation and nitrite oxidation to nitrate. For ammonia oxidation, two enzymes,
ammonia monooxygenase (AMO) and hydroxylamine dehydrogenase (HAO) encoded by
amoA and hao, respectively, catalyze the conversion of ammonia to nitrite. In our study, amoA
exhibited low abundances (0.0017% to 0.0071%) in all samples, while hao exhibited relatively
high abundances in PR4 (0.0234%), DR7 (0.0222%), and DR11 (0.0135%) but a low abundance
in PR1 (0.0037%). Phylogenetic analysis showed that AmoA was associated with the uncharac-
terized genera Nitrosopumilus and Nitrosospira (S6 Fig). With respect to DNRA, the gene nrfA,
which encodes the key enzyme ammonia-forming dissimilatory nitrite reductase of DNRA,
was present in low abundance (~0.0009%) in each metagenomic dataset.
(iii) Genes involved in sulfur metabolism. Potential pathways of sulfur oxidation and
sulfate reduction were identified in the four metagenomes (Fig 5). The relative abundances of
the genes responsible for reducing sulfate was in general high in the four datasets, excepting
for sulfite reductase (EC 1.8.99.1) gene dsrAB and sulfide-cytochrome-c reductase (EC 1.8.2.3)
gene fccB (Fig 5). In PR1, PR4, DR7, and DR11, the relative abundances of dsrAB were 0%,
0.0010%, 0.0067%, and 0.0083%, respectively, while the relative abundances of fccB were
0.0016%, 0.0006%, 0.0003%, and 0.0008%, respectively. Phylogenetic analysis showed that the
DsrB sequence was close to that from Thermodesulfovi brio, Syntrophobacterales, Desulfobacter-
ales, Desulfatibacillum, and Candidatus Rokubacteria (S7 Fig).
The reduced sulfur compounds were likely oxidized to sulfite by reverse dissimilatory sul-
fite reductase (rDsr, encoded by rdsrAB) and thiosulfate sulfurtransferase (Fig 5). Sulfite was

subsequently converted through adenylylsulfate (APS) to sulfate. In the four datasets, rdsrAB
was relatively more abundant in PR1 (0.0102%), DR7 (0.0090%), and DR11 (0.0113%) than in
PR4 (0.0043%). Phylogenetic analysis showed that the sequence of rDsrB was related to

(Fig 6). In addition, NAD
+
-reducing hydrogenase (EC 1.12.1.2) was also present in the four
samples but in relatively low abundances. These four hydrogenases belong to the [NiFe]-
hydrogenase family. Genes related to [FeFe]-hydrogenase (bifurcating hydrogenase, EC
1.12.1.4) and [Fe]-hydrogenase (ferredoxin hydrogenase, EC 1.12.7.2) were only detected in
DR7 and DR11 and in low abundance.

As revealed by phylogenetic analysis (S8 Fig), the large subunit of hydrogen:acceptor oxido-
reductase (HyaB) was relatively closely related to those from the orders Oceanospirillales, Chro-
matiales, Thiotrichales, Chlorobiales, Myxococcales, Desulfuromonadales, Desulfobacterales, and
Clostridiales; the beta subunit of F

biales (S8 Fig).
Discussion
Microbial community structure
In this study, Illumina-based 16S amplicon sequencing was utilized to analyze the microbial
diversity of four deep-sea sediments from the hydrothermal fields of Pacmanus and Desmos in
Manus Basin. The taxonomic distribution of OTUs indicated that Proteobacteria and Thau-
marchaeota were the most abundant bacterial phylum and archaeal phylum, respectively.
Thaumarchaeota was relatively more abundant in the microbial communities of Pacmanus
than in the microbial communities of Desmos, suggesting a possibly more important role of
these archea in ammonia oxidization in the sediment of Pacmanus hydrothermal field. These
results are consistent with the previous reports that Proteobacteria is the dominant community
in marine environments and was found in deep-sea sediments and hydrothermal systems

[18,37]. Likewise, Thaumarchaeota has been observed in the sediments of Southwest Indian
Ridge and Okinwa Trough [18,38,39].
In Proteobacteria, Gammaproteobacteria and Epsilonproteobacteria were abundant in all
four samples. Gammaproteobacteria has been widely detected in deep-sea environments
[18,37,40–43], and Epsilonproteobacte ria was reported to occur in the hydrothermal systems of
Mid-Atlantic Ridge, Mariana Arc seamounts, and Okinawa Trough [44–46]. In our study, the
presence of the genera Sulfurovum, Sulfurimonas, Arcobacter, and Sulfurospirillum within Epsi-
lonproteobacteria suggested that these members potentially participated in sulfur oxidization
and reduction as well as nitrate reduction. These observations are in line with the documented
reports that many SOB and nitrate reducers belonging to these genera existed in hydrothermal
systems [47–52]. Symbiotic and free-living sulfur oxidizers affiliated to Cocleimonas and Thio-
profundum have been isolated from sand snail and vent chimney [53,54]. Sulfur-oxidizing
gammaproteobacteria associated with these two genera were also detected in our datasets. The
abundance of Epsilon- and Gammaproteobacteria indicated potential contributions of these
bacteria to the oxidization of sulfur compounds in Pacmanus and Desmos fields. Chemoauto-
trophic Epsilon- and Gammaproteobacteria are primary producers using inorganic sulfur com-
pounds as an energy source in deep-sea hydrothermal fields [55]. The total sulfur compound
content was relatively higher in the sediments of Desmos, which is consistent with the observa-
tion that a higher abundance of SOB occurred in DR7 from Desmos. These sulfur compounds
are likely originated from deposition of S

contained in vent fluids or plumes
[1]. There possibly exist different primary sulfur components in the sediments of Desmos and
Pacmanus, as supported by the previous reports that Pacmanus hydrothermal deposits have
polymetallic type of sulfide minerals, while Desmos hydrothermal deposits contain abundant
native sulfur [1,2].

Desulfobacterales has been demonstrated as the dominant and active SfatRB in the Elkhorn
Slough mat [56]. In our study, various members of Desulfobacterales were found in the four
samples, suggesting a possible participation of these bacteria in sulfate reduction associated
with anaerobic degradation of hydrocarbon in the sediments as reported previously [57].
Given the detection of TOC and TS in the sediments of our study, the existence of sulfur-oxi-
dizing and sulfate-reducing bacteria in the microbial communities indicated potential contri-
butions of these microbes to sulfur compounds and/or organic matter utilization and sulfur
and carbon cycles. In addition, we observed in all samples striking abundances of Nitrosopumi-
lus, Nitrospira and Nitrospina, which are ammonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA) and NOB,
respectively [58–60]. The coexistence of these three genera suggested that different types of
microbes participated in the conversion of ammonia to nitrate. Although there was no clear
difference of TN content in the sediments, the ammonia-oxidizer Nitrosopumilus was relatively
more abundant in Pacmanus than in Desmos. The richness of AOA and SOB hinted that
ammonia and reduced sulfur compounds were potential energy sources fueling the microbial
communities in these habitats.
Metabolic profile–(i) Carbon metabolism
The metabolic profiles of the four samples were comparatively analyzed based on metage-
nomic sequencing. For carbon metabolism, we found that key enzymes participating in CBB
cycle, WL pathway, and DC/4-HB or 3-HP/4-HB cycle existed in all four metagenomic data-
sets. RbcL, the key enzyme of CBB cycle, was related to that of Nitrosococcus, Sedimenticola/
Thiothrix, and Planctopirus, which are known to be oxidizers of ammonia and sulfur [59,61–
64]. WL-pathway has been reported to operate in diverse methanogens and sulfate reducers
that fix CO
2
in marine environments [36]. In our study, CdhA, the key enzyme of WL path-
way, was homologous to that of Candidatus Bathyarchaeota and Candidatus Thorarchaeota,
the former being a methanogen, and the latter being a sulfur reducer [65,66]. Since the abfD
gene is highly abundant in all four metagenomes, DC/4-HB or 3-HP/4-HB cycle was likely one
of the prevalent CO
2
fixation pathways in our samples. AbfD-based phylogenetic analysis and
16S sequencing data indicated the existence of Nitrosopumilus and Syntrophobacter, which are
known as ammonia oxidizer and sulfate reducer, respectively [58,67,68]. For the rTCA cycle,
the key enzyme AclA was closely related to that from Nitrospira, which was also present in the
16S data, and Thermoplasmatales, which in nature are nitrite-oxidizing and methanogenic,
respectively [59,60,69]. Taken together, all these results suggest that autotrophic CO
2
fixation
coupled to nitrification, sulfur metabolism, and methanogenesis may be present in the micro-
bial communities of the hydrothermal fields of Pacmanus and Desmos. Genes associated with
methane metabolism were identified in PR1, PR4, DR7 and DR11 in low abundances (0.75%,
0.79%, 0.89% and 0.86%, respectively), however, the methyl coenzyme M reductase gene,
which functions in methanogenesis to produce methane and in the anaerobic oxidation of
methane [70,71], was absent in all four metagenomic datasets, suggesting that methane may
not be an important energy source for the local microbes.
(ii) Nitrogen metabolism
Nitrification and denitrification are essential steps in the global nitrogen cycle [72]. In our
study, an abundant key genes of these two processes were present in the metagenomes. In
autotrophic ammonia oxidizers, AMO and HAO are two key enzymes necessary for energy
conservation during ammonia oxidation [72]. In our study, both AmoA-based phylogenetic
analysis and 16S rRNA gene analysis indicated that Nitrosopumilus and Nitrosospira were the
primary ammonia oxidizers. The phylogenetic trees based on NarH and NapB showed that
Microbial commu nities in Manus Basin hydrothe rmal fields

they were homologous to those from Pseudomonas, Candidatus Methylomirabilis, Candidatus
Rokubacteria, Nitrospira, Nitrospina, and Candidatus Scalindua, members of which have been
reported as nitrate reducer, nitrite oxidizer, and anammox bacteria in freshwater sediments
and deep-sea hydrothermal sediments [59,60,73–76]. The genera of Pseudomonas, Nitrospira,
and Nitrospina were also identified in the four 16S datasets. These results indicated a diversity
of microorganisms responsible for utilization of ammonia and nitrate in the deep-sea sedi-
ments of Pacmanus and Desmos.
(iii) Sulfur metabolism
Bacterial sulfate reduction and sulfur oxidation pathways were identified in the microbial com-
munities of our study. The DsrB sequences in the four metagenomes were closely related to
those from the class Deltaproteobacteria (77%-94% similarity), the genus Thermodesulfovibrio
(70% similarity), and the phylum Candidatus Rokubacteria (~44% similarity), which have
been identified as SfatRB in freshwater and deep-sea environments [56,76–79]. Sulfate in the
sediments as an electron acceptor was likely utilized by potential SfatRB. A previous report
predicted Candidatus Rokubacteria to be an important and unrecognized versatile player in
sulfate reduction and nitrite oxidation in groundwater sediment [76]. It is noteworthy that we
identified for the first time Candidatus Rokubacteria as a potential sulfate reducer in the deep-
sea sediments of hydrothermal fields, which expands our knowledge of the taxonomic distri-
bution of SfatRB in deep-sea hydrothermal systems. The reduced sulfur compounds in the sed-
iments of Pacmanus and Desmos were likely oxidized to sulfate by rDsr via bacterial reverse
sulfate reduction pathway, which is known to be present in the microbial communities of vent
chimneys [80]. The phylogenetic closeness of rDsrB to the counterparts in Thioalkalivibrio,
Rhodomicrobium, and Chlorobiales suggested that these microbes possibly played a role in sul-
fur oxidation in Pacmanus and Desmos hydrothermal fields, which is in line with the previous
observations that these microbes occurred in hydrothermal chimneys and marine sediments
[35,81,82].
(iv) Hydrogen oxidation
Hydrogen as an electron donor can be reversibly oxidized by hydrogenase coupled to reduction
of sulfate, Fe(III), and nitrate to produce energy for microorganisms [35,83,84]. Hydrogenases
are classified into three families, i.e. [NiFe]-, [FeFe]-, and [Fe]-hydrogenases, based on the struc-
ture of active site [84]. In our study, [NiFe]-hydrogenase was more prevalent compared to the
other types, as evidenced by a strikingly higher abundance of [NiFe]-hydrogenase gene in the
four metagenomes, which is in agreement with the reports that [NiFe]-hydrogenase is the pri-
mary hydrogenase family in the microbial communities of hydrothermal plumes and vent
chimneys [35,85]. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that HyaB and FrhB were likely derived from
members of the sulfur oxidizing bacteria Chromatiales, Thiotrichales, and Chlorobiales [35,63,82],
the sulfate reducing bacteria Myxococcales, Desulfuromonadales, Desulfobacterales, Archaeoglo-
bales, and Clostridiales [56,86–89], the archaeal methanogens Methanomicrobiales and Methano-
sarcinales [69], and the bacterial methanotroph Methylococcales [90]. Hence, it appears that
hydrogenases are widely distributed in bacteria and archaea. Members belonging to the orders of
Chromatiales, Myxococcales, Desulfuromonadales, Desulfobacterales, and Clostridiales were also
observed in our 16S sequencing datasets. It is possible that hydrogen as an energy source may be
utilized by microbes in these sediments, and that this process is coupled to various metabolic pro-
cesses including sulfur oxidation, sulfate reduction, and methane metabolism as observed in the
vent plumes and chimneys from Guaymas Basin, Eastern Lau Spreading Center, and Southwest
Indian Ridge [35,85,91].

Conclusions
In this study, we conducted the first investigation on microbial diversity and potential meta-
bolic profiles of the microbial communities inhabiting the sediments of the hydrothermal
fields in Pacmanus and Desmos. We found that all microbial communities were dominated by
Proteobacteria, and that ammonia- and sulfur-oxidizing prokaryotes likely played essential
roles in the cycling of nitrogen and sulfur as well as in CO
2
fixation. Ammonia, reduced sulfur
compounds, and hydrogen as potential important energy sources were possibly utilized to fuel
the microbial communities. These first observations add new insights into the metabolisms of
the microbes in deep-sea hydrothermal fields.
