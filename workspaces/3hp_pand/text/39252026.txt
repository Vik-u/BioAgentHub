Abstract
Background Sugarcane molasses, rich in sucrose, glucose, and fructose, offers a promising carbon source for 
industrial fermentation due to its abundance and low cost. However, challenges arise from the simultaneous 
utilization of multiple sugars and carbon catabolite repression (CCR). Despite its nutritional content, sucrose 
metabolism in Escherichia coli, except for W strain, remains poorly understood, hindering its use in microbial 
fermentation. In this study, E. coli W was engineered to enhance sugar consumption rates and overcome CCR. This was 
achieved through the integration of a synthetically designed csc operon and the optimization of glucose and fructose 
co-utilization pathways. These advancements facilitate efficient utilization of sugarcane molasses for the production 
of 3-hydroxypropionic acid (3-HP), contributing to sustainable biochemical production processes.
Results In this study, we addressed challenges associated with sugar metabolism in E. coli W, focusing on enhancing 
sucrose consumption and improving glucose-fructose co-utilization. Through targeted engineering of the sucrose 
utilization system, we achieved accelerated sucrose consumption rates by modulating the expression of the csc 
operon components, cscB, cscK, cscA, and cscR. Our findings revealed that monocistronic expression of the csc genes 
with the deletion of cscR, led to optimal sucrose utilization without significant growth burden. Furthermore, we 
successfully alleviated fructose catabolite repression by modulating the binding dynamics of FruR with the fructose 
PTS regulon, enabling near-equivalent co-utilization of glucose and fructose. To validate the industrial applicability of 
our engineered strain, we pursued 3-HP production from sugarcane molasses. By integrating heterologous genes and 
optimizing metabolic pathways, we achieved improvements in 3-HP titers compared to previous studies. Additionally, 
glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (gapA) repression aids in carbon flux redistribution, enhancing molasses 
conversion to 3-HP .
Conclusions Despite limitations in sucrose metabolism, the redesigned E. coli W strain, adept at utilizing sugarcane 
molasses, is a valuable asset for industrial fermentation. Its synthetic csc operon enhances sucrose consumption, while 
mitigating CCR improves glucose-fructose co-utilization. These enhancements, coupled with repression of gapA, aim 
to efficiently convert sugarcane molasses into 3-HP , addressing limitations in sucrose and fructose metabolism for 
industrial applications.

Background
Sugarcane molasses is a byproduct of the sucrose pro -
duction from sugarcane, and its utilization has many 
advantages, including its abundance, low cost, and high 
sugar content [ 1, 2]. The world’s annual yield of molas -
ses reaches 55 million tons, with the global cane molasses 
market size setting to be about $8.1 billion by 2030 [ 2]. It 
contains not only sucrose but also glucose, fructose, and 
other nutrients such as vitamins, minerals, and amino 
acids, which leads to a potentially attractive carbon 
source for industrial fermentation processes. The utili -
zation of renewable carbon feedstocks for bioprocesses 
is gaining significant attention, driven by environmental 
and economic considerations [ 3, 4]. Sucrose, a disaccha -
ride composed of glucose and fructose, derived from sug-
arcane emerges as a promising renewable carbon source. 
While the precise composition varies among different 
sugarcane varieties, the proportion of sucrose within 
sugarcane molasses is significantly dominant among 
all carbon sources. Therefore, optimization of sucrose 
metabolism is crucial for effective utilization of sugar -
cane molasses.
Only a few non-pathogenic E. coli strains are known to 
utilize sucrose, including EC3132, B-62, and W [ 5–8]. E. 
coli W stands out as the sole well-known strain proficient 
in utilizing sucrose as a carbon source, displaying robust 
growth compared to alternative sources like glucose [ 9]. 
Given the limited ability of most E. coli strains to utilize 
sucrose, previous studies on sucrose metabolism primar -
ily focused on engineering individual strains by introduc -
ing the sucrose uptake system from E. coli  W [ 10–12]. 
Despite previous efforts, engineered strains for sucrose 
utilization often exhibited slow growth rates and pheno -
typic instability from unstable plasmid systems requir -
ing antibiotics and cellular burden induced by high-copy 
number plasmids [ 6, 11, 13, 14]. Thus, there remains a 
critical need for efficient sucrose metabolism engineering 
in E. coli.
Sugarcane molasses contains not only sucrose, but glu -
cose and fructose as carbon sources, posing challenges 
for simultaneous metabolism of multiple sugars. Carbon 
catabolite repression (CCR) is a regulatory mechanism 
where the presence of a preferred carbon source, often 
glucose, represses the utilization of alternative carbon 
sources, including fructose [ 15]. In E. coli, glucose is the 
preferred carbon substrate, and its abundance triggers 
CCR, leading to a reduction in the uptake of fructose. 
This regulatory hurdle limits the simultaneous utiliza -
tion of multiple sugars, hindering the efficiency of certain 
bioprocesses [ 16]. Overcoming the CCR issue is crucial 
for engineering E. coli strains with improved capabilities 
for co-utilizing glucose and fructose, especially in indus -
trial applications where the utilization of mixed sugars in 
common.
In this study, E. coli  W was redesigned for faster con -
sumption rates of sugars in molasses. Sugarcane molas -
ses, a valuable resource rich in sucrose, glucose, and 
fructose, encounters a challenge in simultaneous utiliza -
tion. The primary sucrose utilization system in E. coli W 
relies on non-PTS (phosphotransferase system), while 
glucose and fructose are predominantly utilized through 
PTS. A synthetically designed csc operon, which regu -
lates the non-PTS sucrose metabolism, was shown to 
enhance the consumption rate of sucrose. Additionally, 
the co-utilization of glucose and fructose was improved 
by preventing the fructose repressor from binding to the 
fructose PTS regulon and controlling the expression level 
of the regulon. This approach solved the primary obstacle 
of CCR in glucose and fructose co-utilization. Further -
more, the increased consumption rates of sucrose, glu -
cose, and fructose could help E. coli to efficiently utilize 
sugarcane molasses and convert it into 3-hydroxypropi -
onic acid (3-HP). This approach aligns with the concept 
of utilizing renewable feedstocks, contributing to envi -
ronmentally friendly and economically viable biochemi -
cal production processes.

were added at OD600 0.7. The culture was conducted with 
three biological replicates for flask-scale cultivation.
Metabolite quantification
Concentrations of sucrose, glucose, fructose, 3-HP , glyc -
erol, and acetate were measured at 40 °C using high-per -
formance liquid chromatography (Agilent 1260 Infinity 
II LC System) equipped with Agilent Hi-Plex H column 
(8  μm, 6.5  mm × 300  mm, PL1F70-6830) at a flow rate 
of 0.6 mL/min using 5 mM H 2SO4 as the mobile phase. 
Signals were monitored at 210 nm of wavelength for UV-
Vis and at 35 °C for refractive index detector (RID). Each 
sample had a 30-min running time. At least five data 
points of each biochemical were used to draw a standard 
curve to measure the concentrations.
Fermentation conditions
Fed-batch fermentation was done in a 5-L bioreactor 
(BioCNS) containing initial 1.5  L of medium at 37  °C, 
250 rpm. pH was controlled with 1 M of NaOH to set at 
6.7-7.0. And 30  g/L of sugarcane molasses and 4 µM of 
coenzyme B12 were fed every 24 h [ 18]. Air was provided 
at an aeration rate of 0.667 vvm. An electronic zero (0%) 
on the bioreactor was set first for the DO probe calibra -
tion. Prior to inoculation, once the fermentation media 
was prepared and maintained at 37  °C with agitation at 
250  rpm, the DO level was set to 100%. Also, 0.01% of 
Antifoam 204 (Sigma-Aldrich) was added to the medium 
prior to the fermentation. The DO level was controlled 
to 30% of air saturation by automatically increasing the 
agitation from 200 to 500 rpm first, and then increasing 
the aeration rate from 0.667 vvm to 3.333 vvm when the 
agitation was not enough for the control.
Results and discussion
Enhancing sucrose consumption rate
The varied consumption pattern of sugars in E. coli  W, 
notably delayed sucrose uptake and fructose catabo -
lite repression, stems from the strain’s transport and 
metabolic characteristics [ 7, 8]. Sucrose, relying on the 
non-PTS, requires an additional hydrolysis step, hinder -
ing its immediate utilization (Supplementary Fig. S1). 
Meanwhile, glucose and fructose, facilitated by the PTS, 
exhibit a more efficient uptake [ 15]. The sequential sugar 
consumption reflects the regulatory hierarchy in W, pri -
oritizing glucose followed by fructose. Additionally, pH 
control in the cultivation environment was required to 
consume other sugars than glucose.
We first engineered the uptake system of the primary 
component of sugarcane molasses, sucrose, to improve 
its consumption rate. The main non-PTS sucrose 
metabolism regulon in W is Csc regulon harboring four 
genes: cscB (permease), cscK (fructokinase), cscA (inver-
tase), and cscR (transcriptional repressor) (Fig.  1A). 
To augment the sucrose consumption rate, a strategic 
approach was implemented by initially targeting the 
transcriptional repressor [ 7, 19]. While the deletion of 
cscR within the strain was proven effective in enabling 
complete sucrose consumption, there appeared to be no 
noticeable differences in the sucrose uptake rate (Sup -
plementary Fig. S2). This observation suggested that the 
absence of cscR might primarily influence the regulatory 
aspects of the sucrose metabolism pathway, facilitating 
enhanced utilization without necessarily impacting the 
rate of sucrose uptake.
To optimize the expression level of csc operon, two 
different expression cassettes were constructed (poly -
cistronic (Pcsc_poly) and monocistronic (Pcsc_mono)) 
based on a plasmid with a medium copy number (Fig.  1B 
and Table  1). The polycistronic cassette was designed, 
featuring a synthetic robust promoter, P tac, and synthetic 
5’ UTRs, with the intent of enhancing the overall operon 
expression (Supplementary Table S2) [ 20, 21]. cscA and 
cscK were strategically positioned upstream of cscB, the 
membrane protein, mirroring the arrangement in the 
native operon where they follow a bidirectional pro -
moter. Conversely, the monocistronic cassette involved 
the individual construction of cscB, cscK, and cscA, each 
equipped with synthetic 5’ UTRs and constitutive pro -
moters, specifically J23100, J23106, and P tac, respectively. 
Based on Registry of Standard Biological Parts [ 22], the 
promoter strength in E. coli ranks as follows: Ptac, J23100, 
and J23106, in descending order [ 23–25]. Additionally, 
synthetic 5’ UTRs for both polycistronic and monocis -
tronic cassettes exhibited significantly higher transla -
tion rates compared to native 5’ UTRs. Overexpression 
of cscB led to an increased presence of permease mol -
ecules on the cell membrane, which facilitated the more 
rapid import of sucrose into the cell. Simultaneously, 
overexpression of cscA enabled the cell to more effi -
ciently hydrolyze the imported sucrose into glucose and 
fructose, which could then be swiftly utilized in central 
metabolic pathways like glycolysis. This process helped 
sucrose entering the cell to break down quickly and to be 
metabolized, avoiding potential bottlenecks in utilization. 
Combined, the overexpression of cscB and cscA opti -
mized both the uptake and conversion of sucrose, result -
ing in a more efficient and accelerated consumption rate 
[7]. However, the strength of the promoter for cscK was 
not as strong as for other genes because the overexpres -
sion of cscK, being a kinase requiring ATP for phosphor -
ylation, exhibited a threshold effect due to limitations in 
ATP availability. Also, each gene was codon-optimized 
at the N-terminal for higher expression level, and syn -
thetic strong terminators were used [ 26] (Supplementary 
Table S1). These plasmids were subsequently introduced 
into the cscBKAR-deleted strain, thereby creating a tar -
geted genetic context conducive to examining the impact

of altered expression patterns on sucrose metabolism. 
Pcsc_poly exhibited a less favorable performance attrib -
uted to potential growth burden, likely led by disrupted 
metabolic flux (Fig. 1D-G).
The superior performance of Pcsc_mono, characterized 
by its absence of growth burden and accelerated sucrose 
consumption rate, proved its selection as the optimal 
genetic configuration. The synthetically designed mono -
cistronic csc cassette was integrated into the cscBKAR-
deleted genome (Rcsc) to maintain its stable expression 
and minimize the metabolic burden caused by a heter -
ologous plasmid (Fig.  1C). Despite the deployment of a 
lower copy number, Rcsc exhibited stable consumption 
of sucrose and better cellular growth than Pcsc_mono 
(Fig.  1D-G). Furthermore, the overexpression of inver -
tase expedited the cleavage of sucrose into glucose and 
fructose, facilitating their rapid transport to the extra -
cellular space (Fig.  1F, G). While this alternation might 
diverge from a conventional sucrose uptake mecha -
nism, it aligned with the physiological context of sug -
arcane molasses, which contains a mixture of sucrose, 
glucose, and fructose. Nevertheless, further engineering 
is required for the removal of CCR. Enhanced sucrose 
consumption efficiency, reduced growth burden, and sus-
tained metabolic stability, Rcsc is an advantageous can -
didate for bioprocess applications requiring optimized 
sucrose utilization and metabolic control.
Improving glucose-fructose co-utilization
The removal of the fructose catabolite repression in W 
was pursued by deleting the transcriptional repressor, 
fruR, also recognized as cra in numerous bacteria [ 27]. 
This genetic modification successfully abolished CCR on 
fructose, resulting in a faster fructose consumption rate 
than glucose (Supplementary Fig. S3). However, a notable 
consequence of WΔfruR was the accumulation of acetate, 
indicative of potential disruptions in metabolic flux. The 
observed accumulation suggested that Cra, catabolite 
repressor/activator, as a global transcriptional regula -
tor, might exert control over multiple cellular pathways 
beyond fructose metabolism. This result underscored the 
need for a balanced approach when manipulating global

regulators, as their deletion could inadvertently impact 
various metabolic pathways, potentially leading to unde -
sirable byproducts [28, 29].
Instead of direct deletion of fruR, a refined strategy 
was employed to control CCR on fructose by modu -
lating the binding dynamics of FruR with the fructose 
PTS regulon [ 30]. The regulon is composed of fruA, 
fruB, and fruK; FruAB, the fructose PTS permease, also 
known as the Enzyme II Fru complex, and fruK, fructose-
1-kinase (Fig.  2A). We replaced the native promoter, 
operator, and 5’ UTR with a synthetically designed pro -
moter-5’ UTR cassette (Fig.  2B). Furthermore, 5’ UTR 
library was employed to fine-tune both CCR control and 
consumption rates, and the strains were labeled based on 
their predicted translation rates, with F1 representing the 
lowest and F4 the highest (Table  2) [ 20, 21]. F1 and F2 
demonstrated limited efficacy in alleviating CCR, similar 
to the control strain presumably due to low translational 
rates of enzymes (Fig.  2C-E). Conversely, F4 exhibited 
an accelerated uptake rate of fructose, surpassing that 
of glucose due to an excessively high translational rate 
(Fig.  2G). Based on the expression level of Fru regulon, 
the glucose consumption rate exhibited variability, likely 
due to competition for phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) 
[31]. As the fructose uptake rate increased, the glucose 
uptake rate correspondingly decreased (Fig.  2D-G).

Furthermore, glucose was still consumed even after the 
hydrolysis of sucrose (Supplementary Fig. S3). These 
observations suggest the presence of competition for 
phosphorylation within the cell, particularly involving 
PEP [ 32]. The optimal strain, F3, showed effective CCR 
removal (Fig.  2F). F3 demonstrated near-equivalent 
co-utilization of glucose and fructose, coupled with the 
highest sugar consumption rate, underscoring its poten -
tial as an industrially relevant variant for enhanced sugar 
metabolism.
With the alleviation of CCR, there were more carbon 
sources available for metabolism, leading to the accu -
mulation of acetate (Supplementary Fig. S4). Due to the 
increased flow rate, acetate could not be eliminated com -
pletely, but a reduction by approximately 16% in the F3 
strain was observed at 30 h., just before acetate becom -
ing the primary carbon source. FruR is modulated by the 
concentration of fructose-1,6-biphosphate (FBP) pro -
duced by fruK [ 33]. However, some research suggested 
that there was no direct relationship between FruR and 
FBP , indicating that FruR is only affected by fructose-
1-phosphate (F1P) [ 34]. Despite these controversies 
regarding whether FruR is regulated by FBP , it is clear 
that FBP is directly regulated by fruK and F1P which is 
directely influenced by FruR. Constructing a synthetic 
cassette of the fructose PTS regulon independent of fruR 
expression enhanced fructose metabolism but could 
potentially disrupt overall cellular metabolism [ 35]. FruR 
regulates approximately 79 regulons, some of which are 
other transcription factors [ 36, 37]. Continuous pro -
duction of FBP can deactivate FruR, potentially lead -
ing to the overexpression of genes unrelated to fructose 
metabolism and a consequent waste of cellular resources. 
Further improvements might be achieved by inducing 
mutations in fruR or through adaptive laboratory evolu -
tion (ALE) to enhance overall metabolic efficiency [ 38]. 
The integration of simultaneous sugar uptake strategies 
thus represents a promising avenue for biotechnological 
applications.
Optimizing 3-HP production
To validate the industrial applicability of strains exhibit -
ing increased sucrose consumption rate while simulta -
neously being able to consume multiple carbon sources, 
3-HP was produced using raw material, sugarcane molas-
ses. Multiple heterologous genes were introduced for 
the construction of the 3-HP pathway in the engineered 
strain. Harnessing the glycerol pathway as the fundamen-
tal route for 3-HP biosynthesis from sugarcane molasses, 
renowned for its efficiency and productivity, the selec -
tion of this pathway was based on the identification of 
the required enzymes facilitating the conversion from 
sucrose to glycerol [ 18]. To convert the carbon sources 
from sucrose to glycerol, two genes coding for glycerol-
3-phosphate dehydrogenase ( gpd1) and glycerol-3-phos -
phatase (gpp2) were expressed [39]. Also, from glycerol to 
3-HP , two enzymatic reactions were required, dehydra -
tion of glycerol to 3-hydroxypropionaldehyde (3-HPA) 
and oxidation of 3-HPA, which were catalyzed by glyc -
erol dehydratase (GDHt) and aldehyde dehydrogenase 
(ALDH), respectively. Synthetically designed 3-HP path -
way genes were used in this study to rebalance the path -
way for preventing the accumulation of 3-HPA which was 
toxic, from the previous study [ 40]. Two plasmids, each 
designed to accommodate and drive the overexpression 
of the pathway genes – namely gpd1, gpp2, dhaB1,2,3, 
gdrA, B, and kgsadh – were used (Fig. 3A and B).
Previous studies reported that downregulating or 
replacing native GAPDH to enhance NAD(P)H avail -
ability and mitigate futile cycles between endogenous 
and heterologous enzymes [ 41, 42]. To assess the poten -
tial improvement in 3-HP production, the expression 
level of gapA was rebalanced with alterations in the 
upstream carbon flux. This targeted repression aimed to 
reduce glycolytic pathway fluxes, concurrently enhanc -
ing 3-HP production through the glycerol pathway [ 43, 
44]. The expression level of the glycolytic enzyme, gapA 
was diversified via a promoter library: J23100, J23102, 
J23107, J23108, J23115 (Fig.  3C) [ 45]. This regulatory 
intervention yielded a 1.76-fold increase in the 3-HP 
titer in G100_3HP strain compared to the control strain 
(Fig.  3D). Excessive repression of gapA (G115_3HP) 
yielded suboptimal physiological outcome, highlighting 
the importance of identifying the optimal flux. Com -
pared to the previous studies utilizing a glycerol pathway 
and sugar(s) as substrates in E. coli for 3-HP production, 
this study demonstrated a significant elevated titer, yield, 
and productivity in batch culture : 5.123  g/L, 0.337  g/g, 
and 0.142 g/L-h [46, 47].
Fed-batch cultivation of G100_3HP strain with a sub -
strate of sugarcane molasses demonstrated the 3-HP 
titer of 13.487  g/L and the productivity of 0.180  g/L-h 
(Fig. 3E; Table 3). In the results of the fed-batch culture, 
accumulation of acetate was observed, likely due to an 
overabundance of glycolytic substrates, which demanded 
a greater presence of respiratory chain proteins to pro -
duce ATP through respiration [48]. This could result in a 
higher proteomic cost for ATP production via respiration

than by fermentation. Also, the acetate accumulation 
might be caused by variations in the composition and 
amount of multiple carbon sources present in sugarcane 
molasses [ 49, 50]. To mitigate acetate accumulation and 
enhance 3-HP production, redirecting the flux of carbon 
sources toward cell growth and 3-HP production, rather 
than byproduct formation, could improve yield. Poten -
tial strategies include the overexpression of acetyl-CoA 
synthetase (acs) to convert acetate to acetyl-CoA, or the 
deletion of pyruvate oxidase ( poxB) to prevent the con -
version of pyruvate to acetate [51].
Despite reducing the expression level of gapA, the 
presence of available glucose (additional glucose from 
sucrose breakdown) might induce overflow metabolism 
to manage the excess resources. Optimization of meta -
bolic flux through a systematic approach could further 
enhance biochemical production [ 52]. This outcome not 
only validated the effectiveness of the engineered regula -
tory control over gapA, but also highlighted the potential 
scalability and industrial viability of G100_3HP strain for 
advanced 3-HP biosynthesis in a fed-batch cultivation 
setting. The results showed a step forward in optimizing 
the production of 3-HP , positioning the engineered strain 
as a promising candidate for bioconversion processes on 
a larger scale.
To achieve higher 3-HP titers, genetic engineering 
efforts had been undertaken, including pathway opti -
mization. This involved the design and implementation 
of synthetic pathways, to enhance the expression of key 
pathway genes. Specifically, synthetic promoters and 5’ 
UTRs had been utilized to drive overexpression of these 
genes, thereby increasing the flux through the 3-HP bio -
synthetic pathway. Additionally, flux control mechanisms 
had been incorporated to redirect metabolic flux more 
effectively towards 3-HP production. By strategically 
engineering these pathways and optimizing the associ -
ated regulatory element (gapA), the overall efficiency and 
yield of 3-HP production had been improved. However, 
some fermentation optimizations can be potential fur -
ther work to improve the titer. To enhance 3-HP produc-
tion, various parameters could be optimized, including 
substrate concentration control, two-stage aeration strat-
egies, two-stage pH control, and medium optimization, 
among others [42, 53–55].
Conclusions
Despite certain limitations in sucrose metabolism in E. 
coli, the redesigned E. coli  W strain, proficient in utiliz -
ing sugarcane molasses, emerges as a valuable asset for 
industrial fermentation. The integration of synthetic csc 
operon, enhancing sucrose consumption, and the mitiga -
tion of CCR for improved co-utilization of glucose and 
fructose highlight its significance. Additionally, gapA 
repression contributes to carbon flux redistribution, 
further amplifying its potential for converting molas -
ses into 3-HP efficiently. This optimized strain not only 
addresses current limitations in sucrose and fructose 
metabolism but also paves the way for future applications 
in sustainable and cost-effective industrial biotechnology.
