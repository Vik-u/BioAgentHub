3-Hydroxypropionaldehyde production 
from crude glycerol by Lactobacillus diolivorans 
with enhanced glycerol uptake
Katharina Anna Lindlbauer1,2, Hans Marx1,2*  and Michael Sauer1,2,3
Abstract 
Background: In their quest for sustainable development and effective management of greenhouse gas emissions, 
our societies pursue a shift away from fossil-based resources towards renewable resources. With 95% of our current 
transportation energy being petroleum based, the application of alternative, carbon-neutral products—among them 
biodiesel—is inevitable. In order to enhance the cost structure of biodiesel biorefineries, the valorization of the crude 
glycerol waste stream into high-value platform chemicals is of major importance.
Results: The purpose of this study is the production of 3-hydroxypropionaldehyde (3-HPA) from biodiesel-derived 
crude glycerol by Lactobacillus diolivorans. Particular focus is given on overcoming potential limitations of glycerol 
transport into the cell, in order to use the cells’ total glycerol dehydratase capability towards the formation of 3-HPA as 
the main product. Recombinant overexpression of the endogenous glycerol uptake facilitating protein PduF results in 
a significant increase of glycerol conversion by a factor of 1.3. Concomitantly, glycerol dehydratase activity increased 
from initially 1.70 ± 0.03 U/mg protein to 2.23 ± 0.11 U/mg protein. With this approach, an average productivity of 4.8 
 g3-HPA/(gCDM h) yielding up to 35.9 g/L 3-HPA and 0.91  mol3-HPA/molGlycerol have been obtained.
Conclusion: Lactobacillus diolivorans proves to be a valuable cell factory for the utilization of crude glycerol deliver-
ing high-value C3 chemicals like 3-HPA, 1,3-propanediol (1,3-PDO) and 3-hydroxypropionic acid (3-HP). Enhancing the 
glycerol influx into the cell by genetic engineering was successful paving the way towards the commercial produc-
tion of 3-HPA.

Background
Between 1970 and 2011, global greenhouse gas (GHG) 
emissions (particularly carbon dioxide) derived from fos -
sil fuel combustion and industrial processes increased by 
75% [ 1]. Key drivers for this dramatic increase in GHG 
can be related to alterations in population, structure of 
the economy, state of technology, and availability of fos -
sil energy resources [ 2]. To counteract this trend, legal 
frameworks like the Paris Agreement aim at tackling 
global climate change, based on wide ranging changes 
and innovations for energy provision [ 3]. 60% of new 
power generation capacities are projected to be derived 
from renewables with the majority of them being com -
petitive without any subsidies by 2040 [ 4]. This trend 
towards renewable energy technologies is also reflected 
in the growth of the global biofuels market—including 
biodiesel and bioethanol—from $148.5  billion in 2015 
up to $169.6  billion until 2021 [ 5]. This performance is 
accompanied by an increasing availability of crude glyc -
erol which is derived as a side stream from the transes -
terification process in amounts of 10% (w/w) of the total 
biodiesel production volume [ 6, 7]. High abundance, low 
price, and high degree of reduction make glycerol an 
attractive feedstock for biorefineries [ 8]. However, crude

glycerol contains many impurities, therefore cost-inten -
sive product purification and recovery measurements 
are required for commercial sale in technical quality. The 
potential revenue is quite low due to the currently low 
spot price of $0.79/kg for technical quality refined glyc
-
erol [9–12]. Therefore, the upgrade of crude glycerol to 
high-value chemicals is desirable. A concomitant produc
-
tion of fuels and chemicals in an integrated biorefinery, 
meets the environmental and economic goals simulta
-
neously, due to high-value chemicals becoming the eco -
nomic driver for the entire production plant [13, 14].
A product of interest is 3-hydroxypropionaldehyde 
(3-HPA) which is currently available as a specialty chemi-
cal at a minimum price of $270/g (95% purity, Atlantic 
Research Chemicals Ltd.) [15]. This metabolite is well 
known for its antimicrobial activity. A further market 
(albeit at significantly lower price) is addressed by its 
role as production intermediate for platform chemicals 
like 3-hydroxypropionic acid (3-HP), acrolein, or most 
importantly acrylic acid [16– 18]. Chemical and biologi
-
cal approaches have been explored to convert glycerol 
into 3-HPA [6, 19]. The advantages of microbial conver
-
sion over conventional chemical production processes 
include higher specificity at moderate process conditions 
in regard to temperature and pressure, but also higher 
tolerance to impurities and the possibility to use variable 
feedstocks [20, 21]. Natural production of 3-HPA has been 
reported for species of Bacillus, Citrobacter, Clostridium, 
Enterobacter, Klebsiella, and Lactobacillus [ 18, 22, 23]. 
The microbial production is a simple one-step conversion 
process, catalyzed by the redox neutral action of glycerol 
dehydratase (GDHt) yielding 3-HPA by dehydration [24]. 
This conversion step is neither connected to the redox nor 
the energy metabolism of the cells. It is the first natural 
step of the metabolic pathways from glycerol to 1,3-PDO 
(electron sink) or to 3-HP (yielding one ATP and 2 elec
-
trons) [25]. Due to the high toxicity of 3-HPA, the meta -
bolic pathways are tightly balanced in growing cells, to 
prevent any accumulation of the intermediate. Natural 
accumulation of 3-HPA has been reported to occur either 
due to an enzymatic imbalance, involving high glycerol 
dehydratase activity combined with low aldehyde dehydro
-
genase activity or in non-growing but metabolically active 
cells, also referred to as “resting cells. ” Such cells turned 
out to be quite favorable for the targeted production of 
3-HPA with minor accumulation of by-products [26, 27].
In this study, we are focusing on Lactobacillus dio
-
livorans as microbial cell factory. The advantage of this 
organism is its ability to utilize both pharma grade, as 
well as crude glycerol without further processing steps, 
featuring no adverse impact of potential inhibitors on 
either growth or product yield. It has been shown that L. 
diolivorans is an excellent natural producer of 1,3-PDO 
and 3-HP , but the potential accumulation of 3-HPA has 
not been reported so far [28–30]. This study aims at a 
combinatorial approach of process and metabolic engi
-
neering to extend the product range of this cell factory 
towards the accumulation of 3-HPA. The main aspects 
include the evaluation of the glycerol uptake capabilities 
of L. diolivorans as well as the activity of glycerol dehy
-
dratase as both are key steps towards the formation of 
3-HPA. The final aim is the establishment of an enhanced 
process for the production of 3-HPA from crude glycerol 
without application of any scavengers.
Methods
Bacterial strains and plasmids
Lactobacillus diolivorans LMG 19668 was used for all 
experiments in this study. The sequence of the glycerol 
facilitating protein PduF of L. diolivorans flanked by two 
BbsI restriction sites was ordered from IDT as part of a 
pUCIDT vector carrying a kanamycin resistance cassette. 
The expression of pduF  was put under the control of the 
GAP promotor of L. diolivorans as well as the termina
-
tor of the chloramphenicol resistance cassette (TT_CAT) 
via GoldenMOCS [31], a modified form of Golden Gate 
cloning. This expression cassette was finally cloned into 
a vector carrying a replication origin of L. diolivorans 
(repA), as well as a kanamycin and erythromycin resist
-
ance (Additional file  1: Figure S1). In case of the empty 
vector (EV) control, the aforementioned vector was used 
without the introduction of an expression cassette for 
pduF. The construction of plasmids was performed in 
E. coli DH10B and the final propagation for the deliv
-
ery of non-methylated DNA took place in E. coli JM110. 
Detailed information regarding the used strains and 
design of the plasmids is available in Additional file  1: 
Table S1 and Table S2.
Transformation procedure
The transformation of plasmids was performed accord -
ing to the protocol of Pflügl et al. [32] with some modi -
fications which are described in brief. MRS medium “pH 
5.7” supplemented with 2% (w/v) glucose was inoculated 
with a 1.5-mL cryo stock of L. diolivorans LMG 19668 
and incubated overnight (30 °C, 180 rpm). An aliquot of 
this overnight culture was used to inoculate 500 mL MRS 
medium “pH 5.7” supplemented with 2% (w/v) glucose 
and 1% (w/v) glycine to an  OD
600 of 0.25 AU. After 3 h 
of incubation (30  °C, without shaking), cells were har -
vested by centrifugation (5  min, 4000g, 4  °C), washed 
four times with 0.3 M sucrose supplemented with 20 mM 
 MgCl
2 and once with 0.3  M sucrose. The cells were 
finally resuspended in an electroporation buffer (272 mM 
sucrose, 7  mM sodium phosphate, 0.5  mM  MgCl
2, pH 
7.4). An 80 µL aliquot of cells was mixed with 20 µL DNA

solution (3  µg) and electroporation was carried out at 
2500  V, 200Ω, and 25  µF in an electroporation cuvette 
with 4-mm gap width. Immediately after, the cells were 
resuspended in 900  µL MRS medium “pH 5.7” supple
-
mented with 2% (w/v) glucose, 0.3 M sucrose, and 20 mM 
 MgCl
2. This mix was transferred into a 1.5-mL Eppendorf 
tube, placed on a tube rack and positioned in a shaking 
incubator (30  °C, 180  rpm, 3  h). After this regeneration 
period, the cell suspension was plated on degassed MRS 
plate’s “pH 5.7” containing 2% (w/v) glucose and 2.5 µg/
mL erythromycin and was incubated in an anaerobic jar 
at 30 °C for 3 days.
Growth medium
The cultivations were performed in a two-step cultiva -
tion process. First of all, biomass was generated in a seed 
reactor containing a modified form of the MRS medium 
as described by De Man et  al. [33] supplemented with 
5  mg/L vitamin  B
12, 2.5  µg/mL erythromycin, 3% (w/v) 
glucose and either 1% (w/v) crude glycerol or 0.5% (w/v) 
1,2-PDO. The second step, namely biotransformation, 
was performed in varying amounts of crude glycerol sup
-
plemented with 5 mg/L vitamin  B12 and 2.5 µg/mL eryth-
romycin. Crude glycerol used in this study was obtained 
from Universal Adsorbent & Chemicals Public Co. Ltd. 
Thailand and had an original concentration of 810  g/L 
glycerol. For the individual experiments, crude glycerol 
was used without further pretreatment and was accord
-
ingly diluted with water. The medium of the seed reac -
tor was adjusted to pH 5.7 using 32% HCl, whereas the 
medium for biotransformation was adjusted to pH 7 
using 4  M NaOH. Both media were supplemented with 
1% (v/v)  Struktol
® SB2121 dropwise to avoid foam forma-
tion, when required.
Bioreactor cultivations
All bioreactor cultivations were performed in  DASGIP® 
parallel bioreactor systems (Eppendorf International) 
using three biological replicates—if not otherwise men
-
tioned. For the seed reactors, an initial cultivation volume 
of 700 mL was inoculated to an  OD
600 of 0.2 AU (initial 
active biomass characterization experiments) or 0.4  AU 
(active biomass for biotransformation experiments) with 
1.5% (v/v) inoculum from an exponentially growing pre
-
culture. These seed reactors were operated at a constant 
temperature of 30  °C, pH 5.7, 400  rpm agitation, and 2 
sL/min  N
2-gassing in order to maintain anaerobic con -
ditions. Throughout the cultivation process, pH 5.7 was 
maintained by the use of 12.5%  NH
3 as base supply.
Cell harvest
Towards the end of the exponential growth phase, cells 
were harvested by centrifugation (4000g, 5  min, 20  °C). 
The pellet was washed with sterile water, centrifuged 
again and finally resuspended in sterile water accounting 
for 1.5% (v/v) of the original seed culture volume.
Biotransformation
The cell fraction from the seed reactors was used as 
inoculum for the biotransformation process. Thereby the 
reactors were operated with a culture volume of 350 mL 
at a constant temperature of 30 °C, pH 7, 400 rpm agita
-
tion, and 2 sL/min  N 2-gassing. Throughout the cultiva -
tion process, pH 7 was maintained by the use of 12.5% 
 NH
3 as base supply.
Measurement of cell growth
Biomass production was determined by measuring the 
optical density at 600 nm, and cell dry mass (CDM) was 
calculated by a correlation established by Pflügl et al. [28].
Quantification of extracellular metabolites
Extracellular metabolites like d-glucose, glycerol, 3-HPA, 
3-HP , 1,2-PDO, 1,3-PDO, lactic acid, acetic acid, and 
ethanol were determined by HPLC analysis (Shimadzu, 
Korneuburg, Austria) with an Aminex HPX-87H column 
(300  mm  ×  7.8  mm; Biorad) equipped with a Micro-
Guard Cation H Cartridge (30  mm  ×  4.6  mm, Bio
-
rad). The column was operated at 60 °C and a flow rate 
of 0.6  mL/min with 0.004  M  H
2SO4 as mobile phase. A 
refraction index detector (RID-10A, Shimadzu, Korneu -
burg, Austria) and a UV–VIS photodiode array detector 
(SPD-M20A, Shimadzu, Korneuburg, Austria) were used 
for detection. We observed a tailing peak for 3-HPA in 
the RID detector which is overlapping with the peak of 
1,3-PDO and therefore compromising the accurate quan
-
tification of this metabolite. As a result thereof, 3-HPA 
quantification was performed by using the UV detector 
at 210  nm [34] where the presence of small amounts of 
1,3-PDO can be neglected due to its extremely low sig
-
nal intensity (Additional file  2: Figure S2). Moreover, as 
the concentration of 1,3-PDO cannot exceed the levels of 
equimolar amounts of 3-HP , maximum levels of 0.84 g/L 
are expected in the presence of 1 g/L 3-HP .
Cell breakage
Cells from the seed reactors or the biotransformation 
process were centrifuged (15,000g, 2 min, 4 °C), washed 
with degassed 20  mM potassium phosphate buffer (pH 
8) and resuspended in the same buffer. Cell suspensions 
were subjected to physical cell disintegration by a Bead 
Beater (Fast-Prep-24TM, MP biomedicals, USA) at 6 m/s 
for 20 s (5 cycles). Broken cells were centrifuged (15,000g, 
20  min, 4  °C) and the supernatant was collected in an 
anaerobic atmosphere to measure glycerol dehydratase 
activity [35] and protein concentration [36].

Results and discussion
Evaluation of major bottlenecks attributed to 3‑HPA 
formation in L. diolivorans
The most crucial steps for the production of 3-HPA are 
the initial uptake of glycerol into the cell, followed by the 
conversion of the intracellular glycerol into 3-HPA by 
glycerol dehydratase (see Fig.  1). Members of the genus 
Lactobacillus are reported to accumulate 3-HPA extra
-
cellularly, ensuring a low, non-toxic level of intracellu -
lar 3-HPA [18, 37]—pointing to the fact that export is 
not limiting. Taking furthermore into account that the 
exporting transporters are currently not known, the fol
-
lowing study is focusing primarily on limitations related 
to the glycerol uptake and further conversion to 3-HPA.
A first set of experiments aimed at the comparison 
of the GDHt activity with the actual rate of glycerol 
to 3-HPA conversion. To this end, batch cultures on 
MRS medium supplemented with 3% (w/v) glucose and 
1% (w/v) glycerol were performed. Under this condi
-
tion, 3-HPA is entirely converted into 1,3-PDO [28]. This 
conversion step proceeds in a fast and efficient manner 
within growing cells, ensuring that the concentration of 
toxic 3-HPA is kept low. We opted for this setup to gain 
insight into the potential of the biomass for the desired 
conversion without any interference of 3-HPA toxicity.
Lactobacillus diolivorans is not able to use glycerol as 
a sole carbon and energy source. This was confirmed by 
substrate utilization tests and  C
13 labeling experiments 
(data not shown). This characteristic is also reported for 
Lactobacillus reuteri, which lacks a dihydroxyacetone 
kinase required for channeling glycerol into the cen
-
tral carbon metabolism [24]. Genome analysis of L. dio -
livorans reveals that a bona-fide dihydroxyacetone kinase 
is also missing in this organism. There is a bioinformatic 
annotation for a “kinase to dihydroxyacetone kinase” 
(83 amino acids, NCBI Sequence ID: WP_057864359.1), 
which is rather short compared to the 356 amino acid 
long dihydroxyacetone kinase of other organisms like K. 
pneumoniae [38, 39] and therefore most probably not 
functional. This could be the reason why glycerol cannot 
serve as sole carbon and energy source in L. diolivorans.
Glycerol is converted via a one-step reaction towards 
the formation of 3-HPA in L. diolivorans. This reaction 
is catalyzed by a glycerol dehydratase, encoded by the 
gene cluster pduCDE [ 40]. As there is no side reaction 
diverting the flux of glycerol into biomass formation, 
the glycerol uptake rate is equal to the rate of glycerol 
conversion to 3-HPA. In addition to this, the potential 
of glycerol conversion based on the present GDHt activ
-
ity can be derived via an in vitro enzymatic assay from 
crude cell extract as described by Sankaranarayanan 
et al. [35]. These two values are based on either cell dry 
mass—in case of glycerol uptake and conversion rates—
or on measured protein content of the crude cell extract 
in case of enzymatically measured GDHt activity. Both 
values can be compared based on the assumption of 
bacterial protein content accounting for around 50% of 
CDM [35, 41, 42].
The performance of batch cultures of L. diolivorans 
LMG 19668 + EV is illustrated in Fig. 2a. Under this con
-
dition, glycerol is solely converted to 1,3-PDO as final 
product, without accumulation of 3-HPA or 3-HP in the 
fermentation broth [28]. The detailed analysis of these 
batch cultivations indicated that there is a significant dis
-
crepancy between the rate of glycerol conversion which 
equals the glycerol uptake rate. The required GDHt 
activity for this conversion can be calculated—it equals 
approximately 0.07 U/mg protein. The in vitro measured 
GDHt activity at the end of the exponential growth phase 
is 0.13 U/mg protein (Fig.  3). These results show that L.

diolivorans LMG 19668  + EV uses just 54% of its actual 
glycerol dehydratase capabilities. This points to the fact 
that the glycerol dehydratase is not the limiting factor for 
glycerol conversion. In order to test, if the glycerol uptake 
is the limiting factor a genetic engineering approach was 
chosen aiming at the significant upregulation of glycerol 
uptake into the cell.
Genetic engineering aiming at the upregulation of glycerol 
uptake
In order to enhance the glycerol uptake of L. diolivorans, 
the endogenous glycerol uptake facilitating protein 
PduF was overexpressed from a recombinant plasmid. 
This gene is part of the glycerol converting pdu operon 
of L. diolivorans and shows a high sequence similarity 
with glycerol uptake facilitator proteins for members of 
the species Lactobacillus. Moreover, there is a sequence 
similarity to the experimentally characterized glycerol 
facilitator GlpF from E. coli, which is responsible for the 
passive transport of small hydrophilic species like glyc
-
erol across the inner membrane [43]. Genome analy -
sis also revealed that beside the pduF  gene there are no 
further annotations for members of the major intrin -
sic protein (MIP) family (glycerol uptake facilitators, 
aquaporins), indicating the importance of this gene. In 
a baker’s yeast based complementation assay, we could 
confirm the capability of the pduF  encoded protein to 
enhance glycerol uptake (data not shown).
In order to determine differences related to the uptake 
of glycerol between the strains L. diolivorans LMG 
19668  +  EV and L. diolivorans LMG 19668  +  pduF, 
batch cultures on MRS medium supplemented with 3% 
(w/v) glucose and 1% (w/v) glycerol were performed and 
the actual GDHt activity was determined towards the end 
of the exponential growth phase. The overexpression of 
pduF leads to a significant increase of the average glycerol

uptake rate by a factor of 1.3, from initially 0.21 g/(g CDM 
h) to 0.27  g/(g CDM h) (q s, max   =  0.35  g/(gCDM h)). This 
points to the fact that the glycerol uptake has been limit -
ing before (see Fig. 2b). Surprisingly, the measured GDHt 
activity in the L. diolivorans LMG 19668  +  pduF strain 
is also increased, reaching a value of 0.17 U/mg protein 
at the end of the exponential growth phase and leaving 
again a gap between the potential for glycerol conversion 
based on measured GDHt activity and the actual rate of 
glycerol conversion (Fig. 3).
These results prove that the overexpression of pduF  in 
L. diolivorans has a positive effect on the glycerol uptake 
rates and they indicate that overexpression of pduF  leads 
to significantly higher GDHt activity values.
Increased induction of glycerol dehydratase activity in L. 
diolivorans
Though GDHt featured significantly higher activity val -
ues in the strain overexpressing pduF , the overall meas -
ured GDHt activity of 0.17 U/mg protein is still low for an 
efficient 3-HPA production process. To further increase 
the activity of glycerol dehydratase, glycerol is substituted 
with 1,2-PDO as inducing agent in the growth medium. 
This has been reported to achieve significantly higher 
dehydratase activity values for L. reuteri [44].
For the generation of active biomass, batch cultures on 
MRS medium supplemented with 3% (w/v) glucose and 
0.5% (w/v) 1,2-PDO were performed. It could be dem
-
onstrated that the addition of 1,2-PDO or glycerol leads 
to a similar growth behavior, though the supplementa
-
tion with 1,2-PDO yields a significantly higher measured 
GDHt activity (0.85 U/mg protein or 1.11 U/mg protein 
for the strains L. diolivorans LMG 19668  + EV or L. dio
-
livorans LMG 19668  +  pduF, respectively). Also in this 
case, the pduF  overexpressing strain has an enhanced 
activity compared to the empty vector control. Interest -
ingly, the obtained activity is also significantly higher 
compared to the reported GDHt activity of 0.55  U/mg 
protein for L. reuteri induced by a comparable amount of 
1,2-PDO (Table 1).
Bioconversion of glycerol with resting cells of L. diolivorans
For the production of 3-HPA, a two-step cultivation pro -
cess consisting of the generation of active biomass, fol -
lowed by a quick bioconversion of glycerol, is the most 
promising approach. This two-step process design has 
been reported to achieve the best results with other 
microbial cell factories in terms of high GDHt activity, 
high productivities, and suppression of by-product for
-
mation [27]. Therefore, bioconversion experiments using 
active cells of either L. diolivorans LMG 19668 + EV or L. 
diolivorans LMG 19668  + pduF with 1,2-PDO as induc
-
ing agent were performed on 2% (w/v) crude glycerol.
The bioconversion experiments showed that activated 
cells of L. diolivorans were excellent whole cell biocata -
lysts for the production of 3-HPA (Fig.  4). L. diolivorans  
LMG 19668  +  pduF exhibited a significantly higher 
average glycerol uptake rate (q S = 8.7 g/(g CDM h), 0.5 h) 
as compared to the empty vector control (q S  =  4.2  g/
(gCDM h), 1 h). Within the first 0.5 h hardly any forma -
tion of 1,3-PDO and 3-HP was observed. Interestingly, 
by-product formation significantly increased after 
around 0.5 h for both strains, indicating potential time-
dependent effects of increased 3-HPA levels in the fer

Improving the performance of glycerol bioconversion in L. 
diolivorans
To produce industrially relevant levels of 3-HPA, over -
all titers need to be increased. Therefore, initial glycerol 
concentrations for the bioconversion process were raised 
from initially 2% (w/v) to 5% (w/v) crude glycerol.

This increase in initial glycerol concentration leads to 
an increase in final titers up to 28 g/L 3-HPA, however at 
the cost of productivity q 3-HPA = 3.5 g/g CDM h and a low 
yield of 0.70  mol3-HPA/molGlycerol due to incomplete uti -
lization of glycerol and increased by-product formation 
of around 1.3 and 1.2 g/L for 3-HP and 1,3-PDO, respec
-
tively (Fig. 5).
To overcome low productivities and ensure a complete 
utilization of glycerol, the amount of activated biocata -
lyst was increased from initially 5 g/L CDW up to 15 g/L 
CDW (Fig.  5). This increase in biocatalyst during bio
-
conversions on 5% glycerol had a beneficiary effect on 
productivity, which reached 4.8 g/g
CDM h—similar to the 
performance on 2% (w/v) glycerol and with lower biocat -
alyst concentration. Furthermore, the overall titer could 
be improved to 36 g/L 3-HPA, corresponding to a molar 
yield of 91%. By-product formation using this approach 
was slightly increased up to 1.4 and 1.3 g/L for 3-HP and 
1,3-PDO, respectively.
Repeated batch bioconversions of L. diolivorans
A drawback of the two-step production process is the 
necessity of large amounts of active biomass. Biomass 
production has a significant impact on overall process 
costs. It also has a significant impact on real product 
yields because the carbon source required for the genera
-
tion of active biomass must be taken into account from 
an industrial point of view. One option to circumvent this 
problem is the recycling of biomass at the end of the bio
-
conversion process.
Therefore, cells from the end of a 3-HPA production 
process on 2% (w/v) glycerol were harvested, washed, 
and incubated in a fresh bioconversion media. How -
ever, 3-HPA accumulation started only after a significant 
lag phase of 15  min (data not shown). Therefore, also 
dehydratase activities measured after 10  min of incuba

utilization stopped after 0.5 h reaching a final titer of only 
9 g/L 3-HPA and a molar yield of 45% due to the incom -
plete utilization of glycerol. This indicates that the cells 
are severely damaged by the high 3-HPA concentrations 
to which they have been exposed during the first round of 
production. Hence, repeated batch bioconversion is not a 
suitable strategy for decreasing the amount of required 
active biomass without any protection of the biocatalyst.
Comparison of the bioconversion of glycerol to 3‑HPA by L. 
diolivorans to other cell factories
To our knowledge, the best values for biotechnological 
production of 3-HPA have been obtained with L. reuteri. 
Results obtained from L. reuteri cells activated with glyc
-
erol show that this organism is capable of producing up 
to 17.4  g/L 3-HPA from 36.8  g/L glycerol with a molar 
yield of 62% [45]. Decreasing the glycerol concentration 
to 20 g/L leads to an improved molar yield of 85% on the 
expense of the final 3-HPA concentration (12.6 g/L) [46, 
47]. 1,2-PDO-activated cells of L. diolivorans—in com
-
parison—accumulate 17.8  g/L 3-HPA from 2% crude 
glycerol with a molar yield of 99%.
A major point of hindrance for microbial produc
-
tion of 3-HPA is its toxicity, which has a serious nega -
tive impact on cell viability and pathway enzyme activity 
[35, 48]. One approach for overcoming these limitations 
is the protection of the biocatalyst by the application of 
scavengers like semicarbazide or carbohydrazide which 
are binding 3-HPA in form of hydrazone complexes and 
thereby allowing the accumulation of higher 3-HPA con
-
centrations in the fermentation broth. Bioconversion 
using 1,2-PDO activated cells of L. reuteri in combination 
with semicarbazide as scavenger results in the produc
-
tion of 26 g/L 3-HPA from 5% glycerol with a productiv -
ity of 1.7 g/(g CDM h) [24]. L. diolivorans cells activated by 
1,2-PDO reach similar titers however with a significantly 
higher productivity of 3.5  g/(g
CDM h) in the absence of 
any scavengers—indicating superior biocatalyst prop -
erties under the tested conditions. Currently, L. reuteri 
features with the production of up to 150  g/L 3-HPA 
and a productivity of 10.7 g/L h the best 3-HPA produc
-
tion process [49]. However, the costs of scavengers and 
the increased costs for purification need to be taken into 
account.
Among other bacteria, Klebsiella pneumoniae is an 
alternative production host for 3-HPA. Its ability to use 
glycerol as a sole carbon source leads to a significant loss 
of substrate for biomass formation in case of growing 
cells. In a bioconversion process including scavengers, 
final titers of 46  g/L of 3-HPA with molar yields up to 
80% are reported for this organism [50]. 3-HPA produc
-
tion within a fed-batch process featuring high scavenger 
concentrations and successive addition of active biomass 
was reported to achieve yields up to 97% (not taking the 
formation of biomass into account) thereby reaching the 
highest reported final titer of 54  g/L 3-HPA [51]. How
-
ever, K. pneumoniae is considered a human pathogen, a 
characteristic which limits its industrial applications.
Another promising candidate for 3-HPA produc -
tion is Citrobacter freundii. The highest concentrations 
of 3-HPA are reported for the C. freundii mutant strain 
HPAO-1 by obtaining a yield of 92% from 5% glycerol in 
the presence of semicarbazide hydrochloride [52].
Conclusion
This study demonstrates for the first time the potential of 
L. diolivorans as a valuable cell factory for the valoriza
-
tion of crude glycerol towards 3-HPA extending the C3 
product range from 1,3-PDO and 3-HP towards platform 
chemicals like acrolein and acrylic acid. The combinato
-
rial approach of process and metabolic engineering ena -
bled to overcome bottlenecks associated with glycerol 
uptake and significantly upregulated the activity of glyc
-
erol dehydratase. Based on our results, we propose an 
integrated biodiesel biorefinery concept (Fig.  6) where 
crude glycerol is upgraded in a first step into 1,3-PDO 
[28–30]. It could be demonstrated in previous stud
-
ies that L. diolivorans is a promising cell factory for the 
production of 1,3-PDO from crude glycerol achieving 
maximum titers of 92  g/L 1,3-PDO with a molar yield 
up to 94% [30]. In order to improve the economic viabil
-
ity of the overall biorefinery concept, the valorization of 
side streams (beside crude glycerol) into new product 
and value streams is of major importance. The biomass 
obtained from the production of 1,3-PDO (0.09  ton 
CDM/ton 1,3-PDO) can be employed within a next pro
-
cess step upgrading crude glycerol into 3-HPA, which is 
another product of interest. Considering a 3-HPA pro
-
duction process as described in this study, maximum 
titers of 36 g/L 3-HPA with a molar yield of 91% can be 
obtained using L. diolivorans as microbial cell factory. 
The biomass obtained for the production of 1 ton of 1,3-
PDO will allow the production of 0.21 tons of 3-HPA. A 
continuous supply of biomass originating from 1,3-PDO 
production eliminates the need for scavengers during 
3-HPA production to protect the biomass. Moreover, the 
carbon-rich waste stream—mainly acetic acid—from the 
first process step can be used as input for biogas produc
-
tion. Acetic acid yields an energy output of 1300 kWh as 
methane if fed into a classical biogas fermentation. This 
concept is depicted in Fig. 6.
1,3-PDO as well as 3-HPA represent both interesting 
platform chemicals—the former as precursor chemical 
for the production of polyesters like polytrimethylene 
terephthalate (PTT) [53] and the latter one for the pro
-
duction of acrolein [54]. Bioprocesses for the production

Lindlbauer et al. Biotechnol Biofuels  (2017) 10:295 
of both compounds from glycerol have been suggested in 
the literature. Among other lactic acid bacteria, L. reuteri 
has been reported to achieve 1,3-PDO productivities and 
yields comparable to L. diolivorans, though the maximum 
titers are with 65  g/L 1,3-PDO significantly lower [55]. 
For 3-HPA production with L. reuteri, a titer of 150 g/L 
has been reported—however, using scavengers to protect 
the cells [49]. The best 1,3-PDO process described to date 
is based on a recombinant E. coli strain within a fed-batch 
cultivation process with titers of 135 g/L 1,3-PDO, a pro
-
ductivity of 3.5 g/(Lh), and a weight yield of 51% based on 
corn-derived glucose [56]. The productivity is excellent; 
however, glucose as carbon source appears undesirable in 
context with our proposed biodiesel biorefinery concept. 
The significance of our proposed concept is the benefi
-
cial effect which can be derived by combining the two 
L. diolivorans-based production processes for 1,3-PDO 
and 3-HPA and integrating them into a biodiesel refin
-
ery. This results in a maximum valorization of the crude 
glycerol side stream into more profitable biochemicals. 
Furthermore, it significantly enhances the economics of 
3-HPA production by eliminating the need for additional 
seed reactors containing cost-intensive MRS-medium for 
biomass generation or the application of scavengers for 
biomass recycling. In addition to this, the setup is also 
beneficiary for the step of 1,3-PDO production as the 
both major side streams (acetic acid, biomass) are con
-
tinuously used in a next step. To conclude, this approach 
demonstrates an opportunity for creating an integrated 
oil plant-based biorefinery, producing biodiesel, 1,3-
PDO, 3-HPA, and a significant amount of energy in form 
of biogas.
