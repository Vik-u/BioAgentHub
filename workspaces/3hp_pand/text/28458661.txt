3-Hydroxypropanoic acid (3-HP) is an important biomass-derivable platform chemical
that can be converted into a number of industrially relevant compounds. There have
been several attempts to produce 3-HP from renewable sources in cell factories,
focusing mainly on Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Saccharomyces
cerevisiae. Despite the signiﬁcant progress made in this ﬁeld, commercially exploitable
large-scale production of 3-HP in microbial strains has still not been achieved.
In this study, we investigated the potential of Bacillus subtilis as a microbial
platform for bioconversion of glycerol into 3-HP . Our recombinant B. subtilis strains
overexpress the two-step heterologous pathway containing glycerol dehydratase and
aldehyde dehydrogenase from K. pneumoniae. Genetic engineering, driven by in
silico optimization, and optimization of cultivation conditions resulted in a 3-HP titer
of 10 g/L, in a standard batch cultivation. Our ﬁndings provide the ﬁrst report of
successful introduction of the biosynthetic pathway for conversion of glycerol into 3-HP
in B. subtilis. With this relatively high titer in batch, and the robustness of B. subtilis
in high density fermentation conditions, we expect that our production strains may
constitute a solid basis for commercial production of 3-HP .

INTRODUCTION
Concerns over usage of fossil fuels have led to the development of sustainable technologies to
convert renewable materials into various compounds such as alcohols, acids, and chemicals (Hanai
et al., 2007; Atsumi and Liao, 2008; Atsumi et al., 2008; McKenna and Nielsen, 2011; Borodina et al.,
2015). One of the very important biomass-derivable platform chemicals is 3-hydroxypropanoic
acid (3-HP; Choi et al., 2015). 3-HP can be used in the synthesis of bulk chemicals, such as
the acrylic acid (patent: WO 2013192451 A1), and plastics (Valdehuesa et al., 2013). Production
of 3-HP by chemical conversion is not desirable due to the high cost and toxic intermediates
leading to environmental issues (Jiang et al., 2009; Kumar et al., 2013). Glycerol, a by-product
of the biodiesel industry, is an attractive renewable starting material for production of 3-HP

Kalantari et al. 3-HP Production in B. subtilis
(Chen and Nielsen, 2016). The main bacterial pathway
for the synthesis of 3-HP from glycerol consists of two
enzymatic reactions. The ﬁrst is catalyzed by a coenzyme B 12-
dependent glycerol dehydratase, which converts glycerol into
3-hydroxypropionaldehyde (3-HPA). The second reaction is
the conversion of 3-HPA to 3-HP , catalyzed by an aldehyde
dehydrogenase (Raj et al., 2008). This biosynthetic pathway is
present in some natural producers of 3-HP , such as Klebsiella
pneumoniae (Kumar et al., 2012; Ashok et al., 2013) and
Lactobacillus reuteri(patent: US 20070148749 A1). The pathway
has been heterologously expressed and studied in Escherichia
coli and Saccharomyces cerevisiae (patent: WO 2011038364 A1;
Chen et al., 2014; Jung et al., 2015; Kildegaard et al., 2015).
Overexpression of the E. coli aldH gene in K. pneumoniae
resulted in co-production of 1,3-propanediol (1,3-PDO) and
3-HP with a 3-HP titer of 24.4 g/L (Huang et al., 2012). In another
study, 48.9 g/L of 3-HP was obtained in microaerobic fed-batch
fermentation of K. pneumoniae WM3 expressing aldH from
E. coli k12 (Huang et al., 2013). The recombinant E. coli BL21
expressing dhaB and gdrAB from K. pneumoniaeand KGSADH
from Azospirillum brasilenseproduced 38.7 g/L of 3-HP in fed-
batch condition (Rathnasingh et al., 2009). In another report,
deleting genes responsible for by products redirected the ﬂux
toward the 3-HP and resulted in higher titer of 57.3 g/L of 3-HP
in fed-batch (Kim et al., 2014). Until now, the highest reported
titer of 3-HP is 71.9 g/L using mutated aldehyde dehydrogenase
(ALDH) ( GabD4) from Cupriavidus necator in E. coli (Chu
et al., 2015). Despite the noticeable progress in this area,
microbial production of 3-HP has not yet reached industrial-
scale productivity levels. Here we explored the possibility to
use and alternative host for heterologous expression of the
3-HP synthetic pathway, the Gram-positive model organism
Bacillus subtilis. It is non-pathogenic, generally recognized as
safe (GRAS), suitable for large scale cultivation and has high
growth rates. B. subtiliseﬃciently imports glycerol via a selective
glycerol facilitator (GlpF; da Silva et al., 2009), and reaches a
high growth rate on glycerol ( µmax =0.65 h−1; Kruyssen et al.,
1980). When expressing the 3-HP synthetic pathway in a new
host, the tolerance level toward 3-HP (Kildegaard et al., 2014)
and the intermediate 3-HPA (Hao et al., 2008) can be a major
consideration, resolved by a balanced expression of the two steps
in the pathway (Sankaranarayanan et al., 2014). We expressed
the 3-HP synthetic pathway from K. pneumoniae in B. subtilis.
Since this particular glycerol dehydratase is sensitive to oxygen,
micro-aerobic/anaerobic condition were required for optimal
3-HP production (Zhao et al., 2015). We carried out several
rounds of strain and medium optimization, which resulted in
a production strain capable of producing 10 g/L of 3-HP in
shaking ﬂasks, with the yield on glycerol ranging from 70 to
80%.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Strains and Plasmids
All the strains and plasmids used in this study are listed in
Table 1. B. subtilis 168 trp + was used as the host for genetic
manipulations. Integrative plasmid pBS1C (BGSC, Columbus,
USA) was used to clone dhaB, gdrAB, and puuC from
K. pneumoniae. The codon-optimized construct containing the
genes dhaB123, gdrAB, and puuC from K. pneumoniae was
ordered as synthetic fragment (GenScript, Piscataway, NJ, USA)
and cloned in the plasmid pBS1C. E. coli DH5α was used to
amplify plasmids listed in Table 1 and the B. subtilis 168 trp +
cells were transformed with the same plasmids using a previously
described method (Fabret et al., 2002).
Genetic Manipulations
All synthetic genes (codon optimized) were under control of
pHyperspank, a strong isopropyl β-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside
(IPTG)-inducible promoter of B. subtilis. A strong ribosome
binding site (RBS) from B. subtilis (ACATAAGGAGGAACTA
CT; kindly provided by Dominique Le Coq, INRA, France) was
added before each synthetic fragment. The entire construct was

Kalantari et al. 3-HP Production in B. subtilis
ligated into the pBS1C integrative plasmid (BGSC, Columbus,
USA) as an EcoRI–PstI fragment. The integrative construct was
used to transform B. subtilis 168 trp +. The 1glpk strains were
constructed either by using the single crossing over method
described by Vagner et al. (1998) or a seamless and irreversible
gene inactivation method (Arnaud et al., 2004). In the former,
the pMUTIN2 plasmid carrying a portion of glpK is integrated
into the B. subtilis genome through single cross-over event,
resulting in disrupting the glpK gene. In the latter, the pMAD
plasmid carrying a portion of the glpK gene is integrated at glpK
locus in the B. subtilisgenome in the ﬁrst cross-over event, and
the seamless and irreversible glpK knockout is obtained after
the second single cross-over event. Stability of the recombinant
constructs was tested by PCR using appropriate primers. All
recombinant plasmids were cloned in E. coliDH5α and used to
transform B. subtilis 168 trp +. All constructs were veriﬁed by
restriction digestion and sequencing.
Media and Growth
Escherichia coli strains and wild type (WT) B. subtilis were
cultured in Luria–Bertani (LB) broth at 37 ◦C in shaking
ﬂask (200 rpm) for genetic manipulations. For E. coli strains,
ampicillin was added to the medium when needed at 100 µg/mL.
Recombinant B. subtilis strains were grown in the minimal
medium (M9; Harwood and Cutting, 1990) complemented with
12 g/L glycerol, 12 g/L glucose, and/or 1 g/L yeast extract, when
required, at 37 ◦C in shaking ﬂask (200 rpm). Chloramphenicol
5 mg/mL and erythromycin 1 mg/mL were used when required to
select B. subtilistransformants. Coenzyme B12 (15 µM) and IPTG
(500 µM) were added in the medium. Recombinant B. subtilis
strains were cultured in rich media used in shaking ﬂask which
was composed of 2 ×M9: 40 g/L glycerol, 10 g/L yeast extract,
and 3 g/L peptone. Seeds medium contained M9Y (M9 medium
supplemented with 1 g/L yeast extract) with addition of 1%
glucose. Cultivation medium contained M9Y and/or 2 ×M9Y
with addition of diﬀerent concentration of glucose and glycerol
(the initial concentration for glucose was 0.8% and for glycerol
was about 2.7%). For batch cultivation in ﬂask, a single colony
was transferred into 50 mL falcon tube containing 10 mL seeds
medium and cultured in shaker at 37 ◦C and 200 rpm. Once the
cell OD600 reached about 2, 1 mL of seeds culture was inoculated
into 250 mL ﬂask containing 35 mL cultivation medium. In fed-
batch cultivation in ﬂask, ﬁve glucose tablets (FeedBead Glucose
discs) were added in each ﬂask to release the glucose slowly in
the medium. Flasks were shaken at 37 ◦C and 200 rpm, and were
kept in darkness. B. subtilis transformants were selected using
chloramphenicol 5 mg/mL and erythromycin 1 mg/mL when
required. Coenzyme B 12 (15 µM) and IPTG (500 µM) were
added in the medium. 3-HP production was followed in this setup
for 2–4 days.

3-HPA on B. subtilisGrowth
WT B. subtiliscells were grown in the M9 medium with 12 g/L
glycerol as the sole carbon source. 3-HP was purchased from TCI

synthesized (Burgé et al., 2015a). 3-HP was tested in a range
between 1 and 100 mM, while 3-HPA was tested between 0.02
and 20 mM. OD 600 of the bacterial culture was continuously
monitored for 24 h using a 96-well plate reader (Biotek, USA),
at 37◦C, with three biological replicates.
Proteomics Analysis
Cells were collected at four diﬀerent time points during
fermentation: 0, 24, 48, and 72 h. Cell pellets were re-suspended
in an sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) lysis buﬀer containing
4% SDS in 100 mM triethylammonium bicarbonate pH
8.0, 10 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid and a protease
inhibitor cocktail (Roche). The cell extract was boiled at

debris was removed by centrifugation. The protein pellet
obtained after chloroform/methanol precipitation was dissolved
in denaturation buﬀer containing 8 M urea in 10 mM Tris–
HCl pH 8.0. Protein concentration was measured by Bradford
protein assay. A total of 100 µg of each sample were separated
on a Mini-Protean
R⃝ TGXTM 4–20% gradient gel (Bio-Rad)
and stained with Bio-Safe TM Coomassie (Bio-Rad). Regions
corresponding to the size of “DhaB1” were cut and in-gel trypsin
(PierceTM) digestion was performed as described (Shevchenko
et al., 2007). Peptides were desalted using C-18 stage-tips and
analyzed on the Orbitrap Fusion TM TribridTM (Thermo Fischer
Scientiﬁc). An inclusion list consisting of m/z values in the
range of 400–1600 Da and charge states +2 and +3 only was
incorporated into the instrument method. Acquired mass spectra
were processed with the MaxQuant software suite (v.1.5.1.0; Cox
et al., 2009).

been identiﬁed as glycerol-3-phosphatase (Lindner et al.,
2012), we did not include corresponding reaction into the
model due to the low in vivo activity of these enzymes (data
not shown). The relevant reactions for 3-HP production
(Supplementary Figure S5) were added to the model. The
3-HP production envelopes were generated using COBRA
toolbox in Matlab (MathWorks, Inc., Natick, MA, USA).
For the simulation of aerobic growth in minimal medium
M9, the carbon uptake (glycerol and/or glucose) had a limit
of −10 mmol gDW −1 h−1 as the maximum uptake rate.
Aerobic conditions were simulated by setting the lower and
upper limits for the O 2 exchange ﬂux to free ( −1000 to
1000 mmol gDW −1 h−1). In addition, the uptake rates of
sulfate and ammonium were set to free, as were the K +, Na+,
Mg2+, Ca 2+, Fe 3+, CO 2, H 2O, and H + uptakes. For reaction
knockout simulations, the minimum and maximum ﬂuxes of the
corresponding reactions were set to 0. The reactions available to
knockout was reduced to a pool of approximately 400 reactions
that excluded exchange reactions, transporter reactions, and
essential reactions.
Metabolite Analyses
Glycerol, 3-HP , and lactate concentrations were measured using
high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) (Ultimate
3000, Dionex). 1 mL of culture samples were centrifuged at
12,000 ×g for 10 min, then 200 µL of 8 mM H 2SO4 was
added to 800 µL of the supernatant and ﬁltered through
a 0.20 µm pore size nitrocellulose ﬁlter (Sartorius Stedim).
Separation was performed on a Bio-Rad Aminex HPX-87H
column (300 mm × 7.8 mm; Bio-Rad, Richmond, USA)
connected to a VWD-3100 detector (Thermo Scientiﬁc Dionex)
with 0.5 or 8 mM H 2SO4 as the eluent, as described by Burgé
et al. (2015b). All samples were analyzed in three replicates.
Gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GC-MS) was also used
to quantify the 3-HP and lactate. All samples were derivatized
with methyl chloroformate. For quality control, a mixed pooled
sample (QC sample) was created by taking an aliquot from
each sample. Testing of matrix eﬀects was performed by
spiking/dilution of QC samples. The GC-MS data were processed
by PARAFAC2 model from MS-Omics1.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Sensitivity of B. subtilisto 3-HPA
and 3-HP
The product of the ﬁrst step of conversion of glycerol to 3-HP
is 3-HPA, known to be toxic to some bacteria (Hao et al.,
2008). We examined the eﬀect of 3-HPA and 3-HP on B. subtilis
growing on the M9 minimum medium supplemented with
glycerol. The 3-HPA exhibited a strong inhibitory eﬀect from very
low concentrations. The speciﬁc growth rate in the 0–0.1 mM
range (red-colored group, Figure 1A) was 0.55 h−1. It decreased
to 0.27 h −1 for the 0.2–1 mM range (green-colored group,
Figure 1A ), and the growth was completely abolished in the
2–20 mM range (blue-colored group, Figure 1A). The lag phase
was also prolonged as the concentration of 3-HPA increased
(9:30 h, 14:30 h, and 20 h for the three groups, respectively).
B. subtilis cells were much more tolerant toward 3-HP. The
speciﬁc growth rate in the 0–35 mM range (red-colored group,
Figure 1B) was 0.59 h−1. It decreased slightly to 0.56 h−1 for the
50–80 mM range (green-colored group, Figure 1B) and further
to µ =0.54 h−1 for the 90–100 mM range (blue-colored group,
Figure 1B). The lag phase was also aﬀected as the concentration
of 3-HP increased (7:30 h, 9:30 h, and 13:30 h for the three
groups, respectively). It is important to note that the 3-HP
sample was buﬀered, so the growth eﬀects were not due to the
acidiﬁcation of the medium. Regarding the tolerance level of
other microorganisms toward 3-HP , is has been reported that
E. coli has normal growth in M9 with addition of 100 mM
of 3-HP , while the growth signiﬁcantly decreases with 3-HP
concentrations in the range of 330–440 mM (Chun et al., 2014).
There has also been a report on S. cerevisiae strains tolerant
to 50 g/L 3-HP obtained through adaptive laboratory evolution
(Kildegaard et al., 2014). Our results indicate that B. subtilis is

fairly tolerant to 3-HP , but highlight the importance of preventing
the accumulation of the 3-HPA in the cell.
Expression of the Codon-optimized 3-HP
Pathway from K. pneumoniaeLeads to
the Production of 3-HP
The dhaB and puuC, coding for the B 12-dependent glycerol
dehydratase and aldehyde dehydrogenase from K. pneumoniae,
were codon optimized for B. subtilis (GenScript). The
optimization concerned 23% of the codons. All modiﬁed
codons can be seen in an alignment of non-optimized and
optimized sequences provided in Supplementary Figure S1.
The synthetic genes were expressed in B. subtilis from a single
construct in pBS1C-3, resulting in the strain h-syn- KpDhaB-
PuuC. The entire construct was under the control of a strong
promoter pHyperspank (Vagner et al., 1998), and each gene was
preceded by the strong RBS (ACATAAGGAGGAACTACT). The
B. subtilisstrain containing the empty pBS1C plasmid ( pBS1C-E
strain) was used as the control. We conﬁrmed the expression
of the glycerol dehydratase and aldehyde dehydrogenase in
the h-syn- KpDhaB-PuuC crude extract by mass spectrometry
(MS/MS spectra shown in Supplementary Figure S2), which were
detected with excellent coverage and no ambiguity. The h-syn-
KpDhaB-PuuC and pBS1C-E strains were cultured and samples
were collected at regular intervals after induction to measure
the growth rate, glycerol consumption and 3-HP production
(Figure 2 ). The growth rates (Supplementary Figure S3) and
glycerol consumption ( Figure 2 ) were comparable for both
strains. After 24 h, 3-HP was detected in the h-syn- KpDhaB-
PuuC culture at 180 mg/L ( Figure 2A ). As expected, no 3-HP
was detected in the control strain pBS1C-E (Figure 2B). Growth
proﬁles of h-syn- KpDhaB-PuuC and pBS1C-E are shown
in Figure 2C . Quantiﬁcation of 3-HP was conﬁrmed by an
independent method using GC-MS (Supplementary Figure S4).
Since the growth rate was not aﬀected by the expression of
the heterologous pathway, we concluded that 3-HPA is not
accumulating in the production strain, and no further balancing
of the expression of the two reaction steps was needed. The B 12-
dependent DhaB from K. pneumoniae is sensitive to excessive
oxygen (Zhao et al., 2015), so we compared the production of
3-HP in micro-aerobic and fully aerobic conditions ( Figure 3A)
and their respective growth proﬁle ( Figure 3B ). In the semi-
aerobic condition the h-syn- KpDhaB-PuuC clearly performed
better, so this condition was used throughout the following
optimization steps. These results altogether indicate that the
codon-optimized synthetic version of the 3-HP biosynthetic
pathway was correctly expressed and functional in B. subtilis.
There has been a report on positive eﬀect of glucose addition to
the 3-HP producing strain ofE. coligrown on glycerol, increasing
the 3-HP production by reducing the imbalance between the ﬁrst
and second step of the pathway (Niu et al., 2016). To test whether
this eﬀect applies to our strain, we grew the h-syn-KpDhaB-PuuC
in two conditions: (1) 1.2% glycerol as the sole carbon source and
(2) 1.2% glycerol supplemented with 1.2% glucose. Our results
showed no signiﬁcant increase in 3-HP production when adding
glucose to the culture. The 3-HP production was identical in
both conditions (approximately 200 mg/L with less than 3%
diﬀerence). We concluded that this eﬀect does not apply to our
production strain.

production. (A) Recombinant strain with a knocked-out glycerol kinase (glpk)

h-syn-KpDhaB-PuuC-1glpK-i) cultivated in the M9 medium with glucose,
induced by IPTG, and supplemented with B12 and (A) 12 g/L glycerol, (B)

pathway (Supplementary Figure S5 and Figure 4A) was used to
predict targets for optimizing the 3-HP production. As shown
in Figure 4B, the predicted maximum growth rate was achieved
when using glucose as the sole carbon source, while the predicted
maximum 3-HP production rate was reached when using glycerol
as the sole carbon source. When growing on both glucose and
glycerol, the ﬂux of glycerol to 3-HP biosynthesis is negatively
related to the ﬂux of glycerol to biomass, indicating that the
reduction of glycerol conversion to biomass should improve the
3-HP yield. Our in silicoanalysis (Supplementary Table S1) was
performed to identify single gene knockouts which are expected
to improve 3-HP production under these conditions. As expected
from the literature (Jung et al., 2014; Tsuruno et al., 2015),
the deletion of the gene glpK, which encodes glycerol kinase,
was the top candidate for redirecting the metabolic ﬂux toward
3-HP biosynthesis when grown on a combination of glucose
and glycerol. The glpK strain was the only knockout predicted
to achieve high productivity, while maintaining an acceptable
growth rate.
Inactivation of glpK Leads to Increased
3-HP Production
GlpK catalyzes the formation of glycerol-3-phosphate from
glycerol, which is further converted to dihydroxyacetone
phosphate to enter glycolysis (Holmberg et al., 1990). Based
on the in silico prediction presented above, the glpK gene
was knocked out using the method reported by Vagner et al.
(1998) resulting in strains h-syn -KpDhaB-PuuC-1glpK-i and
pBS1C-E-1glpK, respectively. This deletion naturally suppressed
the growth on glycerol as the sole carbon source (data not
shown). We therefore cultured the strains h-syn-KpDhaB-PuuC-
1glpK-i and pBS1C-E-1glpK in the M9 minimum medium
supplemented with glucose up to the induction point at
OD600 = 1.2. 3-HP was detected in the h-syn -KpDhaB-
PuuC-1glpK-i culture 8 h after induction (50 mg/L) and
its concentration increased to the maximum of 1 g/L after
60 h ( Figure 5A ). As expected, non-induced and pBS1C-E-
1glpk produced no 3-HP (Supplementary Figure S6). The
glycerol uptake was not reduced in h-syn-KpDhaB-PuuC-1glpK-
i (Figure 5A ) compared to the control strain (Supplementary
Figure S6A), indicating that the glpK knockout successfully
redirected the ﬂux toward 3-HP production. Next, we increased
the glycerol concentration to 25 g/L, but this failed to increase
the 3-HP titer ( Figure 5B ). This indicated that one (or more)
of the pathway components does not operate at the maximum
rate.
3-HP Production Increased to 10 g/L in
the Semi-deﬁned and Rich Media
The maximal OD600 reached by the strain h-syn-KpDhaB-PuuC-
1glpK-i in the M9 medium was 3.8. To reach higher cell density,
we further cultured the production strain in M9 supplemented
with 1 g/L yeast extract. The maximal cell OD 600 reached 4.7
(Figure 6A ) after 20.5 h, which is about 24% higher than
in the M9 medium. This strain produced 1.23 g/L of 3-HP
and consumed 2.4 g/L glycerol at the end of the cultivation
(after 44 h), with a yield of 0.51 g 3-HP/g glycerol. The less
than 100% yield is common in other bacterial cell factories,
and is usually due to competing pathways, such as 1,3-PDO
production (Dishisha et al., 2015), or conversion of glycerol to
lactate via the methylglyoxal pathway (Landmann et al., 2011).
We also observed that glucose and glycerol were consumed
simultaneously from 5 to 20.5 h, which suggested that the

incubation of the production strain in the medium with glucose and glycerol. The restituted wild type (WT) glpK diverts the ﬂux from glycerol to biomass, and reduces
the ﬂux to 3-HP , thus decreasing the 3-HP yield on glycerol. In the early stage of the experiment (left), glucose is used for biomass production, and a high yield of
3-HP on glycerol is achieved. At the late stage of the experiment (right), glucose is exhausted, glpK WT is restituted, and 3-HP yield on glycerol is diminished.

Kalantari et al. 3-HP Production in B. subtilis

expression of glpF, the gene encoding glycerol transporter, was
most probably not negatively regulated by the presence of
glucose. Since there is only one copy of dhaB123, gdrAB, and
puuC genes in h-syn-KpDhaB-PuuC-1glpK-i strain, we inferred
that the expression of these genes brings no obvious metabolic
burden. Therefore, we induced the expression of synthetic
pathway at the beginning of the cultivation. As shown in the
Figure 6B, the early induction had no obvious negative eﬀect on
cell growth. A titer of 1.56 and 1.76 g/L 3-HP was accumulated
at 20.5 and 44 h, respectively, and the 3-HP yield on glycerol
reached 0.83 g/g. The ability of h-syn -KpDhaB-PuuC-1glpK-i
to produce 3-HP was also evaluated in a rich medium. As
shown in Figure 6C, a ﬁnal 3-HP titer of 7.6 g/L was achieved
and 21.4 g/L glycerol was consumed after a 64 h cultivation.
However, the average 3-HP yield was only 0.35 g/g glycerol,
much lower than the one obtained in the semi-deﬁned medium.
The glycerol consumption rate signiﬁcantly increased from 40 to
64 h, accompanied by an increase in growth rate and biomass
accumulation. In the same period, the 3-HP yield decreased
from 0.78 g/g (0–40 h) to 0.17 g/g (40–64 h) glycerol. We
suspected that this growth transition and the decrease in yield
was caused by the instability of the 1glpK mutation. Under our
cultivation conditions, it is possible for the pMUTIN2-2 to exit
the chromosome, resulting in the restitution of the functional
glpK. Before the glucose in the medium is exhausted, up to
40 h, glucose is converted into biomass and glycerol is eﬃciently
converted to 3-HP (80% yield; Figure 6D ). Once the glucose
is exhausted, selection pressure restitutes the WT glpK, and
glycerol is then mainly converted to biomass, with the 3-HP
yield dropping to 40% ( Figure 6D). To test this assumption, we
plated the cultures grown in the production setup after 64 h, and
counted the colony forming units (CFU) on M9 supplemented
with either glucose or glycerol (10 g/L). The CFU counts of
the strain h-syn -KpDhaB-PuuC-1glpK-i on M9-glycerol plate
was 71 ±11% of that on M9-glucose plates, indicating that
a signiﬁcant sub-population of cells have restituted WT glpK.
This explains the reduced yield of 3-HP on glycerol after 40 h
of cultivation, since the loss of the 1glpK mutation diverts the
ﬂux from glycerol to biomass, and reduces the ﬂux to 3-HP
(Figure 6D ). The loss of the glpK knockout during cultivation
could also be detected by PCR, checked at four diﬀerent time
points (Supplementary Figure S7A). To counter this eﬀect,
we constructed an irreversible 1glpK strain using the method
described by Arnaud et al. (2004). Using this method, the pMAD
plasmid is ﬁrst integrated at the glpK locus in the B. subtilis
genome, and then the deletion is achieved when the plasmid
leaves the chromosome in the second crossing over event.
The resulting strain was named h-syn -KpDhaB-PuuC-1glpK-ii.
Stability of the glpK knockout in this strain was conﬁrmed by
PCR at four diﬀerent time points throughout the cultivation
(Supplementary Figure S7B). Moreover, full stability of the
integrated heterologous pathway was also conﬁrmed by PCR
at the same time points (Supplementary Figure S7C). We also
checked the expression of the heterologously expressed proteins
in crude extracts by using mass spectrometry proteomics, and
have consistently detected both the DhaB and PuuC at all time
points throughout the cultivation (Supplementary Figure S2).
Compared to h-syn-KpDhaB-PuuC-1glpK-i, the h-syn-KpDhaB-
PuuC-1glpK-ii was superior in terms of 3-HP titer (10 g/L vs
7.6 g/L) ( Figures 7A,B) and average yield on glycerol (0.79 g/g
vs 0.35 g/g), both of which remained stable throughout the
experiment. This conﬁrmed the hypothesis of a positive selective
pressure on restoring theglpK, and highlighted the importance of
using a stable knockout.
CONCLUSION AND PERSPECTIVES
Bacillus subtilishas the potential to be considered as a microbial
host for production of 3-HP due to several reasons including its
eﬃcient glycerol import system (da Silva et al., 2009) and high
growth rate on glycerol (µmax =0.65 h−1; Kruyssen et al., 1980)
which compared to E. coli(µmax =0.26 h−1; Chaudhary et al.,
2012) is an advantage. It can reach high optical density (OD)

Kalantari et al. 3-HP Production in B. subtilis
in fermentation (Park et al., 1992) and has the ability to grow
on simple media (Demain, 1958). B. subtilis can eﬃciently
grow at high temperatures which reduces cooling costs during
fermentation (Fu et al., 2016). In addition, there are number
of developing novel and useful tools for genetic modiﬁcation
of B. subtilis (Dong and Zhang, 2014; Westbrook et al., 2016).
Therefore, here we demonstrated that B. subtilis is a viable
host for conversion of glycerol to 3-HP , with the production
strain h-syn-KpDhaB-PuuC-1glpK-ii reaching a titer of 10 g/L in
shake ﬂasks. This is already comparable to the best benchmark
strains of E. coli in shake ﬂasks (Rathnasingh et al., 2009;
Chu et al., 2015). Further optimization steps should include
increasing the uptake rate for glycerol, by upregulating the
expression of glpF, and export of 3-HP , which presumably
takes place via the lactate transporter (Maris et al., 2004).
More active dehydrogenases such as mutated ALDH (GabD4;
Chu et al., 2015) could be used for further production
improvement. Transferring the B 12 production gene cluster to
B. subtilis from its close relative Bacillus megaterium would
signiﬁcantly reduce the cost of production and should be
considered. Adaptive laboratory evolution aimed at achieving
higher glycerol uptake and utilization of chemostat conditions
to neutralize the acidiﬁcation from produced 3-HP , or on-line
extractors to continuously remove 3-HP , should be reasonably
expected to result in a robust and exploitable production
strain.
