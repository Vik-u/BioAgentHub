The ability to grow at moderate acidic conditions (pH 4.0– 5.0) is important toEscherichia coli
colonization of the host’s intestine. Several regulatory systems are known to control acid
resistance inE. coli, enabling the bacteria to survive under acidic conditions without growth.
Here, we characterize an acid-tolerance response (ATR) system and its regulatory circuit,
required for E. coli exponential growth at pH 4.2. A two-component system CpxRA directly
senses acidiﬁcation through protonation of CpxA periplasmic histidine residues, and upre-
gulates the fabA and fabB genes, leading to increased production of unsaturated fatty acids.
Changes in lipid composition decrease membraneﬂuidity, F
0F1-ATPase activity, and improve
intracellular pH homeostasis. The ATR system is important forE. coli survival in the mouse
intestine and for production of higher level of 3-hydroxypropionate during fermentation.
Furthermore, this ATR system appears to be conserved in other Gram-negative bacteria.

E
nteric bacteria such asEscherichia coli (E. coli) and Salmo-
nella can colonize and cause disease in the human intestinal
tract. They have to combat acidic environments during the
whole process of invading the host. With pH values as low as
1.5– 2.5, the stomach has been recognized as a natural antibiotic
barrier
1. With their passage into the small intestine,E. coli cells
will encounter a less acidic environment (pH 4.0– 6.0) with the
presence of organic acids produced by the normal intestinal
ﬂora2.
E. coli has developed variable acidic stress response systems,
including the acid resistance (AR) systems response to extreme
acid stress and the acid tolerance response (ATR) system towards
mild and moderate acid stress3,4. Up to now, ﬁve AR systems,
AR1−AR5, are reported. The AR1 system is activated by alter-
native σ factor (RpoS) and cAMP receptor protein (CRP) 5,6.
Due to the involvement of CRP, the AR1 system is repressed by
glucose. The AR2−AR5 systems are all dependent on a speciﬁc
extracellular amino acid, and consist of an antiporter as well as a
decarboxylase enzyme that is usually induced by low pH and
extracellular amino acid 3,7, except that AR2 can be induced
at acidic pH in the absence of glutamate 8. They confer acid
resistance by consumption of intracellular protons in amino acid
decarboxylation reaction to produce a less acidic internal pH,
using glutamate, arginine, lysine and ornithine as their corre-
sponding substrates, respectively1,5,9– 12. All ﬁve AR systems can
protect stationary phase cells from the extreme acidity and
prolong survival, while only AR2 and AR3 were reported to
function during the exponential phase5,13.
Among AR systems, AR2 is by far the most effective and the
most complex. The glutamate decarboxylase isoforms, GadA and
GadB, and the glutamate/γ-aminobutyric acid antiporter GadC
are key components of AR2, and their regulation relies on the
action of over 20 proteins and 3 small noncoding RNAs,
including two-component systems EvgAS and PhoPQ; regulatory
proteins RpoS, GadE, RcsB, GadX, GadW and HNS; protease
ClpXP and Lon; and small RNAs DsrA, GadY and GcvB, which
together form a regulatory network with high level of complexity
(for a review, see refs.
3,7). The periplasmic chaperons HdeAB and
their cytoplasmic counterpart Hsp31, which assist the refolding of
denatured proteins during the acid stress7,14,15, are also induced
as part of the AR2 regulon16,17.
The ATR system, though poorly understood, is induced by
exposing E. coli cells to moderate acid stress (pH 4.5– 5.8), and
will protect cells from a subsequent challenge of extreme acid pH
(pH 2.0– 3.0)4,6. ATR can be activated during adaptation at mild
acidic pH by the regulators Fur and PhoPQ in exponential phase
cells and by RpoS and OmpR in stationary phase cells, but the
stationary phase cells are much more tolerant to acid than the log
phase cells3,4.
Beneﬁted from the complicated AR and ATR systems,E. coli
can survive without growth for several hours at pH 2.01,18– 20, and
the acid limit for growth ofE. coli is pH 4.0 in rich medium, or
pH 4.5 in minimal medium6,18,20– 22. So, E. coli will experience
the transition of pH from no-growth to growth conditions when
passing through the stomach and entering the intestine. It is
exceptionally important to elucidate how E. coli adapts to and
grows at pH 4.0– 5.0, because the capability of bacteria to outgrow
hundreds of competing species in gut microbiome in this lower
range of growth pH will determine which strain can colonize the
gut18. Unfortunately, we still barely know that.
In this study, we challenged the exponentially growing cells of
E. coli at pH 4.2, and characterized a regulatory circuit required
for bacterial growth under moderate acidic conditions through
modulation of the membrane lipid composition. The two-
component system CpxRA directly senses acidiﬁcation through
protonation of the CpxA periplasmic histidine residues, and thus
activates transcription of the essential genes fabA and fabB in
biosynthesis of unsaturated fatty acids (UFAs) to enhance the
UFAs content in membrane lipid. This mechanism enablesE. coli
to grow at acidic pH, and also functions in diverse bacterial
species.
Results
UFAs are required for E. coli growth under acidic pH.W e
carried out a screening to characterize an E. coli ATR system
required for bacterial survival in exponential growth. Atﬁrst, the
overnight culture ofE. coliBW25113 wild-type strain was directly
inoculated into minimal medium E at pH 4.2 using glucose as sole
carbon source without supplement of any amino acid. However,
the cells were rapidly killed, even preadapted at pH 5.0 (Sup-
plementary Fig. 1). Then the BW25113 strain was grown in
medium E at pH 7.0 to a cell density of≈3×1 0
8 CFU mL−1, and
the cells were collected, washed and transferred into the same
medium at pH 7.0 and 4.2, respectively. While the cells at pH 7.0
grew normally, the cell density at pH 4.2 decreased continuously,
which led to reduction of the ratio of CFU at pH 4.2 vs. pH 7.0 to
0.21 ± 0.02 after 1 h of exposure at different pH (Fig.1a). This
result conﬁrmed that exponentially growingE. coli was suscep-
tible to this moderate acidic condition.
In previous studies, survival was used to measure the bacterial
acid resistance, which is calculated by the formula, survival (%)=
(CFU after acid challenge/CFU before acid challenge) × 100%.
However, survival was determined under conditionsE. coli can
only survive without growth, and is not suitable here as we are
trying toﬁgure out howE. coligrows at moderate acidic pH. So,
the CFU ratio (pH 4.2/pH 7.0) is calculated to represent the acid
tolerance of exponentially growingE. coli because growth of E.
coli at pH 7.0 is steady. A value of CFU ratio close to 1 indicates
that E. coli grows at pH 4.2 to a cell density similar to that at
pH 7.0.
Phospholipids were extracted from exponential phase cells
after exposure of 1 h to pH 7.0 and 4.2, and analyzed as
previously described
23. The results showed that exposure to such
acidic condition caused a change of membrane lipid composition
in E. colicells (Fig.1b). Speciﬁcally, levels of the UFAs, including
palmitoleic acid (C16:1) and oleic acid (C18:1), were elevated by
3.83- and 1.66-fold; meanwhile, the levels of palmitic acid (C16:0)
and stearic acid (C18:0) were reduced. These ﬁve fatty acids
shown in Fig.1b represented more than 96% of total fatty acids in
E. colicells, consistent with those results reported previously24,25.
As a consequence, the ratio of unsaturated to saturated fatty acids
increased from 0.11 at pH 7.0 to 0.32 at pH 4.2. Comparable to
this result inE. coli, a shift in the unsaturated/saturated ratio in
response to acid stress was also observed in Streptococcus
mutants26,27.
We also found that the expression of two essential genes
required for UFAs biosynthesis, fabA and fabB (Fig. 1c), was
signiﬁcantly upregulated under the acidic condition since their
protein and mRNA levels were elevated (Fig.1d, e). A previous
study showed that overexpression of fabA and fabB increased
UFA contents in E. coli 28. Therefore, it is plausible that
overexpression offabA and fabB may allowE. colito grow under
pH 4.2. To test this hypothesis, we clonedfabA and fabB into
vector pTrcHis2B, and introduced them into BW25113 wild-type
strain. The strain carrying empty vector presented a CFU ratio of
0.26 ± 0.03, similar with that of BW25113 wild-type strain, while
either strain with fabA or fabB showed much higher acid
tolerance at pH 4.2 (Fig.1f).
In agreement with this result, strains harboring a temperature-
sensitive mutant of fabA or fabB gene became much more
susceptible to acid at 42 °C, whereas the wild-type strain showed

similar acid tolerance at different temperatures (Fig.1g). Taken
together, these results demonstrated that elevating the biosynth-
esis of UFAs enhanced the acid tolerance of exponentially
growing E. coli.
Transcription offabA and fabB is activated by CpxRA system.
To ﬁnd out the possible regulator of these loci, we compared the
DNA sequences offabA and fabB promotor regions, and found a
conserved sequence GTAAA-(5 nt)-GCAAA (Fig.2a, b), which
was similar to the identiﬁed CpxR recognition site29. This raised
the hypothesis that the transcription offabA and fabB is regulated
by two-component system CpxRA, which consists of a sensor
histidine kinase CpxA and a cytoplasmic response regulator
CpxR. Since overexpression of outer membrane protein NlpE was
identiﬁed as a Cpx-speciﬁc activation signal30,31, we cloned the
nlpE gene and tested its effect on expression offabA and fabB
loci. As shown in Fig.2c, d, excessive NlpE protein signiﬁcantly
enhanced the expression level offabA and fabB at pH 7.0, and
deletion of cpxR totally abolished this activating effect of NlpE.
Besides those, NlpE overexpression also raised the UFAs content
in E. coli membrane lipid at pH 7.0 (Fig.2e) and E. coli acid
tolerance at pH 4.2 (Fig.2f) in a CpxR-dependent manner since
cpxR knockout mutant displayed higher susceptibility to acidic
challenge than wild-type strain even overexpressing NlpE
(Fig. 2f). These observations collectively demonstrate that the
CpxRA system activates transcription offabA and fabB.

Transcription start site offab genes controlled by CpxRA.W e
mapped the transcription starts offabA and fabB using RACE
(rapid-ampliﬁcation of cDNA ends) experiment. As was pre-
viously reported, forfabA gene, two transcription initiation sites
were detected under growth at pH 7.0: S1 positively regulated by
FadR32 and S2 negatively regulated by FabR 33. Interestingly,
when the cell growth was at pH 4.2, our results indicated that the
fabA gene has a third transcription initiation site located at the
203 bp upstream of the start codon, the S3 (summarized in
Fig. 3a). For fabB gene, the transcription was initiated 37 bp
upstream of the start codon in both conditions (summarized in
Fig. 3b), consistent with previous reports34.
qRT-PCR result showed that the mRNA level offabA and fabB
was upregulated by NlpE overexpression in afabR fadR double
mutant strain, indicating that they had no obvious effect onfabA
and fabB gene expression under CpxRA-dependent activation
(Supplementary Fig. 2).

To verify the putative CpxR recognition sites, two mutant strains
were constructed by site-directed mutagenesis, in which the CpxR

showed that the activating effect of acid stress on expression of
fabA and fabB was completely eliminated by substitution of CpxR
site (Fig. 3c, d). Moreover, the acid tolerance of these mutants
signiﬁcantly decreased (Fig.3e).
The function of CpxR site was further con ﬁrmed in vitro
through gel-shift assay and DNase I footprinting analysis using
puriﬁed His6-CpxR protein and 211- and 219-bp DNA fragments
corresponding to the promoter regions of fabA and fabB,
respectively. The puriﬁed His6-CpxR protein could shift those
two DNA fragments (Fig.3f), and protect thefabA promoter at
the −287 to −255 region (numbering from the start codon) and
the fabB promoter at the−119 to −94 region in the noncoding
strand containing the putative CpxR binding site (Fig.3g). All
these results demonstrate that the CpxR protein enhances
transcription of fabA and fabB by direct binding to their
promoters.
CpxRA is directly activated by acidic environments. As a sensor
histidine kinase in two-component system, CpxA spans the cell
membrane and exposes its sensor domain into the periplasm.
When CpxA detects a speciﬁc signal, it autophosphorylates and
then transports the phosphate group to its cognate regulator
CpxR, enabling the regulatory activity of CpxR. Without inducing
signal, CpxA acts as a phosphatase to maintain CpxR in an
inactive state35,36.
To monitor the expression and phosphorylation level of CpxA
protein, we constructed a strain carrying chromosomal His 6-
tagged CpxA. As shown in Fig. 4a, acid shock signi ﬁcantly
enhanced the amount of CpxA-His 6 protein in exponentially
growing cells. More importantly, increased level of phosphor-
CpxA, the active form of CpxA, was detected at pH 4.2 (Fig.4a).
To demonstrate direct activation of CpxRA upon exposure to
acidic pH, we used a reconstituted proteoliposome system,

where a different internal and external pH can be stably

results suggested that CpxA is capable of activating CpxR upon
direct exposure to acidic environments.
To further verify the sensitivity of CpxA periplasmic domain to
acidiﬁcation, a chromosomal PhoQ-CpxA fusion strain was
constructed, in which the sensor domain of PhoQ (amino acids
43– 193) was replaced by the periplasmic domain of CpxA (amino
acids 28– 164) (Fig. 4d). PhoPQ is a known two-component
system that can sense the acidic pH, Mg 2+ depletion and
antimicrobial peptides, and activate transcription of genes
including rstA and slyB38,39. Western blot results showed that
both low pH and overexpression of NlpE promoted expression of
RstA and SlyB in strain carrying the PhoQ-CpxA fusion protein,
while only acidic environments increased the protein level of
RstA and SlyB in wild-type strain (Fig.4e). On the other hand,
when the CpxA periplasmic domain was replaced with that from
another kinase AtoS which senses the presence of acetoacetate40,
neither could the protein level of FabA-His 6 and FabB-His6
be enhanced by acidic conditions in vivo, nor could the CpxR
protein be phosphorylated at pH 4.2 in reconstituted proteolipo-
some (Supplementary Fig. 3), indicating that CpxA periplasmic
domain is sensitive to acidiﬁcation. All these results collectively
demonstrated that CpxRA system is activated by direct exposure
of CpxA periplasmic domain to acidic environments.
CpxA H52 and H117 are required for sensing of acidic pH.A s
reported, the histidine and glutamic acid residues were regarded
as sensors detecting mild acidic pH because they can change their
protonation state upon variation in the surrounding pH
3,41– 43.
So, we hypothesized that the histidine and glutamate residues in
CpxA sensor domain might be required for pH sensing. To test
this hypothesis, we constructed a series of plasmids encoding
CpxA mutants in which the periplasmic histidine/glutamate
residue was replaced with alanine, respectively. Strains expressing
the mutant CpxA proteins could express fabA in response to
NlpE overexpression normally (Supplementary Fig. 4), indicating
that mutations in residues of the periplasmic domain of CpxA
protein do not impair the kinase activity of CpxA cytoplasmic
domain. As shown in Fig. 4f, only two mutants (H52A and
H117A) resulted in the loss of CpxA capability to upregulatefabA
expression at pH 4.2, while the other mutations in glutamate
residues did not change the expression level offabA. To conﬁrm
that protonation of H52 and H117 is responsible for pH-
mediated gene regulation, we also mutated these two residues to
other basic amino acids, lysine and arginine, respectively. It was
discovered that the substitution of H52 and H117 by lysine and
arginine had no effect on the response to acidic pH (Fig.4g).
Moreover, the strain carrying CpxA variant with a basic amino
acid residue at positions 52 or 117 presented a higher level of
FabA protein even at pH 7.0, when compared with strain with
CpxA H52A or H117A mutant (Supplementary Fig. 5), probably
due to the protonation of basic amino acid residue at pH 7.0.
These results demonstrate that protonation of residues at posi-
tions 52 and 117 is required to maintain the response of CpxA to
acidic pH, but the presence of a histidine at those positions is not
a speciﬁc requirement for activation.
Physiological effects of changes in lipid composition. To learn
how changed content in membrane lipid affectE. coli cell func-
tions and physiology, several assays were carried out using cells
carrying empty vector as control, pfabA,o rp fabB, after acidic
challenge at pH 4.2. The membraneﬂuidity was determined by
analyzing the ﬂuorescence anisotropy of 1,6-diphenyl-1,3,5-hex-
atriene (DPH), which is negatively correlated to ﬂuidity
44.A s
shown in Fig.5a, the strains with overexpression offabA or fabB
presented much less cell membraneﬂuidity than strain carrying
empty vector. The membrane permeability was measured by
detecting the leakage of OD 260 materials (predominantly
nucleotides), and there was no signiﬁcant difference observed
despite the varied UFA contents in membrane (Supplementary
Fig. 6). F
0F1-ATPase spans the cell membrane and transports
periplasmic protons to cytoplasm with production of ATP, and
lipids are required for its optimal functioning45. The activity of
F0F1-ATPase was measured, and results suggested that the
enhancement of UFAs content repressed its activity (Fig. 5b).
Then the intracellular pH was monitored using ratiometric pH-
sensitive GFP pHluorin246. When growing under pH 5.0– 9.0, E.
coli can maintain the intracellular pH between pH 7.4 and
7.947,48. Upon exposure to pH 4.2, the internal pH of control
strain decreased to 6.82 ± 0.06, and the homeostasis of pH inE.
coli cells with overexpression offabA or fabB was good (Fig.5c),
probably due to the lowered membraneﬂuidity and F0F1-ATPase
activity.
As E. coli has to combat a moderate acidic environment
(pH 4.0– 6.0) and proliferate in host’s small intestine, we carried
out mouse gastrointestinal passage experiment to test the
in vivo effect of the UFAs-CpxRA system. BALB/c mice were
administered BW25113 wild-type strain or mutant with
substituted fabA CpxR binding site, and three independent
trials with six mice in each trial were performed for each strain.
After 24 h, fecal samples were collected to test the presence of
each strain. Out of 18 inoculated mice, the wild-type
BW25113 strain was recovered from a total of 8 mice, while
the fabA CpxR box mutant was detected in only 2 fecal samples
(Fig. 5d). The results between the parental and mutant strains
were statistically different ( p < 0.05), demonstrating that this
ATR system signiﬁcantly promotes E. coli survival in mouse
intestinal lumens.
In bio-production of organic acids, product accumulation acidiﬁes
the fermentation broth and inhibits the growth of producing strain.
Previously, we had constructed a 3-hydroxypropionate (3HP)-
producing E. coli recombinant strain. In shakingﬂask cultivation,
the pH of culture decreased to pH 5.2– 5.5 along with the production
of 3HP, repressing the further production and cell growth (Fig.5e).
So, the pH of fermentation broth had to be adjusted to 7.0
periodically. ThenfabA gene was overexpressed to enhanceE. coli
tolerance to acidic environments, leading to similar 3HP production
a n dc e l lg r o w t hw i t ha n dw i t h o u tp Ha d j u s t m e n t( F i g .5e). This
result demonstrates the great prospect of UFAs-CpxRA-dependent
ATR system in organic acids bio-production.
The UFAs-CpxRA system functions in diverse bacteria species.
Salmonella Typhimurium LT2 andShigella ﬂexneri 2a str. 2457T
are both common enteric pathogens, and their FabA proteins
share more than 98% identity withE. coli FabA (Supplementary
Fig. 7). To test whether UFAs are required for growth under
acidic pH in these bacteria, the empty vector and recombinant
plasmid carrying E. coli fabA gene were transformed into Sal-
monella Typhimurium LT2 andS. ﬂexneri 2a str. 2457T. In acidic
challenge tested at pH 5.0, the transformation of empty vector did
not affect the acid tolerance of those two strains, but the over-
expression of fabA gene elevated those CFU ratios by 2.32- and
1.99-fold, respectively (Fig. 6a). Moreover, mRNA level offabA
and fabB was upregulated by acid challenge in Salmonella,
Klebsiella and Pseudomonas strains (Fig. 6b), and the consensus
sequence of CpxR site was also found upstream of thefabA and
fabB genes in additional bacteria species (Table1). Additionally,
Cronobacter sakazakii clone carrying transposon insertion in
cpxR gene was identiﬁed as acid-sensitive mutant49. All these facts
suggest this ATR system functioning in exponential phase is
highly conserved across bacteria species.

Discussion
According to the results shown above, we present a previously
uncharacterized ATR system as well as its regulatory pathway
in exponentially growing E. coli. We demonstrated that the
two-component system CpxRA can directly sense the acidic
environments, and activate transcription of UFAs synthetic genes,
resulting in increased UFAs contents in cell membrane lipid and
normal growth ofE. coliat pH 4.2. Ourﬁndings greatly enriched
our understanding of the networks contributing to bacterial acid
resistance, and the mechanisms for stress response governed by
the CpxRA system.
As reported, the acid limit forE. coligrowth is pH 4.0– 4.5, and
all known AR and ATR systems only prolong survival ofE. coli
cells under acidic conditions, but cannot support growth at pH
4.0– 4.518,21,22. In our study, overexpression of fabA and fabB
genes for UFAs biosynthesis, or activation of the two-component
regulatory system CpxRA both restore the growth capability of
E. coli at pH 4.2. Compared with those previously known AR
systems, this growth-conferring ATR system is expected to have
more important physiological signi ﬁcance. Firstly, bacteria
can grow normally under acidic pH with activation of the
CpxRA- and UFAs-dependent system, achieving higher biomass,
which may be required for successful pathogenesis and efﬁcient
bio-production. Secondly, de novo mutations during DNA
duplication play a critical role in bacterial stress resistance
development
50, and the rapid proliferation at low pH provides an
opportunity for the evolution of novel AR and ATR systems.
Thirdly, functioning of previously known AR systems is subject to
more external limitations, such as AR1 is repressed by glucose
and AR2 −AR5 are dependent on exogenous amino acids,
whereas the UFAs-CpxRA system can be activated by acidic pH
alone because CpxA is capable of phosphorylating CpxR upon
exposure to pH 4.2 in a reconstituted proteoliposome system.

We proved that the transcription offabA stimulated by CpxRA
is required for multiplication ofE. coli in mouse intestine, indi-
cating that UFAs-CpxRA system is also related to pathogenesis of
E. colipathovars, as well as those previously known AR systems.
While various pathotypes ofE. coli colonize and infect different
organs, they all have to combat acidic environments during
invading the host’s digestive tract. With pH values as low as
1.5– 2.5, the stomach has been recognized as a natural antibiotic
barrier1. Beneﬁted from AR1−AR5 systems,E. colican survive in
the gastric acid for hours22,51. With their passage into the small
intestine, E. colicells will encounter a less acidic environment (pH
4.0– 6.0) with the presence of organic acids produced by the
normal intestinal ﬂora2. As pathogenic E. coli strains must
reproduce rapidly to cause disease ultimately52, the UFAs-CpxRA
system is likely to play a key role. In summary, the successful
enteric pathogen must possess two abilities, survival in extreme
acidic condition and quick growth in moderate acidic environ-
ment. Consequently, this ATR system may be a new target for the
development of antimicrobials.
UFAs-CpxRA-dependent ATR system also has potential
application in bio-production of organic acids, which are valuable
platform chemicals and have been successfully produced by
recombinant E. coli strains
53,54. However organic acids cause
acidiﬁcation of fermentation broth and inhibitE. coli growth at
concentrations far below what is required for economical pro-
duction. Now large quantity of base titrant are required to raise
pH of the media in organic acids production process, and large
amounts of acid must be consumed to recover the organic acids
in the protonated form after production. If we could construct
acid-tolerant strains growing at a pH less than the pKa of the
produced acid, the additional consumption of acid and base
titrants will be circumvented and the overall production cost will
be lowered remarkably. As the UFAs-CpxRA system functions in
exponential phase, is not repressed by glucose (the carbon source
in most fermentation), and does not need exogenous amino acids,
it is believed that this ATR system could be effectively applied in
the ﬁeld of organic acids bio-production.
Our data suggested that UFAs played an important role in
protection of exponential phase E. coli from acid shock. The
increase of UFAs content in membrane lipid not only affected
the ﬂuidity of lipid bilayer but also changed the activity of the
F0F1-ATPase, conducing to reduced membrane proton perme-
ability and improved internal pH homeostasis. This phenomenon
is consistent with that S. mutants cells grown at pH 5.0 had
higher UFAs composition and lower proton permeability than
those grown at pH 7.0 27,55. Moreover, changes in fatty acid
composition probably also affect the PTS system and enzyme
secretion56,57. Overall, changing membrane fatty acid composi-
tion may improve the bacterial ability to adapt to acidic envir-
onment and be an important factor in bacterial acid response. In
this study, the cyclopropane fatty acid (CFA) could not be
detected in exponential phase E. coli cells, although it was
regarded as a major factor in acid resistance of stationary phaseE.
coli24,58. However, UFA can be converted into CFA by CFA
synthase59, and increased UFAs content will potentially enable
the synthesis of CFA in stationary phase.
We demonstrate that theE. colikinase CpxA is a direct sensor
for acidic pH. Our data provide strong evidence that a decrease in
pH protonates the histidine residues at positions 52 and 117 in
CpxA periplasmic domain, leads to events catalyzed by its cyto-
plasmic domain, including phosphorylation of CpxA, transfer of
phosphoryl group to regulator CpxR, as well as activation of
CpxR-dependent gene transcription. As titratable by pH, histidine
has been regarded as sensor detecting mild acidic pH, and also
plays an essential role in the activation of sensor kinase PhoQ by
acidic pH
60. But the molecular details of how histidine senses the
low pH signal in PhoQ and CpxA are different. Protonation of
residues at positions 52 and 117 is effective to activate CpxA at
acidic pH, whereas the imidazole ring of histidine is important in
maintaining the response of PhoQ to acidity60.
Our results evidenced that CpxRA is a key system in the acid
stress response of exponentially growingE. coli(Fig. 7), consistent
with a previous proteomic analysis highlighting the importance of
CpxRA in acid stress61. Upon exposure to acidic environments,
CpxRA system stimulates the transcription of UFAs synthetic
genes, resulting in improved intracellular pH homeostasis. Addi-
tionally, CpxRA upregulates some genes involved in cell wall
modiﬁcation, including peptidoglycan (PG) cross-linking proteins
YcfS, YcbB and DacC; PG cleaving proteins AmiA, AmiC and
Slt61– 63. The induction of those genes led to an increase of cross-
linking between PG and outer membrane proteins, and an increase
of cell wall stability, which may help protectingE. coli cells from
acidic challenge. That proteomic study also indicated the repression
of AR2 system by CpxRA61. Because AR2 system is responsible for
survival below pH 3.0 and log phase cells with overexpression of
AR2 genes are not more acid resistant4, the CpxRA-mediated
repression of AR2 in exponentially growing cells above pH 3.0 will
guarantee that AR2 system is not induced in an inappropriate
situation to avoid the metabolic burden. Furthermore, the sensor
kinase CpxA was proved to cross-talk with noncognate response
regulator OmpR64, which itself is involved in the acid stress
response of E. coli65,66.A l lo ft h e s ed a t ai n d i c a t et h a tE. coli has

evolved multiple acid response mechanisms as well as precise reg-
ulatory circuits, to target speciﬁc stress conditions.
In many Gram-negative pathogens, the CpxRA system plays an
important role in the regulation of virulence factors, including
pilus, secreted virulence effectors and type III secretion system36.
For CpxRA to upregulate expression of these virulence genes,
there must be an activating signal for CpxA under in vivo con-
ditions. The identity of this signal still remains a topic of much
debate. According to the results in this study, we propose that
moderate acidic pH (such as the intestine and macrophage) is the
activating signal of CpxA in vivo. As the previous study showed
that CpxRA also contributed to bacterial resistance to anti-
microbial peptides, a component of the host antimicrobial
response62, acidic pH and antimicrobial peptide may have
synergistic effect on CpxRA activation. Further study is ongoing
to address this hypothesis.

concentrations of 100μgm L−1 for ampicillin, 20μgm L−1 for chloramphenicol or
50 μgm L−1 for kanamycin. E. coli DH5α was used as host for the preparation of
plasmid DNA, andE. coli χ7213 was used for preparation of suicide vectors.
Diaminopimelic acid (50μgm L−1) was used for the growth ofχ7213 strain. LB
agar containing 10% sucrose was used forsacB gene-based counter selection in
allelic exchange experiments. The software ImageJ (version 1.52a) was used to
analyze western blot results, and the online version of Clustal Omega (https://www.
ebi.ac.uk/Tools/msa/clustalo) was used for sequence alignment.
Plasmids were constructed by digesting PCR fragments containing target gene
and cloning into corresponding vectors as normal. Derivatives of pTrc-cpxA with
nucleotide substitutions were constructed using Q5 Site-Directed Mutagenesis Kit
(New England Biolabs) according to the manufacturer’s speciﬁcations. All plasmids
were conﬁrmed by DNA sequencing. Strains harboring chromosomal epitope-
tagged proteins were generated usingλ Red recombinase system67,68. DNA
fragments encoding PhoQ-CpxA fusion or carrying substituted CpxR site were
generated by joint PCR using primers shown in Supplementary Data 2, and cloned
into the suicide vector pRE11269. The resulting plasmids were used to mediate the
allelic exchange to generate strains with chromosomal PhoQ-CpxA fusion and
CpxR site mutation.
In acidic challenge experiments, the strains were grown in E medium (pH 7.0)
to an OD600 of 0.6. For strains with plasmid, IPTG was added toﬁnal
concentration of 0.5 mM at an OD600 of 0.4, and the strain was further grown to an
OD600 of 0.6. Then, the cells were harvested and washed twice with fresh E medium
(pH 7.0), and inoculated into E medium with various pH as indicated, and strains
were grown for another 30– 60 min before the cells were collected to determine the
CFU, membrane lipid composition, mRNA and protein levels.
Determination of fatty acid compositions. Phospholipids were extracted as
described by Wang and Cronan23. Brieﬂy, E. coli cells were harvested and resus-
pended in 1 mL sterile water, and 5 mL of chloroform-methanol (2:1 vol/vol) was
added and vortexed for 3 min then stewing overnight. The solution was centrifuged
and the upper phase was removed, an equal volume of 2 M KCl was added, fol-
lowed by mixing and centrifugation. The top KCl phase was removed, an equal
volume of water was added, followed by mixing and centrifugation. The resulting
bottom organic phase was dried under a stream of nitrogen. Two milliliters of
methyesteriﬁcation reagent (BF
3:CH3OH = 1:4) was added and incubated at 60 °C
for 30 min. The resulting solution was extracted with n-hexane for three times and
then detected with Agilent GC-MS (7890A– 5975C; Column: Agilent-HP-INNO-
Wax). The fatty acids were identiﬁed by comparing the retention times and mass
fragmentation patterns with authentic standards. Content of each fatty acid is given
as the relative peak area [(peak area of one fatty acid/total peak area) × 100%].
Immunoblot analysis of His
6-tagged proteins. TheE. colicells were disrupted by
sonication, the cell lysates were centrifuged, and the supernatants were used for
western blot. Protein concentration was determined using BCA protein assay kit
(Pierce), and the same amount of protein sample was separated in 12% SDS-PAGE,
transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Bio-Rad), and incubated with mono-
clonal HRP-conjugated anti-6×His antibodies (1:10,000 diluted) (Abcam). Protein
signals were detected using Immobilon Western HRP substrate (Millipore) and X-
ray ﬁlm. To separate the phosphorylated proteins, 20– 50 μM Phos-tag Acrylamide
(WAKO) and 0.1 mM Mn
2+ were added into the SDS-PAGE. Quantiﬁcation was
conducted using ImageJ software (NIH).
Quantitative RT-PCR and RACE. Total RNA was isolated from bacterial culture
using EASYSpin Plus bacterial RNA quick extract kit (Aidlab Biotechnologies,
China) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. RNA concentration was
determined by spectrophotometry at 260 nm. Removal of genomic DNA and
synthesis of cDNA were carried out using PrimeScript RT reagent Kit with gDNA
Eraser (Takara). qRT-PCR was conducted using TB Green Premix Ex Taq (Takara)
with the QuantStudio 1 system (Applied Biosystems). Constitutively transcribed
gene rpoD was used as a reference control to normalize total RNA quantity of
different samples. The relative difference of mRNA level was calculated using the
ΔΔCt method
70. Two independent biological samples with three technical repeats
for each sample were performed for each qRT-PCR analysis.
The RACE experiment was performed using SMARTer RACE cDNA
Ampliﬁcation Kit (Clontech), according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The
primers 1128+ 1129 and 1130+ 1131 were used to determine the transcription
start sites offabA and fabB under the NlpE overexpression conditions, respectively.
Puriﬁcation of His6-CpxR and CpxA-His6. Puriﬁcation of His6-CpxR and CpxA-
His6 was conducted according to Fleischer et al.37. Brieﬂy, E. colistrain BW25113
with pTrc-cpxR or pTrc-cpxA was grown at 37 °C with aeration in LB medium.
Gene expression was induced with 0.5 mM IPTG for 3– 4 h. Membrane fractions
and cytosolic fraction were separated by ultracentrifugation37. His6-CpxR was
solubilized in cytosolic fraction and puriﬁed by Ni-afﬁnity chromatography.
Membrane proteins were solubilized with 1% dodecyl-β-D-maltoside (DM), and
then CpxA-His6 was also puriﬁed by Ni-afﬁnity chromatography.
Preparation of proteoliposomes. Proteoliposome was reconstructed as previously
described with small modiﬁcation37. Brieﬂy, E. coli phospholipids (Avanti) were
dried under a stream of nitrogen, and slowly dissolved in sodium citrate-
hydrochloric acid buffer (pH 7.0, 5.0, 4.2) with 10% glycerol (vol/vol) and 0.47%
Triton X-100 (vol/vol), respectively. Puriﬁed CpxA-His6 was added to the mixture
and stirred at room temperature for 20 min. Bio-Beads SM-2 (Bio-Rad) were added
in a bead/detergent ratio of 10:1(w/w), and the mixture was gently stirred at 4 °C
overnight. After 16 h, fresh Bio-Beads were added, and the mixture was stirred for
another 6 h. The proteoliposomes were collected by ultracentrifugation. To test
autophosphorylation, proteoliposomes were incubated with 300μmol ATP in
phosphorylation buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10% glycerol (vol/vol), 2 mM
dithiothreitol (DTT), 50 mM KCl, 5 mM MgCl2) at room temperature for 30 min.

phosphortransfer, puriﬁed His6-CpxR was added to this mixture and incubated at
room temperature for 20 min. Then samples were ultracentrifugated and the upper
phase was collected. 5× SDS sample buffer was loaded to stop the reaction. To detect
the phosphorylation level of CpxA and CpxR, all the samples were subjected to 8%
SDS-PAGE with 20– 50 μM Phos-tag Acrylamide (WAKO) and 0.1 mM Mn2+,
which can retard the mobility of phosphoproteins to show the phosphorylated and
nonphosphorylated forms in two separated bands.
Electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA). Primers 683 and 685 were labeled
using T4 polynucleotide kinase (New England Biolabs) andγ-32P ATP (Perki-
nElmer Life Sciences). The promoter regions offabA and fabB genes were
ampliﬁed with primers 682+ 683 and 684+ 685, respectively. Ten nmol of32P-
labeled DNA was incubated at room temperature for 30 min with 0 or 50 pmol of
His6 -CpxR protein in 20μL of an EMSA buffer consisting of 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH
7.5, 1 mM ethylene diamine tetraacetic acid, 5 mM DTT, 10 mM NaCl, 1 mM
MgCl2, and 5% glycerol. The mixture was subjected directly to 4% TAE-PAGE.
Signals were detected by autoradiography.
DNase I footprinting assay. DNase I footprinting assays were carried out using
the fabA promoter region ampliﬁed from BW25113 chromosome with primers 682
and 32P-683 and using thefabB promoter region ampliﬁed with primers 684 and
32P-685 for the noncoding strand. Approximately 25 pmol of32P-labeled DNA and
0, 25, 50, or 100 pmol of His6-CpxR protein were mixed in a 100-μL reaction
containing 20 mM 2-[4-(2-hydroxyethyl)piperazin-1-yl]ethanesulfonic acid pH 8.0,
10 mM KCl, 1 mM DTT, and 0.1 mg mL−1 bovine serum albumin. The reaction
mixture was incubated at room temperature for 20 min. Then 1μL of 100 mM
CaCl2,1 μL of 100 mM MgCl2, and 0.005 units of DNase I (Fermentas) were added,
and the mixture was incubated at room temperature for 2 min. The DNase I
digestion was stopped by phenol treatment, and the DNA was precipitated. Sam-
ples were analyzed by 6% polyacrylamide electrophoresis by comparison with a
DNA sequence ladder generated with the same primers using a Maxam and Gilbert
A + G reaction.
Membrane property assays. The membraneﬂuidity was measured by applying
DPH as aﬂuorescence probe
44.B r i eﬂy, the washed cells were incubated in DPH
(Sigma) at aﬁnal concentration of 2μM, then shaken in the dark at 30 °C for
40 min. After incubation, the unincorporated DPH was removed by washing with
phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) twice. The cells were resuspended in PBS to get a
ﬁnal density of OD
600 = 0.2 for the measurement ofﬂuorescence anisotropy on a
FluoroMax-4 spectroﬂuorometer (HORIBA Jobin Yvon). The wavelengths were
342 and 432 nm and slit widths were 5 and 10 nm for excitation and emission light,
respectively. The ﬂuorescence anisotropy, which was negatively correlated with
membrane ﬂuidity, was calculated44. For the permeability assay, the washed cells
were resuspended in PBS for 30 min. The release of nucleotides was then measured
at an optical density of 260 nm.
Intracellular pH measurement. The gene encoding ratiometric pH-sensitive green
ﬂorescent protein pHluorin2 was synthesized and cloned into vector pBAD-18kan.
Excitation assays were performed at wavelengths 395 and 475 nm with the emis-
sion at 510 nm using FluoroMax-4 Spectroﬂuorometer (HORIBA Jobin Yvon), and
the ratio ofﬂuorescence at 395 to 475 nm was used to calculate the intracellular pH
according to a standard curve46.
F0F1-ATPase activity assay. The cells were washed once and resuspended in 1.8
mL membrane buffer (75 mM Tris pH 7.0, 10 mM MgSO4). Toluene was added to
a ﬁnal concentration of 10% (vol/vol), and the suspension was vortexed for 30 s and
subjected to two rounds of freeze-thawing. Cells were collected, resuspended in
membrane buffer. ATPase activity was assayed in terms of the release of inorganic
phosphate in 50 mM Tris-maleate buffer pH 7.0, containing 10 mM MgSO4 and
50 μM ATP. Phosphate was assayed by the malachite green method, using Mala-
chite Green Phosphate Assay Kit (Cayman Chemical).
Mouse survival passage experiments. Female BALB/c mice were housed indi-
vidually in pathogen-free facility and given food and water ad libitum until 6-week-
old. BW25113 strain and mutant with substitution infabA CpxR site were grown
in LB at 37 °C to log phase, and then 104 CFUs of bacteria were orally admini-
strated to mice. To allow for inoculum clearance through the stomach, the mice
were not provided feed for 4 h after oral administration. Fecal samples were col-
lected 24 h after inoculation and suspended in PBS (0.5 g feces/4.5 mL PBS) and
subsequently diluted. The diluted samples were then plated on LB agar containing
nalidixic acid (20μgm L−1) to test for the presence or absence of corresponding
strains. Three independent trials were performed for each strain, and in each trial
six mice were inoculated. This experiment was performed following the Guide for
the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (National Institutes of Health, 1985).
3-Hydroxypropionate production. The strains were grown overnight in LB broth
and 1:100 diluted into 250 mL Erlenmeyerﬂasks with 50 mL of minimal medium
containing 14 g L−1 K2HPO43H2O, 5.2 g L−1 KH2PO4,1 g L−1 NaCl, 1 g L−1
NH4Cl, 0.5 g L−1 MgSO4, 0.2 g L−1 yeast extract, and 20 g L−1 glucose. All
shake ﬂask experiments were carried out in triplicates. After incubation at 37 °C,
0.05 mM IPTG was added for induction at OD600 0.8, and 3 h later, biotin
(40 mg L−1) and NaHCO3 (20 mM) were added. The antibiotics were supplied
periodically after induction of IPTG every 12 h until 48 h. 10 g L−1 glucose was
added once again after 24 h induction. 3HP concentration in medium was deter-
mined using Agilent 1200 Inﬁnity HPLC system with an Aminex HPX-87H
column (300 × 7.8 mm, Bio-Rad)54.
Ethics declarations. The animal experiments were performed according to the
standards set forth in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals
(National Institutes of Health, 1985). Experimental protocols were approved by the
Institutional Animal Care Committee at Qingdao Institute of Bioenergy and Bio-
process Technology.
