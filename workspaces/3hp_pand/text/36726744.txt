3-Hydroxypropionic acid (3-HP) is a valuable platform chemical that is used as a
precursor for several higher value-added chemical products. There is an increased
interest in development of cell factories as a means for the synthesis of 3-HP and
various other platform chemicals. For more than a decade, concentrated effort has
been invested by the scienti ﬁc community towards developing bio-based
approaches for the production of 3-HP using primarily Escherichia coli and
Klebsiella pneumoniae as production hosts. These hosts however might not be
optimal for applications in e.g., food industry due primarily to endotoxin production
and the pathogenic origin of particularly theK. pneumoniae. We have previously
demonstrated that the generally recognized as safe organismBacillus subtiliscan be
engineered to produce 3-HP using glycerol, an abundant by-product of the biodiesel
industry, as substrate. For commercial exploitation, there is a need to substantially
increase the titer. In the present study, we optimized the bioprocess conditions and
further engineered theB. subtilis3-HP production strain. Thereby, using glycerol as
substrate, we were able to improve 3-HP production in a 1-L bioreactor to aﬁnal titer
of 22.9 g/L 3-HP.

1 Introduction
3-Hydroxypropionic acid, also called 3-hydroxypropionate (3-HP) is a valuable platform
chemical used as a precursor in the chemical industry (Andreeßen and Steinbüchel 2010; Jiang
et al., 2021). 3-HP is used as a precursor for the industrial synthesis of several higher value-
added chemical products, including acrylic acid, acrylamide, methyl acrylate, acrylonitrile
(ACN), ethyl 3-HP, 1,3-propanediol, 3-hydroxypropionaldehyde, propiolactone, and malonic
acid, as well as biodegradable materials, especially poly(3-hydroxypropionate) (P3HP) based
homopolymers and heteropolymers (Andreeßen and Steinbüchel 2010; Jers et al., 2019; Jiang
et al., 2021). These platform chemicals are essential for the synthesis of numerous products,
such as solvents, cleaning agents, adhesives, paints and coatings, plastics and plastic packaging,
resin-based ﬂoor polishes,ﬁbers, absorbent diapers, and disinfectants for sterilizing tissue grafts
(Andreeßen and Steinbüchel 2010; Matsakas et al., 2018).
The chemical synthesis of 3-HP in petroleum oil reﬁneries is very costly and generates
toxic intermediates with serious environmental effects (Matsakas et al., 2018). There are
diminishing global crude oil reserves and increasing environmental deterioration due to
notorious chemical pollutants from petro leum and petrochemical industries. These

circumstances have necessitated the accelerated growth of
bioreﬁnery as an alternative source for the synthesis of various
platform chemicals (Li et al., 2016). Bioreﬁnery is the optimized
biomass usage for the production of biomaterials, biochemicals, and
biofuels for chemical and energy applications with substantial
beneﬁts of lower costs and reduced environmental impacts
(Hingsamer and Jungmeier 2019). In the production of biodiesel,
crude glycerol is the most abundant byproduct. For every 10 tons of
biodiesel produced via transesteriﬁcation of vegetable oils or animal
fats, 1 ton of crude glycerol is recovered (Andreeßen et al., 2010).
This in turn has led to a growing interest in crude glycerol as a
renewable substrate for the production of 3-HP and other chemicals
(Jiang et al., 2018). The bioconversion of crude glycerol to 3-HP
occurs via microbial-mediated fermenta tion processes. To date, a
wide repertoire of bacteria with diverse biochemical abilities to
naturally produce 3-HP from crude glycerol have been identiﬁed
(Jers et al., 2019). Genetic engineering has been widely employed for
the development of improved 3-HP production strains (Li et al.,
2016; Jers et al., 2019). Engineering strategies include screening for
better production pathway enzymes, developing expression systems
for efﬁciently producing 3-HP and re-allocation of cellular resources
to accumulate 3-HP ( Zhao and Tian 2021 ). With respect to
engineering, particularly the Gram-negative bacteria K.
pneumoniae and E. coli have been considered. The highest 3-HP
titer, 102.6 g/L, was obtained using K. pneumoniae (Zhao et al.,
2019). In E. coli, the highest titer reported is 76.2 g/L (Kim et al.,
2020). However, its pathogenic naturei sad e t e r r e n tf o ri t su s ea sa
cell factory (Zhao and Tian 2021; Zabed et al., 2022). Other hosts,
such as Lactobacillus reuteri , Pseudomonas denitri ﬁcans,
Corynebacterium glutamicum and B. subtilis have also been
applied for 3-HP production generally with lower resulting titers
(Zhou et al., 2013; Ramakrishnan et al., 2015; Chen et al., 2017;
Kalantari et al., 2017).
As mentioned, the main body of work has been done using the
Gram-negative bacteria K. pneumoniae
and E. coli. Considering that
3-HP can ﬁnd application in diverse ﬁelds including food and
pharma sector, these hosts can potentially be problematic. Firstly,
due to the production of endotoxin that is observed for most Gram-
negative bacteria, and secondly, due to the pathogenic origin of the
strains (Li and Tian 2015; Zabed et al., 2022). Consequently, it
should be desirably to explore and/or engineer new hosts for 3-HP
production. We previously demonstrated a potential of the Gram-
positive bacteriumB. subtilisas a host for heterologous expression of
the 3-HP synthetic pathway ( Kalantari et al., 2017 )a n dt h i s
bacterium is generally recognized as safe (GRAS). The 3-HP
biosynthetic pathway from K. pneumoniae was successfully
introduced in B. subtilis to redirect its glycerol metabolism
towards 3-HP allowing a titer of 10 g/L in shake ﬂask
fermentations ( Kalantari et al., 2017 ) .T h i st i t e ri sn o th i g h
enough for commercial exploitation and a combination of strain
and process engineering would be needed to substantially improve
titers. Several challenges can be targeted such as preventing buildup
of the toxic intermediate 3-hydroxypropanal (3-HPA) as well as
byproducts, NAD
+ co-factor requirement of the aldehyde
dehydrogenase, and toleran ce to substrate and product ( Liang
et al., 2022; Zabed et al., 2022). Optimization of the production
conditions is key to attain the full potential of production strains. To
this end, various fermentation conditions such as growth medium,
pH, and dissolved oxygen content have been optimized. For
instance, in K. pneumoniae and L. reuteri optimization of the
medium composition led to an increase of 80% and 70% in 3-HP
production, respectively ( Li et al., 2016; Couvreur et al., 2017 ).
Dissolved oxygen could have different effects on 3-HP production
where on one hand aerobic conditions are needed for ef ﬁcient
regeneration of the cofactor NAD
+ but on the other hand the
enzyme glycerol dehydratase is sensitive to oxygen ( Jers et al.,
2019). Using metabolically engineered E. coli, the authors were
able to improve the production of 3-HP to 76.2 g/L using fed-
batch fermentation by controlli ng the dissolved oxygen levels at
10% (Kim et al., 2020).
In the present study, theB. subtilisstrain previously engineered to
produce 3-HP from glycerol (Kalantari et al., 2017) was utilized with
the aim to improve its 3– HP production capacity. Process conditions
for 3-HP production in a bioreactor were optimized and the strain was
engineered in order to address NAD
+ co-factor regeneration, and
transport of substrates and product. Collectively, this allowed the
production of 23.0 g/L 3-HP using an engineered strain in a 1-L
bioreactor.
2 Materials and methods
2.1 Chemicals
3-HP used as a standard was purchased from TCI Europe N.V.
(Zwijndrecht, Belgium). All other chemicals were purchased from
Sigma-Aldrich (Steinheim, Germany).
2.2 Strains and DNA manipulations
All strains used in this study are listed in Table 1. E. coli
NM522 was used for plasmid propagation. For marker-free
disruptions of the genes spoIIAC and lutP in B. subtilis , the
plasmid pMAD carrying a thermosensitive replicon was used
(Arnaud et al., 2004). Regions up- and downstream from the target
gene were PCR-ampliﬁed using relevant primers (Supplementary
Figure S1 ; Table 1 ) and inserted in the pMAD plasmid. The
spoIIAC mutation was introduced in the B. subtilis strain h-syn-
KpDhaB-PuuC-Δglpk-ii to generate the strain PS (production
strain). In the PS, the gene lutP was disrupted to yield PSΔlutP.
The pMAD plasmid was also used to integrate the geneudhA from
E. coliunder the control of P43 promoter into thethrC gene in the PS.
The P43 promoter fragment was ampli ﬁed from the B. subtilis
genomic DNA while the terminator fragment was ampliﬁed from
pBS1C plasmid (Radeck et al., 2013).
Additionally, the pMAD plasmid was used to replace the native
promoter ofndh in the PS with the P43 promoter. For replacing the
native promoters of the genesglpF, yvrC and lctP with P43 promoter, a
CRISPR-Cas9-based method was used ( Altenbuchner 2016). The
20 bp spacer sequence oligos were annealed and inserted in the
plasmid pJOE8999 between the BsaI restriction sites. The repair
template (P43 promoter sequence, and up- and downstream
regions) was inserted between the SﬁI restriction sites. The
pJOE8999 plasmid with the spacer and the repair template was
used to transform the PS as described earlier (Yasbin et al., 1975).
The resulting strains were analyzed by sequencing to conﬁrm the
correct insertion.

2.3 Media and growth conditions
E. coliand B. subtiliswere routinely cultured in LB medium (10 g/
L tryptone, 5 g/L yeast extract, and 5 g/L NaCl) at 37 °C. For
experiments to test production of 3-HP, two different media were
used; a modiﬁed M9 (MM9) medium and a fed-batch fermentation
(FBF) medium essentially as reported previously by Wang and co-
workers (Wang et al., 2011). The growth medium components of
MM9 medium are as follows (in g/L): MM9 seed medium: KH

For shake ﬂask fermentation experiments, a single colony was
inoculated in 10 mL FBF seed medium and incubated with shaking at
37
°C overnight. This culture was then used to inoculate 50 mL FBF
initial medium supplemented with 10 µM isopropyl β-d-1-
thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) and 15 µM coenzyme B12, to obtain
a ﬁnal OD600 of 0.05. Shake ﬂask cultures were incubated at 37°C,
shaking at 200 rpm for either 30 h or 40 h. For measuring cell density
(OD600) and the concentration of various metabolites, 1 mL culture
broth was taken out at the following time-points (h): 0, 6, 24 and 30
(for 30 h experiments) or 0, 16, 24 and 40 (for 40 h experiments). For
the latter, the samples were centrifuged (11,000 g for 3 min) and the
supernatant stored at−20
°C for the HPLC analysis.
Repeated fed-batch fermentation experiments were carried out at
37°C (unless otherwise stated) in a 1-L Sartorius bioreactor. The
pH was maintained at 7.0 by adding 2 M KOH automatically. The
stirrer speed was set to be minimum 500 rpm and maximum
1200 rpm, and air ﬂow between 0.15 L/min and 1.5 L/min. These
two parameters were controlled automatically in order to maintain the
desired dissolved oxygen content. To inoculate the fermentor, a single
colony was inoculated in 10 mL seed medium (MM9 or FBF as
relevant) and incubated 37
°C overnight. The next morning, 30 mL
seed medium in a 250 mL shake ﬂask was inoculated with the
overnight culture to an OD600 of 0.05. The culture was grown until
it reached an OD600 of approximately 3.0. The seed culture was then
used to inoculate 400 mL of initial medium in the 1-L bioreactor to an
OD600 of 0.1. The initial medium was supplemented with 1 mM IPTG,
20 µM Coenzyme B12, and seven drops of Antifoam 204 (Sigma-
Aldrich). The Prima BT Bench Top Process Gas Analysis Mass
Spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc) was used to monitor the
carbon dioxide concentration in the off-gas. Feed medium
supplemented with 1 mM IPTG and 20 µM Coenzyme B
12, was
successively added to the bioreactor when glucose was depleted,
which was indicated by the decline in carbon dioxide concentration
in the off-gas. Glucose depletion in the fermentation broth was also
veriﬁed using the Glucose MQuant
™(Merck Millipore) glucose strips.
A volume of feed medium was added so that the ﬁnal glucose
concentration of was 10 or 20 g/L (as in the corresponding initial
medium). Before adding the feed media, 2 mL culture broth was taken
out for measuring the cell density and the concentration of select
metabolites. Again, the samples were centrifuged (11,000 g for 3 min)
and the supernatant stored at−20
°C before subsequent HPLC analysis.
Experiments were carried out for up to 45 h. In pilot experiments, we
did not see any substantial productivity increases after 40 h (data not
shown).
2.4 HPLC analysis
The concentration of glycerol, 3-HP, glucose, and lactic acid in
the growth medium was quanti ﬁed using HPLC. Samples were
centrifuged and ﬁltered through a 0.2 µm sterile ﬁlter before the
HPLC analysis. 20 µL of sample was run on Aminex HPX-87H ion
exclusion column for 45 min. The mobile phase was 0.5 mM H
2SO4

at the ﬂowrate of 0.5 mL/min. The column temperature was set to
65°C, and the refractive index was measured at 35°C. The Shodex
RH-101 refractive index detector was used to detect 3-HP, glucose
and glycerol. The analytes were identi ﬁed and quanti ﬁed by
comparing the chromatogram with the respective standards
(glycerol, 3-HP, glucose, and lactic acid). The primary rationale
for including lactic acid, was its similarity with our target product 3-
HP. Based on the standards, we could conﬁrm that the method
allowed separating the two compounds. Lactic acid was not detected
in any of the samples.
2.5 Statistical analysis
Shake ﬂasks experiments were performed in biological replicates.
One-way analysis of variance and Tukey’s post-hoc test (α = 0.05) was
performed to infer statistically signiﬁcant differences between the
tested strains with respect to 3-HP production. For the repeated
fed-batch experiments, the experiments were repeated twice and a
representative experiment is shown.
3 Results and discussion
Before conducting bioreactor experiments, we made a non-
sporulating variant of the 3-HP producing strain we previously
generated (Kalantari et al., 2017). This was done by inactivating
spoIIAC which renders B. subtilis incapable of sporulation (Kim
and Kim 2001 ). This strain is referred to as the B. subtilis
production strain (annotated in the text as PS) henceforth. The PS
was tested for growth and 3-HP production in a 1-L bioreactor in the
MM9 medium. The PS exhibited a maximum cell density with an
OD
600 of 14.8, and 3-HP titer of 4.8 g/L in the MM9 medium
(Figure 1). Because of surprisingly low values of cell density and 3-
HP production, we then proceeded to test the PS for growth and 3-HP
production in the FBF medium that was previously used successfully
for riboﬂavin production inB. subtilis. The PS grew better in the FBF
medium where it exhibited a higher maximum cell density with an
OD
600 of 66.6, and a higher 3-HP concentration of approximately
12.9 g/L (Figure 1). As the FBF medium enabled both, a higher cell
density and 3-HP titer, we selected the FBF medium for all further
analyses of the strain.
3.1 Optimization of bioconversion process
conditions
Having selected a growth medium, we subsequently tested the
effect of modifying various fermentation conditions on 3-HP
production capacity of the PS in a 1-L bioreactor. For differentB.
subtilis strains, generally optimum temperatures between 30
°C and
37°C for growth and/or fermentation activity have been reported
(Hoffmann and Bremer 2011; Ju et al., 2019). We thus wanted to
probe the temperature-dependence of the process. At 30°C, both the
growth (Supplementary Figure S1) and the 3-HP production capacity
(4.3 g/L 3-HP) of the PS were signiﬁcantly reduced as compared to the
control (12.9 g/L 3-HP) grown at 37°C( Supplementary Figure S1).
This ﬁnding indicated that the 3-HP production activity of the PS is
temperature-sensitive. The PS needed a favorable temperature of 37°C
for optimal growth as previously reported forB. subtilis strain 168
(Hoffmann and Bremer 2011).
Next, we tested the effect of IPTG concentration on the 3-HP
production capacity of PS. It is well-known that the IPTG
concentration can affect the gen e expression of IPTG-inducible
promoters and consequently ta rget protein concentration.
Balancing the expression of the production pathway enzymes
could be key in alleviating stresses imposed by e.g., heterologous
protein expression and product t oxicity due to intracellular
accumulation. We tested different concentrations of IPTG (1μM,
10 μM, 100μM and 1 mM) in shakeﬂasks for induction of the 3-HP
operon, and found that 3-HP production was highest at 10 µM IPTG
(Supplementary Figure S2 ). While the shake ﬂask experiment
indicated a potential for improving 3-HP production via
modulating heterologous gene expression, it did not translate into
the same effect in the bioreactor. In the bioreactor setup, the
application of 10 µM IPTG led to a reduced production of 3-HP
FIGURE 1

higher maximum optical density (OD600) as well as a higher 3-HP titer.

(9.5 g/L 3-HP) (Supplementary Figure S1) as compared to using
1 mM IPTG (12.9 g/L 3-HP).
A potential problem could reside in the stability of production
pathway enzymes. The enzyme glycerol dehydratase is prone to being
inactivated due to error in regenerating the coenzyme B
12 cofactor.
Glycerol dehydratase reactivase can reactivate the enzyme with help of
ATP and intact coenzyme B12 (Jers et al., 2019). Thus, the amount of
coenzyme B12 present can be critical for the continuity of theﬁrst step
of 3-HP production. We therefore tested the effect of doubling the
amount of coenzyme B
12 on 3-HP production level in a 1-L bioreactor.
This led to a slight reduction in 3-HP production (9.2 g/L 3-HP)
(Supplementary Figure S1) as compared to the control (12.9 g/L 3-HP)
indicating that sufﬁcient coenzyme B
12 was supplied. Considering that
the substrate might be limiting, we also tested if doubling the amount
of glycerol (2%) would lead to an improved 3-HP production in the PS.
This, however, led to a reduced 3-HP titer (7.4 g/L 3-HP)
(Supplementary Figure S1) as compared to the control (12.9 g/L
3-HP).
Finally, we evaluated the 3-HP production capability of the PS
under different levels of dissolved oxygen. Oxygen could potentially
inﬂuence the 3-HP bioprocess by affecting production pathway
enzyme stability and co-factor regeneration. A high level of oxygen
could lead to inactivation of the oxygen-sensitive enzyme glycerol
dehydratase that catalyzes the ﬁrst step in the 3-HP biosynthetic
pathway (glycerol to 3-HPA). On the other hand, the second step of
the pathway requires nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD
+)a sa
co-factor, wherein NAD+ is reduced to NADH. In an aerobic process,
the regeneration of NAD+ involves donation of electrons from NADH
with oxygen being theﬁnal electron acceptor in the electron transport
chain. Thus, lowering oxygen level might impact the availability of
NAD+, thereby affecting the second enzymatic step. Additionally,
being a facultative anaerobe, B. subtilis generally grows better
under aerobic conditions (Hoffmann et al., 1995). Thus, we tested
3-HP production capability of the PS in a 1-L bioreactor under
reduced oxygen environment (growth at dissolved oxygen levels of
40%, 20%, 10%, and 1%), but not under anaerobic environment.
Surprisingly, no remarkable differences were observed in neither 3-HP
production, nor in the growth proﬁle of the cells (Supplementary
Figure S3) when grown under different dissolved oxygen conditions.
The 3-HP titers were 10.1, 10.4 and 14.2 g/L at dissolved oxygen levels
of 20, 10% and 1%, respectively, compared to 12.9 g/L with 40% DO.
These ﬁndings suggest that either only a minimal amount of oxygen is
needed for the regeneration of NAD
+ from NADH, or other
alternative processes are being utilized for regeneration of NAD+,
especially under near-anaerobic conditions. During anaerobic
regeneration of NAD
+, organic molecules can be used to regenerate
NAD+ from NADH. For instance, NADH can aid the conversion of
pyruvate into lactic acid, and is oxidized to NAD+ in the process
(Ramos et al., 2000 ). During alcohol fermentation, alcohol
dehydrogenase can oxidize NADH to NAD + while reducing
acetaldehyde to ethanol. In the present study, the ability of the PS
to regenerate NAD
+ from NADH under reduced dissolved oxygen
growth conditions suggests that oxygen is not critical for this process.
Indeed, B. subtilis can grow under anaerobic conditions due to their
ability to utilize nitrate ammoniﬁcation and various fermentation
processes ( Marino et al., 2001 ). Since the different levels of
dissolved oxygen seemed to have almost no effect on the 3-HP
production or biomass growth, all subsequent 1-L bioreactor runs
were performed under 1% DO.
3.2 Genetic modiﬁcation ofBacillus subtilis
leads to an improved 3-HP production
Having performed an optimization of the production conditions,
we next wanted to assess the possibility of improving 3-HP production
via genetic engineering of the production strain. Initially we
considered the possibility that an increase in NAD
+/NADH ratio
would improve 3-HP production. Consequently, we used different
approaches to modulate this ratio. The native NADH dehydrogenase
encoded by ndh, which can oxidize NADH to NAD
+ was over-
expressed (Marreiros et al., 2016 ). This was done by placing it
under the control of P43 promoter. Additionally, we introduced
the enzyme pyridine nucleotide transhydrogenase (UdhA) from
E. coli , which increases the transfer of reducing equivalents
between NAD
+ and NADP+ (Boonstra et al., 1999). Unfortunately,
none of these introduced gene components substantially increased 3-
HP production in the PS ( Supplementary Figure S4 ). These
experiments, in addition to fermentation experiments with different
oxygen levels, indicated that the balance of NAD
+/NADH was not a
bottleneck in the 3-HP production in our experiments. Other studies
have reported various means, including aearation control, electro-
fermentation and enzymatic approaches, to control the redox balance
leading to improved 3-HP production (Li et al., 2013; Kim et al., 2017;
Kim et al., 2020). While NAD
+/NADH in our current strain did not
appear to be a bottleneck, further improvement in 3-HP production
and derived NAD
+-drain could make it a relevant parameter in a later
stage.
As described above, increasing the amount of coenzyme B12 and
glycerol also did not lead to an increase in 3-HP production. We
hypothesized that this could be because of limitations in their uptake
by the bacterial cell. Therefore, we made a series of genetic
modiﬁcations in the PS targeting transporters to increase substrate
import (GlpF), product export (LctP), and import of the glycerol
dehydratase coenzyme B
12 (YvrC) as well as preventing import of the
product molecule 3-HP (LutP). The genetic modiﬁcations performed
in the PS are depicted in the Figure 2. B. subtilis does not have
dedicated 3-HP transporters but due to the structural similarity we
hypothesized that the native lactate transporters facilitated the
transport of 3-HP. To assure that 3-HP is efﬁciently secreted, we
FIGURE 2
Overview of the genetic modiﬁcations performed in the PS. We
over-expressed the genes glpF (for improved import of glycerol),yvrC
(for improved import of coenzyme B12), lctP (for improved export of 3-
HP), and knocked out the genelutP (to import of 3-HP).

over-expressed the permease LctP that is responsible for the export of
lactate (Ramos et al., 2000; Chai et al., 2009), and hence potentially of
3-HP as well. As 3-HP concentration increases in the fermentation
broth, re-uptake of 3-HP could potentially be decreasing the
productivity, and with the same rationale, we therefore targeted the
main permease for lactate uptake LutP (Chai et al., 2009). To address
these transport processes, we inactivated thelutP gene to yield the
strain PSΔlutP. In this strain, we further over-expressedlctP by placing
it under the control of the strong promoter P43, thereby obtaining the
strain PSΔlutP(lctP)
ox. The inﬂux of the substrate glycerol could also
be a potential bottleneck. We therefore overexpressed the glycerol
transporter GlpF (Stroud et al., 2003) by placingglpF under control of
the P43 promoter to yield the strain PSΔlutP(glpF)ox. Our 3-HP
synthesis pathway is dependent on the cofactor coenzyme B 12.
However, in presence of coenzyme B12, the uptake is negatively
regulated via a riboswitch regulating expression of yvrC encoding
an ABC transporter protein (Nahvi et al., 2004). To improve coenzyme
B12 uptake, we therefore placed yvrC under control of the
P43 promoter to obtain PS ΔlutP(yvrC)ox. Finally, we also
constructed a strain in which all the four mutations were
introduced simultaneously. This strain, PS ΔlutP(yvrC)
ox(glpF)
ox(lctP)ox, is referred to as PS4mut in this manuscript.
These ﬁve engineered strains, i.e., PS ΔlutP,P S ΔlutP(glpF)ox,
PSΔlutP(yvrC)ox,P SΔlutP(lctP)ox and PS4mut, along with PS (as a
reference) were evaluated in shakeﬂasks to determine the effect of
these genetic modiﬁcations on 3-HP production (Figure 3). The PS
produced about 1.6 ± 1.2 g/L 3-HP while the single mutant strain
PSΔlutP produced 3.1 ± 1.6. Neither of the double mutants strains
PSΔlutP(glpF)
ox,o rP SΔlutP(yvrC)ox exhibited a signiﬁcant increase in
the 3-HP titer compared to the PS. In the strain PSΔlutP(lctP)ox where
the aim is to improve export and decrease re-import of 3-HP we
observed a signiﬁcant increase in 3-HP titer (6.9 ± 0.5 g/L). We
previously observed no apparent growth defect of B. subtilis in
presence of ~9 g/L 3-HP ( Kalantari et al., 2017 ), which could
indicate that the primary effect is exerted via the improved
secretion of 3-HP. Similar beneﬁts, albeit in connection with higher
overall 3-HP titers, has been observed inE. coliwhere upregulation of
transporter YohJK leads to improved 3-HP tolerance and increased 3-
HP production (Nguyen-Vo et al., 2019; Nguyen-Vo et al., 2020).
Combining all four mutations led to further signiﬁcant improvement
in 3-HP titer (10.2 ± 0.8 g/L) as compared to the PSΔlutP(lctP)ox.I ti s
worth noting that the genetic modiﬁcations led to altered growth
behavior for all strains. For allﬁve mutant strains, we observed a
reduced ﬁnal cell density in the shakeﬂask cultures compared to the
PS strain (OD600 of 11.2– 13.2 vs. 17.7, respectively) (Supplementary
Figure S5).
The shakeﬂask experiments, indicated a potential of the PS4mut
strain for the production of 3-HP. Next, we wanted to test the
performance of this strain in our 1-L bioreactor setup. Anticipating
a higher 3-HP production in the quadruple mutant as compared to the
PS, we doubled the amount of input glycerol (2% glycerol) in order for
it to not be a limiting factor. As expected, an improved 3-HP
production with a titer of about 22.9 g/L was observed in this
strain (Figure 4), thus highlighting the importance of optimizing
the transport processes in the production strain. By a combination
of metabolic engineering of B. subtilis and optimization of the
FIGURE 3

bioprocess conditions, we were able to increase 3-HP production by
4.8-fold (from 4.8 g/L in the PS to 22.9 g/L in PS4mut) in a 1-L
bioreactor.
4 Conclusion and perspectives
The potential ofB. subtilis as a cell factory has been established
earlier (Kalantari et al., 2017). By optimization of the bioprocess
conditions and genetic engineering, we have further improved the
3-HP production capacity ofB. subtilisby 4.8-fold to a maximum titer
of 22.9 g/L. This titer is still not high enough for commercial
exploitation. Further improvements in 3-HP production could
potentially be achieved by improving the resistance of the
production strain towards 3-HP and glycerol by adaptive
laboratory evolution (ALE). For instance, ALE was used to develop
a 3-HP tolerantE. colistrain which produced more 3-HP as compared
to the reference strain (Nguyen-Vo et al., 2019). In another study, the
glycerol assimilating capability ofCupriavidus necatorwas improved
by ALE (González-Villanueva et al., 2019). Employment of highly
active and speciﬁc glycerol dehydratases and alcohol dehydrogenases
could be a venue for further improving the 3-HP production.
Importance need also be given to the optimization of the
bioprocess conditions. Such a combinatorial approach would be
needed in order to reach industrially relevant 3-HP titer, yield and
productivity.
