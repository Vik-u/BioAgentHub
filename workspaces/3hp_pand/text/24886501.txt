propanediol-utilization pathway for production of
3-hydroxypropionaldehyde, 3-hydroxypropionic
acid and 1,3-propanediol from glycerol

Abstract
Background: Lactobacillus reuteri converts glycerol to 3-hydroxypropionic acid (3HP) and 1,3-propanediol (1,3PDO)
via 3-hydroxypropionaldehyde (3HPA) as an intermediate using enzymes encoded in its propanediol-utilization
(pdu) operon. Since 3HP, 1,3PDO and 3HPA are important building blocks for the bio-based chemical industry,
L. reuteri can be an attractive candidate for their production. However, little is known about the kinetics of glycerol
utilization in the Pdu pathway inL. reuteri. In this study, the metabolic fluxes through the Pdu pathway were determined
as a first step towards optimizing the production of 3HPA, and co-production of 3HP and 1,3PDO from glycerol. Resting
cells of wild-type (DSM 20016) and recombinant (RPRB3007, with overexpressedpdu operon) strains were used as
biocatalysts.
Results: The conversion rate of glycerol to 3HPA by the resting cells ofL. reuteriwas evaluated byin situcomplexation
of the aldehyde with carbohydrazide to avoid the aldehyde-mediated inactivation of glycerol dehydratase. Under
operational conditions, the specific 3HPA production rate of the RPRB3007 strain was 1.9 times higher than that of the
wild-type strain (1718.2 versus 889.0 mg/gCDW.h, respectively). Flux analysis of glycerol conversion to 1,3PDO and 3HP
in the cells using multi-step variable-volume fed-batch operation showed that the maximum specific production rates of
3HP and 1,3PDO were 110.8 and 93.7 mg/gCDW.h, respectively, for the wild-type strain, and 179.2 and 151.4 mg/gCDW.h,
respectively, for the RPRB3007 strain. The cumulative molar yield of the two compounds was ~1 mol/mol glycerol and
their molar ratio was ~1 mol
3HP/mol1,3PDO. A balance of redox equivalents between the glycerol oxidative and reductive
pathway branches led to equimolar amounts of the two products.
Conclusions:Metabolic flux analysis was a useful approach for finding conditions for maximal conversion of glycerol to
3HPA, 3HP and 1,3PDO. Improved specific production rates were obtained with resting cells of the engineered RPRB3007
strain, highlighting the potential of metabolic engineering to render an industrially sound strain. This is the first report
on the production of 3HP and 1,3PDO as sole products using the wild-type or mutantL. reuteristrains, and has laid
ground for further work on improving the productivity of the biotransformation process using resting cells.

Background
Recent years have seen a growing interest in shifting from
fossil- to a more renewable feedstock based on biomass
for the production of chemicals and materials with a lower
carbon footprint [1,2]. In order to match the efficiency
and flexibility of the petrochemical industry, a number of
platform chemicals have been identified for the bio-based
industry that would serve as building blocks for a
range of other products [1,2]. Among these are 3-
hydroxypropionaldehyde (3 HPA), 3-hydroxypropionic
acid (3HP) and 1,3-propanediol (1,3PDO) [1,2]. While
there is no existing industrial production of the former
two chemicals [3,4], 1,3PDO has been produced industri-
ally from fossil-based propylene and ethylene, respectively,
by Degussa and Shell processes (in both processes, 3HPA
is formed as an intermediate) [5,6].
3HPA is a potential platform for several high-volume
products like acrolein, 3HP, 1,3PDO, malonic acid, acryl-
amide and acrylic acid [3,7-9], and can also be used as
an antimicrobial agent (reuterin) in food and health in-
dustries [3]. 3HP, besides being an important precursor
for acrylic acid [10], is a potential building block for the
production of propionilactone, biodegradable polyesters
and oligomers, and other products for food and cosmetic
industries [10-12]. 1,3PDO is incorporated in copolyesters
and advanced polymers, and used as ingredient in wood
paints, anti-freeze, adhesives and laminates [10,13,14]. Mi-
crobial production offers an attractive route for obtaining
these chemicals from bio-based resources, as seen by the
several studies reported using wild-type and engineered
bacteria. Production of 1,3PDO from sugar using engi-
neered Escherichia coli is indeed done on large scale
[15,16], and scale up of 3HP production is also being
attempted [17].
The large volume of glycerol obtained as a by-product
of biodiesel as well as bioethanol and soap manufacture
[18-21], represents a potentially useful carbon substrate
for production of 3HPA, 3HP and 1,3PDO. Several mem-
bers of the generaClostridia, Lactobacilli, Klebsiella,a n d
Citrobacter can use glycerol as an electron acceptor yield-
ing 1,3PDO via 3HPA as an intermediate. Recently, the
feasibility of simultaneous production of 3HP and 1,3PDO
using recombinant strains ofKlebsiella pneumonia, Lacto-
bacillus reuteri and E. coli has been reported [4,22-26].
The simple separation of these two compounds makes this
route very attractive [27]. However, despite the high titers
and production rates reported, most of these production
routes share the common problem of relatively low yields
and large amounts of by-products (lactic acid, ethanol,
butanol, succinic acid, and acetic acid, among others) with
high structural similarity to the desired products, which
complicated the downstream processing [4,23,24,26].
Further metabolic engineering of K. pneumonia aimed
at minimizing lactic acid pro duction was successful,
but the cumulative yield of 3HP and 1,3PDO was only
0.77 mol/mol glycerol [26].
L. reuteriis a very attractive candidate for the production
of 3HPA, 3HP and 1,3PDO. In contrast to the opportunis-
tic pathogenK. pneumonia, it has a“generally recognized
as safe” status and is also used as a probiotic, hence restric-
tions on scaling up for industrial production are minimal.
L. reuteriuses glycerol only as an electron acceptor and not
as a carbon source for growth, which ensures the absence
of undesired by-products in the reaction mixture. Trans-
formation of glycerol by growing L. reuteri results in
1,3PDO as the main product. The resting cells, on the
other hand, convert glycerol to 3HPA catalyzed by glycerol
dehydratase (GDH), while 1,3PDO and 3HP are formed in
small quantities as by-products. Due to the inhibitory
effect of 3HPA, the process is rapidly terminated if the al-
dehyde is not trapped as a complex with sodium bisulfite,
semicarbazide or carbohydrazide [28-31]. The ability of
L. reuteri to synthesize adenosylcobalamin (vitamin B12),
an essential co-factor for glycerol dehydratase, is an add-
itional economical advantage for its use as production
host [32].
Bioconversion of 3HPA to 1,3PDO and 3HP occurs
through a reductive and an oxidative pathway, respect-
ively [28,29]; the enzymes involved in these reactions
are encoded in the propanediol-utilization (pdu)o p e r o n .
The production of 3HP alone or in a mixture with
1,3PDO as main products using a wild-type L. reuteri
has however not been successful [22,33], mainly due to
the accumulation to toxic l evels of the intermediate
3HPA [22,28] and its inhibitory effect on one of the
enzymes of the oxidative pathway [34], as well as the
diversion of glycerol to dihydroxyacetone (DHA) cata-
lyzed by a glycerol dehydrogenase [33]. The co-production
of 3HP and 1,3PDO was only possible after the gene
encoding the enzyme glycerol dehydrogenase was knocked
out [22]. Despite the increasing interest and research
on the utilization ofL. reuteri in industrial biotechnol-
ogy, there is only fragmentary information regarding
metabolic fluxes within the Pdu pathway and conditions
for the co-production of 3HP and 1,3PDO as main end
products.
In the present study, metabolic flux analysis (MFA), a
technique that has been widely used for quantification of
fluxes, determination of nodal rigidity and metabolic
bottlenecks, and assisting the choice of the proper meta-
bolic engineering strategy [35-37], was employed to gain a
better understanding of the kinetics of glycerol utilization
and 3HPA distribution into reductive and oxidative
pathways in L. reuteri. This was done with the aim to
determine conditions for achieving maximal yields of the
desired products while overcoming the inhibitory/toxic
effects. The determination of these fluxes is challenging
due to the toxic nature of the intermediate 3HPA, the

compartmentalization of some intermediates (3HPA and
3HP-CoA) [38], and the co-factors recycling between the
different steps, affecting the overall dynamics of the system.
The flux of glycerol to 3HPA was analyzed using batch
mode of operation by trapping the aldehyde as a complex,
while the fluxes to 3HP and 1,3PDO were measured using
a multi-step fed-batch mode of operation. The study
was performed with twoL. reuteri strains: wild-type and
an engineered strain (RPRB3007) [39] in which the genes
encoded in thepdu operon were overexpressed.
Results and discussion
Mechanism of glycerol biotransformation and choice of
biotransformation conditions with whole cells ofL. reuteri
The expected pathway for the conversion of glycerol to
1,3PDO and 3HP byL. reuteri is illustrated in Figure 1.
It is initiated by the dehydration of glycerol to 3HPA in
a reaction catalyzed by a B12-dependent glycerol/diol
dehydratase (GDH) [33]. Further conversion of 3HPA to
1,3PDO is catalyzed by 1,3-propanediol oxidoreductase
(PduQ) and a putative alcohol dehydrogenase [40]. This
reaction is coupled to the regeneration of one mole of
NAD
+ per mole 1,3PDO produced, allowing the glycerol
to be continuously utilized by the growing cells as an
electron acceptor for conversion of NADH generated
during sugar metabolism and cell growth [41]. In contrast,
when resting cells are used, this reaction will proceed only
until all the NADH molecules available in the cells are
consumed. At this point, the role of the oxidative pathway
is very important through which 3HPA is oxidized in a
three-step reaction catalyzed by CoA-dependent propio-
naldehyde dehydrogenase (P duP), phosphotransacylase
( P d u L )a n dp r o p i o n a t ek i n a s e( P d u W ) ,r e s p e c t i v e l y ,t o3 H P
with 3HP-CoA and 3HP-phosphate as intermediates, and
utilizing NAD
+ to yield NADH resulting in a balance of
redox equivalents [33,42]. The overall balance of reducing
equivalents would result in the equimolar production of the
hydroxyacid and the diol. Furthermore, the Coenzyme
A (CoA) required for synthesis of 3HP-CoA in the
PduP-catalyzed step is released later in the PduL-catalyzed
reaction allowing continuous regeneration of these two
co-factors. The last step of the conversion of 3HPA to
3HP yields one mole of ATP per mole of 3HP formed,
which makes the reaction thermodynamically favorable
[27], and could be a reason for continuity even when rest-
ing cells are used. The ATP generated during this step
might be used for maintenance of cells [22] or for active
transport of 3HP outside the cell [43]. Also, it could be
utilized for reactivation (via a reactivase) of the inactivated
glycerol dehydratase in a process that requires ATP , Mg
+2
ions and adenosylcobalamin [44].
Compared to other species that can grow on glycerol,
L. reuteri cannot use glycerol as a carbon source due to
the lack of dihydroxyacetone kinase for conversion of
DHA to dihydroxyacetone phosphate prior to metabolism
via the glycolysis and phosphoketolase pathways [45,46].
This implies that no by-products will be formed during
glycerol bioconversion, hence simplifying the downstream
processing that is suggested to be one of the main factors
influencing the cost of production of 3HP by recombinant
E. coli[47].
Based on the above information, the process using resting
cells ofL. reuteriwas selected to analyze the metabolic flux
of glycerol to 3HPA, and the flux distribution around
3HPA to the reductive and oxidative pathway branches.L.
reuteri cells used for the studies were grown in the culture
medium containing 5 g/L 1,2-propanediol (1,2PDO), which
(or glycerol) is important for activating the expression of
the genes encoding enzymes and structural proteins re-
quired for glycerol metabolism [48] and also for triggering
the formation of metabolosomes required for entrapment
of the produced aldehyde and its subsequent conversion
to the CoA-derivative through the membrane-bound
PduP [33]. Addition of 1,2PDO results in a larger increase
in GDH activity than with the same concentration of
glycerol [33].
Cell growth was continued until the late stationary
phase (11 h) when all the glucose (40 g/L) and 1,2PDO
were consumed, and yielding a final cell density of 3.1
g
CDW/L, 14.3 ± 0.4 g/L lactic acid, 2.5 ± 0.3 g/L acetic acid
and 6.6 ± 1.6 g/L ethanol. Also 3.0 ± 0.4 g/Ln-propanol
was obtained from 1,2PDO. The resulting active biomass
was utilized as a whole-cell catalyst for biotransformation
experiments.

Metabolic flux of glycerol inL. reuteriresting cells using
batch mode of operation in the presence of 3HPA scavenger
According to our earlier experiments, resuspension of
the L. reuteri cells, cultivated as described above, in a
glycerol solution (200 – 400 mM) was suitable for the
production of 3HPA at a high purity and concentration,
but loss of cell viability and enzymatic activity was observed
within 2 h [28,49]. This could be attributed to different
factors, including toxicity of the aldehyde to the cells and
enzymatic machineries [49], and the inactivation of the
glycerol dehydratase enzyme due to breakdown of the
Co-C bond in the co-factor adenosylcobalamin [44].
The biocatalyst life span is significantly extended by
in situ complexation of the aldehyde with bisulfite, carbo-
hydrazide or semicarbazide [28,29]; the latter two form
more stable complexes with 3HPA [29]. Hence, carbohy-
drazide was chosen as a 3HPA scavenger to minimize the
toxic effect of the aldehyde on the cells and hence allow
determination of the true conversion rate of glycerol to
3HPA. pH 7 was selected for determining the glycerol
uptake and 3HPA accumulation rates based on the earlier
report revealing the optimal pH of production of 3HPA to
be shifted from pH 5 to 7 in the presence of carbohydra-
zide [29]. Under operational conditions, the conversion of
50 g/L glycerol was achieved within 6 h using 6 g
CDW/L of
the wild-type strain (Figure 2A). The overall volumetric-
(Q3HPA) and specific 3HPA production rates (q3HPA)w e r e
4.3 ± 0.1 g/L.h and 889.0 ± 65.6 mg/gCDW.h, respectively.
When RPRB3007 strain was used, the specific productivity
was 1.9x higher (1718.2 ± 98.3 mg/gCDW.h) than in the
wild-type strain and complete consumption of glycerol
was achieved within 3 h with formation of 26.2 ± 1.3 g/L
3HPA at a rate of 8.7 g/L.h as a carbohydrazide complex
(Figure 2B). Simultaneously, 5.8 g/L 1,3PDO and 6.9 g/L
3HP were also obtained. In both strains, glycerol uptake
and 3HPA production was characterized by a fast rate for
the first 30 min followed by a slower linear rate thereafter
(Figure 2 and Table 1).
Flux analysis and flux distribution through oxidative and
reductive pathways inL. reuteri resting cells
Bioconversion of glycerol to 1,3PDO and 3HP byL. reuteri
is subject to different inhibitory mechanisms, which need
to be avoided to achieve maximum yield and productivity.

the PduP enzyme at a concentration exceeding 0.6 g/L [34].
Moreover, high glycerol and 1,3PDO concentrations inhibit
glycerol dehydratase activity [49]. A controlled variable-
volume fed-batch operation with glycerol as a limiting
substrate was designed, in which the feed was applied at
a rate that allowed consumption of the entire glycerol
and formation of 3HP and 1,3PDO as end products. To
determine the maximum flux around 3HPA towards 3HP
and 1,3PDO, the glycerol feeding rate was increased
stepwise to a level that maximized the fluxesν
2 and ν3
(Figure 1). At this point, accumulation of 3HPA oc-
curred (flux ν4) at a concentration that was low enough

ability of co-factors produced during cell growth phase
could result in apparent rates in the initial hours of fed-
batch biotransformation that are higher than the actual
rates, data from the first 10 hours of the bioconversion
was not utilized in the calculation of the fluxes.
When the experiment was conducted at pH 5, no accu-
mulation of the intermediate aldehyde was observed in the
wild-type strain during operation in batch (1 h) and fed-
batch at 0.6 g/h glycerol (Figure 3A). Complete conversion
of glycerol to 3HP and 1,3PDO as the main end products
was observed. The link betweenthe oxidative and reductive
branches through the co-factorregeneration reaction cre-
ated a rigid node around 3HPA. The flux split ratio around
3HPA (ɸ) was ~50 mol% from 3HPA to 3HP and 1,3PDO,
respectively. Subsequently,increasing the feeding rate to

5.05 g/L of 1,3PDO, and accumulation of extracellular
3HPA to 1.36 g/L after 10 h (Figure 3A). The corresponding
production rates were 0.40, 0.34 and 0.15 g/h, respectively.
Using the RPRB3007 strain at pH 5 showed no accumu-
lation of the intermediate 3HPA during fed-batch operation
at 0.6 and 1 g/h glycerol feeding rates. Complete conversion
of glycerol to 6.57 g/L 3HP and 5.55 g/L 1,3PDO was
achieved. Further increase in the feeding rate to 1.9 g/h gly-
cerol between 22.3 h and 32.3 hresulted in accumulation
of 3HPA to 1.7 g/L at the end of the biotransformation
period. The production rates during the last 10 h of bio-
transformation were 0.66 g/h and 0.78 g/h for 1,3PDO and
3HP, respectively (Figure 3B). The maximum specific pro-
duction rates obtained withthe wild-type and RPRB3007
strains were confirmed by independent experiments where
the glycerol feeding rate was maintained at the maximum
rate determined for each strain (data not shown), which
also revealed that the maximum specific production rates
for the products were 2.2 fold higher with the RPRB3007
strain (Table 1).
Increasing the pH of the biotransformation reaction to 7
resulted in an increase in the specific production rates of
3HP and 1,3PDO to 110.8 and 93.7 mg/g
CDW.h for the
wild-type strain, and 179.2 and 151.4 mg/gCDW.h for the
RPRB3007 strain, respectively (Figure 3C & 3D and Table 1).
This is in agreement with the reported optimum pH for the
activity of PduP [33], and is also close to the reported
optimum pH of 6.2 for PduQ [50]. In this case, the final titers
of 3HP and 1,3PDO were 10.6 and 9.0 g/L, respectively.
Implications for the application ofL. reuterifor production
of 3HPA, 3HP and 1,3PDO
The results described above show that the use of resting
cells ofL. reuteri in combination with a 3HPA scavenger
Dishisha et al. Microbial Cell Factories2014, 13:76 Page 4 of 10
http://www.microbialcellfactories.com/content/13/1/76
under batch mode of operation seems to be a promising
approach for 3HPA production. While the RPRB3007
mutant strain with the overexpressedpdu operon exhib-
ited almost two-fold higher specific production rate of
3HPA than the wild-type strain, there is no change in
the susceptibility to 3HPA inhibition and requires the
presence of the scavenger for aldehyde production.
Fed-batch and immobilized-cell configurations have
been used with the wild-type strain for the production
of 3HPA as a carbohydrazide complex with improved
yields [29] and should also be tested with the RPRB3007
strain. Considering the relatively high cost of carbohy-
drazide, it would also be useful to test other more cost-
effective scavengers, or to isolate mutants with higher
tolerance to 3HPA.
In the experiments for the production of 1,3PDO and
3HP with resting cells of the wild-type strain, the controlled
glycerol feeding strategy allowed their co-production at a
higher productivity (0.56 g
1,3PDO/L.h and 0.66 g3HP/L.h)
compared to that obtained using a recombinant strain ofL.
reuteri lacking glycerol dehydrogenase activity under batch
operation (0.06 g1,3PDO/L.h and 0.07 g3HP/L.h) [22]. The

corresponding rates using the RPRB3007 strain were even
higher, 0.91 g1,3PDO/L.h and 1.08 g3HP/L.h. So far, the high-
est volumetric productivities reported for 1,3PDO and 3HP
were 7.6 g/L.h and 9 g/L.h, respectively, obtained using
resting cells of recombinantE. coli overexpressing theL.
reuteri genes encoding glycerol dehydratase, its reactivation
factor, and 1,3-propanediol oxidoreductase, as well as an
E. coliK-12 aldehyde dehydrogenase [22]. In contrast toL.
reuteri, the absence of protein shells (metabolosomes) in
E. coli minimizes the mass transfer limitation of the
substrate, intermediates and co-factors, and 3HPA is
converted to 3HP in a single-step reaction.

The measured fluxes for the different steps in the Pdu
pathway indicate that the rate of glycerol dehydration
catalysed by GDH is at least 10 times faster than the
subsequent reduction or oxidation of 3HPA to 1,3PDO
and 3HP , respectively (Table 1). Hence for targeting the co-
production of 3HP and 1,3PDO, the glycerol feeding rate
should be controlled to maintain the flux v
1 ≤ (v2 + v3).
When the glycerol feeding rate is≥ v1,3 H P Ai sa c c u m u -
lated as the main end product. MFA further suggests that
the oxidative and/or reductive pathways could be critical
targets for further metabolic engineering towards enhanced
production of 3HP and 1,3PDO. Further metabolic engin-
eering of the RPRB3007 strain could help in reducing the
product inhibition, and improving the volumetric prod-
uctivity and yield. Since the Pdu pathway is a non-growth
associated pathway, metabolic engineering for enhanced
production of 3HPA, 3HP and 1,3PDO is possible without
interference with microbial growth. There seems to be no
need for knocking out the gene encoding for glycerol
dehydrogenase as done by Yasuda et al. [22], since no
DHA production was observed in our experiments.
Despite the low volumetric productivity, there are
many other factors that make theL. reuteri-based process
desirable. The high purity of the resulting product mixture
obtained using resting cells (Figure 4), greatly simplifies
the downstream processing and minimizes production
costs. In the process using recombinant strain ofK. pneu-
monia, part of the glycerol is converted to dihydroxyacet-
one phosphate, which then enters the glycolytic pathway
yielding lactic acid, acetic acid and other alcohols as the
main by-products. In a study using recombinantPseudo-
monas denitrificans, 3HP was further oxidized to malon-
ate and utilized for cell growth resulting in decreased
yield. Several by-products (lactic acid, succinic acid, acetic
acid, ethanol and others) were indeed obtained as a result
of glucose metabolism when the growing cells ofL. reuteri
were used (data not shown), which would lead to com-
plicated downstream processing and increased costs even
if the concentrations, volumetric- and specific production
rates of 1,3PDO and 3HP were higher than those obtained
using resting cells. The use of resting cells also makes
process operation very simple, and moreover both the
wild-type and RPRB3007 strains do not need to be grown
in media with antibiotics that reduces operational costs.
Further studies to determine the extent of recyclability
of the microbial biocatalyst as well as the maximum con-
centration of the two final products that can be tolerated
are in progress.
Conclusions
L. reuteri has great potential as a candidate for the in-
dustrial production of 3HPA, 3HP and 1,3PDO. The
strain is amenable to metabolic engineering and a wide
variety of methods for its genetic manipulation are
available. Engineering of thepdu operon to increase the
glycerol-utilization rate is a good strategy to increase
specific production rates, and further manipulation could
render a robust strain for industrial applications. This
study presents a useful method for determination of meta-
bolic fluxes of the Pdu pathway inL. reuteriwith glycerol
as substrate. The method not only provided a stepping
stone for developing a production process for 3HPA or
co-production of 3HP and 1,3PDO using whole resting
cells of L. reuteri but also shed some light on important
aspects to consider during process design to allow for
cleaner production.

extract, 5 g yeast extract, 20 g dextrose, 1 g Tween 80, 2 g
ammonium citrate, 5 g sodium acetate, 0.1 g magnesium
sulfate, 0.05 g manganese sulfate and 2 g dipotassium
phosphate) was a product of Difco (BD laboratories,
Detroit, Michigan, USA). 1,3-Propanediol (99%) was
obtained from Sigma-Aldrich (St Louis, MO, USA),
glucose monohydrate from Prolabo (VWR International,
Fontenay-sous-Bois, France), and 1,2-propanediol (1,2PDO)
was from Merck (NJ, USA).
Microorganisms and culture conditions
L. reuteri DSM 20016 and L. reuteri RPRB3007 with a
modification in the catabolite repression element (CRE)
upstream of the pdu operon [39], were used for the
biotransformation of glycer ol. Inocula were grown in
30-mL serum bottles containing 20 mL 55 g/L MRS
and 20 mM 1,2-propanediol. The medium was added
to the bottles, boiled, and bubbled with nitrogen gas.
The bottles were then closed with rubber stoppers,
and autoclaved at 121°C for 15 min. The sterilized
medium was inoculated with 200 μLo fas t o c kc u l -
ture in 20% v/v glycerol and then incubated at 37°C
for 16 h. Two hundred microliters of the resulting
culture were transferred to 20 mL of fresh medium
and incubated for 8 h under the same conditions.
The resulting culture was used as inoculum in bioreactor
studies.
Production of the whole-cell biocatalyst for
biotransformation of glycerol
L. reutericells were grown in a 3-L bioreactor (Applikon,
Microbial Biobundle, The Netherlands). Monitoring and
control of all the parameters was done through anez-
control unit. Stirrer speed was maintained at 200 rpm,
temperature at 37°C and pH at 5.5 by addition of 5 N
NH
4OH. Anaerobic conditions were maintained through
continuous bubbling of nitrogen gas. Twenty milliliters of
the freshly prepared inoculum were aseptically added to
2-L fermentation medium containing 55 g/L MRS broth,
5 g/L 1,2-propanediol, and glucose at a final concen-
tration of 40 g/L. Fermentation was conducted for 10 h
after which the broth was collected and centrifuged at
15 000 × g and 4°C for 5 minutes. The supernatant was
discarded and the cell pellet was used for the biotrans-
formation of glycerol.
Batch production of 3HPA from glycerol using resting
cells ofL. reuteri
Biotransformation of glycerolwas done in a 1-L Biostat®-Q
bioreactor (B. Braun Biotech International, Melsungen,
Germany) with a 0.5-L working volume. The process
was started by resuspending theL. reuteri cells obtained
as described above, in 0.5 L solution containing 50 g/L
glycerol and 50.6 g/L carbohydrazide to a final cell
density of 6 g
CDW/L. Glycerol biotransformation was
performed at 37°C, pH 7, 500 rpm, with continuous nitro-
gen bubbling to maintain anaerobic conditions. Samples
were collected and analyzed for glycerol, 3HP , 1,3PDO,
and 3HPA, and the experiment was stopped when all the
glycerol had been consumed.
The biotransformation kinetics were determined using
the following equations:
–
Volumetric production rate; Qp g=L:hðÞ ¼ Pfinal–Pinitial
/C2/C3
=Δt
–Volumetric consumption rate; Qs g=L:hðÞ ¼ Sfinal–Sinitial

–Specific production rate; qp mg=gCDW : h
/C0/C1
¼ Qp⋅1000=X
–Specific consumption rate; qs mg=gCDW :h
/C0/C1
¼ Qs⋅1000=X
where P and S are the concentrations of the products
and substrate (g/L), respectively, X is the cell density
(gCDW/L), and Δt is the time elapsed between the initial
and final conditions (h).
Fed-batch production of 1,3PDO and 3HP from glycerol
using resting cells ofL. reuteri
Biotransformation of glycerol was done in a 3-L bioreac-
tor (Applikon, The Netherlands) with a 1-L initial work-
ing volume. The process was started by resuspending
the harvested L. reuteri cells from the biocatalyst-
production step in a 1-L solution containing 2 g/L gly-
cerol to a final density of 6 gCDW/L. After 1 h of batch
biotransformation, fed-batch mode was started by feed-
ing glycerol (50 g/L) at a rate of 12 mL/h (0.6 g
gly/h) for
10 h. Subsequently, the feeding rate was increased to
31.1 mL/h (1.6 ggly/h) for 10 h, and finally to 50 mL/h
(2.5 ggly/h) for 10 h. The biotransformation was per-
formed at 37˚C, pH 7, 500 rpm, with continuous nitro-
gen bubbling to maintain anaerobic conditions. The pH
was chosen based on the reported optimum for some of
the enzymes of the Pdu pathway [34,50].
Since some studies for 1,3PDO production inL. reuteri
have used acidic pH conditions, the experiment was also
conducted at pH 5 [51]. In this case, the feeding rates
and feeding periods were 12 mL/h (0.6 g
gly/h) for 11 h,
19.8 mL/h (1 ggly/h) for 10 h, and 38.1 mL/h (1.9 ggly/h)
for 10 h.
The feeding rates were determined according to a pre-
liminary fed-batch experiment at a constant feeding rate.
The feeding time (10 h) was chosen to ensure the stabil-
ity of the measured fluxes before shifting to a higher
feeding rate.
Samples were collected frequently and analyzed for
glycerol, 3HP, 3HPA and 1,3PDO concentrations. The

–Specific consumption rate; qS mg=gCDW :h

where P and S are the concentrations of the products
and substrate (g/L), respectively,V is the reaction volume,
x is the amount of the biocatalyst (gCDW), and Δt is the
time elapsed between the initial and final conditions (h).
Analytical procedures
Cell growth was monitored by measuring optical density
at 620 nm using a Ultrospec 1000 spectrophotometer
(Pharmacia Biotech, Uppsala, Sweden) and then correlated
with cell dry weight (CDW). For determination of the cell
dry weight, 10 mL of the culture broth were centrifuged at
3893 × g for 20 minutes in a pre-dried (105°C for 2 h),
pre-weighed 15 mL tube. The supernatant was removed
and the cell pellet was dried at 105°C overnight and then
weighed again. The difference in weight is equivalent to
cell dry weight in 10 mL culture.
Glycerol, glucose, lactic acid, ethanol, acetic acid,
1,2-propanediol, propionald ehyde, propionic acid, 3HP ,
and 1,3PDO concentrations were determined by HPLC
(JASCO, Tokyo, Japan) equipped with RI detector (ERC,
Kawaguchi, Japan), a JASCO UV detector and a JASCO
intelligent autosampler. Separation of the compounds was
done on an Aminex HPX-87H chromatographic column
connected to a guard column (Biorad, Richmond, CA,
USA). The column temperature was maintained at 65°C
in a chromatographic oven (Shimadzu, Tokyo, Japan).
Samples from the bioreactor were diluted with Milli-Q
quality water and mixed wi th 20% v/v sulfuric acid
(20 μL/mL sample) and then filtered. A forty-microliter
aliquot was injected in 0.5 mM H
2SO4 mobile phase flow-
ing at a rate of 0.4 mL/min. The retention times (min) for
the different compounds were 13.890 (glucose), 18.317
(lactic acid), 19.500 (3HP), 20.208 (glycerol), 22.350 (acetic
acid), 25.400 (1,2-propanediol), 25.876 (propionic acid),
26.400 (1,3PDO), 32.858 (ethanol), 33.290 (propionalde-
hyde) and 40.100 min (n-propanol).
For the determination of 3HPA concentration, a modified
colorimetric method of Circleet al.(1945) [52] as described
by Ulmer and Zeng (2007) [53] with acrolein as standard
was used. Briefly, 1 mL of sample (diluted to be within
the range of the assay) was mixed with 750 μLo f
1 0m M D L - t r y p t o p h a ns o l u t i o ni n5 0m MH C la n d
3 mL of concentrated HCl (fuming 37%). The reaction
mixture was incubated for 20 min at 37°C, and the result-
ing purple color was then measured spectrophotometric-
ally at 560 nm.
