Abstract 
The 3-Hydroxypropionic acid (3-HP) pathway is one of the six known natural carbon fixation pathways, in which the 
carbon species used is bicarbonate. It has been considered to be the most suitable pathway for aerobic  CO2 fixation 
among the six natural carbon fixation pathways. Mesaconate is a high value-added derivative in the 3-HP pathway 
and can be used as a co-monomer to produce fire-retardant materials and hydrogels. In this study, we use mesaco-
nate as a reporting compound to evaluate the construction and optimization of the sub-part of the 3-HP pathway in 
Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Combined with fine-tuning of the malonyl-CoA reductase (MCR-C and MCR-N) expression 
level and optimization of 3-Hydroxypropionyl-CoA synthase, the 3-HP sub-pathway was optimized using glucose or 
ethanol as the substrate, with the productions of mesaconate reaching 90.78 and 61.2 mg/L, respectively.

Graphical Abstract
Introduction
Global warming caused by the greenhouse effect is one 
of the great challenges facing mankind, which will lead to 
melting of glaciers and rising sea levels (Glikson 2018). 
In 2020, the highest temperature in Antarctica reached 
20.75 °C, a new record in history. The significant increase 
of the  CO2 density in the atmosphere caused by fossil 
fuel combustion is the main reason for this phenomenon 
(Venkata Mohan et  al. 2016). Therefore, the question 
on how to reduce the consumption of fossil fuels and 
develop alternative sustainable bioenergy has drawn 
great interest. Converting  CO2 into biofuels or chemi -
cals by engineered biological systems is one of the ways 
for  CO2 resource utilization (Hu et al. 2019). The recon -
struction of the  CO2 fixation pathway within traditional 
microbial cell factories could recycle  CO2 and reduce 
greenhouse gas emissions, which is of great significance 
for solving the shortage of fossil resources and alleviating 
the greenhouse effect.
There are six known natural carbon fixation pathways, 
including the Calvin (CBB) cycle, the 3-hydroxypropionic 
acid (3-HP) pathway, the Wood-Ljungdahl (WL) path -
way, the reducing tricarboxylic acid cycle (rTCA) cycle, 
the dicarboxylic acid/4-hydroxybutyric acid (DC/HB) 
cycle and the 3-hydroxypropionic acid/4-hydroxybutyric 
acid (HP/HB) cycle. Among them, the 3-HP pathway 
has been considered to be the most suitable pathway for 
aerobic  CO2 fixation (Liu et  al. 2020). Unlike the CBB 
cycle, the WL pathway, the rTCA cycle and the DC/HB 
cycle, the carbon species used in this pathway is bicar -
bonate, whose concentration in equilibrium with air is 
much higher than  CO2 in aqueous solution (Fuchs 2011). 
Therefore, the 3-HP pathway may be more efficient than 
those natural carbon fixation pathways using  CO2 (Bar-
Even et al. 2010). However, most of the research related 
to this pathway focused on the production of 3-HP 
(David et al. 2016; Liu et al. 2016).
Mesaconyl-C1-CoA is a key metabolic intermedi -
ate in the 3-HP pathway. The 3-HP pathway has been 
divided into four sub-pathways: (1) from acetyl-CoA to 
propionyl-CoA, (2) from propionyl-CoA to succinate, 
(3) from succinate to glyoxylate & acetyl-CoA, (4) from

glyoxylate and propionyl-CoA to pyruvate and acetyl-
CoA (Additional file  1: Fig. S1) (Mattozzi et al. 2013). In 
the sub-pathway (4), glyoxylate and propionyl-CoA are 
condensed into β-methylmalyl-CoA via MCL (malyl-
CoA/beta-methylmalyl-CoA/citramalyl-CoA lyase), sub -
sequently dehydrated to mesaconyl-C1-CoA by MCH 
(2-methylfumaryl-CoA hydratase), and then to pyruvate 
and acetyl-CoA catalyzed by MCT (2-methylfumaryl-
CoA isomerase), MEH (3-methylfumaryl-CoA hydratase) 
and MCL. Almost all the intermediates are acyl-CoAs, 
which are difficult to quantify in cell extracts due to their 
easy hydrolysis and degradation properties. This makes it 
difficult to use these acyl-CoAs as an indicator compound 
to assess the efficiency of the assembled 3-HP pathway in 
the engineering host. However, by removal of the CoA 
moiety, mesaconyl-C1-CoA can generate its correspond -
ing organic acid salt, mesaconate, under the reaction of 
the acyl-CoA thioester (Sonntag et al. 2014). When com-
pared to 3-HP and propionate, mesoconate acts as the 
downstream product of 3-HP-CoA and propionyl-CoA. 
It serves as a crucial component when it comes to eval -
uating the construction and optimization of the 3-HP 
pathway in S. cerevisiae. As a result, mesaconate has been 
selected as the indicator compound utilized to evaluate 
the efficacy of the assembled 3-HP pathway in the engi -
neering host.
Saccharomyces cerevisiae has long been the preferred 
metabolic engineering platform widely used in the refin -
ing of various biological products or chemicals, due to its 
numerous advantages (well characterized in genetics and 
physiology, available genome editing and gene expres -
sion tools) (Nielsen and Keasling 2016). At present, as 
a model organism for both basic and applied research, 
researchers have designed and expressed several carbon 
sequestration pathways in this heterotrophic industrial 
microorganism. For example, parts of the CBB cycle 
have also been heterogeneously reconstructed in S. cer -
evisiae, increasing the ethanol yields using  CO2 as part 
of the carbon source (Guadalupe-Medina et  al. 2013; Li 
et  al. 2017). Gonzalez de la Cruz et  al. (2019) enabled 
the reductive glycine (rGly) pathway in S. cerevisiae by 
overexpression of the endogenous enzymes. These works 
provide evidence for the potential modification of  CO2 
utilization in S. cerevisiae, which was also selected as the 
host in this work.
In this study, part of the 3-HP pathway was success -
fully constructed and optimized in S. cerevisiae using 
glucose or ethanol as the substrate (Fig.  1). Under both 
conditions, the production of mesaconate was used as 
an indicator compound for the optimization of the 3-HP 
sub-pathway and was adopted to evaluate the suitability 
of constructing the 3-HP pathway. After optimization of 
the 3-HP sub-pathway, the production of the mesaconate 
reporter reached 90.78 and 61.2 mg/L from glucose and 
ethanol, respectively. The detection of the produced 
mesaconate demonstrates the feasibility of constructing 
the 3-HP pathway in S. cerevisiae.
Materials and methods
Strains, plasmids and chemicals
E. coli DH5α was used for cloning and plasmid propaga -
tion. S. cerevisiae CEN.PK2-1D was used as the host for 
the construction of the 3-HP sub-pathway and mesaco -
nate biosynthesis. The strains and plasmids used in this 
study are listed in Additional file  1: Tables S1 and S2. 
3-HP was obtained from Sigma–Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, 
USA). Mesaconate and itaconate were purchased from 
Yuanye Biotechnology Co., Ltd. (Shanghai, China).
Plasmids construction
The following genes were used to construct the 3-HP 
sub-pathway for the synthesis of mesaconyl-C1-CoA in 
CEN.PK2-1D, including genes encoding malonyl-CoA 
reductase (Ca MCR, uniport ID: Q6QQP7) from Chloro -
flexus aurantacus, 3-hydroxypropionyl-CoA synthase 
(MsHPCS, uniport ID: A4YGR1) and acryloyl-CoA 
reductase (MsACR, uniport ID: A4YGN2) from Metal -
losphaera sedula, 3-hydroxypropionyl-CoA dehydratase 
(StHPCD, uniport ID: F9VNG3) from Sulfolobus toko -
daii, propionyl-CoA synthetase (SePrpE, uniport ID: 
P55912) from Salmonella enterica, the malyl-CoA/beta-
methylmalyl-CoA/citramalyl-CoA lyase (Rs MCL, uni -
port ID: A3PGR7) from Rhodobacter sphaeroides, and 
2-methylfumaryl-CoA hydratase (Ca MCH, uniport ID: 
A9WC34; RsMCH, uniport ID: Q3IZ78; HmMCH, uni -
port ID: Q5V464) from C. aurantacus, R. sphaeroides 
and Haloarcula marismortui. The genes encoding acyl-
CoA thioester hydrolase (EcYciA, uniport ID: P0A8Z0) 
from E. coli was used to convert mesaconyl-C1-CoA to 
mesaconate. The genes encoding acetyl-CoA hydrolase 
(ACH1), 3-hydroxyisobutyryl-CoA hydrolase (EHD3) and 
peroxisomal acyl-CoA thioesterase (TES1) from S. cerevi-
siae were selected to verify mesaconyl-C1-CoA hydrolase 
function. Those genes were amplified or synthesized by 
TSINGKE (Beijing, China), and cloned into appropri -
ate plasmids, respectively. For the combined expression 
of related genes, different gene expression cassettes were 
assembled into appropriate plasmids using ClonExpress ® 
Ultra One Step Cloning Kit (Nanjing Vazyme Biotech 
Co., Ltd, China), and the primers used for fragments 
amplification are listed in Additional file 1: Table S3.
Genomic manipulation by GTR‑CRISPR
The GTR-CRISPR system (Zhang et  al. 2019) was used 
for the genetic manipulation in CEN.PK2-1D. The 
sequences of gRNAs for the deletion of ACH1, EHD3 and 
Page 4 of 12Xu et al. Bioresources and Bioprocessing           (2023) 10:33 
TES1 were predicted at https:// atum. bio/ eComm erce/ 
cas9/ input. The expression cassettes were integrated at 
the XI-2, XI-3 and XII-1 sites (Jessop-Fabre et al. 2016). 
The primers used for integrations are listed in Additional 
file 1: Table S3.
Fermentation and metabolite extraction
The transgenic CEN.PK2-1D cells were cultured with 
yeast extract peptone dextrose (YPD) medium or appro -
priate synthetic defined dropout liquid medium (SC) 
containing 2% glucose or 2% ethanol with 0.1% acetate, 
which could allow Saccharomyces cerevisiae to enter the 
logarithmic growth stage earlier (Additional file  1: Fig. 
S3). All yeast strains were cultured at 30 °C and 200 rpm 
in shake flasks.
For metabolite extraction, 200  mL of 0.5  mm glass 
beads, 30 μL of 12 M HCl and 10 μL of 0.2 g/L itaconate 
were added into 400 μL cell culture. After vortexing for 
10  min, the mixture was incubated at 80  °C for 30  min 
and subsequently cooled to room temperature. Then 
50 μL of NaCl saturated solution and 800 μL of ethyl ace -
tate were added, and the samples were then vortexed for 
10 min and centrifuged for 5 min at 5000 g. The organic 
phase was transferred into a new tube, and this extrac -
tion step was repeated once. The ethyl acetate extracts 
were vacuum-evaporated and derivatized with N-(tert-
Butyldimethylsilyl)-N-methyl-trifluoroacetamide (MTB -
STFA) at 80 °C for 30 min. 2 μL of the derivatized sample 
was subjected to GC–MS analysis.
Promoter strength assay
The promoters of TEF1, PGK1, TDH3, TPI1, QCR10, 
COX9, HXT1 and N AT2 were amplified from the 
genomic DNA of S. cerevisiae CEN.PK2-1D. Primers 
used for promoter amplification are listed in Addi -
tional file  1: Table  S3. The green fluorescent protein 
(GFP) was adopted for the determination of promoter 
strength. Plasmids containing GFP with different pro -
moters mentioned above were transformed into S. cer -
evisiae  CEN.PK2-1D. After culture for 72 h in SC-his 
medium that used 2% glucose or 2% ethanol (with 0.1% 
acetate) as the carbon source, the fluorescence inten -
sity was measured by CytoFLEX (Backman Coulter, 
USA) for the quantification of GFP expression.

HPLC and GC–MS analyses
3-HP was determined by HPLC with an LC-20AT 
instrument (Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan) using an Aminex 
HPX-87H column (Bio-Rad, Hercules, USA). The col -
umn temperature was maintained at 60 °C using 5 mM 
 H2SO4 as the mobile phase at a flow rate of 0.6 ml/min, 
and the signal was detected using a RI-101 refractive 
index detector.
Mesaconate was quantified using a GC/MS-QP2010 
Ultra (Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan) equipped with a 
HP-5 MS column (0.25 mm ID × 0.25 μm Film Thick -
ness × 15  m Length). The column temperature was 
programmed at an initial temperature of 55  °C for 
1 min, then increased to 115 °C at a rate of 30 °C/min 
and held for 15 min, then increased to 160 °C at a rate 
of 5 °C/min, then increased to 300 °C at a rate of 30 °C/
min, and finally held at 300  °C for 15  min. The tem -
perature of the injector was set at 270 °C. Helium was 
used as the carrier gas at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. The 
MS system was operated in full scan mode within the 
m/z range of 50–600.
Results and discussions
Construction of a 3‑hp sub‑pathway in S. cerevisiae
As shown in Fig.  1, a 3-HP sub-pathway was designed 
and constructed in S. cerevisiae, with the formation of 
mesaconate as the reporter metabolite. This sub-pathway 
covers reactions from acetyl-CoA to mesaconyl-C1-CoA 
in the 3-HP pathway (Additional file 1: Fig. S1).
In this 3-HP sub-pathway, we first overexpressed the 
MCL, MCH and an acyl-CoA thioester hydrolase (YciA) 
in CEN.PK 2-1D that composed the downstream reac -
tions from propionyl-CoA to mesaconate (Fig.  1). To 
facilitate the confirmation of the function of MCL, MCH 
and YciA, propionate was added to the medium as well 
as additional expression of a propionyl-CoA synthetase 
(PrpE) to enable the supply of propionyl-CoA (Fig.  2A). 
When designing the pathway, the EcYciA from E.coli 
and SePrpE from S. enterica were chosen, since EcYciA 
has been reported to be a non-specific thioesterase that 
is active on mesaconyl-CoA (Sonntag et  al. 2014) and 
SePrpE can convert propionate to propionyl-CoA (Ding 
et al. 2022). MCL is a multifunctional enzyme with both 
cleavage and condensation activities. We summarized 
the activities of MCLs from BRENDA (https:// www. 
brenda- enzym es. info/ index. php) (Table  S4). Among 
them, RsMCL has the highest ratio of condensation activ-
ity to cleavage activity and was adopted in our design. 
We chose and tested three MCHs, which are from C. 
aurantacus, R. sphaeroides and H. marismortui, respec -
tively. As the result shown in Fig.  2B, mesaconate can be 
detected in strains that overexpressed Ca MCH from C. 
aurantacus or Rs MCH from R. sphaeroides, combined 
with the overexpression of Se PrpE, RsMCL and EcYciA.

Page 6 of 12Xu et al. Bioresources and Bioprocessing           (2023) 10:33 
The strain holding Ca MCH can produce more mesaco -
nate, indicating higher efficiency of the constructed 3-HP 
sub-pathway. We integrated the preferred RsMCL  and 
CaMCH into the genome of CEN.PK 2-1D, obtaining 
strain M1 for subsequent pathway construction.
Then, MsHPCS from M. sedula, MsACR  from M. 
sedula, and StHPCD from S. tokodaii were integrated 
into M1 (obtaining strain M2). To constructed the whole 
3-HP sub-pathway (Fig.  1), the plasmid pSC-HIS-MCR  
harboring CaMCR from C. aurantacus was transformed 
into M2 (obtaining strain M201), and the plasmid pSC-
HIS-MCR-YciA harboring CaMCR  and EcYciA was 
transformed into M2 (obtaining strain M202). As shown 
in Fig.  2C, 1.02 mg/L of mesaconate was synthesized in 
M201 from glucose, suggesting that this whole 3-HP 
sub-pathway was successfully constructed in S. cerevi -
siae. Interestingly, the yield of mesaconate decreased to 
0.26  mg/L after overexpressing an additional EcYciA in 
the engineered strain M202. We speculate that the acyl-
CoA thioester hydrolase also can hydrolyze 3-hydroxy -
propionyl-CoA, thereby inhibiting the metabolic flux 
of 3-HP to mesaconate. In the subsequent optimization 
work, we did not overexpress the additional EcYciA in the 
engineering strains.
Evaluation and characterization of acyl‑CoA hydrolases 
in the 3‑HP sub‑pathway
It should be mentioned that mesaconate can also be 
detected in the absence of EcYciA (Fig.  2C). We specu -
late that the endogenous acyl-CoA hydrolases in yeast 
may play a role in converting mesaconyl-C1-CoA to 
mesaconate (Fig.  2A). Here, genes encoding acetyl-CoA 
hydrolase (ACH1 ), 3-hydroxyisobutyryl-CoA hydrolase 
(EHD3) and peroxisomal acyl-CoA thioesterase (TES1) 
from S. cerevisiae were selected to verify the function 
of mesaconyl-C1-CoA hydrolase, since acyl-CoA hydro -
lase or thioesterase may have substrate promiscuity and 
showed hydrolase activity to broad substrates (Sonntag 
et  al. 2014). We overexpressed and knocked out these 
three genes in M3 (SePrpE was integrated into M1), 
respectively. As shown in Fig.  3A, the accumulation of 
mesaconate increased by 24.4% after the plasmid-based 
overexpression of ACH1  in M3. In contrast, mesaco -
nate was significantly reduced when knocking out ACH1  
in M3 (Fig.  3B). The results showed the thioesterase 
encoded by ACH1 has mesaconyl-CoA hydrolase activity.

Optimization of the MCR expression in the 3‑HP 
sub‑pathway
MCR has been reported as the key enzyme in the 3-HP 
pathway, catalyzing the reduction of malonyl-CoA to 
3-HP (Son et al. 2020). In this section, we tested whether 
the efficiency of 3-HP pathway can be improved by 
increasing the accumulation of 3-HP via optimizing of 
MCR. There are two functional domains in MCR, which 
catalyzes malonyl-CoA to 3-HP through a two-step 
NADPH-dependent reduction (Hügler et  al. 2002; Liu 
et al. 2013). Liu et al. (2013) made an intriguing discovery 
which showed that MCR can be split into two segments, 
namely MCR-C (amino acids 550–1219) and MCR-N 
(amino acids 1–549). MCR-C is involved in catalyzing 
malonyl-CoA to malonate semialdehyde, while MCR-N 
transforms malonate semialdehyde to 3-HP . The expres -
sion of these two fragments had an important impact on 
3-HP production. It also reported that even when both 
genes were codon-optimized and controlled by the same 
promoter, MCR-N had a higher expression level than 
MCR-C (Liu et  al. 2013). This enzyme activity discrep -
ancy has the potential to affect the overall production of 
3-HP .
To solve this problem, Liu et  al. (2016) significantly 
increased the 3-HP production by fine tuning of the 
expression level of MCR-N combined with directed 
evolution of MCR-C (mutation in N940V, K1106W and 
S1114R). In this study, the two functional domains were 
expressed under promoters of different strengths, respec-
tively. Promoters of PGK1, TEF1, TDH3, TPI1, HXT1, 
QCR10, COX9 and N AT1 are selected to fine tune the 
expression level. We determined the ability of these pro -
moters under glucose by measuring the expression level 
of GFP (Additional file  1: Fig. S2). Stronger promoters, 
such as PGK1p, TEF1p, TDH3p and TPI1p, were used for 
expression of MCR-C mut (N940V, K1106W and S1114R) 
and weaker promoters, such as HXT1p, QCR10p, 
COX9p and NAT2p, were adopted for expression of 
MCR-N (Fig.  4A). As shown in Fig.  4B, the combina -
tion of PGK1p-MCR-Cmut and HXT1p-MCR-N produced 
the highest yield of 3-HP in glucose. When the expres -
sion level of MCR-N is lower than that of MCR-C mut, it 
helps to improve 3-HP production. However, insufficient 
expression of the MCR-N protein may not effectively 
reduce the MSA produced by MCR-C mut, thus limit -
ing 3-HP biosynthesis. The results show that a balanced 
expression level between MCR-C mut and MCR-N is an 
essential factor for 3-HP production.
Since cellular intracellular fatty acid synthesis usually 
consumes malonyl-CoA, competing with the 3-HP path -
way (Fig. 4C). To further drive the malonyl-CoA flux into 
the 3-HP pathway instead, we used an ultrahigh copy 
number plasmid pUGG to replace the typical 2μ-based 
plasmid for the expression of 3-HP formation genes. The 
ultrahigh copy number plasmid with a truncated pro -
moter for the auxotrophic maker gene could reach ∼200 
copies per cell, which is much higher than 10–40 copies 
of 2μ-based plasmid (Qin et  al. 2020). After changing 
the copy number, the 3-HP accumulation increased to 
1025  mg/L at shaker flask (Fig.  4D). Currently, consid -
erable progress has been achieved in yeast-based 3-HP 
production via the MCR pathway (Chen et al. 2014, 2017; 
Kildegaard et al. 2016; Li et al. 2015; Maury et al. 2018; Yu 
et al. 2022). Many of the strategies implemented utilized 
incremental precursor and co-factor supply to enhance 
the production of 3-HP . In particular, Yu et al. optimized 
the expression of MCR in a super yeast chassis with suf -
ficient supply of precursor malonyl-CoA and cofactor 
NADPH, greatly improving 3-HP yield (Yu et  al. 2022). 
The result demonstrated that optimizing MCR expres -
sion is an effective strategy to increase the efficiency of 
the 3-HP pathway in yeast.
To test the effect of optimization strategy of MCR on 
the 3-HP sub-pathway, we transformed the ultrahigh 
copy number plasmid pUGG-PH into M2, obtaining 
strain M203. Indeed, the yield of the reporter mesaconate 
was increased to 3.23 mg/L, a 1.8 folds increase compared 
to that of the initial strain M201 (Fig.  4E). However, in 
contrast to the strong concentration of 3-HP , the yield of 
mesaconate remains notably low, leading us to presume 
that the hindrance lies in the reactions from 3-HP to 
mesaconate. The process of further reductive conversion 
of 3-HP to mesaconate demands six enzymatic steps, and 
the initial step is the activation of 3-HP to its CoA ester 
(3-HP-CoA). Therefore, our next objective is to evalu -
ate whether the efficiency of the 3-HP sub-pathway can 
benefit from the selection of 3-hydroxypropionyl-CoA 
synthase.
Overexpression of PrpE to increase the efficiency 
of the 3‑HP sub‑pathway
The 3-hydroxypropionyl-CoA synthase (HPCS) from 
M. sedula and propionyl-CoA synthetase (PrpE) from S. 
enterica were used in this project. Both HPCS and PrpE 
are multifunctional acyl-CoA synthases, belonging to 
propionate-CoA ligase (EC 6.2.1.17), have a rather broad 
substrate spectrum. It was reported that HPCS can use 
3-HP , propionate, acrylate, acetate, and butyrate as sub -
strates (Alber et al. 2008) and PrpE can catalyze acyl sub -
strates, such as propionate, acrylate, acetate and butyrate, 
into corresponding acyl-CoA (Horswill and Escalante-
Semerena 2002). Hence, we assume that PrpE can also 
take 3-HP as the substrate, similar to HPCS.
To test the formation efficiency of 3-hydroxypropio -
nyl-CoA from 3-HP , MsHPCS, MsACR, StHPCD and 
CaMCR were overexpressed in strain M1, resulting

strain M101, and SePrpE, MsACR, StHPCD and CaMCR 
were overexpressed in strain M1, resulting strain M102. 
The production of mesaconate was used as an indicator 
compound for the optimization of 3-hydroxypropionyl-
CoA synthase in the 3-HP sub-pathway. Compared to 
the expression of MsHPCS in M101, the use of SePrpE

in M102 gave a much higher production of mesaconate, 
indicating a higher activity in the formation of 3-HP-CoA 
from 3-HP (Fig. 5A). To further improve the efficiency of 
the 3-HP sub-pathway, an additional copy of SePrpE was 
integrated into the XII-1 site (Jessop-Fabre et  al. 2016) 
to obtain strain M103, resulting in a further 5.5-fold 
increase in the accumulation of mesaconate (Fig. 5A).
Finally, we constructed strain M403 and M405 by 
combining the above optimization strategies (balanced 
expression levels between MCR-C mut and MCR-N, over -
expression of MCR and PrpE). The yield of the reporter 
mesaconate of M403 (using SePrpE replaced MsHPCS at 
the XI-2 site of M203, and an additional copy of SePrpE 
was integrated into the XII-1 site) was increased to 
6.62 mg/L (Fig.  5B), indicating the efficiency of the 3-HP 
sub-pathway has increased by 4.7 fold, compared with 
initial strain M201. Moreover, the production of mesaco-
nate from glucose by the 3-HP sub-pathway in M403 is 
close to the strain M3 (Fig.  3), which produced around 
5  mg/L mesaconate from the medium supplemented 
with 1  g/L of propionate and 1  g/L of glyoxylate. This 
highlights the MCL and MCH as limiting factors in the 
3-HP sub-pathway. When comparing M403 to M405, 
it was found that an additional SePrpE gene expressed 
on the pUGG1 plasmid resulted in a further increase in 
mesaconate yield of up to 90.78 mg/L. This suggests that 
increasing the number of SePrpE copies can improve 
the efficiency of 3-HP and ultimately boost mesaconate 
production.
Ethanol is more compatible with the 3‑HP pathway in yeast
S. cerevisiae can utilize non-fermentable substrates 
such as ethanol, acetate, lactate, oleate and glycerol as 
carbon sources (Laxman et al. 2014; Lee et al. 2011; Li 
et  al. 2020; Minard and McAlister-Henn 2005; Xiber -
ras et al. 2019). Ethanol is an ordinary and inexpensive 
commodity substrate, which can be produced on an 
industrial scale from lignocellulosic biomass (Clomburg 
et al. 2017) and steel waste gas (Liew et al. 2016). Dur -
ing growth on ethanol, the glyoxylate cycle is critical 
(Daran-Lapujade et al. 2004) and can provide essential 
intermediate glyoxylate for the synthesis of mesco -
nate via 3-HP pathway (Fig.  1). Meanwhile, ethanol 
can be used for the supply of the precursor acetyl-CoA

without carbon release, and it does not belong to any 
of the intermediates in the 3-HP pathway. In the 3-HP 
pathway of mesocanate synthesis, using ethanol as the 
only carbon source, one molecule of mesocanate can 
fix one molecule of bicarbonate and two molecule eth -
anol. In contrast, when using glucose as the only car -
bon source, carbon fixation is not achieved, as pyruvate 
kinase catalyzes pyruvate to acetaldehyde, releasing one 
molecule of  CO2 (bicarbonate). Therefore, the synthesis 
of one molecule of mesocanate requires two molecules 
of acetyl-CoA and releases one molecule of  CO2 (bicar-
bonate) when glucose is used as the only carbon source. 
Those features make ethanol a suitable carbon source 
for the construction of 3-HP pathway in yeasts, and we 
attempted and optimized the 3-HP sub-pathway in S. 
cerevisiae using ethanol as the carbon source.
Since the strength of the promoters varies under differ-
ent carbon sources, we determined the strength of these 
promoters under ethanol by measuring the expression 
level of GFP . Similar to the results with glucose as the car-
bon source, the strength of the promoters TEF1p, PGK1p, 
TDH3p and TPI1p was higher than that of QCR10p, 
COX9p, HXT1p and NAT2p when ethanol was used as 
the carbon source (Additional file  1: Fig. S2). When glu -
cose was used as the carbon source, the promoters used 
to drive the genes (MsHPCS/SePrpE, StHPCD, MsACR 
, RsMCL and CaMCH ) of the 3-HP sub-pathway were 
PGK1p, TEF1p, TDH3p. So we didn’t replace the pro -
moters of these genes when the carbon source changed 
from glucose to ethanol. However, the relative strength 
between the promoters when ethanol was used as the 
carbon source (PGK1p ~ TEF1p ~ TPI1p > TDH3p > QCR
10p > COX9p > NAT2p > HXT1p) was different compared 
to that when glucose was used as the carbon source (P
GK1p ~ TDH3p > TEF1p ~ TPI1p > QCR10p > HXT1p > 
COX9p > NAT2p) (Additional file  1: Fig. S2). Then, we 
used PGK1p, TEF1p, TDH3p, TPI1p for the expression 
of MCR-Cmut and HXT1p, QCR10p, COX9p, NAT1p for 
the expression of MCR-N to balance the expression lev -
els between two domains again when the carbon source 
changed from glucose to ethanol. As shown in Fig.  6A, a 
combination of TEF1p-MCR-C mut and QCR10p-MCR-N 
produced the highest yield of 3-HP from ethanol. Fur -
thermore, we used the previously adopted ultrahigh copy 
number plasmid pUGG to increase the overexpression of 
MCR, yield of 3-HP from ethanol increased to 987 mg/L 
(Fig. 6A).
To test the effect of optimization strategy of MCR on 
the 3-HP sub-pathway under ethanol condition, we trans-
formed the ultrahigh copy number plasmid pUGG-TEQ

of SePrpE in the plasmid pUGG-TEQ

into M2, obtaining strain M204. Similarly, the yield 
of the reporter mesaconate in M204 was increased to 
3.97 mg/L, 3.78-fold higher than that of the initial strain 
M201 (0.83 mg/L from ethanol) (Fig.  6B). Next, we used 
SePrpE replaced MsHPCS at the XI-2 site of M204, and 
integrated an additional copy of SePrpE into the XII-1 
site, obtaining strain M404. The reporter mesaconate 
yield derived from ethanol in M404 was augmented 
to 7.56  mg/L. M406, featuring supplementary SePrpE 
expression on pUGG1 plasmid, exhibited a mesaconate 
yield of 61.2 mg/L compared to M404.
The 3-HP pathway shows greater potentiality in  CO2 
fixation, and is considered to be the most suitable path -
way for aerobic  CO2 fixation (Liu et al. 2020). At present, 
studies related to the 3-HP cycle focused mainly on the 
production of 3-HP rather than C1 fixation (Yu et  al. 
2022). Here, we constructed part of the 3-HP pathway in 
recombinant S. cerevisiae and optimization of the recom-
binant strain significantly improved the efficiency of this 
pathway. Furthermore, the optimization of the 3-HP sub-
pathway utilizing ethanol as a carbon source has shown 
the potential of using ethanol for this purpose. In the 
future, incorporating the engineered S. cerevisiae with 
the whole 3-HP pathway could enable the direct synthe -
sis of biomass from  CO2.
Conclusion
Most of the intermediates in 3-HP pathway are acyl-CoA, 
which are difficult to quantify in cell extracts. Mesaconate 
is the corresponding organic acid of mesaconyl-C1-CoA, 
the intermediate metabolite in the 3-HP pathway. In this 
study, mesaconate was used as an indicator compound 
to assess the efficiency of reactions from acetyl-CoA to 
mesaconyl-C1-CoA, which facilitate the construction 
and optimization of the 3-HP sub-pathway in S. cerevi -
siae with the use of glucose or ethanol as the substrate. 
Currently, there are still some problems with the con -
struction of the whole 3-HP pathway in yeast. The yeast’s 
endogenous fatty acid synthesis pathway and acetyl-CoA 
hydrolases, like Ach1p, may compete with the 3-HP path-
way for acetyl-CoA and mesaconyl-C1-CoA, respectively. 
The competition can lead to a shift in carbon metabo -
lism, emphasizing mesaconate production over mesaco -
nyl-C4-CoA in the process.
