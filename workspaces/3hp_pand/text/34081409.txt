Summary
The use of the methylotrophic yeastPichia pastoris
(Komagataella phafﬁ) to produce heterologous pro-
teins has been largely reported. However, investiga-
tions addressing the potential of this yeast to
produce bulk chemicals are still scarce. In this
study, we have studied the use ofP. pastoris as a
cell factory to produce the commodity chemical 3-
hydroxypropionic acid (3-HP) from glycerol. 3-HP is
a chemical platform which can be converted into
acrylic acid and to other alternatives to petroleum-
based products. To this end, the mcr gene from
Chloroﬂexus aurantiacus was introduced intoP. pas-
toris. This single modiﬁcation allowed the production
of 3-HP from glycerol through the malonyl-CoA path-
way. Further enzyme and metabolic engineering
modiﬁcations aimed at increasing cofactor and meta-
bolic precursors availability allowed a 14-fold
increase in the production of 3-HP compared to the
initial strain. The best strain (PpHP6) was tested in a
fed-batch culture, achieving a ﬁnal concentration of
3-HP of 24.75 g l/C01, a product yield of 0.13 g g/C01 and
a volumetric productivity of 0.54 g l/C01 h/C01, which, to
our knowledge, is the highest volumetric productivity
reported in yeast. These results benchmark P. pas-
toris as a promising platform to produce bulk chemi-
cals for the revalorization of crude glycerol and, in
particular, to produce 3-HP.
Introduction
In 2004, the US Department of Energy (DOE) published
the list of the top value-added bio-based chemicals to be
produced from biomass (Werpy and Petersen, 2004).
The production of such bio-based products in a bioreﬁn-
ery is necessary to complement biofuel production,
which is a low value-added product with a high price
volatility. Co-producing biofuels and chemicals in an inte-
grated bioreﬁnery would allow the design of an economi-
cally robust and sustainable process, making it an
attractive investment option. The DOE report ranked 3-
hydroxypropionic acid (3-HP) among one of these top
value-added chemicals to be produced in a bioreﬁnery.
The largest application of 3-HP is its conversion into
acrylic acid and other products typically derived from
petroleum (Della Pina et al., 2011; Kumar et al., 2013).
The global market size of acrylic acid is estimated to
reach 22 550 M$ in 2022 (Grand View Research, 2016).
Due to such promising market forecast, Novozymes and
Cargill announced a joint agreement to develop a plat-
form to produce acrylic acid from biologically produced
3-HP in 2008 (Novozymes, 2008). Nevertheless, up to
date, the process has not been implemented at a large
scale, as further development is still required.
While the revalorization of lignocellulosic products con-
sisting of glucose and xylose has been largely investi-
gated, there are other waste products that can be used
as substrates to produce bulk chemicals. This is the
case of crude glycerol, a side-product obtained during
the enzymatic production of biodiesel. It is a mixture
made of 60– 80% glycerol, 10– 20% methanol and 10–
20% of soap or other unde ﬁned organic matter com-
pounds (Luo et al., 2016). The use of this mixture as

substrate is limited by the fact that methanol is toxic to
many microorganisms. The methylotrophic yeast Pichia
pastoris is a promising microorganism for the revaloriza-
tion of crude glycerol as it can efﬁciently grow using both
glycerol and methanol as carbon sources. Moreover,
P. pastoris can grow at a low pH, and it is reported that
the cost of the downstream process is reduced if the fer-
mentation is performed at a pH below the pKa value of
the acidic product (van Mariset al., 2004). For all these
reasons, in this study, we investigate the production of
3-HP from glycerol in the yeastP. pastoris.
Pichia pastoris is widely used in industrial biotechnol-
ogy as an efﬁcient host for recombinant protein produc-
tion, and it has received increasing interest as a platform
to produce ﬁne and bulk chemicals (Schwarzhanset al.,
2017; Pe~na et al., 2018). Moreover, the efforts of the
P. pastoris community have allowed the implementation
of the necessary tools allowing its use in metabolic engi-
neering research, including up-to-date genetic engineer-
ing tools like the GoldenMOCS (Prielhoferet al., 2017)
and CRISPR-Cas9 (Weninger et al., 2016), metabolic
genome-scale models (GSM; Tom /C18as-Gamisans et al.,
2016), metabolomics and ﬂuxomics protocols (Carnicer
et al., 2012; Ferrer and Albiol, 2014), and a wide knowl-
edge of its behaviour at the bioreactor scale (Looser
et al., 2014; Yang and Zhang, 2018). Another interesting
trait of P. pastoris is that it is a Crabtree-negative yeast.
This is an interesting feature in metabolic engineering
because overﬂow metabolism to undesired by-products,
such as ethanol or glycerol, can be minimized. The full
oxidation of the carbon source leads to a higher energetic
yield than in Crabtree-positive yeasts, like Saccha-
romyces cerevisiae, thus leading to potentially higher pro-
duct yields (Daiet al., 2018; Pe~na et al., 2018). Moreover,
the extracellular concentration of some intermediate
metabolites of the TCA cycle (i.e. malate or citrate) is
lower in P. pastoris than in S. cerevisiae under similar
conditions (Carnicer et al., 2012). This trait simpliﬁes the
downstream processing of the products of interest.
The biological production of 3-HP has been largely
investigated (de Fouch/C19ecour et al., 2018). Several path-
ways have been tested in a number of microorganisms,
including the industrial workhorses Escherichia coli and
S. cerevisiae. Each pathway to produce 3-HP is named
according to its precursor. The route that has obtained the
highest yields and productivities is the coenzyme B12-
dependant glycerol pathway (Raj et al
., 2008; Rathnas-
ingh et al., 2009). However, the implementation of this
route inP. pastorisis currently unfeasible at an industrial
scale due to the high production costs caused by the
requirement of coenzyme B12 addition, which is an
expensive compound (Chenet al., 2014). The 3-HP route
through b-alanine has been investigated inS. cerevisiae
(Borodina et al., 2015) andE. coli(Song et al., 2016) and
the route which uses malonyl-CoA as a precursor has
been implemented in several microorganisms, including
E. coli (Rathnasingh et al., 2012; Liuet al., 2013, 2016),
S. cerevisiae (Chen et al., 2014; Kildegaardet al., 2016)
and Shizosaccharomyces pombe(Suyama et al., 2017).
Using glucose as substrate, the maximum theoretical
yield of theb-alanine to 3-HP pathway is higher than the
route starting from malonyl-CoA, as more ATP is required
for the latter. However, when glycerol is used as a sub-
strate, the maximum theoretical yield for both pathways
equals 1, as there is net ATP production in both cases
(see Supplementary materials Section Data S1). While
the b-alanine pathway would require the expression of 3
heterologous genes (Borodinaet al., 2015) to achieve 3-
HP production inP. pastoris, it is reported that the single
expression of the bifunctional enzyme malonyl-CoA
reductase fromChloroﬂexus aurantiacus(MCR
Ca) triggers
3-HP production in yeast through the malonyl-CoA route
(Chen et al., 2014). This enzyme performs two NADPH-
consuming consecutive reactions sequentially converting
malonyl-CoA to malonate semialdehyde (MSA), and then,
MSA is converted to 3-HP (Fig. 1).
In this study, the production of 3-HP using glycerol as
substrate has been implemented in P. pastoris through
the malonyl-CoA pathway. The expression of mcr
Ca
leads to 3-HP production inP. pastoris. This base strain
has been further modiﬁed using two different strategies:
protein engineering and metabolic engineering. The
independent expression of the two subunits of the
malonyl-CoA reductase has shown higher 3-HP produc-
tion in other microorganisms (Liuet al., 2013). This strat-
egy has been further tested in P. pastoris, yielding a
substantial improvement compared to the initial strain.
Further modi ﬁcations have been implemented to
increase the ﬂuxes producing the substrates of the
malonyl-CoA pathway to 3-HP (NADPH and malonyl-
CoA). The strain producing the highest 3-HP titre has
been characterized in a fed-batch culture using glycerol
as a substrate. Overall, the potential ofP. pastoris as a
promising host for 3-HP production from this renewable
feedstock was demonstrated for theﬁrst time.
Results and discussion
Expression ofmcr
Ca in P. pastorisleads to 3-HP
production
In the present work, we expressed mcrCa gene in
P. pastoris under the control of the constitutive and
strong GAP promoter (Waterhamet al., 1997). Compar-
ison of the resulting strain, PpHP1, to the reference
strain (X-33) in triplicate shakeﬂasks on buffered mini-
mal glycerol (BMG) medium showed that the sole
expression of mcr
Ca resulted in 3-HP production, while it
did not affect cell growth (the µmax of the control and

PpHP1 strains was the same within the precision range,
0.24 /C60.01 h/C01 and 0.24 /C60.01 h/C01 respectively).
Moreover, no by-products were detected in any of the
two strains (Fig. S2).
Notably, the PpHP1 strain produced 0.19/C60.03 g l/C01
of 3-HP after 24 h of cultivation. Such 3-HP titre is consid-
erably higher than those achieved inS. pombe (Takayama
et al., 2018) andS. cerevisiae(Chen et al., 2014) harbour-
ing a similar genetic construction and using glucose as a
substrate (0.016 g l
/C01 and 0.093 g l/C01 respectively). Fur-
thermore, the C-yield (Cmol of 3-HP per Cmol of substrate,
i.e. glycerol or glucose) for the PpHP1 strain
(0.015 /C60.002 Cmol Cmol
/C01) was remarkably higher
than the one observed in other yeasts (0.0003 Cmol
Cmol/C01 in S. pombe, and 0.0048 Cmol Cmol /C01 in
S. cerevisiae). Remarkably, the speciﬁc activity of MCR in
PpHP1 was 0.30 /C60.06 U mg/C01 of protein, which is
remarkably higher than the speciﬁc activity reported in
S. cerevisiae(0.008 U mg/C01; Chenet al., 2014). The com-
bined effect of the strength of theP. pastorisGAP promoter
and the fact that glycerol is more reduced than glucose,
which leads to net production of ATP from the substrate,
instead of net ATP consumption (Fig. S1), points at
P. pastorisas a promising cell factory for the bioproduction
of 3-HP from glycerol.
Setting up the screening conditions for 3-HP producing
P. pastoris clones
We established two independent analytical methods
based on NMR and HPLC-MS for 3-HP quantiﬁcation,
which were cross-validated. The results using the HPLC-
MS method diverge from those obtained using NMR
when glycerol is still present in the medium (Fig. S3).
This is explained by the matrix effect caused by the glyc-
erol co-eluting with 3-HP from the column, which affects

the ionization efﬁciency at the ionization source. How-
ever, once the glycerol is fully consumed, the HPLC-MS
and the NMR methods yielded statistically identical
results when measuring theﬁnal 3-HP concentrations in
the PpHP1 shakeﬂask cultures described in Section 3.1
(i.e. 3-HP ﬁnal concentrations of 0.18/C60.02 g l
/C01 of 3-
HP and 0.19/C60.02 g l/C01 of 3-HP respectively).
Consumption of 3-HP has been reported in several
microorganisms (Zhou et al., 2014; Yanget al., 2017). In
order to evaluate whether the PpHP1 strain was able to
assimilate this compound, this strain was grown in tripli-
cate shake ﬂasks using BMG, BMG medium supple-
mented with 2.5 g l
/C01 of 3-HP (BMG3HP) or buffered
minimal medium supplemented with 2.5 g l/C01 of 3-HP as
a sole carbon source (BM3HP). Samples were collected
after 24, 48 and 72 h. The 3-HP concentration remained
constant throughout the 72 h in the cultures grown on
BM3HP (no growth was observed). After 24 h, glycerol
was exhausted from the BMG and BMG3HP, while the
concentration of 3-HP remained unaltered between the
24 and the 72 h (data not shown), thereby indicating that
P. pastoris does not assimilate 3-HP as C-source within
the experimental time frame tested.
Considering these results, screening of the 3-HP-
producing strains was performed taking end-point sam-
ples after 48 h of incubation to ensure full consumption
of glycerol, followed by 3-HP quanti ﬁcation using the
HPLC-MS method.
Improvement of 3-HP production by MCR enzyme
engineering
Recent studies have shown the positive effect of dissect-
ing the MCR enzyme in the two subunits catalysing each
of the two reactions converting malonyl-CoA into 3-HP
(Liu et al., 2013). The presence of three point mutations
causing three amino acidic changes (N940V, K1106R
and S1114R) had an additional positive impact on 3-HP
production in E. coli (Liu et al., 2016). The same out-
come has been demonstrated in S. pombe, where the
expression of the N-terminal and the improved version of
the C-terminal domain of MCR using two independent
expression cassettes led to a 30-fold improvement in the
ﬁnal 3-HP titre, compared to the starting strain express-
ing the original sequence of MCR
Ca (Takayama et al.,
2018). Therefore, we introduced two expression cas-
settes into P. pastoris allowing the independent expres-
sion of the coding DNA sequences for the N-terminal
and the C-terminal domains of MCR (including the wild-
type and the mutated version of the latter) under the
control of the GAP promoter.
As shown in Fig. 2, the dissection of MCR (strain
PpHP2) had a positive impact on 3-HP production, trig-
gering a 12.5-fold increase in 3-HP production
(1.63 /C60.09 g l
/C01 3-HP). Nevertheless, the introduction
of the 3 point mutations in the C-terminal domain (strain
PpHP3) resulted in a non-producing strain. Similarly, the
introduction of these 3 point mutations to a non-
dissected version of MCR resulted in a non-producingP.
pastoris strain (data not shown). These point mutations
are far from the reactive site and the NADPH binding
site of the enzyme. It remains poorly understood how
distant mutations may affect catalytic properties. More-
over, as the structure of the C-terminal domain of MCR
from C. aurantiacus is not available, the exact effect of
the point mutations on the protein conformational stabil-
ity/quality is hard to predict, particularly when the protein
is synthetized at high rates (i.e. using a strong

deviation, the solid line indicates the SE and the circles show the average result for each clone. The solid circle of a PpHP5 clone shows the
result of a clone which was discarded for the calculations, as it had a different behaviour from the rest of the clones of that strain. For PpHP6,
only 3 clones could be screened. Despite that more than 50 transformants of PpHP6 from 2 independent transformations were checked using
colony PCR, only 3 clones resulted positive.

promoter). Notably, the 12.5-fold improvement obtained
by dissecting MCR is in the same range as those
reported inS. pombe and E. coli.
Metabolic engineering ofP. pastoris to improve 3-HP
production
Metabolic engineering for 3-HP production through the
malonyl-CoA pathway was aimed at increasing the avail-
ability of the two precursors of this route, namely
NADPH and malonyl-CoA. To do so, the ACC
Yl and
cPOS5Sc genes have been heterologously expressed in
the PpHP2 strain. The reactions catalysed by the
enzymes encoded by these two genes are depicted in
Fig. 1. Acc produces malonyl-CoA from acetyl-CoA,
which is the precursor of the central carbon metabolism
for 3-HP production. The overexpression of such
enzyme has already been performed inE. coli(Rathnas-
ingh et al., 2012),S. cerevisiae(Chen et al., 2014; Kilde-
gaard et al., 2016) and S. pombe (Takayama et al.,
2018) to increase the production of 3-HP. The enzyme
cPos5 produces NADPH by means of NADH and ATP
consumption, and the overexpression of its gene leads
to an increase in the NADPH/NADP ratio (Tom /C18as-
Gamisans et al., 2020).
As shown in Fig. 2, the overexpression of Acc or
cPos5 in the strain PpHP2 – resulting in the strains
PpHP4 and PpHP5, respectively – led to a small
increase in 3-HP production. Still, such increases were
not statistically signi ﬁcant compared to the parental
strain PpHP2 (P-values of 0.27 and 0.15 respectively).
However, when both genes were overexpressed at the
same time (PpHP6), a signiﬁcant increase in theﬁnal 3-
HP concentration was observed (P = 0.015).
The PpHP6 strain produced 1.81 /C60.04 g l
/C01 of 3-
HP, which represents a 14-fold increase compared to
the starting strain (PpHP1), and a 12% increase com-
pared to PpHP2. The C-yield for PpHP6 was
0.146 /C60.003 Cmol Cmol
/C01.
Similar strategies in other microorganisms resulted in
similar outcomes. For example, in E. coli, the overex-
pression of either ACC or PntAB (a transhydrogenase
encoding gene) led to a twofold increase, while the co-
expression of both genes led to a threefold increase
(Rathnasingh et al., 2012). It is also worth noticing that
in S. pombe, enzyme engineering and expression level
adjustment of MCR led to a 30-fold increase in 3-HP
titres, while increasing the availability of acetyl-CoA and
CoA in this strain resulted in a twofold increase. Alto-
gether, these results point at theﬂux from malonyl-CoA
to 3-HP as the main limiting factor for 3-HP production.
Further metabolic studies should corroborate this hypoth-
esis. Indeed, the increase of the number of copies of the
mcr gene has already been demonstrated to have a
positive effect in 3-HP production in both S. cerevisiae
(Kildegaard et al ., 2016) and S. pombe (Takayama
et al., 2018).
Overall, the product yield obtained by the strain PpHP6
during the screening phase (0.146/C60.003 Cmol Cmol
/C01)
is signiﬁcantly higher (around 1.8-fold) to the highest yield
observed in yeast under comparable conditions (deep-well
plate culture using deﬁned medium), i.e. using theS. cere-
visiae strain 3HP-M11 producing 3-HP through the malonyl-
CoA pathway, with a yield on glucose of 0.080 /C60.0
08 Cmol Cmol
/C01 (calculated from data given by Kildegaard
et al., 2016).
Production of 3-HP in a fed-batch culture
The strain PpHP6 was further cultivated in a controlled
fed-batch culture. First, a batch experiment was per-
formed in order to determine the µ
max of PpHP6, and
also the initial biomass concentration (X0) and the bio-
mass to substrate yield (YX/S), which are the parameters
required to set the exponential feeding rate (see Sec-
tion 2.4). The µ
max was 0.19 /C60.1 h/C01, the X0 was
18.6 /C60 . 2gl/C01 and theYX/S 0.47 /C60.01 g g/C01.
After the initial batch phase (22 h), the exponential
feeding rate was set to maintain a growth rate equal to
0.1 h
/C01 (approximately 50% of the µmax; Fig. 3A). After
44 h of cultivation (22 h of feeding phase), glycerol
accumulation was observed, and the feeding pump was
stopped. Thereafter, the fermentation was terminated
after 45.5 h of cultivation, when the pO
2 increased, indi-
cating that all the glycerol had been consumed. Overall,
195 g l
/C01 of glycerol was added into the reactor, and
24.75 /C60.54 g l/C01 of 3-HP was produced. The only by-
product detected by NMR was arabitol in the late stages
of the batch and the fed-batch phases.
As already inferred from the evolution of physiological
growth parameters over time, growth rate was not main-
tained during the whole feeding phase. Furthermore, the
decrease in the growth rate was accompanied with the
accumulation of glycerol and the production of arabitol
towards the end of the cultivation. These results differ from
previous observations of P. pastoris producing heterolo-
gous proteins in fed-batch cultures operated under analo-
gous conditions (i.e. using a pre-programmed exponential
substrate feeding strategy for controlled speciﬁc growth
rate at 0.1 h
/C01), where theµ remained constant through-
out the feeding phase and no arabitol accumulation was
detected, achieving up to 100 g l
/C01 of dry cell biomass
(Garcia-Ortega et al., 2013). The spline curvesﬁtted to
the evolution of the growth rate (µ), product yield (YP/S),
qP3-HP and qPArabitol throughout the cultivation further
reveal that the decrease in the growth rate coincides with
the onset of glycerol accumulation and arabitol by-product
excretion (Fig. 3B). Conversely, product yield and qP

followed the opposite trend, i.e. theYP/S is reduced from
0.134 /C60.010 Cmol Cmol/C01 at the ﬁrst part of the feed-
ing phase to yields close to 0.1 Cmol Cmol/C01 coinciding
with the highest qPArabitol values. These results show how
during the beginning of the feeding phase the C-yield was
close to the one obtained in the screening phase
(0.146 /C60.003 Cmol Cmol
/C01), even though the average
yield of the overall fed-batch culture was lower
(0.130 /C60.003 Cmol Cmol
/C01 and 0.127/C60.003 g g/C01).
A possible explanation for the observed trends is the
increase in the 3-HP concentration. Accumulation of 3-HP
in the fermentation broth has been reported to be toxic for
other microorganisms likeE. coliand S. cerevisiae. Such
toxicity may be triggered by the conversion of 3-HP into
3-hydroxypropanaldehyde (reuterin), which causes oxida-
tive stress to the cells through its interaction with reduced
glutathione (Schaefer et al., 2010; Kildegaard et al.,
2014). The sequestration of glutathione leads to a
decrease in the maximal growth rate ofS. cerevisiae at
high 3-HP concentrations (Kildegaardet al., 2014).
Another plausible explanation of the decrease in theµ
at the ﬁnal stage of the culture may be the increase in
the ATP expenditure for maintenance at high extracellu-
lar concentrations of weak organic acid, i.e. 3-HP. Proto-
nated acid molecules may enter the cytoplasm by
diffusion and later on dissociate, leading to an ATP cost
for the re-secretion of the organic acid and the restora-
tion of the intracellular pH. The expression of a 3-HP
exporter in E. coli has proven to be bene ﬁcial, as it
reduces stress caused by the intracellular dissociation of
3-HP (Nguyen-Vo et al., 2020). Moreover, higher extra-
cellular concentrations of 3-HP have a direct impact on
the thermodynamics of its secretion, leading to an
increase in ATP expenses for 3-HP export (van Maris
et al., 2004). All these phenomena would ultimately
impact on the Y
X/S in P. pastoris, explaining the
decrease in the growth rate and the accumulation of
glycerol at the later stage of the fed-batch culture.
Moreover, we observe the production of arabitol at the
end of the batch and the fed-batch phases (Fig. 3A).
Arabitol production in P. pastoris has been related to
stress conditions caused by the unfolded protein
response (UPR; Tredwell et al., 2017), high osmolarity
(Dragosits et al., 2010) or hypoxic conditions, where

arabitol production has been proposed to be used as a
redox sink (Baumann et al., 2010). Additionally, arabitol
by-product formation has been observed in lactic acid-
producing recombinant P. pastoris growing in batch cul-
tures using glycerol as carbon source (Melo et al .,
2020). Therefore, the presence of arabitol points to a
redox imbalance, either caused by 3-HP-derived toxicity
effects, or by overexpression of cPos5. Further metabo-
lomic and ﬂuoxmic studies will help elucidating the
cause.
Altogether, these results suggest that the pre-
established bioreactor fed-batch cultivation protocols for
heterologous protein production in P. pastoris are not
necessarily optimal for the production of weak acids
such as 3-HP, as its accumulation in the extracellular
space and/or the toxic effect at high concentrations may
lead to physiological changes negatively impacting on
the bioprocess parameters such as the µ
max or YX/S.
Moreover, the current cultivation protocol led to the pro-
duction of arabitol as a by-product at the end of the fed-
batch process, which caused a signiﬁcant decrease in
the product yield. Deletion of the arabitol dehydrogenase
(ArDH) gene in a lactic acid-producing strain reduced
arabitol production, resulting in a 20% increase in pro-
duct titres (Meloet al., 2020).
The tolerance to 3-HP should also be addressed in
order to increase further the product yield. To this end,
both adaptive laboratory evolution (ALE) experiments
and rational engineering strategies have proven suc-
cessful to increase 3-HP tolerance in other yeast and
could be therefore transferred toP. pastoris. Speciﬁcally,
ALE experiments led to the conclusion that overexpres-
sion of the S-(hydroxymethyl)glutathione dehydrogenase
gene (SFA1)i n S. cerevisiae restored growth at 50 g l
/C01
of 3-HP (Kildegaard et al., 2014). Expression of two
mutated versions ofSFA1 under the control of the native
SFA1 promoter was also able to restore cell growth at
50 g l/C01 of 3-HP. The SFA1 residues which were
mutated in S. cerevisiae are conserved in the homolo-
gous P. pastoris gene (PAS_chr3_1028). Therefore, a
similar approach to avoid 3-HP toxicity could be tested
in P. pastoris.
The overall productivity of the fed-batch culture was
0.54 /C60.01 g l
/C01 h/C01. To our knowledge, this is the
highest 3-HP productivity reported in yeast (de
Fouch/C19ecour et al., 2018; Lis et al., 2019), and it is
almost identical to the highest productivity reported using
the malonyl-CoA pathway, which was 0.56 g l
/C01 h/C01 and
it was reported inE. coli (Liu et al., 2016). Such promis-
ing results can be attributed to the combination of three
main factors: (i) the high speciﬁc MCR activity due to the
strength of pGAP, extensively proven for heterologous
protein production in P. pastoris; (ii) the use of glycerol
as a substrate, which delivers more ATP than glucose
under aerobic conditions, leading to higher biomass and
product yields compared to the use of glucose; and (iii)
the use of glycerol as substrate allows for higher growth
rates during the feeding phase compared to typical fed-
batch cultivations of Crabtree-positive yeasts growing on
glucose as substrate, thereby supporting higher volumet-
ric productivities, while minimizing by-product formation.
Conclusions
In this study, we successfully introduced the malonyl-
CoA to 3-HP pathway inP. pastorisfor 3-HP production.
The use of pGAP, a strong constitutive promoter, to
drive expression of the biosyntheticmcr gene, combined
with the use of glycerol as carbon source, proved to be
key to obtain higher space-time yields than in other
yeasts. The subsequent combination of protein and
metabolic engineering strategies performed in this study
have led to a 14-fold increase in the 3-HP yield. More-
over, a controlled fed-batch strategy has shown the abil-
ity of P. pastoris to produce up to 24.75 g l
/C01 of 3-HP in
45.5 h, achieving an overall yield of 0.13 Cmol Cmol/C01,
and a productivity of 0.54 g l/C01 h/C01. Overall, we bench-
marked P. pastoris for 3-HP production, demonstrating
the potential of this cell factory for platform chemicals
bioproduction. In addition, this study serves as a basis
for further optimization of this platform through integrated
systems metabolic engineering and bioprocess engineer-
ing strategies, which are paramount to reach economi-
cally attractive metrics for 3-HP production from crude
glycerol inP. pastoris.
Experimental procedures
Strain construction
A series of strains derived from the parental strain P.
pastoris X-33 (Invitrogen-Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc, Wal-
tham, MA, USA) was generated. Plasmids and strains
used during this study are listed in Table 1. Three
heterologous genes were expressed in P. pastoris ,
encoding for: a bifunctional malonyl-CoA reductase
from Chloroﬂexus aurantiacus (mcr
Ca, Uniprot:
Q6QQP7_CHLAU), an acetyl-CoA carboxylase fromYar-
rowia lipolytica (ACCYl, Uniprot: YALI0_C11407) and a
cytosolic NADH kinase from S. cerevisiae (cPOSSc;
Tom/C18as-Gamisans et al., 2020). The expression of all the
heterologous genes was controlled by the strong and
constitutive GAP promoter. A detailed description of the
molecular cloning protocols used to generate the plas-
mids for this study is available in the Supplementary
Materials Section (Data S1).
Electrocompetent P. pastoris cells were prepared as
described elsewhere (Sears et al ., 1998). Plasmids
derived from pBIZi_pGAP (Bioingenium SL, Barcelona,

Spain) were linearized using AvrII (New England Bio-
labs, Ipswich, MA, USA), while the ones derived from
BB3eH were linearized using PmeI (New England Bio-
labs). Transformation was performed using 100 ng of
puriﬁed linear DNA according to a previously described
protocol (Searset al., 1998).
Recombinant P. pastoris strains were selected on
YPD agar plates (1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, 2%
dextrose, 15 g l
/C01 agar) supplemented with the appropri-
ate antibiotic (100 µgm l/C01 zeocine or hygromycin
200 µgm l/C01; InvivoGen, CA, USA). When the plates
contained both zeocine and hygromycin, the concentra-
tion of each antibiotic was reduced by half (50µgm l
/C01
zeocine and hygromycin 100µgm l/C01).
Shake ﬂask cultures
Cultures wereﬁrst grown overnight on 5 ml of YPG med-
ium (1% yeast extract, 2% peptone and 1% v/v glycerol)
supplemented with the appropriate antibiotic in 50-ml
Falcon tubes, at 30°C, and 180 rpm. The overnight cul-
tures were then diluted to an optical density at 600 nm
(OD600) of 0.5 on 5 ml of YPG and grown for 8 h at the
same cultivation conditions. Afterwards, these cultures
were used to inoculate a 500-ml bafﬂed shake ﬂask con-
taining 50 ml of buffered minimal glycerol medium
(BMG; 100 mM potassium phosphate buffer pH 6,
1.34% yeast nitrogen base (YNB), 0.4 mg l
/C01 biotin and
1% v/v glycerol) at a starting OD600 of 0.05. The shake
ﬂask cultures were grown at 30°C and 180 rpm in an
incubator shaker Multitron Standard (Infors HT, Bottmin-
gen, Switzerland) with a 2.5 cm orbit.
Screening in deep-well plates
Pichia pastoris strains were inoculated from cryovials
into a 24 deep-well plates containing YPG medium sup-
plemented with the appropriate antibiotic. Cultures were
placed on a platform with a slope of 20° in an incubator
shaker Multitron Standard with 25 mm orbit and grown
overnight at 28 °C and 220 rpm. Afterwards, 50 µlo f
overnight cultures was used to inoculate a 24 deep-well
plate containing 2 ml of BMG medium. If not stated
otherwise, six clones of each strain were tested in
Table 1. List of plasmids andP. pastorisstrains used during this study.

triplicates. The cultures were grown for 48 h at the same
conditions.
Enzymatic assay
Pichia pastoris X-33 and P. pastoris PpHP1 cells were
grown overnight on YPG medium supplemented with
zeocine when appropriate. The grown cultures were
used to inoculate a 100-ml shakeﬂask containing 25 ml
of fresh BMG medium at an initial OD
600 of 0.1. When
the cells reached an OD600 of about 2, 5 ml of each cul-
ture were centrifuged at 6000 g. The pellets were
washed twice with ice-cold PBS buffer and resuspended
in 1 ml of breaking buffer (50 mM HEPES, 150 mM KCl,
1 mM DTT, 1 mM EDTA, pH 7.5, Halt Protease Inhibitor
Cocktail (Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc)). Resuspended cells
were then lysed using glass beads applying 5 cycles of
1 min of vortexing followed by 2 min of incubation on
ice. Cell lysates were centrifuged at 16 000g and 4°C
for 20 min. The supernatant (soluble fraction) was trans-
ferred to a new tube, and the amount of protein in the
cell extract was quantiﬁed using the Bradford method
(Pierce
TM
Coomassie Plus, Thermo Fisher Scienti ﬁc).
The MCR speciﬁc activity was quantiﬁed as previously
reported (Chen et al., 2014). As MCR is a bifunctional
enzyme consuming 2 NAPDH molecules to convert
malonyl-CoA into 3-HP, one unit of enzyme activity was
deﬁned as 2µmol NADPH consumed per minute.
Bioreactor cultivation
For the bioreactor cultivations, the batch medium con-
sisted of 40 g l /C01 glycerol, 1.8 g l /C01 citric acid,
0.02 g l/C01 CaCl2 /C12H 2O, 12.6 g l /C01 (NH4)2HPO4,
0.5 g l/C01 MgSO4 /C17H 2O, 0.9 g l/C01 KCl, 50 µl antifoam
Glanapon 2000 kz (Bussetti and Co GmbH, Vienna,
Austria), 4 /C110
/C05 gl /C01 biotin and 4.6 ml l/C01 of PTM1
trace salts (Maureret al., 2006). The pH of the medium
was set to 5 using 5 M HCl. The feeding medium com-
position was 400 g l
/C01 glycerol, 10 g l/C01 KCl, 6.45 g l/C01
MgSO4 /C17H 2O, 0.35 g l/C01 CaCl2 /C12H 2O, 0.2 ml l/C01
antifoam Glanapon 2000 kz, 0.3 mg l /C01 biotin and
15 ml l/C01 PTM1 trace salts. For the batch and the feed-
ing media, all components except the biotin and the
trace salts were mixed and autoclaved. Biotin and trace
salts were ﬁlter-sterilized and added to the mixture once
the medium had cooled down.
Fed-batch cultures were performed in duplicate in a 5-
l Biostat B Bioreactor (Sartorius Stedim, Goettingen,
Germany). The pH was maintained at 5 using ammonia
15% (v/v). The temperature was set to 28°C, and air
was added into the reactor at an aeration rate of 1 vvm
(2 l min
/C01). The agitation was gradually increased from
600 to 1200 rpm to maintain a pO2 above 25%. When
increasing the agitation was insufﬁcient to maintain the
pO2 above the set point, the agitation was set to
1200 rpm and pure oxygen was mixed with air at the air
inlet of the bioreactor to maintain a pO
2 above 25%,
while maintaining an aeration rate of 2 l min/C01.
The batch phase was performed with a starting vol-
ume equal to 2 l, and the reactor was inoculated at a
starting OD
600 equal to 1. The feeding phase started
after a sudden increase in the pO2 indicating that all the
glycerol from the batch phase had been consumed. A
pre-set exponential feeding rate was used when adding
the feeding medium into the reactor. Such exponential
feeding rate was calculated according to previous litera-
ture (Cos et al., 2005), and it aimed to maintain pseudo-
steady state conditions at a constant growth rate of
0.1 h
/C01 at C-limiting conditions. The working volume of
the reactor was calculated as described elsewhere
(Garcia-Ortega et al., 2013). To calculate the exponential
feeding rate, the biomass concentration at the end of the
batch phase (X
0) and the biomass to substrate yield
(YX/S) were used.
Analytical methods and data processing
The analytical and biological replicates were averaged,
and the standard error (SE) for each measurement was
calculated considering the number of biological repli-
cates (number of independent samples).
The splines ﬁtting the µ, the q-rates and the product
yield during the feeding phase of the fed-batch culture
were performed using Matlab 2019 (Mathworks, Natick,
MA, USA). The ﬁt function was used together with the
additional options: ‘smoothingspline’ and ‘Smooth-
ingParam’ = 0.5.
The OD
600 measurements of the shakeﬂask and the
bioreactor cultures were performed using a Lange DR
3900 spectrophotometer (Hach, Loveland, CO, USA).
To quantify the metabolites, the culture samples were
ﬁrst centrifuged at 12 000g and 4°C and then ﬁltered
using a 0.45-µm syringe ﬁlter of type HAWP (Millipore,
Temecula, CA, USA). Glycerol and arabitol were quanti-
ﬁed using an HPLC Dionex Ultimate3000 (Dionex –
Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc) coupled to a UV detector at
210 nm and an RI detector (Dionex– Thermo Fisher Sci-
entiﬁc). The compounds were separated with an ionic
exchange column ICSep ICE-COREGEL 87H3 (Transge-
nomic, Omaha, NE, USA) using 6 mM sulphuric acid as
mobile phase at aﬂow rate of 0.6 ml min
/C01. As 3-HP and
glycerol elute the column at the same time, the 3-HP was
quantiﬁed using two different methods: HPLC-MS and
nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. Stan-
dard samples for calibration were prepared using 3-
hydroxypropionic acid sodium salt from Santa Cruz
Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA, USA).

For the HPLC-MS method, we used a Prominence
HPLC (Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan) coupled to a single
quadrupole Shimadzu-2010A mass spectrometry detec-
tor using electrospray ionization. The metabolites of the
supernatant were separated using an ICSep 87H USP
L17 column (Transgenomic, NE, USA) and 16 mM for-
mic acid as mobile phase at a ﬂow rate of
0.15 ml min
/C01.2 µl samples were injected into the col-
umn, and the MS analyser was set to 89m/z for nega-
tively charged molecules, which corresponds to them/z
ratio for unprotonated 3-HP. The detector settings were
as follows: curved desolvation line (CDL) temperature at
200°C, heat block temperature at 200°C, voltage of the
detector at 1.5 kV, nebulizing gas (nitrogen) ﬂow at
1.5 l min
/C01 and drying gas (nitrogen)ﬂow at 10 l min/C01.
Each sample was analysed in duplicate.
For the NMR method, a Bruker AVANCE 600 spec-
trometer (600.13 MHz frequency for1H) equipped with a
5 mm TBI probehead and an autosampler (Bruker BioS-
pin, Rheinstetten, Germany) was utilized. The probe
temperature was maintained at 300.0 K for all experi-
ments. Once centrifuged andﬁltered, 300 µl of each cul-
ture aliquot was mixed with 300 µlo faD
2O stock
solution containing an internal standard (3-(trimethylsilyl)-
[2,2,3,3-
2H4]-propionic acid sodium salt (TSP), 11.1 mM)
and transferred to the NMR tube. All samples were anal-
ysed conducting standard quantitative 1D
1H NMR
experiments with presaturation of the residual water sig-
nal. Data were collected into 32k data points during an
acquisition time of 1.7 s using a recycle delay of 15 s.
Spectra were recorded in the time domain as interfero-
grams (FID) across a spectral width of 9,615 Hz and as
the sum of 128 transients. FIDs were automatically Four-
ier transformed (FT) and the spectra were phased, and
baseline corrected. TSP was used as internal reference
(d(
1H) andd(13C) at 0.00 ppm).
The glycerol concentration obtained from the IR spec-
tra of the HPLC analysis was corrected accounting for
the 3-HP interference. The area at the IR detector corre-
sponding to the amount of 3-HP quanti ﬁed using the
HPLC-MS or the NMR analyses was calculated and sub-
tracted from the total IR area.
