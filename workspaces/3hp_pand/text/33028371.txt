Abstract
Background: Propionic acidemia (PA) is a serious metabolic disorder, and different approaches have been applied
to its prenatal diagnosis. To evaluate the reliability and validity of a biochemical strategy in the prenatal diagnosis of
PA, we conducted a retrospective study of our 11-year experiences at a single center.
Methods: We accumulated data from 78 pregnancies from 58 families referred to our center and provided prenatal
diagnosis by directed genetic analysis and/or metabolite measurement using tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS)
and gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) of amniotic fluid (AF) samples.
Results: Sixty-five unaffected fetuses (83.33%) and 13 affected fetuses (16.67%) were confirmed in our study. The
characteristic metabolites including propionylcarnitine (C3) level, C3/acetylcarnitine (C2) ratio and 2-methylcitric acid
(2MCA) level in unaffected and affected groups showed significant differences ( P < 0.0001), while the level of 3-
hydroxypropionic acid (3HPA) showed no significant difference between the two groups ( P > 0.05).Of the 78
pregnancies, 24 fetuses were found to have either one causative pathogenic variant or were without genetic
information in the proband. Three of these fetuses had elevated AF levels of C3, C3/C2 ratio, and 2MCA and, thus,
were determined to be affected, while the remaining fetuses were determined to be unaffected based on a normal
AF metabolite profile. Our genetic and biochemical results were highly consistent with postnatal follow-up results
on all unaffected fetuses.
Conclusions: We conclude that a biochemical approach can serve as a fast and convenient prenatal diagnostic
method for pregnancies at an increased risk for PA, which could be used in conjunction with genetic testing for
precise prenatal diagnosis of this disorder. In our analysis, the characteristic metabolites C3 level, C3/C2 ratio, and
2MCA level in AF supernatant were dependable biochemical markers for diagnosis, of which the C3/C2 ratio
appears to be the most reliable biochemical marker for the prenatal diagnosis of PA.

Introduction
Propionic acidemia (PA, OMIM #606054) is an organic acid-
emia attributed to the deficiency of propionyl-CoA carboxyl-
ase (PCC, EC6.4.1.3). PCC, which catalyzes the carboxylation
of propionyl-CoA to D-methylmalonyl-CoA [1, 2], is a 750
kDa heterododecamer composed of 6 propionyl-CoA carb-
oxylase alpha (PCCA) and 6 propionyl-CoA carboxylase beta
subunits (PCCB) [3, 4]. Propionyl-CoA has a broad influence
on metabolism, including impacts on the urea cycle, the cit-
ric acid cycle, and the glycine cleavage system [ 5]. PA has an
autosomal recessive mode of inheritance and results from bi-
allelic variants in PCCA or PCCB that impair enzyme func-
tion [6].
Although there are mild, late-onset forms of PA, most
patients have a neonatal presentation with life-threatening
metabolic decompensations [ 1, 7, 8]. Reliable methods for
prenatal diagnosis are thus essential for neonatal manage-
ment of PA. Different approaches have been applied to
prenatal diagnosis of PA including direct propionyl-CoA
carboxylase activity assay in chorionic villi (CV) [ 9, 10],
quantification of the characteristic metabolites including
acylcarnitines, propionic acids and methylcitric acids in
cell-free amniotic fluid (AF) [ 11–14]; and direct patho-
genic variant analysis of PCCA or PCCB genes in amnio-
cytes. However, each approach has its limitations.
Enzymatic assay can be time-consuming or unavailable,
and activity can be influenced by the quality of the CV
sample. Direct genetic analysis of amniocytes is dependent
upon the availability of known familial mutations and
diagnostic metabolites for PA in the AF can degrade over
1–2 weeks. Therefore, the use of two or more methods
simultaneously may be needed to achieve the definitive
prenatal diagnosis [ 15].
In the present study, we provide a retrospective review
of our experience with prenatal diagnosis of PA over the
last 11 years. Overall, we have investigated 78 pregnan-
cies in 58 unrelated families by molecular genetics ana-
lysis of amniocytes and/or metabolite analysis in AF
supernatants.

seeking prenatal diagnosis from April 2008 to December
2019. The probands were diagnosed based on clinical
symptoms, biochemical results and genetic testing of the
PCCA or PCCB genes. Biochemical results included ele-
vated blood levels of propionylcarnitine (C3) and propio-
nylcarnitine to acetylcarnitine ratio (C3/C2) and elevated
urine levels of 3-hydroxypropionic acid (3HPA) and 2-
methylcitric acid (2MCA). The mutation spectrum of the
PCCA and PCCB genes in this study is shown in Tables 1
and 2 and Table S2 [16–23]. Written informed consent
was obtained from all participants, and our study was ap-
proved by the Ethics Committee of Xinhua Hospital.
Amniocyte samples
Thirty milliliters of AF were obtained from each preg-
nant woman by amniocentesis performed between 16
and 20 weeks of gestation. Ten mL was used for DNA
extraction and the remaining supernatant from this ali-
quot was used for the metabolite analysis. Twenty mL of
AF was cultured for karyotype analysis, with the cultured
amniocytes also available as a back-up.
Metabolite analysis of amniotic fluid
The levels of C3, C2 and C3/C2 were measured by MS/
MS (Applied Biosystems, API 2000) using 3 μLo fA F
supernatant and the levels automatically calculated based
on the assigned values for internal standards using Che-
moView v1.2 software [ 24]. The organic acids levels in 2
mL of uncultured AF supernatant samples were mea-
sured using GC-MS (QP2010, Shimadzu Limited, Kyoto,
Japan) as described by Hasegawa et al. [ 25].
Gene variant analysis
DNA from AF was extracted with a QIAamp DNA
Blood Mini Kit (Qiagen Inc., Valencia, CA). We then
conducted polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplifica-
tion and direct Sanger sequencing. Reference sequences
PCCA (NM_000282.3) and PCCB (NM_000532.3) were
obtained from the NCBI GENEBANK.
Linkage analysis
We collected 3 –4 mL of peripheral blood from all PA
pedigree members to perform a linkage analysis and to
exclude maternal-cell contamination. Six short tandem
repeats (STR) were selected according to informative
STR loci in our laboratory, and we subsequently con-
ducted the linkage analysis (STR and primers are listed
in Table S1).
Statistical analysis
Reference ranges for the four analytes evaluated in this
study were determined by a nonparametric approach,
identifying the 99.5th percentiles of the cumulative levels
from unaffected fetuses as the upper reference limit (C3:
<5 μmol/L; C3/C2: < 0.3; Propionic acid: < 35 mmol/mol
Cr; 2MCA: < 0.5 mmol/mol Cr). Standard scatter plots
were generated for level of C3, C3/C2 ratio, 2MCA and
3HPA in AFs. Wilcoxon rank sum tests with exact P
values were performed to compare the C3, C3/C2 ratio,
2MCA and 3HPA level in affected and unaffected
groups. P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.
Statistical analysis was performed using Prism 8 (Graph-
Pad Software Inc.).
Results
We summarized the genetic and biochemical results of
78 prenatal samples from 58 families in our study
(Table 1, Table S2), including 65 unaffected (83.33%)
and 13 affected fetuses (16.67%). We found no sample
with maternal contamination and uncovered no

symptoms of PA upon postnatal follow-up in any of the
65 unaffected fetuses. For the 13 affected fetuses, how-
ever, the parents chose to terminate their pregnancies.
Biochemical analyses of amniotic fluid metabolites
Of 78 fetuses, 13 fetuses were determined to be affected
based on metabolite tests (Table 1). The median (range)
level of C3, C3/C2 ratio and 2MCA in affected samples
were 11.45 μmol/L (5.07 –43.69), 1.00 (0.62 –2.11) and
1.19 mmol/mol Cr (0.61 –4.58), respectively (Fig. 1). All
of the individual levels of these three analytes in 13 fe-
tuses was higher than that of defined reference ranges
for each metabolite. However, the 3HPA levels in all af-
fected samples, ranging from 0 to 25.18 mmol/mol Cr
which were in the normal range.
Sixty-five AF supernatant samples were determined to
be unaffected according to our metabolite test results
(Table S2). The median (range) level of C3, C3/C2 ratio,
and propionic acid, and 2MCA in 65 unaffected samples
were 1.56 μmol/L (0.61 –5.87), 0.14 (0.05 –0.28), 2.31
mmol/mol Cr (0 –80.65), and 0 mmol/mol Cr (0 –0.52),
respectively (Fig. 1). There were seven unaffected fetuses
that had a slightly increased level of one of the four bio-
chemical markers studied (Table 2). We noted two fe-
tuses (F008 and F053) with slightly higher levels of C3,
while the C3/C2 ratio and levels of 3HPA and 2MCA
were in the normal range. Four fetuses (F014, F042,
F043, and F044) were found to possess higher levels of
propionic acid, but had a normal C3/C2 ratio and C3
and 2MCA levels. We found one fetus (F020) with a
slightly higher level of 2MCA, but a normal C3/C2 ratio
and normal levels of C3 and propionic acid.
Although the metabolite results for the C3, C3/C2 ra-
tio, and 2MCA in unaffected and affected groups
showed significant differences ( P < 0.0001), the level of
3HPA in AF samples showed no significant difference
between the two groups ( P > 0.05, Fig. 1).
Genetic analysis of the pathogenic variants in amniocyte
DNA
There were 54 pregnancies with clear information as to
pathogenic variants in probands and parents, of which
19 pregnancies were from families affected by patho-
genic variants of the PCCA gene, while the other 35
pregnancies were from families affected by pathogenic
variation in the PCCB gene. Twelve fetuses carried no
pathogenic variants in PCCA or PCCB (22.22%), 32 fe-
tuses carried a heterozygous variants (59.26%), and 10
fetuses carried compound heterozygous variants
(18.52%; Tables 1 and 2, Table S1). To explore the rela-
tionship between genotype and levels of metabolites in
AF, we compared the median level of C3, C3/C2 ratio,
and propionic acid and 2MCA in PCCA pathogenic vari-
ant carriers ( n = 12) or PCCB pathogenic variant carriers
(n = 20) with reference samples and observed that nei-
ther PCCA nor PCCB pathogenic variant carriers
showed significant differences in these four metabolite
levels relative to the reference group.
Genetic and metabolite analyses of the 54 fetuses
showed high consistency. Ten of 54 fetuses have been
determined to be affected fetuses by molecular genetics
analysis (Table 1). Metabolite analyses in AF were con-
sistent with these results. AF samples in the 10 affected
fetuses had elevated C3 level, C3/C2 ratio, and 2MCA
level and we therefore also inferred them to be affected
fetuses by metabolite analysis (Table 1). Forty-three of
54 fetuses were determined to be unaffected by genetic
testing, including 31 carriers and 12 fetuses without
identifiable mutations with normal levels of C3, C3/C2
ratio and 2MCA. There was only one fetus with incon-
sistent molecular genetics and metabolite results (Table
2). The fetus (F053) with a pathogenic variant inherited
from the father had an AF C3 level at the cutoff of (C3
5.00 μmol/L). However, the other diagnostic metabolic
markers were within normal limits. Thus, the overall
metabolite panel is indicative of an unaffected fetus, as
supported by molecular testing.
There were 24 fetuses with incomplete molecular gen-
etics results. Three of these cases (F001, F017 and F023)
had elevated C3, C3/C2 ratio and 2MCA in the AF and
were thus determined to be affected (Table 1). The other
21 fetuses were determined to be unaffected by a normal
metabolite profile, which was confirmed by a normal
phenotype at postnatal follow-up. Of the 21 unaffected
fetuses by biochemical testing, there were three fetuses
(F014, F043 and F044) that showed high levels of pro-
pionic acid, but normal levels of the key diagnostic
markers, were determined to be unaffected (Table 2 and
S2). While fetus F008 was found to have a slightly ele-
vated C3 level, the other diagnostic markers were nor-
mal, thereby determined to be unaffected. Similarly,
fetus F020 had a only slightly higher 2MCA level, but
with normal C3 and C3/C2 levels, was deteremined to
be unaffected. Postnatal follow-ups for all 24 fetuses de-
termined to be unaffected by biochemical testing were
consistent with unaffected phenotype.
Discussion
PA is a rare organic acidemia with an average estimated
incidence of ~ 1:100,000 –150,000 in the wordwide [ 26,
27]. The typical presentation of PA entails metabolic de-
compensations, cardiac complications, chronic kidney
disease, or encephalopathy [ 28]. Prognosis of PA is gen-
erally poor and strongly influenced by the duration of
coma and the level of blood ammonia [ 29, 30], and se-
vere patients without proper treatment can die in the
newborn period or later. Although a series of treatment
strategies have been implemented over the past decade
Dai et al. Orphanet Journal of Rare Diseases          (2020) 15:276 Page 4 of 7
to improve the survival rate and life quality of PA pa-
tients [ 5, 31, 32], they remain at high risk for life-
threatening complications. Prenatal diagnosis especially
in families of probands with PA, is an essential strategy
for neonatal planning. In the present study, we describe
our experiences with prenatal diagnosis of PA in 78
pregnancies over 11 years.
The measurement of metabolite levels in AF and stable
ranges across gestational ages can assist the prenatal diag-
nosis of PA [ 33–35]. The analyses of acylcarnitines by
MS/MS and organic acids by GC/MS in AF allowed us to
rapidly and reliably diagnose this condition, similar to our
experience with prenatal diagnosis of methylmalonic acid-
emia [ 36]. Prenatal diagnosis of PA using biochemical
methods required systematic evaluation. The majority of
previously reported studies were based on single case or
small series cases. We analyzed AF supernatants from 78
pregnancies at risk for PA using MS/MS and GS/MS tech-
niques and showed that the measurements of three me-
tabolite indices (C3, C3/C2 ratio and 2MCA) allowed for
fast prenatal diagnosis of PA. Importantly, this metabolite
panel required only a very small amount of AF super-
natant, yet provided results for multiple metabolites. The
propionylcarnitine (C3) level, C3/C2 ratio and 2-
methylcitric acid (2MCA) level in unaffected and affected
groups showed significant differences ( P < 0.0001).
3HPA levels were also determined, but were found not to
be informative, as levels in affected and unaffected cases

showed no significant difference between the two groups
(P > 0.05). The C3/C2 ratio in AFs showed no overlap be-
tween affected and unaffected fetuses, while C3, 2MCA
and 3HPA levels overlapped. For 54 fetuses with con-
firmed pathogenic variants in the probands, the results for
the C3/C2 ratio and 2MCA were consistent with the gen-
etic results. In contrast, the levels of 3HPA in both groups
showed discrepancies with the genetic results. These re-
sults suggested that the C3 level, C3/C2 ratio, and 2MCA
level in AF samples were better suited than 3HPA as
metabolic markers for the prenatal diagnosis of PA
and that the C3/C2 ratio appeared to be the most re-
liable of the four tested biochemical markers. The
biochemical testing approach could provide a strong
support for diagnosing PA using amniotic fluid super-
natant. And in the future, we could adjust cut-off
value of the parameters by taking into account the
molecular genetics testing to achieve a higher
specificity.
Molecular genetics testing is a vital standard for the
prenatal diagnosis of PA that requires the exclusion of
maternal contamination to avoid false test results. How-
ever, due to the high genetic heterogeneity or novel vari-
ants whose clinical appearance is unknown, a genetic
diagnosis of PA may lead to misdiagnosis [ 37], and the
method depends upon availability of genetic information
from the proband and parents. In some PA families, only
one causative pathogenic variant was found in the pro-
band, or a genetic testing was not performed, leading to
the inability to make a precise prenatal diagnosis using
genetic testing alone. For these families, metabolite test-
ing could provide fast diagnosis and enable them to
make an informed decision. In our study, there were 24
fetuses with incomplete genetic results in the probands:
three samples were determined to be affected according
to elevated levels of C3, C3/C2 ratio, and 2MCA in the
AF supernatants. The remaining 21 fetuses were inferred
to be unaffected fetuses based on normal metabolite
levels. Additionally, postnatal follow-up showed a nor-
mal phenotype in all unaffected fetuses. Hence, bio-
chemical testing appears to be a suitable option in
diagnosis and provides further information that can be
used for genetic counseling.
Conclusion
In summary, prenatal diagnosis of PA should be offered
to families with an affected proband. Although a genetic
approach is routine for the prenatal diagnosis of PA, a
biochemical approach would offer an additional reliable
method, especially for families with incomplete genetic
results. A combined genetic and biochemical approach
would comprise the strongest strategy, providing in-
creased diagnostic accuracy.
