Abstract 
Background: 3-Hydroxypropionic acid (3-HP) is an important platform chemical that boasts a variety of industrial 
applications. Gene expression systems inducible by 3-HP , if available, are of great utility for optimization of the path-
ways of 3-HP production and excretion.
Results: Here we report the presence of unique inducible gene expression systems in Pseudomonas denitrificans and 
other microorganisms. In P . denitrificans, transcription of three genes (hpdH, mmsA and hbdH-4) involved in 3-HP deg-
radation was upregulated by 3-HP by the action of a transcriptional regulator protein, LysR, and a cis-acting regulatory 
site for LysR binding. Similar inducible systems having an LysR transcriptional regulator were identified in other micro-
organisms that also could degrade 3-HP . A docking study showed that the 3-HP binding pocket is located between 
the N-terminal helix-turn-helix motif and the C-terminal cofactor-binding domain.
Conclusions: This LysR-regulated 3-HP-inducible system should prove useful for control of the level of gene expres-
sion in response to 3-HP .

Background
3-Hydroxypropionic acid (3-HP) is an important plat -
form chemical. It can be converted to acrylic acid, 
acrylamide, 1,3-propanediol, malonic acid, and others. 
It can also be used for synthesis of biodegradable poly -
mer [ 1–3]. Biological production of 3-HP from glycerol 
has been successfully demonstrated in several bacte -
ria such as Escherichia coli , Klebsiella pneumoniae  and 
Pseudomonas denitrificans , which are engineered to 
(over)express glycerol dehydratase (GDHt, coenzyme 
B12 -dependent), glycerol dehydratase reactivation fac -
tors (GdrAB), and/or aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH, 
NAD+-dependent) [4–8]. Some recombinant strains such 
as E. coli W DUBGK have produced >40 g/L of 3-HP in 
48 h [ 9], but further increases of 3-HP production have 
been challenging. The 3-HP pathway enzymes GDHt and 
ALDH have been shown to be unstable and to lose their 
activities during prolonged fermentation, especially in 
the late stage [9].
One important mechanism of GDHt activity loss is so-
called suicidal inactivation. Coenzyme B12, the cofactor of 
GDHt, is irreversibly damaged during dehydration reac -
tion of the substrate glycerol to 3-hydroxypropionalde -
hyde (3-HPA) [10]. This inactivation is aggravated in the 
presence of oxygen. To alleviate this mechanism-based 
inactivation, Yamanishi et  al. [ 11] developed mutant 
GDHt by site-directed mutagenesis. Some of the mutant 
enzymes exhibited improved stability, but the activity 
was significantly lower than that of the wild type. Toxic 
intermediate 3-HPA also causes enzyme instability. It was 
observed that, when GDHt or ALDH was incubated with 
3-HPA, its activity declined in a dose-dependent man -
ner (unpublished data). Aldehyde is known to react with 
amino acid residues lysine, cysteine and histidine by tar -
geting the ε-amino group (NH 3
+), the sulfhydryl group 
(-SH) and the imidazole group, respectively [ 12–15].

site-directed or random mutagenesis have been made, 
but with only limited success [13, 16].
One alternative approach to solve the instability prob -
lem in 3-HP production is to synthesize new and active 
enzymes continuously during the entire period of cul
-
tivation. This is difficult, especially in the late period of 
fermentation, where cell growth is very slow and tar
-
get products often accumulate at levels toxic enough to 
interfere with cellular metabolisms. However, if there 
exists a dynamic 3-HP-inducible promoter, gene expres
-
sion for the aforementioned, unstable GDHt and ALDH 
enzymes can be stimulated and their enzymatic activities 
can be maintained at high levels, even in the late period 
of 3-HP production. To this end, we attempted to screen 
such promoters in 3-HP-degrading P. denitrificans, and 
identified two of them in this specific strain. After ana
-
lyzing the 3-HP-inducible system’s gene arrangement, 
including transcriptional activator proteins, promoter 
sequences and structural genes under the control of such 
3-HP-inducible promoters, similar 3-HP-inducible gene 
expression systems were searched and identified in other 
microorganisms. The existence of 3-HP-inducible gene 
expression systems in many of these microbes was con
-
firmed by measurement of the transcriptions of the genes 
under the control of the 3-HP-inducible promoters.
Results and discussion
Screening of 3‑HP‑inducible promoters in P . denitrificans
3-Hydroxypropionic acid (3-HP) is a carbon compound 
not commonly encountered in the natural environment; 
neither its use as a carbon substrate nor its biological 
degradation has been adequately elucidated. Recently, 
we found that P. denitrificans can grow on 3-HP as car
-
bon source and, further, that it degrades 3-HP under 
non-growing conditions in the presence of oxygen [7, 8]. 
Genome sequence and metabolite analysis by gas chro
-
matography/mass spectrometry [7] suggested that 3-HP 
is metabolized in P. denitrificans sequentially via two 
major enzymes, a putative 3-hydroxypropionate dehy
-
drogenase (HpdH) and (methyl)malonate-semialdehyde 
dehydrogenase (MmsA) [8, 17, 18], and converted to 
acetyl-CoA. In activity assay with purified enzymes, a 
putative 3-hydroxyisobutyrate dehydrogenase (HbdH-4) 
also exhibited 3-HP degradation [19]. Because the deg
-
radation activity of 3-HP in P. denitrificans was found 
to increase greatly when cells were exposed to 3-HP [8], 
we hypothesized that the expressions of these enzymes 
are induced by 3-HP . Thus, transcription of three cho
-
sen 3-HP catabolic genes, hpdH , hbdH-4 and mmsA , 
was examined by quantitative RT-PCR with and without 
exposure to 3-HP (Fig.  1). The housekeeping gene rpoD, 
encoding sigma factor 70, was used as a reference. As 
expected, expression of all three putative 3-HP catabolic 
genes was enhanced markedly upon exposure to 3-HP: 
47-fold for hpdH , 141-fold for hbdH-4, and 142-fold 
for mmsA. This indicates that transcription of the three 
genes is induced by 3-HP . The levels of transcription for 
mmsA and hbdH-4 were much higher than that for hpdH, 
suggesting that the promoter strength of the first two 
genes is much stronger than the other.
Analysis of 3‑HP‑inducible gene expression system
To unravel the details of the 3-HP-induced gene expres -
sion systems, the genetic arrangement of the operons 
for hpdH, hbdH-4 and mmsA in P. denitrificans was ana
-
lyzed (Fig.  2). The three genes were found to exist in two 
separate operons, hpdH  in one operon (the C3 operon, 
hereafter) and hbdH-4 and mmsA  in another (the C4 
operon). Located just before each of the C3 and C4 oper -
ons, there was an oppositely oriented gene encoding a 
LysR-type transcriptional regulator (LTTR) (Fig.  2a), 
which suggests the possible involvement of LysR pro
-
tein in the regulation of the expressions of those genes. 
Additionally, this suggests that the transcription of LysR 
regulator protein is also self-regulated, though negatively. 
LysR protein is known to be composed of a DNA-binding 
domain (helix-turn-helix motif) at the N-terminus and a 
cofactor-binding domain at the C-terminus [20]. When 
binding to DNA, LysR protein forms a homodimer and 
targets two specific binding sites, a regulatory binding 
site, which has the conserved T-N
11-A/TTA-N7/8-GAA 
motif, and an activation binding site (near the -35 RNA 
polymerase binding site) (Fig.  2b). The tetramer of LysR, 
formed through protein–protein interaction between 
two LysR homodimers, is known to lead to conforma
-
tional changes in DNA and, thereby, to enhancement of 
RNA polymerase binding in the promoter sequence. The 
conserved T-N
11-A/TTA-N7/8-GAA motif also was iden -
tified in both operons. The structure of the putative LysR 
protein for the C4 operon was analyzed as well (see Fig.  3 
for more details). Features similar to those found in other 
LysR proteins, namely a DNA-binding helix-turn-helix 
motif, a substrate-binding motif and a linker connecting 
the two, were identified in C4-LysR. The structural char
-
acteristics of the putative LysR, the existence of the LysR-
binding T-N
11-A/TTA-N7/8-GAA motif DNA sequence 
in the intergenic region, as well as the RT-PCR results 
shown in Fig.  1, strongly support the conclusion that 
gene transcription in the C3 and C4 operons is induced 
by the LysR-3-HP complex.
Virtual screening of 3‑HP‑inducible gene expression 
systems
The LTTR-mediated 3-HP-inducible gene expres -
sion systems were screened in other microorganisms 
using homology searches of various public and private

databases such as NCBI (nr, refseq_protein, and env_nr), 
MBGD (Microbial Genome Database), and SEED. The 
most conserved components of the C3 and C4 oper
-
ons from P. denitrificans, HpdH (C3-LysR) and HbdH-4 
(C4-LysR), were used as primary queries. The 3-HP-
inducible systems existed in more than 53 genera among 
the members of the sequenced bacterial species; some 
of them had both C3 and C4 operons, while others C4 
operon only. The 53 genera were arbitrarily grouped 
into 14 based on (1) their gene organization and (2) the 
existence of the C3 operon (Fig. 4). A comparison among 
the various organisms revealed that the genetic organi
-
zations and compositions of the LysR systems differed 
significantly. Notably for example, the C4 system was 
more commonly present than the C3. Interestingly too, 
in many microorganisms, the genes encoding a DNA-
binding regulator protein (C3- or C4-LysR) were located 
just before the corresponding C3 or C4 operon and oppo
-
sitely oriented, indicating that transcription of the LysR 
regulator protein is self-repressed, as in the case of P. 
denitrificans (see Fig.  2). However, in other microorgan
-
isms, the gene encoding LysR was located remotely from 
the C3 or C4 operon and in the same orientation. Further 
studies are required to understand the significance of the 
different LysR gene arrangements among various genera.

A phylogenetic tree was generated to analyze the prox -
imities among the C4-LysR variants (Fig. 5). The C4-LysR 
of Pseudomonas was close to that of Azotobacter but far 
from those of Kitasatospora, Kutzneria, Segniliparus, 
Catenulispora and Gordonia. The multiple sequence 
alignment for the helix-turn-helix regions of C3- and 
C4-LysR exhibited a high amino acid sequence homology 
(data not shown). Moreover, the amino acid sequences 
of the enzymes HpdH, HbdH and MmsA appeared to be 
significantly conserved across all of the species studied 
(Additional files 1 and 2: Tables S1 and S2). This indicates 
that the 3-HP-inducible LysR system and the operons 
regulated by LysR are widely distributed across a broad 
range of microorganisms.
Molecular modeling and docking
Wek et  al. reported that LysR-type protein binds to 
operator sites and directs a conformational change in 
the structure of the promoter–operator DNA complex 
[21]. When bound by inducer molecules, LysR protein 
enhances the recruitment of RNA polymerase to the pro
-
moter without affecting the occupancy of the LysR pro -
tein at the operator site. However, the ligand-associated 
conformational changes in LysR protein and their effect 
on the activity of LysR have not been fully elucidated. For 
detailed understanding of the structural and functional 
characteristics, protein modeling was performed for 
C4-LysR and its interaction with 3-HP (protein–ligand 
interaction). Because the crystal structure of C4-LysR is 
not available, multiple template threading was employed 
(see “Methods ”). The predicted model was evaluated 
using the RAMPAGE tool, by calculating the main-chain 
RMSD (Root Mean Square Deviation) with reference 
to its template structure (3SZP) and their amino acid 
distribution.
Among the various docking poses generated, the best 
one showed the lowest Glide docking score (empirical 
scoring function) of −5.01 kcal/mol with three hydrogen 
bonds and a hydrophobic contact, which indicated the

hydrogen bonds are represented by the yellow dotted lines

high reliability of the simulation [22]. Several intermo -
lecular interactions were identified between C4-LysR and 
the 3-HP molecule: three amino acid residues (ARG94, 
LYS96 and GLU137) present in the substrate-binding 
domain showed hydrogen bonding with 3-HP , while 
ARG24 located in the helix-turn-helix domain, exhib
-
ited a hydrophobic interaction (Fig.  3). The steric hin -
drance caused by the binding of 3-HP to the active site 
of C4-LysR might be responsible for protein dimerization 
and DNA relaxation. Thus, increasing the RNA polymer
-
ase (RNAP) binding at the promoter site would effec -
tively activate transcription of the target genes.
Resting‑cell degradation of 3‑HP and 3‑HP‑dependent 
transcription activation of C3 and C4 operons in selected 
microorganisms
As in the case of P. denitrificans, the genes in the C3 and 
C4 operons in the microorganisms presented in Fig.  4 
were expected to get involved in 3-HP degradation and/
or assimilation. To confirm this, 3-HP degradation under 
non-growing conditions was examined for 10 selected 
microorganisms (Table  1). Cells were cultured in nutri
-
ent media containing 25  mM 3-HP to mid-log period, 
harvested by centrifugation, and resuspended in 100 mM 
potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) containing 25 mM 
3-HP . After 24  h incubation at 30  °C, the amount of 
degraded 3-HP was determined. All 10 of the microor
-
ganisms degraded 3-HP , though the amounts varied. Four 
strains, Pseudomonas protegens CHA0, Pseudomonas 
fluorescence A506, Alicycliphilus denitrificans and A. ave
-
nae subsp. citrulli, showed high degradation yields simi -
lar to that of P. denitrificans. In contrast, Pseudomonas 
knackmussii B13, Pseudogulbenkiania sp. and Variovorax 
paradoxus exhibited up to 50 % lower degradation yields 
compared with P. denitrificans.
The transcription levels of the 3-HP catabolic genes 
(hpdH, hbdH, mmsA) in the 10 microorganisms also were 
determined, after growing them in the absence or pres

ence of 25  mM 3-HP (Table  2). Six showed improved

transcription for the three 3-HP catabolic genes, with 
the exception of Acidovorax sp. for hpdH . As in the case 
of P. denitrificans, transcription of hpdH  was lower than 
that of mmsA  or hbdH, indicating that the promoter 
strength of the former is weaker than the others. In three 
of the microorganisms (Collimonas arenae, Achromobac
-
ter xylosoxidans, V. paradoxus), the mRNA of the 3-HP 
catabolic genes was not amplified at all, which suggested 
that the degenerate primer sequences, designed based on 
NCBI database, did not match the original gene sequence 
(Additional file  3: Table  S3). With P. protegens CHA0, 
total RNA could not be isolated using standard RNA iso
-
lation procedures (see “Methods ”). It should be noted 
that the fold increases in transcription of three genes in 
the six microorganisms (P. knackmussii B13, P. fluores
-
cence A506, A. denitrificans, Pseudogulbenkiania sp., 
Acidovorax sp. and A. avenae subsp. citrulli) are gener -
ally lower compared to those of P. denitrificans (Table 2). 
In P. denitrificans, the fold increase was in the range of 
47–142, while that in the other six microorganisms was 
<37. The reason for this difference is not clear, though 
we suspect that culture conditions, including medium 
composition, could have affected expressions of C3- and 
C4-LysR and the catabolic genes under their control. 
Nevertheless, the enhanced transcription of the putative 
3-HP catabolic genes, along with the resting-cell 3-HP 
degradation, strongly suggests that the 10 microorgan
-
isms tested (Table 1) and, probably, most of other micro -
organisms listed in Additional files 1 and 2: Tables S1 and 
S2 have 3-HP-inducible C3 and/or C4 operons similar 
to those of P. denitrificans. Further in  vivo and in  vitro 
studies to elucidate the detailed mechanism of 3-HP-
inducible systems are in progress.
Conclusions
Unique transcriptional activator proteins and promot -
ers that respond to 3-HP were studied. In the presence 
of 3-HP , two different LysR-family transcriptional regu
-
lators, designated C3- and C4-LysR, respectively, were 
found to stimulate the transcription of the catabolic 
genes hpdH, hbdH and/or mmsA involved in 3-HP deg
-
radation. The inducible systems were common to many 
microorganisms: more than 53 genera, according to the 
genome sequence databases. The present molecular mod
-
eling and docking studies suggested that, in C4-LysR, the 
four amino acid residues ARG94, LYS96, GLU137 and 
ARG24 interact with 3-HP and activate the LysR regula
-
tor protein. The 3-HP-inducible systems promise to be of 
a great utility to the development of gene expression sys
-
tems that are regulated by 3-HP .

strains, the nutrient medium contains the following com-
ponents per liter: peptone, 5  g; beef extract 3  g; 3-HP , 
25  mmol. For the Acidovarax sp. strain, trypticase soy 
broth containing 25 mmol/L was used. The cultures were 
conducted at 30  °C, obtaining ~1–1.5 OD
600. The cells 
were then harvested and centrifuged at 5000  rpm for 
10  min. The resultant pellet was washed with 100  mM 
potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) and resuspended in 
the same buffer supplemented with 25 ± 2 mmol/L 3-HP . 
The cells were then harvested and centrifuged as above 
noted, subjecting them to non-growing 3-HP degrada
-
tion experimentation. After 24 h cultivation, the samples 
were withdrawn to determine the 3-HP concentrations.
RNA extraction and Real‑time PCR
The P. denitrificans ATCC 13867 strain was grown in M9 
minimal medium containing 5 g/L sodium gluconate; the 
other microorganism strains listed in Table 1 were grown 
in a specified nutrient medium. The cells were cultivated 
under the aerobic condition at 37 or 30 °C and 200 rpm 
in an orbital incubator shaker. 3-HP at 0/25 mM was sup
-
plemented at OD 600 of ~0.4–0.5. After a further 2 h cul -
tivation, approximately 5  × 108 cells were collected and 
centrifuged at 5000×g for 10  min. The cell pellets were 
immediately resuspended in 500 μL of RNAlater solution 
(Ambion, UK). RNA was extracted using a total RNA iso
-
lation kit (Macherey–Nagel, Germany). One microgram 
of total RNA was employed to synthesize the first-strand 
cDNA in a 20 µL reaction using the SuperScript III first-
strand synthesis system (Invitrogen, USA). A real-time 
PCR analysis was performed, according to the SYBR 
green method, in a 20  µL reaction volume using the 
StepOne Real-Time PCR system (Applied Biosystems, 
USA). The PCR efficiencies of all of the primers were 
experimentally determined and found to be suitable for 
reliable copy-number quantification. The relative quanti
-
fication for each of the mRNA levels was calculated using 
the ΔΔC
t method as described previously [23]. All of the 
assays were performed in duplicate, and a template-less 
reaction template was used as a negative control.
Phylogenetic tree
The evolutionary history was inferred using the Neigh -
bor-Joining method [24], which proceeds as follows: a 
bootstrap consensus tree inferred from 1000 replicates 
is taken to represent the evolutionary history of the taxa 
analyzed [25]; branches corresponding to partitions 
reproduced in less than 50 % of the bootstrap replicates 
are collapsed; the percentages of replicate trees in the 
associated taxa clustered together in the bootstrap test 
(1000 replicates) are shown next to the branches; the tree 
is drawn to scale, with branch lengths (in the same units 
as those of the evolutionary distances) used to infer the 
phylogenetic tree. The evolutionary distances were com

puted, using the Poisson correction method [26], in units 
of the number of amino acid substitutions per site. Evolu

tionary analyses were conducted in MEGA5 [27].
Protein modeling and docking of C4‑LysR
A model three-dimensional (3D) C4-LysR structure was 
created by protein fold modeling using the MUSTER 
(MUlti-Source ThreadER) program [28]. The protein 
model with the lowest level probability density function 
(PDF) energy was selected. The prepared protein model 
was energy minimized by the OPLS 2005 force field. Fur
-
ther, the model, thus refined, was validated using Pro -
Check and Ramachandran plot (RAMPAGE tool; http://
raven.bioc.cam.ac.uk/rampage.php).
A molecular docking study was carried out to examine 
the binding interaction between the modeled C4-LysR 
protein and 3-HP . The active-site regions in C4-LysR 
for 3-HP binding were predicted, using the COACH 
tool, according to the highest C-scores and cluster sizes 
of 0.05 and 9.0, respectively. The validated model and 
predicted active-site residues were used to perform 
docking studies, using the Maestro program from the 
SCHRODINGER
™v10.1 software package to run the 
docking protocol. Briefly, the target protein (C4-LysR) 
and the ligand (3-HP) were prepared and processed using 
Protein Preparation Wizard and LigPrep Wizard in the 
Schrodinger graphical user interface MAESTRO (ver
-
sion 10.1). Bond orders were assigned to the ligand, and 
hydrogen bonds consistent with the physiological pH 
(7.0) were added to the receptor. The initial ligand con
-
formations were obtained by a Monte Carlo conforma -
tional search. Using the Receptor Grid Generation tool, 
a receptor grid box (scaling factor: 1.0; partial charge 
cutoff: 0.25 Å) was generated around the active-site resi
-
dues predicted by the COACH tool. Ligand docking was 
performed using XP (extra precision) predefined docking 
settings and flexible ligand sampling within the grid box. 
Finally, the docked poses were visualized using the Maes
-
tro 10.1 graphical user interface.
Analytical methods
The cell concentration was determined in a 10-mm-path-
length cuvette using a double-beam spectrophotometer 
(Lambda 20, Perkin-Elmer, Norwalk, CT). The concentra
-
tions of 3-HP were determined by HPLC using a slightly 
modified version of the method described elsewhere 
[29]. Briefly, the obtained by 10 min centrifugation of the 
culture samples at 10,000× g was filtered through a Tuf
-
fryn-membrane (Acrodisc; Pall Life Sciences, Port Wash -
ington, NY) and eluted through a 300  mm  ×  7.8  mm 
Aminex HPX-87H (Bio-Rad, USA) column at 65 °C using 
2.5 mmol/L H
2SO4 as the mobile phase.
