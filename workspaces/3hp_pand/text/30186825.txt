Background: Propionic acidemia (PA) is an extremely rare autosomal rece ssive disorder
which is caused by the deﬁciency of propionyl-CoA carboxyla se (PCC) and associated
with pathogenic variants in PCCA or PCCB gene.
Case Report: Detection of PA in neonates is possible using Propionyl carn itine (C3)
analysis by tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) in dried blood spots (DBS). Here we
report one patient with PA. C3 in this case was normal in the in itial screening and recall
check and only manifested as the slightly increase of C3/C2, 3-hydroxypropionate in
urine was only slightly elevated. Then two pathogenic mutat ions (c.802C >T/c.827delG)
were detected in the PCCA gene by Genetic diagnosis panel. Am ong them, the variation
rs774738181 (c.802C >T) was present on the dbSNP database which appeared to be
“Likely pathogenic” in GenBank dbSNP (100915068). c.827de lG was a novel frameshift
mutation, leading to p.Gly276ValfsX46 mutation of amino ac id sequence in PCCA. The
patient underwent 1 year of follow-up, had total of 7 times an d remain asymptomatic
whose blood ammonia and liver function were normal. When the c hild was 1 year of age
(in May of 2017), C3 and 3-Hydroxypropionate sudden elevate d signiﬁcantly, that proved
pathogenicity of c.802C >T and c.827delG.
Conclusion: Two novel mutations (c. 802C >T and c.827delG) in PCCA gene may be
associated with late-onset PA, expanding its mutational sp ectrum. Maybe there is relation
between the severity of propionyl-CoA carboxylase (PCC) ac tivity defects and different
genotypes.

INTRODUCTION
Since the ﬁrst report of Propionic Acidemia (PA) by Hommes in 19 68 (
1), PA has been investigated
by the researchers around the world. PA is an autosomal recess ive genetic organic acidemia due
to propionyl-CoA carboxylase (PCC) activity defects, leading to the abnormal accumulation of
propionic acid and its metabolite precursor.
PCC is α 6β 6 multimer composed of α and β subunits, the coding genes of α and β two subunits
are PCCA and PCCB, respectively ( 2). In this study, we reported one patient with PA who was
screened by tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) and diagnosed by u rine gas chromatography mass
spectrometry (GC/MS), then we used Genetic diagnosis panel to a nalyze the patient and identiﬁed
a novel mutation in PCCA gene.

CASE REPORT
The child, a Chinese boy with birth weight of 3,450 g and
gestational age of 39 + 6 week (his mother was 28-year-old,
G1P1, with normal pregnancy), was screened in Genetics and
Metabolism Department of the Obstetrics and Gynecology
Hospital aﬃliated to the Nanjing Medical University at 3th day
after birth. The results are shown in Table 1. MS/MS showed
that he had elevated C3/C2 but C3 and 3-hydroxypropionate
remained almost normal. In order to identify the etiology, t he
patient and his families were diagnosed by Genetic diagnosis
panel in our hospital on 16 June 2016. Parents were healthy and
non-consanguineous.
Genetic diagnosis panel of genetic metabolic disease covers
51 diseases and 98 genes, of which Panel 1 covers 18
amino acid metabolism diseases and 35 genes, Panel 2
covers 17 diseases, and 42 genes of organic acid metabolic
diseases and glycogen metabolism diseases, and Panel 3
covers 16 fatty acid metabolism diseases and 21 genes.
Genomic DNA was extracted from the peripheral blood of
the families using the OMEGA Genomic DNA Extraction
Kit (OMEGA Biotech, USA). All mutations were veriﬁed
by Sanger sequencing. Ion Torrent data extraction, sequenc e
alignment and SNPs and Indels extraction were performed
by using Ion Torrent Suite v3.0 software. After the resultin g
SNPs and indels were ﬁltered by the dbSNP 137 database,
HGMD, LOVD and other databases and Pubmed related
literatures were retrieved, matching the reported pathogeni c
sites. Two pathogenic mutations (c.802C >T/c.827delG) were
detected in the PCCA gene ( Table 2, Figure 1), among them,
the variation rs774738181 (c.802C >T) was present on the
dbSNP database which appeared to be “Likely pathogenic” in
GenBank dbSNP (100915068). we propose that this variation
may be pathogenic. (http://www.egl-euroﬁns.com/emvclass/
emvclass.php?approved_symbol=PCCA).
c.827delG was a frameshift mutation, leading to
p.Gly276ValfsX46 mutation of amino acid sequence, which
has not been reported. According to the ACMG principle, the
mutation was a highly reliable pathogenic mutant type. The
protein function was predicted by SIFT and PolyPhen, and the
results were all harmful. The identiﬁed pathogenic mutation s
and suspected pathogenic mutations were conﬁrmed by Sanger
sequencing.
Although two pathogenic mutations were detected in
PCCA, two mutations were not reported before, and the
3-Hydroxypropionate in urine was only slightly increased.
Therefore, the treatment was postponed and frequency of follow -
up was increased.
The patient underwent 1 year of follow-up. MS/MS and
GC/MS detection results were shown in Table 3. He remained
asymptomatic and his blood ammonia and liver function were
normal.
When the child was 1 year old (in May of 2017), C3 and
3-Hydroxypropionate sudden elevated signiﬁcantly, indicat ing
the pathogenicity of c.802C >T and c.827delG. Thus we suggest
that c.802C>T and c.827delG may be linked to late-onset PA.
DISCUSSION
PCC is located in the mitochondria, and its main biological
function is to enable propionyl-CoA carboxylation to form
methyl malonyl-CoA. The reduced or lack of PCC activity caus es
propionyl-CoA accumulation in the body, thereby activating
the bypass metabolic pathway and producing a large amount
of propionic acid, 3-hydroxypropionate, and methyl citrate.
The clinical symptoms of the patients are mainly caused by
these intermediate metabolites, and manifested as neurolog ical
symptoms such as feeding diﬃculties, vomiting, lethargy, co ma,
metabolic acidosis, and hyperammonemia.
Tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) enabled Propionic
academia (PA) to be early detected based on detecting propionyl
carnitine (C3) in neonatal dried blood spot (DBS). American
Medical Genetics Society lists PA as one of the 29 diseases to
be screened ﬁrstly. Neonatal screening laboratory manageme nt
method issued by China’s Ministry of Health in 2017 stipulates
that PA is one of the 48 diseases that must be screened. As high
C3 was detected in DBS by MS/MS, PA must be diﬀerentiated
from methylmalonic academia (MMA). The speciﬁcity of 3-
hydroxypropionate can be detected in the urine of PA patients
by GC/MS, while the speciﬁcity of methylmalonic acid can
be detected in the urine of MMA patients. Therefore, MS/MS
and urine GC/MS can make a preliminary clinical diagnosis of
patients. C3 in this case was normal in the initial screening a nd
recall check and only manifested as the slight increase of C3 /C2,
and 3-hydroxypropionate in urine was only slightly elevated. The
clinical diagnosis of PA was diﬃcult, thus the pathogenic gen e
detection was carried out. We used a gene Panel based on NGS
technology, and all the exon coverage of PCCA and PCCB gene
was 100%.
The PCCA gene is located on chromosome 13q32.3 and
contains 24 exons, encoding 703 amino acids. The PCCB gene is
located on chromosome 3q22.3 and contains 15 exons, encodin g
539 amino acids. Currently, 81 mutations of PCCA and 86
mutations of PCCB have been found, and mutation types have
signiﬁcant diﬀerences among diﬀerent ethnic groups. In Japanese
PCCA gene mutations were mainly 923-924insT, IVSl8-6C >G
and R399Q, while PCCB gene mutations were mainly R410W,
T428I and A153P (
3). PCCB mutation in Korean population was
mainly T428I, the gene mutation frequency of T428I mutation
in PA children was as high as 56.3% (
4). PA was common in
Greenland Inuit people, and PCCB gene 1540insCCC mutation
rate in the normal population was up to 5% (
5). People with PA in
Latin America had mainly 2 types of mutations in PCCB gene C.
1218-1231dell4insl2 and C. 5029 >A, accounting for more than
60% (
6).
Two pathogenic mutations (c.802C >T/c.827delG) were
detected in PCCA gene of this child patient, c.827delG was
a frameshift mutation, leading to p.Gly276ValfsX46 mutatio n
of amino acid sequence, and the mutation was reported by
us for the ﬁrst time. According to the American College of
Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG) principle, the variation
belong to the PVS1 null variant class that can often be assumed
to disrupt gene function by leading to a complete absence

of the gene product by a lack of transcription or nonsense-
mediated decay of an altered transcript. However, the site
lacked functional validation. The second variation rs7747 38181
(c.802C>T) appeared to be “Likely pathogenic” in GenBank
dbSNP. Despite the fact that rs774738181 was present on
the dbSNP database, we propose that this variation may be
pathogenic.
We must be grateful to the cooperation and understanding
between the doctor and patient. The child’s family members
insisted on regular follow-up, even C3/C2 in MS/MS and 3-
hydroxypropionate in urinary GC/MS gradually dropped to
normal within 6 months after birth. Thus we wondered whether
the site is really a pathogenic site. When the child was 1 year o f
age, C3 and 3-hydroxypropionate concentration began to eleva te
with the increase in protein intake, and he was diagnosed as
PA. This patient should be classiﬁed as late-onset case and we
suggest that c.802C >T and c.827delG may be linked to late-
onset PA.
But the fact which is unable to avoid is, if a deletion is large r
than the ampliﬁed PCR fragment, or one of the primers for
PCR reaction is located at the deleted region, the fragment f rom
the chromosome carrying large deletion will not be ampliﬁed a t
all. Thus, the sequence would appear normal and large deletion
would not be detected. For this study the Desviat (
7) chose
20 samples of PA patients with no mutations in one or both
alleles to study by MLPA analysis. MLPA was employed to
screen for deletions in PCCA gene with the SALSA P278 PCCA
MLPA kit in these 20 PA patients. Then this strategy revealed
a high frequency (21.3%) of deletion alleles, therefore it is very
important to perform MLPA analysis for PCCA gene. However,
in our department, we also purchased commercial kits directly for
MLPA detection, just including SMA, DMD, CAH, PKU, PKD,

and Hemophilia. The PA frequency in Nanjing was 2/175160
(Statistical time from December 1, 2013 to July 20, 2018). Thi s
patient is the ﬁrst case of PA, so we had no MLPA kit for
PA detention. In follow-up, we will accumulate PA cases and
centralize detection by PCCA MLPA kit.
PA lacks speciﬁc treatment methods, acute phase is mainly
managed by symptomatic treatment. Long-term treatment is
to limit the natural protein diet, mainly the intake of valine ,
isoleucine, threonine and methionine, and is supplemented by
levocarnitine, metronidazole, carbamoyl glutamate, and o ther
drug treatment. Recently, liver transplantation is proven as a n
eﬀective method for the treatment of PA.
This study found that PCCA gene had a new mutation
(c.827delG) in a patient with PA, and the clinical follow-up
data for the child conﬁrmed that the mutation was pathogenic
type. Despite the fact that rs774738181 (c.802C >T) was present
on the dbSNP database, we propose that this variation may be
pathogenic. In clinical work we must pay attention to the patien t’s
clinical follow-up and doctor-patient relationship. As a rar e
genetic metabolic disease, PA belongs to the 3-level prevent ion
category of national birth defects. Genetic testing can mak e clear
diagnosis and help diagnosis of pre-symptomatic patient in the
family who has not shown onset. In the meantime, genetic testi ng
can be used in prenatal diagnosis. We recommend PA patients
should be perform MLPA analysis, and it makes the diagnosis
more comprehensive.
