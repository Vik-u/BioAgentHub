Abstract
Poly(3-hydroxypropionate) (P3HP) is a biodegradable and biocompatible thermoplastic. In our previous study, a pathway for
P3HP production was constructed in recombinantEsecherichia coli. Seven exogenous genes in P3HP synthesis pathway
were carried by two plasmid vectors. However, the P3HP production was severely suppressed by strain instability due to
plasmid loss. In this paper, two strategies, chromosomal gene integration and plasmid addiction system (PAS) based on
amino acid anabolism, were applied to construct a genetically stable strain. Finally, a combination of those two methods
resulted in the best results. The resultant strain carried a portion of P3HP synthesis genes on chromosome and the others on
plasmid, and also brought a tyrosine-auxotrophy based PAS. In aerobic fed-batch fermentation, this strain produced 25.7 g/
L P3HP from glycerol, about 2.5-time higher than the previous strain with two plasmids. To the best of our knowledge, this
is the highest P3HP production from inexpensive carbon sources.

Introduction
Escherichia coli strains are widely used as hosts for microbial
production of valuable compounds, like biofuels, chemicals,
polymers, and proteins, and the production processes often
depend on expression of heterologous genes carried by plasmid
vectors [1]. Plasmids have been regarded as important tools for
microbial genetic modifications. However, plasmids are separate
genetic elements and autonomously replicated, and the redundant
DNA carried by plasmids may cause metabolic burden in host
strains, which could result in plasmid loss [2–4]. For plasmid
maintenance, the cloning and expression vectors harbor antibiotic
resistance genes and require the addition of antibiotics to the
medium. Though it is feasible at the laboratory scale, the use of
antibiotics at industrial scale will increase the production cost and
raise the ecological issues. Furthermore, plasmid loss can even
occur with presence of antibiotics during cultivation [5].
Plasmid addiction system (PAS) is an efficient strategy to prevent
the survival of plasmid-free cells due to selective killing. Up to now,
three major groups of PAS have been described: (1) toxin/
antitoxin-based systems, (2) metabolism-based systems, and (3)
operator repressor titration systems [1]. PASs have been success-
fully used in metabolically engineered strains to increase the
product yield by stabilizing the plasmid in the cells, which carries
the genes associated with product synthesis pathway and an
addiction system. For instance, an antibiotic-free plasmid selection
system based on glycine auxotrophy was constructed and used for
overproduction of recombinant protein [6]. To maintenance the
plasmid carrying cyanophycin synthesis genecphA, Kroll et al. [7]
established a novel anabolism-based addiction system. This system
consisted of two components: anE. coli ispH mutant that cannot
synthesize isopentenyl pyrophosphate (IPP), an essential precursor
for isoprenoid biosynthesis, and a synthetic plasmid harboringcphA
gene and the relevant genes of a foreign IPP-producing
mevalonate pathway. The resultant strain revealed a plasmid
stability of 100% and improved cyanophycin production.
Chromosomal gene integration (CGI) is another strategy to
stabilize foreign genes. For example, pyruvate decarboxylase gene
pdc and alcohol dehydrogenase II geneadhB from Zymomonas mobilis
were integrated into the E. coli chromosome for ethanol
biosynthesis, and the integration improved the stability of theZ.
mobilis genes in E. coli and ethanol production [8]. Recently, a
method was developed to insert multiple desired genes into target
loci onE. coli chromosome and up to six copies oflacZ gene were
simultaneously integrated into different loci. Theb-galactosidase
activity increased corresponding to the copy number of inserted
lacZ genes [9]. To a certain extent, multiple insertions have
resolved the main problem of CGI, low expression level of
recombinant protein due to a low copy number.
Poly(3-hydroxypropionate) (P3HP) is a biodegradable and
biocompatible plastic exhibiting high rigidity, ductility, and
exceptional tensile strength in drawn films, and was regarded as
one of the alternatives to petrochemical-derived plastic [10]. The
biosynthesis of P3HP and 3HP-containing copolymers was

previously dependent on structurally related precursors, such as
3HP, acrylate and 1,3-propanediol [11–14]. However the addition
of these expensive precursors increased P3HP production cost. To
solve this problem, we constructed a recombinantE. coli strain to
synthesize P3HP using inexpensive carbon source glycerol
(Figure 1) [15]. The genes involved in P3HP synthesis were
cloned into two plasmids: the glycerol dehydratase and its
reactivating factor genes, dhaB123 and gdrAB, from Klebsiella
pneumoniae were inserted in the expression vector pACYCDuet-1 to
generate plasmid pWQ04, and the propionaldehyde dehydroge-
nase gene pduP from Salmonella typhimurium and polyhydroxyalk-
anoate synthase genephaC1 from Cupriavidus necatorwere carried by
pWQ02. Under the optimized culture conditions, the recombinant
E. coli strain accumulated 10.1 g/L P3HP (representing 46.4% of
the cell dry weight) in a fed-batch fermentation.
To optimize the P3HP production strain, 5 strategies (Figure 2)
were designed and tested in this study. Strategy I used the
previously constructed plasmids pWQ02 and pWQ04. Strategy II
was designed to construct a phenylalanine/tyrosine-auxotrophy
based PAS and all the genes associated with P3HP synthesis were
integrated in E. coli chromosome in Strategy III. Strategy IV
strains carried portion of genes involved in P3HP synthesis on
chromosome and others on plasmid, which was further developed
using a tyrosine-auxotrophy based PAS to improve the plasmid
stability in Strategy V. As a result, the Strategy V strain Q1738
produced 25.7 g/L P3HP from glycerol in aerobic fed-batch
fermentation, 2.5-time higher than the previous report.
Materials and Methods
Bacterial Strains and Growth Conditions
All strains and plasmids used in this study are listed in Table 1.
E. coli DH5a was used as the host to construct and store all
recombinant plasmids, E. coli x7213 strain was used for
preparation of all suicide vectors, andE. coli BL21(DE3) strain
was used for protein expression and P3HP production. Bacteria
were grown at 37uC in Luria-Bertani (LB) broth unless specified.
Diaminopimelic acid (DAP) (50mg/ml) was used for the growth of
x7213 strain. When necessary, antibiotics were added at final
concentration of 100 mg/ml for ampicillin and 34 mg/ml for
chloramphenicol. LB agar containing 10% sucrose was used for
sacB gene-based counter selection in allelic exchange experiments.
Construction of Recombinant Plasmids
The primers used are listed in Table S1 in File S1. The plasmid
pG01 was constructed using PCR fragments containing thetyrA
coding region generated with primers 366 and 367 and
BL21(DE3) chromosomal DNA as a template, which were
digested with XhoI and then ligated with pWQ02 digested by the
same enzyme. The plasmid pG02 was constructed using PCR
fragments containing pheA coding region generated with primers
364 and 365 and BL21(DE3) chromosomal DNA as template,
which were digested withAflII and HindIII and then ligated with
pWQ04 digested by the same enzymes.
Construction of BL21(DE3) Strains with Chromosomal
Mutations
The primers used are listed in Table S1in File S1. The
mutations were constructed using suicide vector pRE112 as
previously described [16]. For thepheA tyrA deletion, two pairs of
primers, 369/370 and 371/372, were used to amplify approxi-
mately 500-bp fragments upstream and downstream of these genes
from BL21(DE3) chromosome, respectively. The two fragments
were then joined by PCR using primers 369 and 372. The PCR
product was digested withSacI andXbaI and then ligated between
the SacI and XbaI sites of vector pRE112 to generate plasmid
pG03. ThepheA tyrA mutation was introduced into BL21(DE3) by
allelic exchange using suicide vectors pG03. A similar strategy was
used to construct tyrA mutation using suicide vector pG04
constructed with primers 569/570 and 571/572.
To integrate the dhaB123 and gdrAB genes into prpR locus on
BL21(DE3) chromosome, two pairs of primers, 268/269 and 270/
271, were used to amplify approximately 500-bp fragments
upstream and downstream of prpR gene from BL21(DE3)
chromosome, respectively. The two fragments were then joined
by PCR using primers 268 and 271. The PCR product was
digested withSacI andNheI and then ligated between theSacI and
XbaI sites of vector pRE112 to generate plasmid pRE112-DprpR.
Then the KpnI-XbaI fragment containing dhaB123 gdrAB genes
from plasmid pWQ04 was inserted into the corresponding sites of
plasmid pRE112-DprpR to generate suicide vector pLC01, which
was used to mediate the allelic exchange to generateDprpR::lacI
P
T7 gdrAB PT7 dhaB123 strain. A similar strategy was used to
construct suicide vectors pG05, pG06, pG07, and pG08 to
generate the chromosomal gene integration of DascF::PT7 phaC
pduP, DmtlA::PT7 phaC pduP, DebgR::PT7 phaC pduP, andDmelR::PT7
phaC pduP, respectively.
Shake Flask Cultivation
The strain was inoculated into 500 ml baffled Erlenmeyer flasks
containing 100 mL of minimal medium, which contains 3 g/L
glucose, 20 g/L glycerol, 1.5 g/L KH2PO4, 3 g/L (NH4)2SO4,
1 g/L citric acid, 1 g/L citrate sodium, 1.9 g/L KCl, 3 g/L
MgSO4, 0.138 g/L FeSO4?7H2O, 4.5 mg/L vitamin B1, and
1 ml of trace element solution. The trace element solution
contained (per liter): 0.37 g (NH
4)6Mo7O24?4H2O, 2.47 g
H3BO4, 1.58 g MnCl 2?4H2O, 0.29 g ZnSO 4?7H2O, 0.25 g
CuSO4?5H2O. The culture broth was inoculated with the
overnight culture and incubated in a gyratory shaker incubator
at 37uC and 200 rpm. The cells were induced at OD600,0.6 with
0.05 mM IPTG and further incubated at 30uC. 5 mM of vitamin
B12 (VB12) and appropriate antibiotic were added every 12 h. The
cell dry weight (CDW) and P3HP yield were determined after 48 h
culturing. All shake flask experiments were carried out in
triplicates.
Fed-batch Fermentation
Fed-batch cultures were carried out in a Biostat B plus MO5L
fermentor (Sartorius Stedim Biotech GmbH, Germany) containing

3 L of minimal medium as described above. During the
fermentation process, pH was controlled at 7.0 via automated
addition of 5 M KOH and antifoam 204 was used for foam
control. The dissolved oxygen (DO) concentration was maintained
at 5% saturation by associating with agitation from 400 rmp to
800 rpm and aeration with the airflow rate of 2 liters per min.
After the initial carbon sources were nearly exhausted, fed-batch
mode was commenced by feeding a solution containing 10 M
glycerol at 0.5 mL/min. The expression of exogenous genes was
initiated at an OD
600 of 12 by adding 0.05 mM IPTG and 5mM
VB12. IPTG, VB12 and appropriate antibiotic were added every
12 h.
Cell Harvest, P3HP Extraction and Characterization
Cells ofE. coliwere harvested with centrifugation at 50006g for
15 min, and washed with distilled water twice. To determine
CDW, cell pellets were lyophilized, and the CDW was gravimet-
rically determined. P3HP was extracted from lyophilized cells with
hot chloroform in a Soxhlet apparatus, and precipitated by ice-
cold ethanol as described [17]. P3HP structure was confirmed by
NMR analysis using an Avance III 600 NMR spectrometer
(Bruker, Switzerland) as described previously [15].
Analysis of Antibiotic Concentration
Samples were withdrawn from the cultivation flask and
centrifuged at 50006g for 10 min. The supernatant was filtered
using 0.22- mm filter, and concentrations of ampicillin and
chloramphenicol were determined using Agilent 1200 HPLC
System as described previously [18,19].
Analysis of Plasmid Stability
To determine plasmid stability, samples were withdrawn from
the cultivation flask at assigned time, diluted and spread onto LB
agar plates with or without antibiotics supplemented. Ampicillin
and chloramphenicol were used for plasmids pWQ02/pG01 and
pWQ04/pG02, respectively. The plates were incubated for 16 h
at 37uC, and the colony-forming units (CFU) were determined and
analyzed by comparing the CFU on LB agar plates containing
antibiotics and CFU on LB agar plates without antibiotics.
SDS-PAGE. The strain Q1599 andE. coli BL21(DE3) were
grown in MM and induced by 0.05 mM IPTG. The cells were
harvested by centrifugation and lysed by sonication. The whole-
cell lysate was used for SDS-PAGE. Protein concentration was
determined using the Bradford Protein Assay Kit (Tiangen,
China). Proteins were separated in 12% acrylamide gels and
visualized with Coomassie brilliant blue R250.
Results
P3HP Production and Plasmid Stability of Strategy I Strain
In our previous study, the genes involved in P3HP synthesis
pathway were carried by two plasmids pWQ02 and pWQ04 [15].
An E. coliBL21(DE3) strain carrying pWQ02 and pWQ04, named
as Q1359, was used to test the P3HP production and plasmid
stability with the presence and absence of antibiotics. Without the
addition of antibiotics, strain Q1359 accumulated 0.34 g/L P3HP
representing 15.5% of the CDW under shaking flask condition.
When ampicillin and chloramphenicol were added into the culture
media, P3HP production and content increased to 0.52 g/L and

17.3%. After 48 h of cultivation, cultures were appropriately
diluted and spread onto LB agar plates with and without the
antibiotics to calculate the plasmid stability. Most of the cells lost
their plasmids even with antibiotic selection (Table 2), and it was
assumed that the segregational plasmid instability was caused by
two reasons. First, plasmid duplication increased metabolic burden
of the strain. Secondly, the antibiotic in medium was degraded
during culturing process. To test this speculation, the ampicillin
and chloramphenicol concentration in medium was determined by
HPLC. Surprisingly, no antibiotic can be detected after 48-h
cultivation even with periodic antibiotic addition every 12 h,
indicating that the antibiotic degraded very fast under concentra-
tions used in this study.
Construction and Characterization of Strain with PAS
To improve P3HP production and plasmid stability, a
phenylalanine/tyrosine-auxotrophy based PAS was designed and
constructed. The biosynthetic pathways of aromatic amino acids
phenylalanine and tyrosine share the first step, from chorismate to
prephenate catalyzed by bifunctional chorismate mutase/prephe-
nate dehydratase PheA or TyrA. Besides that, PheA also carries
out the second step in phenylalanine synthesis, converting
prephenate into 2-keto-phenylpyruvate [20], and TyrA is respon-
sible for the formation of 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate from pre-
phenate in tyrosine synthesis [21]. ThepheA and tyrA genes are
located next to each other inE. colichromosome, and transcription
of these 2 loci proceeds in opposite direction. In this study, anE.
coli DpheA DtyrA mutant Q1475 was constructed using suicide
vector pRE112 [16]. The chromosomal knockout ofpheA and tyrA
was verified by PCR and DNA sequencing. As shown in Figure 3,
strain Q1475 was not able to grow in minimal medium. When
phenylalanine and tyrosine were added, growth level and rate was
similar to the wild-typeE. coli BL21(DE3) strain, confirming the
Phe
2Tyr2 phenotype of strain Q1475.
To complement the phenylalanine/tyrosine-auxotrophy pheno-
type, the tyrA and pheA genes were cloned into pWQ04 and
pWQ02, and the resulting plasmids were named as pG01 and
pG02, respectively (Fig. S1 in File S1). ForpheA gene, the structure

Stable E. coli Strain for P3HP Production

gene and its own promoter region were amplified fromE. coli
chromosomal DNA. AstyrA is the second gene in cluster and does
not have its own promoter, a constitutive promoter Plac1–6 [22] was
fused to theE. coli tyrAcoding region by PCR. In order to rule out
the possible interferer between transcription ofpheA/tyrA gene and
P3HP synthesis associated genes, a bi-directional Rho-indepen-
dent transcriptional terminator [23] was added behind thepheA
and tyrA structural genes. The resulting plasmids pG01 and pG02
were confirmed by DNA sequencing, and transformed into Q1475
to generate Strategy II strain Q1509. In minimal medium without
addition of phenylalanine and tyrosine, strain Q1509 revealed a
similar growth with the wild-type strain (Fig. 3).
To verify P3HP accumulation and plasmid stability, strain
Q1509 was cultivated as described above. The results showed that
the phenylalanine/tyrosine-auxotrophy based PAS greatly in-
creased the stabilities of pG01 and pG02 (Table 2). In absence of
antibiotics, Q1509 exhibited plasmid stabilities of 42.9% for pG01
and 27.2% for pG02, more than 6-time higher than Strategy I
strain Q1359. When antibiotics were added into the medium, the
plasmid stabilities of pG01 and pG02 increased to 59.1% and
36.9%, respectively, about 4.5-time higher than strain Q1359.
Unfortunately, the P3HP production did not raise in proportion of
the plasmid stabilities. Only 0.55 g/L and 0.84 g/L P3HP were
harvested under the condition without and with antibiotics
addition, about 1.5-time higher compared with Q1359 (Table 2).
Construction and Characterization of CGI Strains
To insert the P3HP synthesis associated genes into E. coli
BL21(DE3) chromosome, a set of suicide plasmid was constructed
based on the vector pRE112 [16]. For example, the flanking
regions ofprpR gene were amplified and linked up with each other
by overlap extension PCR, and the restriction sites ofKpnI and
XhoI were introduced at the connection point by primer design.
This fragment was cloned into the vector pRE112 to generate
pRE112-DprpR. Then an XhoI-KpnI fragment from pWQ04,
encoding transcriptional regulator LacI and glycerol dehydratase
system, was inserted into the corresponding site of pRE112-DprpR,
and the resulting plasmid was defined as pLC01, which was used
to mediate the allelic exchange. After two rounds of selection
based on the positive marker chloramphenicol resistance genecat
and negative marker levan-sucrase gene sacB from Bacillus spp.
[24], we obtained the strain Q1463 carrying chromosomal copy of
dhaB123 and gdrAB genes (Figure S2 in File S1and Table 1). The
phaC1 and pduP genes were inserted into themtlA locus, mediated
by suicide vector pG06 similarly, to generate Strategy III strain
Q1599 (Figure 2, Figure S3 in File S1 and Table 1). TheprpR gene
and mtlA gene encode propionate catabolism regulator and
mannitol-specific phosphotransferase system (PTS) enzyme IIA
component, respectively. Under conditions used in this study, the
prpR and mtlA mutations shouldnot affect the cell metabolism.
Cultivated in minimal medium for 48 h, strain Q1599
accumulated 0.26 g/L P3HP, which represented 6.4% of the
CDW and was much lower than the P3HP productions of Q1359
and Q1509. To figure out the reason of low P3HP production in
strain Q1599, SDS-PAGE analysis of whole-cell lysate was
performed. Compared with the control strainE. coli BL21(DE3),
DhaB1 and GdrA were observed as distinct bands with the
expected molecular weights on SDS-PAGE, however we cannot
find the bands for PhaC1 and PduP at appropriate position. It is
assumed that the low copy number limited the expression level of
phaC1 and pduP genes, so another three copies of these two genes
were inserted into the chromosomal loci ofascF, ebgR and melR.
These three genes are all involved in degradation of carbon
compounds like cellobiose and lactose. As these disaccharide
molecules are absent, the inactivation of those genes should not be
detrimental to cell metabolism and growth. The result of shake
flask cultivation showed that the P3HP production increased with
the crescent copy number ofphaC1 and pduP genes (Table 3), to
the similar level of strains Q1359 and Q1509. Although this strain
is stable and antibiotic-free, its P3HP production was still too low.
Combination of CGI Strategy and Plasmid Vector
To further improve the P3HP production, we constructed the
Strategy IV strains, in which the CGI strategy and plasmid vector
were used simultaneously. The strain Q1638 carries a chromo-
somal copy of genes encoding glycerol dehydratase and its
reactivatase and plasmid-borne phaC1 and pduP genes, while in
strain Q1802 thephaC1 and pduP genes were integrated into the
mtlA locus and thedhaB and gdrAB genes were carried by plasmid
pWQ04 (Figure 2).
The strains Q1638 and Q1802 were inoculated into minimal
medium to test the P3HP production and plasmid stability. After
48 h of cultivation in shake flasks, the strain Q1638 accumulated
2.01 g/L and 2.34 g/L P3HP without and with addition of
ampicillin, respectively, while the strain Q1802 only produced
0.56 g/L and 0.83 g/L P3HP under the same conditions (Table 2).
In respect of plasmid stability, 76.4% of strain Q1638 cells still
carried plasmid pWQ02 at the end of cultivation even without
Table 2.P3HP production and plasmid stability of plasmid-containing strains.

Stable E. coli Strain for P3HP Production

addition of ampicillin, however only 13.1% of strain Q1802 cells
possessed the expression plasmid pWQ04 with the presence of
chloramphenicol (Table 2).
Based on Strategy IV strain Q1638, we developed Strategy V
strain Q1738 as following: the chromosomal tyrA gene was
knocked out and plasmid pWQ02 was replaced by pG01
(Figure 2). In shake flask cultivation, strain Q1738 revealed
similar P3HP production and slightly higher plasmid stability than
strain Q1638 (Table 2). Compared with original strain Q1359,
strains Q1638 and Q1738 presented about 4.5-time higher P3HP
production and only required the addition of ampicillin in the
growth process. Even without the usage of antibiotics, the P3HP
production of strains Q1638 and Q1738 was still about 4-time
higher than that of strain Q1359 with presence of ampicillin and
chloramphenicol.
Fed-batch Fermentation
To evaluate the P3HP production in a scalable process, fed-
batch fermentation of Q1638 and Q1738 was carried out at 5-L
scale under aerobic condition. Cell growth and P3HP accumula-
tion were monitored over the course of fermentation. As shown in
Figure 4, CDW and P3HP reached the maximum in 36 h. With
presence of ampicillin, the P3HP productions of trains Q1638 and
Q1738 were 24.3 g/L (58.1% of CDW) and 25.7 g/L (67.9% of
CDW), respectively. Even without antibiotic addition, 15.1 g/L
and 16.2 g/L P3HP was accumulated by trains Q1638 and
Q1738, respectively, higher than the previously reported P3HP
yield from glycerol [15].
Discussion
In this study, we are trying to construct a genetically stable
strain for P3HP biosynthesis. As shown in Table 2, the stability of
plasmid pWQ02 in stain Q1638 and plasmid pWQ04 in strain
Q1802 was significantly improved when compared with strain
Q1359. In strains Q1738 and Q1509, similar phenotype of
plasmid pG01 was also observed. All these three strains with
increased plasmid stability contain only one plasmid, whereas two
in strains Q1359 and Q 1509. This phenomenon indicated that
the plasmid stability would decrease if two or more types of
plasmid exist in the same strain. It was reported that the
segregative plasmid stability decreased with the size increasing,
and the metabolic burden caused by plasmid duplication is a
major reason for plasmid loss [25,26]. Multiple plasmids brought
about heavier burden on cell metabolism obviously, and a single
plasmid had better stability reasonably.
Another noticeable result is that the CDW and P3HP
production of strain Q1638 were much higher than that of
Q1359, and the only difference between these strains is the copy
number of glycerol dehydratase genes. Besides burden caused by
plasmid duplication, the toxic product of glycerol dehydratase was
also responsible for the low P3HP content. Glycerol dehydratase
converts glycerol into 3-hydroxypropionaldehyde, which is a
major component of antimicrobial substance Reuterin and inhibits
the growth of some bacteria, yeasts and protozoa [27,28]. The
difference between strains Q1509 and Q1738 can be explained in
the same way, and the intermediate toxicity was also the reason
that the CDW and P3HP production were significantly lower
when ampicillin was not supplemented in strains Q1638 and
Q1738 (Figure 4). They carry a chromosomal copy of glycerol
dehydratase gene, and the other genes involved in P3HP synthesis
were borne by plasmids with ampicillin resistance. When
ampicillin was absent, the plasmid instability increased, resulting
in intracellular accumulation of 3-hydroxypropionaldehyde and
growth depression.
In sum, the microbial P3HP production from glycerol was
improved greatly by constructing a genetically stable E. coli
recombinant strain. To overcome the strain instability due to
plasmid loss, two strategies, amino acid anabolism based PAS and
chromosomal integration, were tested. Finally, a combination
of those two methods led to the best result. Our recombinant
strain Q1738 produced 25.7 g/L P3HP from glycerol in aerobic

highest P3HP production from inexpensive carbon sources.
