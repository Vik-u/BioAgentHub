Abstract 
Background Fuels and chemicals derived from non‑fossil sources are needed to lessen human impacts on the envi‑
ronment while providing a healthy and growing economy. 3‑hydroxypropionic acid (3‑HP) is an important chemical 
building block that can be used for many products. Biosynthesis of 3‑HP is possible; however, low production is typi‑
cally observed in those natural systems. Biosynthetic pathways have been designed to produce 3‑HP from a variety of 
feedstocks in different microorganisms.
Results In this study, the 3‑HP β‑alanine pathway consisting of aspartate decarboxylase, β‑alanine‑pyruvate ami‑
notransferase, and 3‑hydroxypropionate dehydrogenase from selected microorganisms were codon optimized 
for Aspergillus species and placed under the control of constitutive promoters. The pathway was introduced into 
Aspergillus pseudoterreus and subsequently into Aspergillus niger, and 3‑HP production was assessed in both hosts. A. 
niger produced higher initial 3‑HP yields and fewer co‑product contaminants and was selected as a suitable host for 
further engineering. Proteomic and metabolomic analysis of both Aspergillus species during 3‑HP production identi‑
fied genetic targets for improvement of flux toward 3‑HP including pyruvate carboxylase, aspartate aminotransferase, 
malonate semialdehyde dehydrogenase, succinate semialdehyde dehydrogenase, oxaloacetate hydrolase, and a 
3‑HP transporter. Overexpression of pyruvate carboxylase improved yield in shake‑flasks from 0.09 to 0.12 C‑mol 3‑HP 
C‑mol−1 glucose in the base strain expressing 12 copies of the β‑alanine pathway. Deletion or overexpression of indi‑
vidual target genes in the pyruvate carboxylase overexpression strain improved yield to 0.22 C‑mol 3‑HP C‑mol−1 glu‑
cose after deletion of the major malonate semialdehyde dehydrogenase. Further incorporation of additional β‑alanine 
pathway genes and optimization of culture conditions (sugars, temperature, nitrogen, phosphate, trace elements) for 
3‑HP production from deacetylated and mechanically refined corn stover hydrolysate improved yield to 0.48 C‑mol 
3‑HP C‑mol−1 sugars and resulted in a final titer of 36.0 g/L 3‑HP .

Conclusions The results of this study establish A. niger as a host for 3‑HP production from a lignocellulosic feedstock 
in acidic conditions and demonstrates that 3‑HP titer and yield can be improved by a broad metabolic engineering 
strategy involving identification and modification of genes participated in the synthesis of 3‑HP and its precursors, 
degradation of intermediates, and transport of 3‑HP across the plasma membrane.

Background
The fuel and chemical products obtained from petro -
leum refineries have been essential in our daily life for 
more than a century. However, petroleum products are 
non-renewable and their production and use has contrib-
uted to widespread anthropogenic impacts on the earth’s 
atmosphere, lands, and oceans [1]. This has prompted the 
investigation of alternative routes to produce fuels and 
chemicals at low carbon intensity from renewable feed -
stocks [2]. Cost-effective utilization of existing industries 
to support the transition to alternative production routes 
for chemicals currently derived from petrochemical feed-
stocks will require synergistic efforts to maximize the 
output of biological systems and establish bioprocesses 
that are economically viable. To accomplish this, an Agile 
BioFoundry has been established to efficiently address 
the challenges associated with bioprocess development 
and engineer microorganisms for production of fuels and 
chemicals from renewable biomass feedstocks [3].
3-hydroxypropionic acid (3-HP) is a potential bio -
derived platform chemicals that can be converted into 
various commercial use chemicals, such as acrylic acid, 
malonic acid, 1,3-propanediol, and acrylamide, as well 
as direct use for production of biodegradable polymers 
[4, 5]. Chemical synthesis routes have been explored for 
3-HP production, but high costs and adverse environ -
mental impacts have limited chemical synthesis of 3-HP 
as a bulk chemical [6]. However, biological fermentation 
is a potential route for 3-HP production from renew -
able feedstocks and has been actively investigated for 
more than a decade [7, 8]. Naturally, there exist several 
3-HP production processes, such as  CO2 assimilation in 
Chloroflexus aurantiacus [9], cyanobacterium Synecho -
cystis sp. [10, 11], glycerol oxidation in Lactobacillus sp. 
[12, 13], acrylic acid degradation in Byssochlamys sp. [14] 
or Rhodococcus erythropolis [15], and uracil catabolism 
in Saccharomyces kluyveri [16] or E. coli K-12 [17]. How -
ever, the efficiency of 3-HP production in native micro -
organisms is very low. Therefore, genetic engineering of 
non-native hosts with novel synthetic 3-HP production 
pathways is actively being evaluated to improve 3-HP 
production.
Glycerol oxidation through a coenzyme A-independ -
ent pathway was initially detailed by Bieble et  al. for 
1,3-propanediol production in Clostridia and Entero -
bacteriaceae and the  NAD+-dependent aldehyde dehy -
drogenase that can convert 1,3-propanediol to 3-HP in 
Klebsiella pneumoniae by Raj et al. [18, 19]. E. coli or K. 
pneumoniae was genetically engineered and optimized 
for 3-HP production by combination of glycerol reduc -
tion and 3-HP production, which led to 70 to 80 g/l 3-HP 
production titer in fed-batch fermentations with glycerol 
as a carbon source [20, 21].
Biosynthetic routes to 3-HP via malonyl-CoA and 
β-alanine have been demonstrated in E. coli [22, 23] and 
further explored or optimized in various microorgan -
isms such as E. coli, cyanobacteria, and Saccharomy -
ces cerevisiae. For example, the malonyl-CoA pathway 
was introduced into E. coli for conversion of glucose to 
3-HP , which resulted in 10 g/l 3-HP production in 36 h 
[24]. Similar results were observed for the same pathway 
after integration into the chromosomes of S. cerevisiae or 
Schizosaccharomyces pombe [25, 26]. The β-alanine 3-HP 
pathway consisting of aspartate decarboxylase, β-alanine 
pyruvate transaminase, and 3-HP dehydrogenase was 
constructed and examined in the S. cerevisiae with pro -
duction titer of 13.4  g/l in controlled fed-batch fermen -
tation [27]. Recently, we demonstrated that the β-alanine 
3-HP pathway was functional in the acidophilic filamen -
tous fungus Aspergillus pseudoterreus [28].
Filamentous fungi such as Aspergillus species are 
used industrially for organic acid production because of 
their ability to grow at very low pH (< 2.0) and produce 
secreted metabolites in nutrient-limited growth condi -
tions, which eliminates the requirement of medium pH 
neutralization. A. pseudoterreus can secrete more than 
80  g/l of itaconic acid in culture medium [29, 30] and 
Aspergillus niger can grow in more than 20% glucose 
or sucrose and convert more than 90% of the feedstock 
to citric acid [31, 32]. In this study, we explored and 
improved 3-HP production via the β-alanine pathway in 
the industrial Aspergillus species.

Evaluation of 3‑HP production in Aspergillus pseudoterreus

aminotransferase (BAPAT), and Escherichia coli 
3-hydroxypropionate dehydrogenase (HPDH) has been 
established and demonstrated in S. cerevisiae [27] and 
A. pseudoterreus [28]. In this study, we examined the 
effect of supplementation with trace elements (TE) and 
complex nutrients on 3-HP production in transgenic 
strain A. pseudoterreus Ap3HP6 that contains two cop -
ies of the β-alanine pathway (Additional file  1: Figs. S1 
and S2) since the production medium B (RDM) was 
originally optimized for itaconic acid production [33]. 
Individual or combinations of TE were added to the base 
culture medium at up to 20-fold the original concentra -
tion. Figure 1A shows that both Cu and Fe enhance 3-HP 
production in modified production medium B (mRDM). 
However, no synergetic effects were observed when com-
binations of Cu, Fe, Mn, and Zn were added. In addition, 
supplementation with small amounts of nutrient-rich 
medium [0.5, 1, or 2  ml CM (complete medium)] sub -
stantially reduced 3-HP production.
We tested whether expression of the β-alanine path -
way for 3-HP production was limiting by overexpressing 
additional copies of the pathway. A transgene expression 
cassette containing one (3HP) or one with the aat over -
expression (3HP-aat) of the β-alanine pathway (Addi -
tional file  1: Figures S4 and S5) was randomly integrated 
into the chromosome of transgenic strain Ap3HP6. 3-HP 
titer in selected transgenic strains was increased up to 
3.4 g/l, about twice the concentration of the parent strain 
(Fig.  1B). In addition to 3-HP , significant amounts of 
other organic acids such as aconitic acid and citric acid 
were produced by A. pseudoterreus [28], suggesting that 
it may not be an ideal acidophilic filamentous fungus for 
3-HP production. Therefore, A. niger, an industrial spe -
cies used for citric acid production, was examined as a 
host for 3-HP production.
Evaluation of 3‑HP production in A. niger
The same linearized transgene expression cassette (Addi -
tional file 1: Figure S1A) used in A. pseudoterreus [28] was 
randomly integrated into the chromosomes of A. niger. 
Three transgenic A. niger strains, An3HP5, An3HP9, and 
An3HP10, were selected for evaluation of 3-HP produc -
tion in mRDM medium. The results in Fig.  2A show that 
transgenic strain An3HP9 produced the highest 3-HP 
titer, reaching 6.8 g/l in mRDM, a 200% increase over the 
highest titers produced by A. pseudoterreus. Prior to fur -
ther genetic engineering in the An3HP9 strain, the copy 
number was estimated by Southern blotting analysis. 
The results (are) shown in the Additional file  1: Figure S6 
shows that strain An3HP9 contains more than one copy 
of the β-alanine pathway for 3-HP production. The actual 
copies of insertion in An3HP9 were estimated as twelve 
by short-read whole genomic DNA sequencing (Table 1).
Multi‑omics analysis of 3‑HP production in Aspergillus 
species
In both A. pseudoterreus and A. niger, transformants of 
the same β-alanine pathway for 3-HP production were 
isolated that produce a broad range of 3-HP titers. We 
compared transformants of both species during time-
course cultivation in shake flasks in mRDM (Fig.  3A). 
In some cases, 3-HP titer declined later in the cultiva -
tion consistent with previous observations of 3-HP

spectrum of co-products is dissimilar. Aside from 3-HP , 
from the panel of metabolites quantified, only trehalose 
and citric acid were detected in the A. niger fermentation 
broth. In contrast, A. pseudoterreus produced a wide vari-
ety of contaminating co-products that include glycerol 
and most of the tricarboxylic acid (TCA)-cycle derived 
organic acids (Fig.  3B). Targeted peptides designed for 
the heterologous enzymes in the β-alanine pathway were 
used to compare expression level between the species 
(Fig. 3C) and confirmed that the pathway is expressed at 
a higher level in strains that produce more 3-HP .
Global proteomics and metabolomics were used to 
assess the impact of increasing 3-HP production on 
metabolism. Metabolomics revealed that in both species 
intracellular β-alanine, 3-HP , and 4-hydroxybutyrate were 
significantly increased in all transformed strains. Prot -
eomic analysis identified ALD6 as significantly upregu -
lated in all engineered strains indicating degradation via 
the pathway intermediate malonate semialdehyde is a 
conserved aspect of 3-HP metabolism in Aspergillus  spe-
cies. Proteins involved in the GABA shunt (UGA1 and 
UGA2) and a hydroxyacid-oxoacid transhydrogenase 
involved in conversion of α-ketoglutarate to succinate 
semialdehyde and mobilization of 4-hydroxybutyrate [34] 
are also responsive to 3-HP production and upregulated 
in all engineered strains (Fig. 3D).
Most enzymes along the ideal path from glucose to 
3-HP do not exhibit a consistent response to the presence 
of the heterologous 3-HP production pathway. However, 
in the highest producing A. niger strains alanine, gluta -
mate, and aspartate are depleted, suggesting that nitrogen 
pools may be stressed in this host, while in A. pseudoter -
reus glutamate and alanine are accumulated and both 
alanine transaminase and aspartate aminotransferase are 
downregulated.
Augmenting metabolic flux to precursor molecules 
required for 3‑HP production in A. niger
When directly compared, A. niger produced 3-HP with 
fewer co-product contaminants than A. pseudoterreus. 
We therefore focused on the improvement of 3-HP yield 
from glucose in A. niger. Carbon efficient flux toward 
3-HP relies on the precursor metabolites, oxaloacetate 
and aspartate. Omics analysis indicated that nitrogen 
pools that support flux through these metabolites may be 
strained and that the expression of pyruvate carboxylase, 
a critical step for carbon efficiency, may be limited in 
some strains. Flux toward oxaloacetate and aspartate was

examined for their contribution to 3-HP production in 
A. niger by overexpression of pyruvate carboxylase (pyc) 
and aspartate aminotransferase (aat). cDNA of aat or 
pyc under the control of tef1 (tef1p-aat, Additional file  1: 
Figure S7A),  or mbfA promoter  (mbfAp-pyc, Additional 
file  1: Figure S7B) or the combination of aat and pyc 
(tef1p-aat-pgkt-pyc-mbfAp, Additional file 1: Figure S7C) 
was integrated into transgenic strain An3HP9. Transfor -
mants were evaluated for 3-HP production (Additional 
file  1: Figure S8) and strains with improved titer were 
purified (Fig.  2B). Overexpression of aat increased titer 
of 3-HP up to 43%, while pyc overexpression increased 
titer by as much 93% compared to the original transgenic 
An3HP9 strain. This indicates that flux toward beach-
head metabolites for 3-HP is limiting in An3HP9; how -
ever, no synergistic effects were observed in transgenic 
strains overexpressing both aat and pyc together (Addi -
tional file 1: Figure S8C). The copy number of aat or pyc 
in transgenic strains An3HP9/aat5 and An3HP9/pyc2 
(Table 1) was estimated as five and eight by short-read 
whole genomic DNA sequencing, respectively.
Effects of genes involved in metabolism of β‑alanine 
pathway intermediates and 3‑HP transport in A. niger
Recently, we identified genes potentially involved in 
metabolism of 3HP pathway intermediates via multi-
omics studies in A. pseudoterreus [28] and confirmed 
many of these as targets in A. niger (Fig.  3). In this 
study, the A. niger homologs of malonate semialdehyde 
dehydrogenase (jgi|Asppseute1|414254 [Apald6] and 
jgi|Asppseute1|497789 [Apald3]), succinate semialde -
hyde dehydrogenase (jgi|Asppseute1|447301 [Apuga2 ]), 
a putative 3-HP transporter identified from A. pseu -
doterreus (jgi|Asppseute1|474223[Apmct1]), and A. 
niger oxaloacetate hydrolase (AnoahA ) were examined 
for their effect on 3-HP production in the transgenic 
An3HP9/pyc2 strain (Additional file  1: Figure S7E and 
S9). Single gene homologs were identified for all the tar -
gets except Apald6, where two homologs were identified 
in A. niger (Anald6a and Anald6b). The results in Fig.  2C 
show that disruption of Anald6a in strain 3HP/pyc2 
increased 3-HP titer by 83% to 16.5 g/l, while disruption 
of Anald6b and Anald3 increased titer by 45% and 26%, 
respectively suggesting that, while Anald6a is likely the 
major malonate semialdehyde dehydrogenase, all three 
contribute to directing flux away from 3-HP . In contrast, 
when Anuga2  was deleted, 3-HP production decreased 
by 37%. In this strain, growth and sugar conversion rate 
was decreased and the specific yield of 3-HP increased. 
This suggests that yield of 3-HP from sugars may be 
improved by limiting flux through the GABA shunt, 
but that deletion of the pathway entirely is overly detri -
mental to growth. Disruption of oxaloacetate hydrolase 
(AnoahA) increased the titer of 3-HP by 45% without 
impacting growth suggesting that flux toward oxalic acid, 
a product secreted by A. niger [35], represents a sub -
stantial loss in yield of 3-HP . A monocarboxylate trans -
porter (Anmct1, Additional file  1: Figure S7E), where the 
homolog in A. pseudoterreus responds to the presence of 
intracellular 3-HP [28], was overexpressed, resulting in 
a 35% improvement in 3-HP suggesting that transport 
across the plasma membrane may limit 3-HP production.
Effects of additional copies of β‑alanine pathway on 3‑HP 
production in A. niger
Our initial set of A. niger and A. pseudoterreus strains 
expressing various levels of the 3-HP production path -
way demonstrated that a higher expression level of the 
β-alanine pathway genes increased the yield of 3-HP 
(Fig. 3). To determine whether flux through the β-alanine 
pathway was still a limiting factor for the yield, we fur -
ther increased expression by randomly integrating a new 
transgene expression cassette (Additional file  1: Figure 
S10E) into the highest producing An3HP9/pyc2/ald6aΔ 
strain. Transformants with higher 3-HP titer than the 
parent were identified and the best performing single-
spore isolate produced 20.5 g/l 3-HP , a 53% improvement 
over the parent strain (Fig. 2D).
Short-read whole genome sequencing was performed 
on selected strains at critical points in the construc -
tion lineage to estimate copy number of the randomly 
integrated plasmids (Table  1). We found that approxi -
mately 12 copies of the β-alanine pathway were ran -
domly integrated into the A. niger chromosomes during 
construction of strain An3HP9 and that seven addi -
tional copies of pyc2 were integrated into the genome 
in strain An3HP9/pyc2. In the highest producing strain 
(An3HP9/pyc2/ald6a∆/3HP-6), we confirmed deletion 
of ald6a and found that an additional 15 copies of the 
β-alanine pathway were inserted into the genome bring -
ing the total copy-number of the β-alanine pathway to 
approximately 27 copies.
Optimization of culture conditions for 3HP production
Culture conditions for citric acid by A. niger have been 
optimized and are dependent on pH, as well as carbon, 
nitrogen, and manganese concentrations [31]. In this 
study, the effects of pH, manganese, and nitrogen on 
3-HP production were examined with initially geneti -
cally engineered strain An3HP9 or 3HP9/pyc2. The 
effects of citric acid production (CAP) versus mRDM 
medium were examined in the first A. niger transgenic 
strain An3HP9 by growing them in either CAP medium 
or mRDM with the pH ranging from 2.0 to 3.4 since pH 
2.0 is the optimal pH for CAP . 3-HP titer in CAP medium 
was 2.7 g/L, significantly lower than in mRDM across the 
Page 7 of 16
Dai et al. Biotechnology for Biofuels and Bioproducts           (2023) 16:53 
 
pH spectrum. (Additional file  1: Figure S1A). In mRDM, 
the spore germination rate increased with increasing pH 
up to 30.7% at pH 3.4 (Additional file  1: Figure S1B) and 
coincided with increased consumption of glucose result -
ing in an insignificantly lower yield of 3-HP .
To achieve maximal 3-HP production, the effects of 
manganese on 3-HP production were evaluated in the 
transgenic strain An3HP9/pyc2 strain, which contains 
8 copies of pyc transgene overexpression in An3HP9 
with 90% improvement in 3-HP production. When the 
strain was grown with 0 ~ 0.035  ppm manganese, 3-HP 
titer reached 5.5 g/l but when manganese was increased 
to 0.07, 0.7, 1.4, 14.0  ppm manganese, the 3-HP titer 
increased to 6.1, 6.7, 7.4, and 7.5  g/l, respectively, sug -
gesting that the required manganese level to support 
3-HP metabolism is around 1.4  ppm, about 140-fold 
higher than that required for citric acid production in A. 
niger (Fig. 4A). At all manganese concentrations, the yield 
of 3-HP was not significantly different while the yield of 
biomass trended downward with increasing manganese 
suggesting that the increased titer is due to differences 
in the rate of 3-HP production. The effect of nitrogen 
concentration and source, in the form of  (NH4)2SO4 
or  NH4NO3, on 3-HP production in the An3HP9/pyc2 
strain was also examined (Fig.  4B). 3-HP production 
increased from 2.5 to 9.7 g/l when the strain was grown 
in mRDM with 1.16, 2.36, or 4.72 g/l  (NH4)2SO4, respec-
tively. Increasing nitrogen increased the sugar conver -
sion rate, but overall yield was still significantly higher 
at the greatest  (NH4)2SO4 concentration (p < 0.01). The 
β-alanine pathway to produce 3-HP is dependent on bal -
anced flux through three transaminases [AAT, alanine 
transaminase (ALT), and BAPAT] and excess nitrogen 
may be required to support efficient flux through these 
reactions. When the strain was grown in mRDM with 
increasing concentrations of  NH4NO3, 3-HP produc -
tion decreased suggesting that the impact of  NO3 as a 
nitrogen source may be detrimental to 3-HP production. 
The optimal nitrogen source for batch 3-HP production 
in shake-flasks was 4.72  g/l of  (NH4)2SO4, which corre -
sponds to a C/N ratio of 40.
Production of 3‑HP from lignocellulosic feedstock derived 
sugars
In addition to purified glucose as a carbon source for 
3-HP production, we considered sugars derived from 
lignocellulosic biomass as a feedstock. Corn stover 
was subjected to dilute alkali deacetylation prior to 
disk refining and enzymatic hydrolysis (DDR-EH) to 
release glucose and xylose monomers [36, 37]. We 
investigated conversion of sugars produced by the 
DDR-EH process using both An3HP9/pyc2/ald6aΔ and 
An3HP9/pyc2/ald6aΔ /3HP-6 strains with the highest 
3-HP production titers. We initially tested 3-HP pro -
duction of An3HP9/pyc-2/ald6aΔ strain in RDM to 
provide essential micro and macro-nutrients with 
increasing concentrations of sugars from the DDR-EH 
process to identify limits on conversion due to toxicity. 
We found that A. niger was able to germinate and grow 
in up to 200 g/L total sugars from the DDR-EH process 
(Fig.  5A) with a significantly lower yield of 3-HP at the 
highest sugar concentration where growth was maxi -
mized. We next looked at the impact of temperature 
on conversion in DDR-EH and found that 34–37  °C 
significantly improved both 3-HP yield and titer with 
a maximum of 29.4  g/L 3-HP and 0.35 C-mol 3-HP 
C-mol−1 sugars (Fig.  5B). Sugars produced using the

DDR-EH process contain a wide variety of character -
ized and unknown metabolites. To determine whether 
phosphate, nitrogen, and trace elements (TE) required 
for growth and production are present at necessary 
levels in DDR-EH, we modified their concentration up 
and down by fivefold to represent limiting and excess 
concentrations (Fig.  5C). We found that reducing phos -
phate or nitrogen concentration reduced biomass pro -
duction and 3-HP titer suggesting that DDR-EH needs 
to be supplemented with both of these macronutrients 
to maximize 3-HP production. However, reduction of 
TE significantly improved 3-HP titer (p  < 0.05) while 
excess TE had no impact on growth or productivity 
suggesting that TE in DDR-EH may be present at nec -
essary concentrations without supplementation. When 
excess nitrogen was supplied, 3-HP titer and yield were 
both significantly improved without increasing biomass 
suggesting that supply of precursors for the multiple 
transaminases of the β-alanine pathway may not be 
optimized and flux is aided by the presence of excess 
nitrogen.
Some of the potential improvements in cultiva -
tion conditions to increase yield, rate, or cost for 
production of 3-HP from DDR-EH derived sug -
ars were combined and tested with the highest yield 
An3HP9/pyc2/ald6a∆/3HP-6 strain. The standard con -
centration of sugars was increased to 150  g/L (97.5  g/L 
glucose and 52.5  g/L xylose) and the temperature 
increased to 34 °C prior to retesting the impacts of nitro -
gen and trace elements (Fig.  6). With the combined 
improvements in the standard RDM with 1 × TE and 
1 × N [2.36 g/l  (NH4)2SO4], 36.0 g/l 3-HP was produced, 
and the yield was improved to 0.48 C-mol 3-HP C-mol −1 
sugars. We found that reducing or completely eliminat -
ing the addition of TE from the standard RDM did not 
have a significant impact on growth or 3-HP produc -
tion. Increasing the concentration of nitrogen tended 
to increase the amount of biomass produced and, in all 
cases, significantly decreased the yield of 3-HP .
Discussion
The biosynthesis of 3-HP as a secreted monomer or an 
intracellular polymer has been examined in a variety of 
microorganisms and from various feedstocks. Produc -
tion of monomeric 3-HP as a precursor for commodity 
chemical production has been proposed and developed 
primarily using sugars or glycerol as feedstocks, both of 
which have the potential to offer economic and green-
house gas emission benefits compared to petroleum 
derived feedstocks [38]. Production of 3-HP from glyc -
erol as a feedstock using bacterial hosts has made sub -
stantial gains toward economic viability [39, 40]; however, 
high-yield production from sugar feedstocks has been 
more challenging [41] with only modest yields achieved

in hosts that require expensive nutrient supplements and 
are limited to production of 3-hydroxypropionate near 
neutral pH production conditions rather than 3-hydroxy-
propionic acid (Table  2). We therefore engineered the 
β-alanine pathway, which was initially alluded to in pat -
ents granted to Cargill/Novozymes [42] and later estab -
lished academically in the yeast S. cerevisiae [27], in the 
filamentous fungal hosts A. pseudoterreus and A. niger, 
which have been demonstrated at scale for industrial pro-
duction of organic acids at acidic pH (< 2.0) and are capa-
ble of converting mixed sugar feedstocks with minimal 
nutrients and without pH neutralization requirement. 
After several DBTL (design-build-test-learn) cycles and 
culture optimizations, the 3-HP production in the best A. 
niger transgenic strain reached 36.0 g/l with the DDR-EH 
derived sugars from corn stover, which is summarized in 
Fig. 7.
In the first design-build-test-learn (DBTL) cycle, the 
β-alanine pathway was functionally expressed in the fila -
mentous fungus A. pseudoterreus and genes related to 
3-HP degradation enzymes (Apald6, Ap ald3, Ap uga2) 
and monocarboxylate transport across the plasma mem -
brane (Apmct1) were identified via transcriptomic and 
proteomic analyses [28]. The lessons we learned from the 
first DBTL cycle in A. pseudoterreus facilitated the trans -
fer of the β-alanine pathway into the A. niger, citric acid 
production strain [43]. The same transgene expression 
cassette used in A. pseudoterreus was randomly chromo -
somally integrated into A. niger and conferred a higher 
initial titer of 3-HP . Analysis of both species revealed 
that increased 3-HP yield correlates to copy number and 
expression level of the β-alanine pathway, which may 
explain the higher initial titers in the A. niger strains. Pro-
duction of other organic acids, such as citric acid, was

below the detection limit in A. niger allowing more car -
bon to be routed toward 3-HP production.
The effects of increasing the intracellular pool of pre -
cursor metabolites such as oxaloacetate and aspartic acid 
on 3-HP production were first evaluated by increasing 
the expression of aat1, or pyc in the An3HP9 transgenic 
strain with about 30 to 90% improvements in 3-HP titer 
in the selected transgenic strains. Elimination of car -
bon fluxes competing with β-alanine pathway metabolic 
intermediates oxaloacetate, malonic semialdehyde, and 
glutamate/α-ketoglutarate was also examined in trans -
genic strain An3HP9/pyc2. All exhibited positive effects 
on 3-HP production and 83% improvement in titer of 
3-HP production were observed with the disruption of 
ald6a gene. Previously we observed significant improve -
ments in flux toward 3-HP in A. pseudoterreus after dis -
ruption of Apald6 [28] that are consistent with results 
from the homolog in Candida albicans [44]. This high -
lights that while ald6a may be the major contributor to 
the pathway competition, A. niger encodes at least three 
enzymes capable of metabolizing the 3-HP precursor 
malonic semialdehyde that may need to be simultane -
ously disrupted to maximize yield of 3-HP .
To test for the possibility of reactions limiting the final 
steps in conversion of pyruvate to 3-HP we increased 
the expression level of the heterologous enzymes in the 
β-alanine pathway in the An3HP9/pyc2/ald6aΔ strain by 
increasing the chromosomally integrated copy-number 
of the pathway from 12 to 27 (Fig.  2D, Table 1). We also 
overexpressed a putative 3-HP transporter identified 
from our previous work [28] to test whether export may 
be limiting (Fig.  2C). In both cases, increased expression 
improved the yield of 3-HP suggesting that the expres -
sion level of critical enzymes for 3-HP production is still 
limiting in the engineered strains and highlighting the 
need for novel metabolic engineering tools in Aspergillus  
species capable of increasing expression level of enzymes 
orders of magnitude beyond what is currently possible.
In addition to modification of pathway enzymes in the 
transgenic strains, culture conditions play an essential 
role in directing metabolic flux toward 3-HP . The initial 
pH in A. niger cultures for citric acid production is 2.0 
and manganese is limited to 10 ppb [31]. Here, we found 
that an initial pH range from 3.4 to 2 did not significantly 
affect 3-HP yield in the An3HP9 strain though the spore 
germination frequency is higher at pH 3.4. 3-HP is pro -
duced in CAP medium which supports overflow metabo -
lism, but to a lesser extent than in the mRDM medium. 
Therefore, the effects of the mRDM medium on 3-HP 
production were further optimized by alternation of 
individual components. Maintenance of manganese at a 
very low concentration (~ 10 ppb) is required to support 
high-yield production of citric acid in A. niger [31, 45] 
as well as itaconic acid in A. pseudoterreus [46]. In this 
study, however, we found that 100-fold higher concentra-
tions of manganese in the culture medium support 3-HP 
production highlighting the difference in metabolism 
between production of 3-HP and the organic acids typi -
cally produced by these organisms. Tolerance, or even a 
requirement for higher concentrations of trace elements 
for 3-HP production, avoids some of typical challenges 
with organic acid production by Aspergilli  whereby

micro-nutrients leaching from metal fermentation ves -
sels or present as contaminants in feedstock sugars nega -
tively impact yield [45].
An essential component of economically viable 3-HP 
production is utilization of inexpensive feedstocks [4]. 
The 3-HP production on a DDR-EH derived sugars from 
corn stover was evaluated and optimized with the higher 
3-HP production transgenic strains. We found that raw 
DDR-EH requires supplementation macro-nutrients 
(nitrogen and phosphate) to support growth and 3-HP 
production by A. niger, but that the trace elements added 
to RDM can be eliminated as an additive to reduce cost. 
The optimal temperature for 3-HP production was 
around 34  °C, which is consistent with optimal temper -
atures for enzyme activities of PAND (50  °C) of T. cas -
taneum [47], BAPAT (35 °C) of B. cereus [48], and HPDH 
(37 °C) of E. coli K12-TG1 [49]. Increasing the concentra-
tion of  (NH4)2SO4 to the optimal level in RDM supported 
more growth but reduced the yield of 3-HP in DDR-EH 
suggesting a lower concentration of nitrogen can be used 
to further reduce production costs.
Engineering efforts to produce 3-HP in fungi have 
demonstrated modest yields from pure glucose and 
xylose but typically supplement with vitamins [25, 27, 50, 
51]. Efforts have been made to produce 3-HP in the yeast 
S. cerevisiae in acidic conditions below the pKa of 3-HP , 
however yield was nearly half that achieved at pH 5 [27]. 
Engineering efforts to produce 3-HP from mixed sugars 
in bacteria (E. coli and C. glutamicum) have also been 
successful but typically require growth at neutral pH and 
supplementation with vitamins and a complex nutrient 
source such as yeast extract or corn-steep liquor [52–55]. 
Production of 3-HP using A. niger alleviates many of the 
economic issues presented by model yeast and bacterial 
hosts by eliminating the need to supplement with costly 
vitamins and complex nutrients and allowing for pro -
duction as a free acid amenable to low-cost purification 
strategies (Table 2).
Conclusions
In summary, the β-alanine pathway functions and ena -
bles high-yield 3-HP production at acidic pH from low-
cost sugars derived from corn stover in the industrial 
filamentous fungus A. niger. Results from a DBTL cycle 
comparing multiple species and strains in conjunction 
with optimization of cultivation conditions dramatically 
increased the yield of 3-HP to 48% of the no-growth 
theoretical yield from a corn-stover feedstock. This work 
establishes Aspergillus species as a platform for com -
mercial production of renewable 3-HP as a precursor for 
a variety of fossil-derived chemicals including 1,3-pro -
panediol, acrylic acid, methyl acrylate, acrylamide, and 
acrylonitrile. Future work focused on stacking of genetic 
improvements identified herein a single transgenic strain 
and scale-up will de-risk commercial production of 
renewable 3-HP and support the transition of commod -
ity-scale chemical synthesis to lower green-house gas 
emitting processes.
Methods
Strains and media
The Escherichia coli strain Top10 was used for routine 
plasmid DNA preparation. A. pseudoterreus (ATCC 
32359) and A. niger (ATCC 11414) from the American 
Type Culture Collection (Rockville, MD, USA) were 
grown on complete medium (CM) or potato dextrose 
agar (PDA) plates at 30  °C for culture maintenance and 
spore preparation. About 1 ×  104 to 1 ×  105 spores were 
inoculated on CM agar (petri dish) plates and incubated 
for four days at 30 °C. Spores were harvested by washing 
with 5–10  ml sterile 0.4% Tween 80 (polyoxyethylene -
sorbitan monooleate) and pelleted by centrifugation at 
2500 g for 5 min. The spores were re-suspended in ster -
ile 0.4% Tween 80 and enumerated with a hemocytom -
eter. Aliquots of the resulting spore suspension (about 
 108 ~  109 spores/ml) were used to inoculate different 
agar-plates or liquid cultures. The preparation of PDA, 
CM, and minimal medium (MM) followed the descrip -
tion of Bennett and Lasure [56]. All strains used in this 
study are shown in Table 3.
Preparation of transgene expression constructs for gene 
overexpression or gene disruption in A. pseudoterreus 
and A. niger
In our previous study, the β-alanine pathway transgene 
expression cassette with pyrithiamine resistance gene 
(ptrA) of Aspergillus oryzae as a selection marker was 
described previously [28]. In this study, all transgene 
expression cassettes were prepared with Gibson assem -
bly master mix (NEB, Ipswich, MA, USA) and the DNA 
fragments were isolated by PCR with Phusion high-
fidelity DNA polymerase (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 
Waltham, MA 02451, USA). Different transgene expres -
sion cassettes, related intermediate plasmids, or selection 
marker gene cassettes prepared for this study are thor -
oughly described in the section of “Detailed description 
of transgene vector construction for selected gene over -
expression or disruption in Aspergillus pseudoterreus or 
Aspergillus niger” in Additional file 1.
Culture methods
Pyrex 125  ml or 250  ml glass Erlenmeyer flasks were 
prepared by filling with 5% Contrad 70 (Decon Labs, 
Inc., King of Prussia, PA, USA) and soaked overnight 
to remove any potential residues on the inside surface 
of flasks prior to general dishwashing. Silicon sponge

closures were used for all flask cultures. The biomass of 
transgenic clones and parent strain for genomic DNA 
isolation were prepared from 2  mL stationary CM cul -
tures with proper antibiotics and grown in 13 × 100 mm 
glass culture-tubes for 24–36  h at 30  °C. The biomass 
formed on the surface of the liquid culture medium was 
collected, frozen immediately in liquid nitrogen and 
dried in the VirTis benchtop manifold freeze dryer (SP 
Scientific, Gardiner, NY, USA). For 3-HP production, 
35 ml of citric acid production (CAP) medium was pre -
pared by the following previous descriptions [31]. Pro -
duction medium B (RDM) [33] or modified production 
medium B (mRDM) [28, 33] that contains 20 × TE (trace 
elements: 4  mg/l  CuSO4.5H2O; 110  mg/l  FeSO4.7H2O; 
14  mg/l  MnCl2.4H2O; and 26  mg/l  ZnSO4.7H2O) was 
also used. The fermented sugars liberated from corn 
stover by deacetylated and disk-refined process (DDR), in 
which the biomass was deacetylated with dilute alkaline 
at low temperature first, then mechanically refined in 
an industrial size disk refiner, and finally enzymatically 
hydrolyzed [DDR-EH; Batch 1–19-05, 20190829, [57]], 
were obtained from the Pilot Plant at National Renewable 
Energy Laboratory (Golden, CO, USA).
Chemical‑mediated protoplast transformation of A. niger
The protoplast preparation and chemical-mediated 
transformation followed the method described by Dai 
et al. [58] for A. niger. Briefly, the 14.4 kb plasmid DNA 
of the β-alanine pathway transgene expression construct 
was linearized by restriction enzyme EcoRV and con -
centrated down to about 1 µg/µl with Microcon-30 kDa 
centrifugal filter unit (MilliporeSigma, Burlington, MA, 
USA). Ten microliters of the linearized plasmid DNA 
were used for protoplast transformation in A. niger. For 
transgene overexpression of A. niger aat1, pyc, the aat1-
pyc, or mct1 gene in A. niger, about 3–5 µg of linearized

plasmid DNAs by proper restriction enzymes were used 
for protoplast transformation. For the gene deletion 
construct of ald6a, ald6b, oah1, or uga2  gene homolog, 
about 1  µg of linearized plasmid DNAs by restriction 
enzyme PmeI was used for protoplast transformation in 
A. niger. Usually, about 5 to 12 transformed clones were 
picked randomly for the evaluation of 3-HP production 
and the effects of selected genes on 3-HP production. 
The chemical-mediated protoplast transformation of A. 
pseudoterreus was mainly followed the previous descrip -
tion [59].
Total genomic DNA isolation for PCR, Southern blotting 
analysis, and short‑read whole genomic DNA sequencing
Total genomic DNA was isolated from A. niger or A. 
pseudoterreus cells using a cetyltrimethylammonium 
bromide (CTAB) extraction method with some modifi -
cations. Briefly, 50–100  mg of lyophilized biomass and 
two 3.5 mm diameter glass beads were transferred into a 
2 mL polypropylene micro-vial, where biomass was pul -
verized into fine power with a Mini-Beadbeater-8 (Bio 
Spec Products Inc., Bartlesville, OK, USA) for 50 s. The 
disrupted cells in microcentrifuge tubes were re-sus -
pended with 800–900 µl of CTAB solution and incubated 
at 60  °C for 30 ~ 45  min and inverted occasionally. The 
genomic DNA in the supernatant of the cell extracts was 
extracted with 300 µl of phenol/chloroform solution and 
precipitated with 1 volume of 2-propanol. The genomic 
DNA was resuspended with 200  µl of 50TE (50  mM 
Tris–HCl, pH8.0 and 10  mM EDTA, pH8.0) and 25  µg 
of RNase and incubated for 30 ~ 45  min at 50  °C. After 
RNase treatment, the genomic DNA was extracted twice 
with 125 µl of phenol/chloroform solution and once with 
chloroform. The genomic DNA in the supernatants was 
precipitated with 1  M NaCl and 2 volume of 95% etha -
nol for 15 min at room temperature and centrifugation at 
10,000 × g for 8 min. Finally, the genomic DNA pellet was 
washed with 70% ethanol and was resuspended in 10 mM 
Tris–HCl (pH 8.0) buffer at 50 °C for 15–20 min and the 
concentration was determined with a Qubit fluorometer 
(Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). Fifty 
to seventy ng of total genomic DNA were used for PCR 
analyses.
For Southern blotting analyses of heterologous expres -
sion of β-alanine pathway in either A. niger or A. pseu -
doterreus, 1  µg of total genomics DNA was digested 
with the restriction endonuclease Bam HI, EcoRV, or 
HindIII. The genomic DNA fragments were separated 
in 1% agarose gel electrophoretically and transferred 
onto the Hybond-N + nylon membrane (GE Healthcare 
Bio-Sciences, Pittsburgh, PA, USA) with alkaline capil -
lary transfer method. The 1.0 kb 3’-end of genomic DNA 
fragments of A. pseudoterreus cad1 gene was used for 
the preparation of the biotin-labeled probe. The genomic 
DNA in the Hybond-N + nylon membrane was hybrid -
ized with the biotin-labeled probe overnight at 60 °C in 
the Problot Hybridization Oven (Labnet International, 
Edison, NJ, USA). The genomic DNA on the hybridized 
membrane was visualized with North2South chemilumi -
nescent detection kit (Pierce Protein Research Products, 
Rockford, IL, USA) in Analytikjena UVP ChemStudio 
(Analytik Jena US, Upland, CA, USA).
The short-read whole genomic DNA sequencing was 
carried out by Azenta Life Sciences (South Plainfield, 
NJ, USA). The integration copy number was estimated 
by fold-increase of reads mapped to the expression con -
struct versus background single copy regions of the 
genome. The sequenced short-reads were mapped to 
the reference genome sequence of A. niger ATCC 1015 
(https:// mycoc  osm. jgi. doe. gov/ Aspni7/ Aspni7. home. 
html) augmented with the overexpressed gene sequence 
using BWA-MEM [60]. The mapped reads were sorted 
using SAMtools [61] and duplicate reads were marked 
using Picard Toolkit (https:// github. com/ broad insti 
tute/ picard# citing) to produce BAM files for copy num -
ber estimation. The copy numbers of β-alanine pathway 
genes and engineered native genes were estimated using 
CNVnator [62]. The mapped reads were counted using 
bin sizes of 100, 200, and 1,000  bp, and the read depth 
signal was partitioned into segments for each bin size. 
The average and standard deviation of read depth signal 
were evaluated for bin sizes of 100 and 200 bp, and copy 
number genotype was estimated based on the normal -
ized read depth using the bin size of 100 bp.
Metabolites analysis by HPLC
The extracellular metabolites were quantified by HPLC. 
Twenty-five microliters of the samples filtered with 
0.2 µm syringe filters were analyzed for 45 min using an 
Aminex HPX-87H ion exclusion column with a 1  mM 
 H2SO4 flow of 0.6  ml/ml. The temperature of the col -
umn was 60 °C. The refractive index at 45 °C and the UV 
absorption at 210 nm were measured.
Sample preparation for metabolomics and proteomics 
analyses
Briefly, the culture supernatants or biomass (cell pellet) 
for A. niger or A. pseudoterreus were harvested at day 
4. For quantification of extracellular metabolites diluted 
spent medium samples (by a 1/8 factor) were dried, pre -
pared, and analyzed as described previously [28]. The 
cell pellets were extracted using the MPLex protocol [63] 
and extracts were analyzed using GC–MS as explained 
previously in detail [64]. The protein interlayer pellet 
was digested and prepared for global proteomics analy -
sis and targeted proteomics analysis, the latter using 
Page 14 of 16Dai et al. Biotechnology for Biofuels and Bioproducts           (2023) 16:53 
heavy labeled peptides. Instrument acquisition and data 
analysis were done as described in a previous publication 
[28]. Global proteomics data were generated using a Q 
Exactive Plus mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scien -
tific, Waltham, MA, USA) in data-dependent acquisition 
mode.
