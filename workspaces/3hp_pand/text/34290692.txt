Ammonia-oxidizing archaea of the phylum Thaumarchaeota are among the most
abundant organisms that exert primary control of oceanic and soil nitriﬁcation and
are responsible for a large part of dark ocean primary production. They assimilate
inorganic carbon via an energetically efﬁcient version of the 3-hydroxypropionate/4-
hydroxybutyrate cycle. In this cycle, acetyl-CoA is carboxylated to succinyl-CoA, which
is then converted to two acetyl-CoA molecules with 4-hydroxybutyrate as the key
intermediate. This conversion includes the ( S)-3-hydroxybutyryl-CoA dehydrogenase
reaction. Here, we heterologously produced the protein Nmar_1028 catalyzing this
reaction in thaumarchaeon Nitrosopumilus maritimus , characterized it biochemically
and performed its phylogenetic analysis. This NAD-dependent dehydrogenase is highly
active with its substrate, ( S)-3-hydroxybutyryl-CoA, and its low Km value suggests that
the protein is adapted to the functioning in the 3-hydroxypropionate/4-hydroxybutyrate
cycle. Nmar_1028 is homologous to the dehydrogenase domain of crotonyl-CoA
hydratase/(S)-3-hydroxybutyryl-CoA dehydrogenase that is present in many Archaea.
Apparently, the loss of the dehydratase domain of the fusion protein in the course
of evolution was accompanied by lateral gene transfer of 3-hydroxypropionyl-CoA
dehydratase/crotonyl-CoA hydratase from Bacteria. Although ( S)-3-hydroxybutyryl-
CoA dehydrogenase studied here is neither unique nor characteristic for the HP/HB
cycle, Nmar_1028 appears to be the only ( S)-3-hydroxybutyryl-CoA dehydrogenase in
N. maritimus and is thus essential for the functioning of the 3-hydroxypropionate/4-
hydroxybutyrate cycle and for the biology of this important marine archaeon.

INTRODUCTION
Biological inorganic carbon ﬁxation, the oldest and quantitatively most important biosynthetic
process in Nature, proceeds via at least seven natural pathways (Berg, 2011; Fuchs, 2011;
Sánchez-Andrea et al., 2020). Two of these pathways, the 3-hydroxypropionate/4-hydroxybutyrate
(HP/HB) and the dicarboxylate/4-hydroxybutyrate (DC/HB) cycles were found only in Archaea

Liu et al. (S)-3-Hydroxybutyryl-CoA Dehydrogenase From Nitrosopumilus maritimus
(Berg et al., 2010a). In both of these cycles, acetyl-CoA
is carboxylated to succinyl-CoA, which is then reduced to
two acetyl-CoA molecules, regenerating the inorganic carbon
acceptor and forming the ﬁnal product of the cycle(s)
(Figure 1 ). However, the carboxylation reactions are diﬀerent.
The carboxylases in the DC/HB cycle are ferredoxin-dependent
pyruvate synthase and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase (Huber
et al., 2008; Ramos-Vera et al., 2009), while a promiscuous
acetyl-CoA/propionyl-CoA carboxylase catalyzes both acetyl-
CoA and propionyl-CoA carboxylations in the HP/HB cycle
(Chuakrut et al., 2003; Hügler et al., 2003). In the latter case, a
number of speciﬁc enzymes are responsible for the conversion
of malonyl-CoA, the product of the acetyl-CoA carboxylase
reaction, to propionyl-CoA, which is then carboxylated and
isomerized to succinyl-CoA ( Figure 1 ). Further metabolism
of succinyl-CoA is identical in both cycles. Succinyl-CoA
reduction leads to the formation of 4-hydroxybutyrate, which is
converted to 4-hydroxybutyryl-CoA and dehydrated to crotonyl-
CoA. Crotonyl-CoA conversion to two acetyl-CoA molecules
proceeds through the reactions known from β-oxidation:
hydration of crotonyl-CoA to ( S)-3-hydroxybutyryl-CoA, its
oxidation to acetoacetyl-CoA and cleavage to two acetyl-CoA
molecules (Figure 1).
The DC/HB cycle functions in anaerobic Crenarchaeota of
the orders Desulfurococcales and Thermoproteales (Huber et al.,
2008; Ramos-Vera et al., 2009; Berg et al., 2010b), while the
HP/HB cycle is present in aerobic Sulfolobales (Crenarchaeota)
and ammonia-oxidizing Thaumarchaeota (AOA) (Ishii et al.,
1997; Berg et al., 2007, 2010a; Könneke et al., 2014). For both
cycles, variants exist. Although it appears that the cycles in
Thermoproteales and Desulfurococcales evolved from a common
ancestor, the representatives of these two orders use a number
of phylogenetically unrelated enzymes (e.g., succinyl-CoA
reductase, succinic semialdehyde reductase) (Huber et al., 2008;
Ramos-Vera et al., 2009; Flechsler et al., 2021). For the HP/HB
cycle, two fundamentally diﬀerent variants function in Cren- and
in Thaumarchaeota. The thaumarchaeal variant uses ADP/P i-
producing 3-hydroxypropionyl-CoA and 4-hydroxybutyryl-CoA
synthetases, while non-homologous synthetases produce AMP
and PPi in the crenarchaeal HP/HB cycle in the corresponding
reactions (Berg et al., 2007; Hawkins et al., 2013, 2014;
Könneke et al., 2014). The usage of ADP-producing synthetases
makes the thaumarchaeal HP/HB cycle the energetically most
eﬃcient aerobic autotrophic pathway (Könneke et al., 2014).
The characteristic enzymes of these two variants of the cycle
are mostly phylogenetically unrelated, implying the involvement
of convergent evolution in their emergence (Berg et al., 2007;
Könneke et al., 2014; Otte et al., 2015).
Both DC/HB and HP/HB cycles (and all their variants)
have in common that crotonyl-CoA is converted to acetoacetyl-
CoA (Figure 1). The corresponding enzymes are widespread in
prokaryotes, being an interesting example of the involvement of
convergent evolution and vertical gene transfer in the emergence
of diﬀerent autotrophic pathways, and a possible role of lateral
gene transfer in this process. In the DC/HB cycle, this conversion
is catalyzed by a bifunctional crotonyl-CoA hydratase/( S)-3-
hydroxybutyryl-CoA dehydrogenase consisting of two domains,
a C-terminal enoyl-CoA hydratase domain and an N-terminal
dehydrogenase domain (Ramos-Vera et al., 2011; Flechsler
et al., 2021). This protein is widespread among Archaea and
was probably present in the last common ancestor of the
TACK-superphylum consisting of T haum-, A ig-, C ren-, and
Korarchaeota (Williams et al., 2017). Sulfolobales also possess
a homologous crotonyl-CoA hydratase/( S)-3-hydroxybutyryl-
CoA dehydrogenase. Although this protein is present in
autotrophically grown Metallosphaera sedula (Sulfolobales) cells
(Ramos-Vera et al., 2011; Liu et al., 2021), it is responsible
only for a minute ﬂux in the crotonyl-CoA conversion to
acetoacetyl-CoA in this archaeon (Liu et al., 2020, 2021). In
contrast to the organisms using the DC/HB cycle, M. sedula and
other Sulfolobales possess stand-alone crotonyl-CoA hydratase
and ( S)-3-hydroxybutyryl-CoA dehydrogenase enzymes in the
HP/HB cycle (Liu et al., 2020). Their crotonyl-CoA hydratase is
a promiscuous protein that has also a high 3-hydroxypropionyl-
CoA dehydratase activity and thus catalyzes two (de)hydratase
reactions in the cycle (Liu et al., 2021). Thaumarchaeota
also use a similar promiscuous enzyme to catalyze these two
reactions (Liu et al., 2021). Interestingly, crenarchaeal and
thaumarchaeal 3-hydroxypropionyl-CoA dehydratases/crotonyl-
CoA hydratases are closely related to bacterial enoyl-CoA
hydratases but were retrieved independently by the ancestors of
Sulfolobales and AOA from diﬀerent bacteria (Liu et al., 2021).
Here, we characterize (S)-3-hydroxybutyryl-CoA dehydrogenase
from the ammonia-oxidizing thaumarchaeon Nitrosopumilus
maritimus, compare it with the enzyme from M. sedula
and with the crotonyl-CoA hydratase/(S)-3-hydroxybutyryl-CoA
dehydrogenases, and discuss the enzymological diﬀerences in
these conversions in course of the DC/HB and HP/HB cycles.

Liu et al. (S)-3-Hydroxybutyryl-CoA Dehydrogenase From Nitrosopumilus maritimus
Rosetta 2 (DE3) (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) were cultivated at
37◦C in lysogeny broth (LB) medium.
CoA-Esters Synthesis
(S)- and ( R)-3-hydroxybutyryl-CoA were synthesized from the
corresponding free acids by the mixed anhydride method
(Stadtman, 1957) and then were puriﬁed using high-performance
liquid chromatography (Zarzycki et al., 2009). Acetoacetyl-CoA
and acetyl-CoA were chemically synthesized from diketene
and acetic anhydride, respectively, as reported before (Simon
and Shemin, 1953). 3-Hydroxypropionyl-CoA was synthesized
enzymatically with recombinant propionate CoA-transferase
from Clostridium propionicum (Selmer et al., 2002).
Gene Cloning
Chromosomal DNA of N. maritimus was extracted using an
illustra bacteria genomicPrep Mini Spin Kit (GE Healthcare).
The gene encoding ( S)-3-hydroxybutyryl-CoA dehydrogenase
(Nmar_1028) was ampliﬁed by Q5 High-Fidelity DNA
Polymerase (NEB, Frankfurt, Germany) from genomic DNA of
N. maritimus using the forward primer (5′-GCG GCC ATA TCG
AAG GTC GT C ATA TG G CAG TAA AAA ATA TCA CAA
TTT TAG-3′) introducing an NdeI restriction site (italicized) at
the initiation codon and the reverse primer (5 ′- TCT CAT GTT
TGA CAG CTT ATC ATC GATAAG CTT GAT TCA CTG CAT
TGA TGT GAG-3 ′) introducing a HindIII site (italicized) after
the stop codon. Touchdown PCR was used as follows: initial
denaturation 3 min at 98 ◦C, 20 cycles of 30-s denaturation at
98◦C, 30-s primer annealing at 57 ◦C (gradually reduced 0.2 ◦C
per cycle) and 40-s elongation at 72 ◦C, followed by 15 cycles
of 30-s denaturation at 98 ◦C, 30-s primer annealing at 53 ◦C
and 40-s elongation at 72 ◦C. The PCR product was treated with
the corresponding restriction enzymes and then the gene was
ligated into pET16b using T4 DNA ligase (NEB). The cloning of
a gene into this vector with NdeI and HindIII restrictases adds
an N-terminal His 10-tag to the produced protein. The obtained
plasmid was transformed into E. coli TOP10 for ampliﬁcation.
Heterologous Expression in E. coli
The recombinant vector pET16b-Nmar_1028 was transformed
into E. coli Rosetta 2 (DE3). The cells were grown at 37 ◦C
in LB medium with 100 µg ampicillin ml −1 and 34 µg
chloramphenicol ml−1. Expression of Nmar_1028 was induced
at optical density (OD 578nm) of 0.6 with 0.2 mM isopropyl- β-D-
thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG), and the temperature was lowered
to 16◦C. The cells were harvested after additional growth for 15 h
and stored at -20◦C until use.
Preparation of Cell Extracts
Frozen cells were suspended in a double volume of 20 mM
Tris-HCl (pH 7.8) containing 0.1 mg ml −1 DNase I. The
cell suspension was sonicated for 60 cycles of 1-s pulse and
2-s pause, and the cell lysate was centrifuged for 20 min
(14,000 rpm; 4 ◦C). The supernatant (cell extract) was used for
protein puriﬁcation immediately.
Puriﬁcation of Recombinant Protein
Nmar_1028
The heterologously produced histidine-tagged (his-tagged)
Nmar_1028 was puriﬁed using aﬃnity chromatography. The
supernatant was applied to 0.2-ml HisPur Ni-NTA Spin Column
(Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc, Rockford, United States) that had
been equilibrated with 20 mM Tris-HCl containing 100 mM
KCl (pH 7.8). The unwanted proteins were washed out with
the same buﬀer containing 100 mM imidazole and the enzyme
was eluted with the same buﬀer containing 500 mM imidazole.
The recombinant protein was stored in 50% glycerol at -20 ◦C
after concentration using 10K Vivaspin Turbo 4 (Sartorius,
Göttingen, Germany).
Size Exclusion Chromatography
The native molecular mass of Nmar_1028 was determined by
gel ﬁltration on a Superdex 200 Increase column (24-ml volume;
Cytiva) at a ﬂow rate of 0.75 ml min −1. The column was
equilibrated with buﬀer containing 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.8)
and 150 mM KCl. To make a standard curve, apoferritin (horse
spleen, 443 kDa), alcohol dehydrogenase (yeast, 150 kDa), bovine
serum albumin (BSA, 66 kDa), and carbonic anhydrase (bovine
erythrocytes, 29 kDa) were used. The eluted fractions were stored
in 50% glycerol at -20◦C.
Enzyme Assays
All enzyme activities of Nmar_1028 were measured
spectrophotometrically in 300 µl reaction mixture at 30 ◦C at
365 nm (εNADH = 3.4 mM−1 cm−1, εNADPH = 3.5 mM−1 cm−1;
Bergmeyer, 1975). ( S)-3-hydroxybutyryl-CoA dehydrogenase
activity was detected in 100 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.8) containing
0.5 mM NAD(P), 0.2 mM ( S)-3-hydroxybutyryl-CoA, and
puriﬁed enzyme. The concentration of ( S)-3-hydroxybutyryl-
CoA was varied (0.005–0.2 mM) for Km determination. Activity
of (S)-3-hydroxybutyryl-CoA dehydrogenase in the direction of
NAD(P)H oxidation was measured in 100 mM Tris-HCl (pH
7.8) containing 0.5 mM NAD(P)H, 0.2 mM acetoacetyl-CoA
and puriﬁed enzyme. The concentration of acetoacetyl-CoA
was varied (0.005–0.2 mM) for Km determination. To illustrate
the eﬀect of pH on enzyme activity, 50 mM MOPS/50 mM
Tris (pH 7.0, 7.4) and 100 mM Tris (7.8, 8.0, 8.6, and 9.0) were
used. One enzyme unit (U) corresponds to 1 µmol substrate
converted per minute.
Database Search and Phylogenetic
Analysis
Query sequences for the database searches were obtained from
NCBI data base. The BLASTP searches were performed via NCBI
BLAST server1 (Altschul et al., 1990). The phylogenetic tree was
constructed by using the maximum likelihood method and Jones-
Taylor-Thornton (JTT) matrix-based model (Jones et al., 1992)
in MEGA-X (Kumar et al., 2018). 145 amino acid sequences
were involved in this analysis. All positions containing gaps were

protein sequences are listed in Supplementary Table 1.
Other Methods
DNA sequence determination of puriﬁed plasmids was
performed by Euroﬁns (Ebersberg, Germany). Protein
concentration was measured according to the Bradford
method (Bradford, 1976) using BSA as a standard. Sodium
dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE;
12.5%) was performed as previously described (Laemmli, 1970).
Proteins were visualized using Coomassie blue staining (Zehr
et al., 1989). Protein identiﬁcation was performed at the IZKF
Core Unit Proteomics Münster based on tryptic in-gel digestion
and mass spectrometric analysis using Synapt G2 Si coupled to
M-Class (Waters Corp.). Km and Vmax values were calculated by
GraphPad Prism5 software.
RESULTS
Characterization of Recombinant
Nmar_1028
Using a bioinformatic analysis, Nmar_1028 was identiﬁed
as a putative ( S)-3-hydroxybutyryl-CoA dehydrogenase in
N. maritimus (Könneke et al., 2014). Here, we ampliﬁed the gene
nmar_1028, cloned it in pET16b vector (resulting in the vector
pET16b-Nmar_1028), and heterologously expressed it in E. coli.
The recombinant protein was present in the soluble protein
fraction ( Figure 2 ). The molecular weight of puriﬁed protein
on SDS gel (45 kDa) was close to the predicted size (44.8 kDa).
The identity of the obtained protein was conﬁrmed using
tryptic in-gel digestion and mass spectrometric analysis (PLGS
score: 12489.25; peptides: 90; theoretical peptides: 40; coverage:
98%; precursor RMS mass error: 10.1806 ppm; products: 1168;
products RMS mass error: 10.8739 ppm; products RMS RT
error: 0.01313549 min). Gel ﬁltration chromatography showed
the enzyme was eluted in two peaks. The molecular weight
of these two peaks were estimated as 89.9 and 43.8 kDa,
respectively, indicating that the enzyme was present in dimeric
and monomeric forms in the preparation.
The speciﬁc activity of the protein after His-tag puriﬁcation
in ( S)-3-hydroxybutyryl-CoA dehydrogenase reaction was
36.2 ±1.9 U mg−1 protein, and the corresponding activities for
the dimeric and monomeric forms of enzyme were 4.6 ±0.4
U mg −1 protein and 69.6 ±1.0 U mg −1 protein, respectively.
Therefore, the activity of the dimeric protein was only 6.6%
compared to the activity of the monomeric one. Only the
monomeric enzyme was used for the following measurements
of the dehydrogenase activity ( Table 1 ). The enzyme was
speciﬁc for NAD with high Vmax and low Km values for ( S)-
3-hydroxybutyryl-CoA (98.6 U mg −1 protein and 19 µM,
respectively, as measured with 2 mM NAD). The activity with
0.5 mM NAD was slightly lower ( Table 1). Only low activity
with 3-hydroxypropionyl-CoA was detected (0.02 U mg −1
protein), conﬁrming high speciﬁcity of the enzyme toward
(S)-3-hydroxybutyryl-CoA. Besides NAD, the enzyme is able to
use NADP as an electron acceptor. Nevertheless, its catalytic

eﬃciency ( kcat/Km) for NAD was 200 times higher than that
for NADP ( Table 1), being consistent with the published data
for 3-hydroxybutyryl-CoA dehydrogenases. Apart from the
Clostridium kluyveri enzyme (Madan et al., 1973), all other
3-hydroxybutyryl-CoA dehydrogenases characterized so far were
(best) active with NAD. Although the capability to use NADP as
an alternative coenzyme was observed in some cases, the catalytic
eﬃciency for this cofactor was very low (Osumi and Hashimoto,
1980; Liu et al., 2020).
The activity of Nmar_1028 was also measured in the reverse
direction with NADH as acetoacetyl-CoA reduction to ( S)-3-
hydroxybutyryl-CoA ( Table 1 ). The corresponding Vmax and
Km values of the enzyme were 144.8 U mg −1 protein and 26
µM, respectively (with 0.5 mM NADH). The kcat/Km value for
NADH was 5,271 s−1 mM−1, no activity was detected with 5 mM
NADPH, revealing NADH as the electron donor for the enzyme.
The ( S)-3-hydroxybutyryl-CoA dehydrogenase activity of
Nmar_1028 was aﬀected by changes in pH ( Figure 3), gradually
increasing with increase of pH from 7 to 9 with ∼30% activity
at pH 7.0 or 7.4 in comparison to 100% activity at pH 9. On the
opposite, the activity for the reverse reaction was maximal in the
buﬀers with lower pH (7.0–7.8), with remarkable activity decrease
with the pH change from 7.8 to 9.0 ( Figure 3). These results are
typical for NAD-dependent dehydrogenases, as NAD+reduction
leads to the formation of NADH and H+.
As the Mycobacterium tuberculosis 3-hydroxybutyryl-CoA
dehydrogenase activity was enhanced by divalent metals (Taylor
et al., 2010), we performed the corresponding assays with the
N. maritimus protein. Nmar_1028 did not require addition of
divalent metals in the reaction mixture for activity ( Table 2).
The incubation of the enzyme in the presence of divalent metals
resulted rather in inhibition of its activity. Whereas Mg2+, Mn2+,
Ni2+, and Co2+had only subtle eﬀect on the activity, the addition
of Fe2+and Zn2+strongly aﬀected the Nmar_1028 activity.

Distribution and Phylogenetic Analysis of
N. maritimus(S)-3-Hydroxybutyryl-CoA
Dehydrogenase
Whereas Nmar_1028 is the only homolog for ( S)-3-
hydroxybutyryl-CoA dehydrogenase in the genome of
N. maritimus , several phylogenetically related proteins can
catalyze this reaction in M. sedula (Liu et al., 2020). Msed_0389
has only low ( S)-3-hydroxybutyryl-CoA dehydrogenase activity.
The activity of bifunctional crotonyl-CoA hydratase/( S)-3-
hydroxybutyryl-CoA dehydrogenase Msed_0399 is comparable
to that of Nmar_1028, while its Km value is 6 times higher
than that of Nmar_1028 ( Tables 1 , 3). Msed_1423 is the
main ( S)-3-hydroxybutyryl-CoA dehydrogenase in M. sedula
with the highest Vmax value (96 U mg −1 protein) and the
lowest Km value (5 µM) to its substrate ( Table 3 ). The
catalytic properties of Nmar_1028 are rather comparable
with those of Msed_1423 than of Msed_0399. Indeed, the
kcat/Km values of Nmar_1028 and Msed_1423 were 5- and
20-fold higher than the corresponding value of Msed_0399
in the ( S)-3-hydroxybutyryl-CoA dehydrogenase reaction
(Tables 1, 3).
To trace the evolution of the HP/HB cycle, we
performed a comparative phylogenetic analysis ( Figure 4 )
of the corresponding enzymes. The homologs of ( S)-
3-hydroxybutyryl-CoA dehydrogenase Nmar_1028
were found in the genomes of all sequenced AOA,
suggesting that all these archaea share the ability to grow
autotrophically by using the HP/HB cycle. Moreover,
these homologs formed a separate cluster containing the
sequences of AOA, which is phylogenetically separated
from the cluster of the corresponding crenarchaeal
sequences ( Figure 4 ). Interestingly, Nmar_1028 and
Msed_1423 share 42/60% of sequence identity/similarity,
whereas Nmar_1028 and the dehydrogenase domain of
Msed_0399 share 41/62% of sequence identity/similarity
(according to the BLASTP search). It appears that

is responsible for a large part of dark ocean inorganic carbon
ﬁxation (Meador et al., 2020). This process is usually dated
back to the great oxidation event (Ren et al., 2019), and its
obligate requirement for oxygen can be accounted for by the
fact that the ﬁrst reaction in ammonia oxidation is performed
via ammonia monooxygenase. It can be found only in a
limited number of bacteria and archaea. A recent phylogenomic
analysis suggested that AOA originated from the terrestrial non-
ammonia-oxidizing ancestors and expanded to the shallow and
then deep ocean upon their oxygenation (Ren et al., 2019), while
ammonia-oxidizing bacteria are much younger (Ward et al.,
2021). Note however that this model is still under discussion
(Abby et al., 2020). The absence of the key genes of the
HP/HB cycle in the non-ammonia-oxidizing Thaumarchaeota
(non-AOA) and their presence in all AOA studied so far (Ren
et al., 2019) suggests that the thaumarchaeal HP/HB cycle
evolved in AOA ancestors de novo , and that the last common
ancestor of AOA had already a fully evolved HP/HB cycle.
Our analysis also conﬁrms this model, showing the ( S)-3-
hydroxybutyryl-CoA dehydrogenase studied here is present in
all studied AOA, but not in non-AOA ( Figure 4 ). Similarly,
a 3-hydroxypropionyl-CoA dehydratase/crotonyl-CoA hydratase
gene was found only in ammonia-oxidizing representatives of the
phylum Thaumarchaeota (Liu et al., 2021).
The HP/HB cycle exists in two variants, and the apparent
similarity in the intermediates of the cycle in AOA and
in Sulfolobales is in sharp contrast with the results of the
biochemical and/or phylogenetic analysis of the corresponding
enzymes (Könneke et al., 2014; Otte et al., 2015; Liu et al.,
2021). The diﬀerence in the autotrophic pathways in these
two archaeal groups goes along with the diﬀerence in their
ecology and environmental requirements. While Sulfolobales
like M. sedula gain energy from the highly exergonic aerobic
hydrogen oxidation, AOA use a much less energetically favorable
reaction, the oxidation of ammonia to nitrite. Moreover, some
AOA are adapted to perform near maximum autotrophic
growth at nanomolar concentrations of ammonia (Martens-
Habbena et al., 2009), further highlighting the high eﬃciency
of their metabolism. Correspondingly, AOA and Sulfolobales
convergently evolved the pathways that are best adapted to their
needs, with a less energetically eﬃcient but kinetically superior
variant functioning in Sulfolobales (Könneke et al., 2014).
(S)-3-Hydroxybutyryl-CoA dehydrogenases in M. sedula and
N. maritimus are both homologous to the dehydrogenase
domain of crotonyl-CoA hydratase/( S)-3-hydroxybutyryl-CoA
dehydrogenase (though to diﬀerent clusters in the tree,Figure 4).
This fusion protein is present in many bacteria and archaea
and was predicted to be present in the common ancestor of

Liu et al. (S)-3-Hydroxybutyryl-CoA Dehydrogenase From Nitrosopumilus maritimus
Cren- and Thaumarchaeota (Williams et al., 2017). Apparently,
the protein lost its dehydratase domain in both archaeal
groups in the course of evolution, probably because of
its redundancy. Indeed, the HP/HB cycle possesses two
very similar (de)hydratase reactions, crotonyl-CoA hydratase
and 3-hydroxypropionyl-CoA dehydratase. To catalyze these
reactions, both AOA and Sulfolobales possess a promiscuous
3-hydroxypropionyl-CoA dehydratase/crotonyl-CoA hydratase
that was laterally transferred from bacteria to their ancestors
(Liu et al., 2021). The importance of the acquisition of bacterial
genes for the evolution of AOA has been shown earlier
(Deschamps et al., 2014).
The apparent independent loss of the enoyl-CoA hydratase
domain in the ancestors of AOA and Sulfolobales suggests that
the separation of the hydratase and dehydrogenase reactions
should give certain advantages for organisms using the HP/HB
cycle. What could it be? The crotonyl-CoA hydratase/( S)-3-
hydroxybutyryl-CoA dehydrogenase Msed_0399 is only weakly
active with 3-hydroxypropionyl-CoA. We suggest that an
acquisition of a promiscuous bacterial hydratase capable of
catalyzing both of these reactions with high eﬃciency made
the dehydratase domain of a fusion protein redundant, leading
to its loss. In addition, the analysis of catalytic properties
of diﬀerent ( S)-3-hydroxybutyryl-CoA dehydrogenases suggests
that the fusion proteins have much higher Km values to ( S)-
3-hydroxybutyryl-CoA than the stand-alone dehydrogenases
(Table 3 ). In fact, a two −step reaction catalyzed by a fusion
enzyme usually demonstrates an improved catalytic eﬃciency,
which is usually attributed to a substrate channeling, however
only if the intermediate concentration remains low (Rabe et al.,
2017). As the Km value to ( S)-3-hydroxybutyryl-CoA in the
dehydrogenase reaction is relatively high, this factor is probably
not relevant for the functioning of the HP/HB cycle, and the
merging of the dehydrogenase and hydratase in a fusion protein
for the HP/HB cycle becomes dispensable.
Interestingly, autotrophic Crenarchaeota of the orders
Thermoproteales and Desulfurococcales use the fusion protein to
catalyze the crotonyl-CoA hydratase and ( S)-3-hydroxybutyryl-
CoA dehydrogenase reactions in the DC/HB cycle (Huber et al.,
2008; Ramos-Vera et al., 2009; Flechsler et al., 2021). This
cycle does not require a 3-hydroxypropionyl-CoA dehydratase
reaction. Furthermore, the crotonyl-CoA hydratase activity of
the fusion protein is high (Ramos-Vera et al., 2009; Hawkins
et al., 2014; Flechsler et al., 2021), making the tinkering around
this reaction unnecessary.
The reaction studied here is neither unique nor characteristic
for the HP/HB cycle. Nevertheless, the enzymatic conversion
of (S)-3-hydroxybutyryl-CoA to acetoacetyl-CoA is essential for
the functioning of the cycle. The genome of N. maritimus
is streamlined, and Nmar_1028 appears to be the only ( S)-3-
hydroxybutyryl-CoA dehydrogenase in this important marine
archaeon. Moreover, some autotrophic Sulfolobales also have
only one enzyme to catalyze this conversion (Liu et al.,
2020), what makes it as essential for the functioning of the
cycle as any other enzyme involved in the cycle. Apart from
autotrophic CO 2 ﬁxation in the HP/HB and DC/HB cycles,
the enzyme participates in various metabolic process like β-
oxidation, polyhydroxyalkanoate metabolism, or fermentations.
The low Km values of N. maritimus and M. sedula enzymes
to ( S)-3-hydroxybutyryl-CoA suggest their adaptation to the
functioning in the HP/HB cycle. Moreover, these enzymes
are of biotechnological interest and could be applied for the
biosynthesis of e.g., n-butanol (Kim and Kim, 2014). The HP/HB
cycle is a promising candidate for microbial production of
chemicals from CO 2 (Loder et al., 2016), and the studied
enzyme can be used e.g., to the reconstitution of the HP/HB
cycle or similar process in a proper mesophilic host organism
(Fuchs and Berg, 2014).
