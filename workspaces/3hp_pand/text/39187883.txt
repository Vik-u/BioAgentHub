The expression of  panD, yhxA  and  ydfG  genes in   K.

the last sentence of the first paragraph should read as fol-
lows “…, namely the moderate strength mitochondrial 
porin ( POR1) promoter, obtaining the PpCβ20 strain, 
and the weak pyruvate decarboxylase ( PDC1) promoter, 
obtaining the PpCβ10 strain” .
Similarly, in the second paragraph of the same section 
(Page 4), the third sentence should be “The heterolo -
gous expression of panD, yhxA and ydfG genes resulted 
in 0.93 ± 0.03 g l− 1 of 3-HP after 48 h of cultivation when 
the weak PPDC1 was used to control the expression of the 
ydfG gene (PpCβ10 strain), whereas a slightly but signifi -
cantly higher titer (p-value < 0.05), 1.04 ± 0.01 g l − 1 3-HP ,

gene (PpCβ20 strain)” .
Page no. 5 of the original publication under section 
Improving 3‑HP production by optimizing the flux

sentences need to be rephrased as follows: “These results 
indicate that higher expression levels of the ydfG gene 
(i.e., under the control of P POR1) seem to be beneficial in 
terms of 3-HP production. These results point at the final 
step of the pathway, which catalyzes the NADPH-depen -

critical rate-limiting reaction. Notably, the increase in the

In the original version of this article [ 1], the promoters 
used to control the expression of the ydfG gene (P POR1 
and P PDC1) in strains PpCβ10 and PpCβ20 were inad -
vertently swapped. Consequently, the correct genetic 
constructs are as follows: The ydfG gene was expressed 
under the control of the weak P PDC1 in strain PpCβ10 
(and thereby in all PpCβ10-derived strains), whereas the 
medium strength P POR1 was used in strain PpCβ20 (and 
thereby in all PpCβ20-derived strains).
While the data from experiments performed with each 
of these strains are not affected by this correction and the 
fundamental conclusions of the study remain valid, the 
following statements, as well as Fig.  3; Table 3, have been 
corrected in this erratum.

Page 5 of the original publication Fig.  3 should be 
corrected to the following Fig.  3, in which the promot -
ers used for ydfG expression (in orange) are correctly 
assigned to the corresponding strain.

Evaluating the impact of the β‑alanine pathway on 
cell growth kinetics , the fourth sentence needs to be 
changed as follows: “Interestingly, higher levels of the 
NADPH-consuming YDFG Ec enzyme of the β-alanine 
pathway (i.e., ydfG gene expressed under the control of 
PPOR1, strain PpCβ20) proved to be beneficial, both in 
terms of 3-HP production and in µmax reduction (referred 
to the µ max of the wild type strain), which was less pro -
nounced (µmax reduction from 0.14 h − 1 to 0.11 h − 1) than 
that observed for strain PpCβ10 (µ max reduction from 
0.14 h− 1 to 0.09 h− 1) .”
Page no. 11 of the original publication, Table  3 should 
be modified as follows:
Finally, upon publication of this article [ 1], it was 
brought to our attention that in Table S1 from Additional 
file 1, we utilized a mechanistic P/O value of 2.5 for mito-
chondrial NADH oxidation in our stoichiometric analy -
sis of both the Malonyl-CoA and the β-alanine pathways 
towards 3-HP using different carbon sources, indicating

that 2.5 ATP are obtained per oxygen atom reduced by 
the respiratory chain. This value was chosen based on 
historical estimations found in several earlier reports [ 2]. 
However, other studies suggest a lower theoretical P/O 
ratio of 1.5 for Saccharomyces cerevisiae as more realistic 
[3], which has also been used in K. phaffii genome-scale 
models for validation of phenotypic predictions [ 4, 5]. 
Accordingly, Table S1 from Additional file 1 should be 
modified as follows:
Importantly, the stoichiometric calculations consider -
ing a theoretical P/O value of 1.5 do not alter the result -
ing stoichiometries for 3-HP production from glucose 
and methanol. Consequently, the original publication’s 
conclusion that the β-alanine pathway is more energeti -
cally efficient than the malonyl-CoA pathway for pro -
ducing one molecule of 3-HP from three molecules of 
methanol still holds true.
