Microbial cleavage of dimethylsulfoniopropionate (DMSP) producing dimethyl sulﬁde
(DMS) and acrylate is an important step in global sulfur cycling. Acrylate is toxic
for cells, and thus should be metabolized effectively for detoxiﬁcation. There are
two proposed pathways for acrylate metabolism in DMSP-catabolizing bacteria, the
AcuN-AcuK pathway and the PrpE-AcuI pathway. AcuH is an acryloyl-CoA hydratase
in DMSP-catabolizing bacteria and can catalyze the hydration of toxic acryloyl-CoA to
produce 3-hydroxypropionyl-CoA (3-HP-CoA) in both the AcuN-AcuK pathway and the
side path of the PrpE-AcuI pathway. However, the structure and catalytic mechanism
of AcuH remain unknown. Here, we cloned a putative acuH gene from Roseovarius
nubinhibens ISM, a typical DMSP-catabolizing bacterium, and expressed it ( RdAcuH)
in Escherichia coli . The activity of RdAcuH toward acryloyl-CoA was detected by
liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS), which suggests that RdAcuH is
a functional acryloyl-CoA hydratase. Then we solved the crystal structure of RdAcuH.
Each asymmetric unit in the crystal of RdAcuH contains a dimer of trimers and each
RdAcuH monomer contains an N-terminal domain (NTD) and a C-terminal domain
(CTD). There are three active centers in each trimer and each active center is located
between the NTD of a subunit and the CTD of the neighboring subunit. Site-directed
mutagenesis analysis indicates that two highly conserved glutamates, Glu112 and
Glu132, in the active center are essential for catalysis. Based on our results and previous
research, we analyzed the catalytic mechanism of AcuH to hydrate acryloyl-CoA, in
which Glu132 acts as the catalytic base. This study sheds light on the mechanism of
acrylate detoxiﬁcation in DMSP-catabolizing bacteria.

Cao et al. Catalytic Mechanism of AcuH for Acryloyl-CoA Hydration
INTRODUCTION
Dimethylsulfoniopropionate (DMSP), a secondary metabolite of
marine phytoplankton, macroalgae and some angiosperms, is a
major participant in the global sulfur and carbon cycles (Kiene
et al., 2000; Stefels et al., 2007; Curson et al., 2011; Li et al., 2014;
Wang et al., 2015). DMSP can be produced on a scale of 10 3
Tg each year and accounts for approximately 10% of the total
organic carbon in some places of the seawater (Archer et al., 2001;
Simo et al., 2002). The marine Roseobacter clade and the SAR11
clade are the principal groups of bacteria involved in DMSP
degradation (Curson et al., 2011). They metabolize DMSP via two
general pathways, the demethylation pathway and the cleavage
pathway (Curson et al., 2011; Johnston et al., 2016). Every year,
approximately 300 Tg of dimethyl sulﬁde (DMS) and equal mole
of acrylate are produced by microbial cleavage (Lovelock et al.,
1972; Curson et al., 2011).
Acrylate is an important carbon source in the ocean and can
be used as a sole carbon source for some bacteria (Yoch, 2002;
Todd et al., 2010; Curson et al., 2014). However, acrylate and its
metabolite acryloyl-CoA are toxic when they are accumulated in
cells (Todd et al., 2010, 2012; Reisch et al., 2013). Thus, rapid
metabolism of acrylate and acryloyl-CoA is essential for the
survival of the DMSP-catabolizing bacteria.
Two diﬀerent pathways for acrylate metabolism and
detoxiﬁcation in DMSP-catabolizing bacteria have been
proposed, the AcuN-AcuK pathway and the PrpE-AcuI
pathway (Curson et al., 2011; Reisch et al., 2013; Wang et al.,
2017). In the AcuN-AcuK pathway, acrylate is metabolized to
3-hydroxypropionyl-CoA (3-HP-CoA) by AcuN and AcuH,
which is also named AcuK (Curson et al., 2011), and ﬁnally
metabolized through the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle
(Figure 1 ). In the PrpE-AcuI pathway, acrylate is metabolized
to propionyl-CoA by PrpE and AcuI and ﬁnally metabolized
through the methymalonyl-CoA pathway ( Figure 1 ) (Curson
et al., 2011; Reisch et al., 2013; Bullock et al., 2017).
In acrylate metabolism and detoxiﬁcation, AcuH is functional
in both the AcuN-AcuK pathway and the PrpE-AcuI pathway
(Curson et al., 2011; Reisch et al., 2013; Bullock et al., 2017)
(Figure 1 ). It can catalyze acryloyl-CoA hydration in the
AcuN-AcuK pathway and the branching of the PrpE-AcuI
pathway (Curson et al., 2011; Reisch et al., 2013; Bullock et al.,
2017) ( Figure 1 ). AcuH belongs to the enoyl-CoA hydratase
family and is ﬁrst identiﬁed from Halomonas sp. HTNK1, a
γ-proteobacterium that can grow on acrylate as sole carbon
source (Todd et al., 2010). Enoyl-CoA hydratase usually catalyzes
the second step of the β-oxidation of fatty acid degradation
(Bahnson et al., 2002; Nelson and Cox, 2005). Enoyl-CoA
hydratases can use various enoyl-CoA with diﬀerent lengths
as substrates, such as crotonyl-CoA, methacrylyl-CoA and
tiglyl-CoA. Enoyl-CoA hydratases from diﬀerent sources, such
as bovine liver and rat liver, have been characterized (Steinman
and Hill, 1975; Furuta et al., 1980). The mechanisms of some
enoyl-CoA hydratases, such as an enoyl-CoA hydratase from
the liver of Rattus norvegicus and EchA6 from Mycobacterium
tuberculosis have been further studied (Bahnson et al., 2002;
Cox et al., 2016). However, the structure of AcuH and its
catalytic mechanism to catalyze acryloyl-CoA hydration in
DMSP-catabolizing bacteria remains unknown.
Roseovarius nubinhibens ISM, a member of the marine
Roseobacter clade, is an aerobic bacterium that is capable
of degrading DMSP. It was isolated from the caribbean sea
seawater (Fuhrman et al., 1994) and has been whole-genome
sequenced. Its genome sequence has been deposited in the
NCBI database (GCA_000152625.1), which contains a putative
AcuH (WP_009813188.1). In order to insight the structure and
catalytic mechanism of AcuH in acrylate mechanism pathway
in DMSP-catabolizing bacteria, in this study, we cloned the
putative acuH gene from Roseovarius nubinhibens ISM and
heterologously expressed it in Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3).
The recombinant AcuH was named RdAcuH. We detected the
acryloyl-CoA hydration activity of RdAcuH and solved its three-
dimensional structure. Then, by structural and site-directed
mutagenesis analyses, we found two conserved glutamates,
Glu112 and Glu132, are key residues involved in catalysis. Finally,
based on our structural and mutagenesis analyses, we proposed
a catalytic mechanism for RdAcuH hydrating acryloyl-CoA to
produce 3-HP-CoA. The results oﬀer a better understanding for
the process and molecular mechanism of acrylate detoxiﬁcation
in DMSP-catabolizing bacteria.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Bacterial Strains and Growth Conditions
Roseovarius nubinhibens ISM was purchased from the Leibniz
Institute DSMZ-German Collection of Microorganisms and Cell
Cultures, and was cultured in 974 medium at 30 ◦C for 2 days
according to the provided protocol 1. E. coli DH5α and E. coli
BL21 (DE3) were all purchased from TransGen Biotech company
(China) and were grown in Luria-Bertani (LB) medium at 37 ◦C.
E. coliDH5α and E. coliBL21 (DE3) were used for gene cloning
and gene expression, respectively.
Gene Cloning, Site-Directed Mutation,
Protein Expression and Puriﬁcation
The RdacuH gene was ampliﬁed from the genome of Roseovarius
nubinhibens ISM by PCR using FastPfu DNA polymerase. PCR
primers were designed with the NdeI and XhoI restriction
sites. The ampliﬁed Rd acuH is recombined to the vector
pET-22b. FastPfu DNA polymerase and the vector pET-22b
were purchased from TransGen Biotech (China) and Novagen
company (Germany), respectively.
All site-directed mutations were introduced using overlap
PCR and veriﬁed by sequencing. The constructed recombinant
plasmids, including the wild type Rd acuH and its mutants were
transferred into E. coli BL21 (DE3) for expression. The cells
were cultured in LB medium with 0.1 mg/ml ampicillin at 37 ◦C
to an OD 600 of 1.0-1.2. Then the culture was induced at 20 ◦C
overnight with 0.2 mM isopropyl- β-D-thiogalactopyranoside
(IPTG). Wild type RdAcuH and its mutants were puriﬁed by
aﬃnity chromatography on a Ni 2+-NTA column (GE healthcare,

United States), and then fractionated by anion exchange
chromatography on a Source 15Q column (GE healthcare,
United States) and gel ﬁltration on a Superdex G200 column (GE
healthcare, United States).
The prpE gene was ampliﬁed from the genomic DNA of
Dinoroseobacter shibae DFL 12. Expression and puriﬁcation
of PrpE were conducted with the same methods as RdAcuH
described above.
Enzyme Assays
PrpE, a propionate-CoA ligase from D. shibaeDFL 12, was used
to produce acryloyl-CoA. Reaction system of PrpE contained
0.5 mM acrylate, 0.5 mM coenzyme A (CoA), 0.5 mM adenosine
triphosphate (ATP), 5 mM MgCl 2, 100 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0)
and 10 µM recombinant PrpE. After a 2-h reaction at 37 ◦C,
RdAcuH was added to the mixture at a ﬁnal concentration of
1 µM. Hydrochloric acid was added to a ﬁnal concentration
of 1 mM after 5 min to terminate the reaction. The enzyme
activity of RdAcuH was measured by determining the production
of 3-HP-CoA using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry
(LC-MS). Components of the reaction system were separated on
a reversed-phase C18 column (4.6 ×250 mm, 5 µm particle size;
Waters, United States) connected to a high performance liquid
chromatography (HPLC) system (Dionex, United States). The
detection wavelength was 260 nm. The samples were eluted with a
linear gradient of 1-20% (v/v) acetonitrile in 20 mM ammonium
acetate (pH 5.5) over 15 min at a ﬂow rate of 1 ml/min. The
injection volume was 5 µl and the column temperature was
25◦C. The HPLC system was coupled to an impact HD mass
spectrometer (Bruker, Germany) for molecular weight (MW)
determination.
Crystal Screening and Data Collection
Crystal Screen Reagent Kits (Hampton, V A, United States;
Qiagen, Germany) were used for crystal screening. The
concentration of the puriﬁed protein was approximately
10 mg/ml. The initial buﬀer for crystallization contained 0.1 M
sodium acetate (pH 5.0), 15% (v/v) 2-methyl-1,3-propanediol

and 2% (w/v) PEG 4000. Then the crystals were optimized
using the hanging drop vapor diﬀusion method at 20 ◦C (the
ratio of protein to precipitant was 1:1). The optimal buﬀer
for crystallization contained 0.1 M sodium acetate (pH 5.2),
15% (v/v) 2-methyl-1,3-propanediol and 2.2% (w/v) PEG 4000.
Precipitant with 15% glycerol was used as cryoprotection buﬀer
and the crystals were frozen in liquid nitrogen. X-ray diﬀraction
data were collected at the Shanghai Synchrotron Radiation
Facility beamline BL17U1 (Wang et al., 2016). The wavelength
was 0.9791 Å. Diﬀraction data were collected using an ADSC
Q315r CCD detector (Poway, CA, United States) at 100 K
and processed with the HKL2000 package (Ducruix and Giegé,
1999).
Structure Determination and Reﬁnement
The structure of RdAcuH was solved by molecular
replacement using Phaser (Potterton et al., 2003). An
enoyl-CoA hydratase (PDB ID code: 3H81) was used
as the searching model. The automated model building
was performed with ARP/wARP (Langer et al., 2008).
Manual model reﬁnement was performed with COOT
(Emsley et al., 2010) and PHENIX (Emsley et al., 2010).

Circular Dichroism (CD) Spectroscopy
Circular dichroism (CD) spectra were collected from 250 to
200 nm on a J-810 spectropolarimeter (Jasco, Japan) at 25 ◦C.
A quartz cuvette with a path length of 0.1 cm was used. All
proteins were adjusted to a ﬁnal concentration of 0.2 mg/ml in
10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0).
Dynamic Light Scattering (DLS)
Dynamic light scattering experiment was performed on a
Dynapro Titan TC (Wyatt Technology, United States) at 4 ◦C
using 20 µl (2.5 mg/ml) RdAcuH in a buﬀer containing 10 mM
Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) and 100 mM NaCl. Data were analyzed with
dynamics 7 1.0 software.
Accession Numbers
The structures of RdAcuH was deposited in the Protein Data
Bank under the accession codes 5XZD.
RESULTS
Gene Cloning and Sequence Analysis of
RdAcuH
The putative acuH gene, RdacuH (GI:497498990), was identiﬁed
from the genome of Roseovarius nubinhibens ISM. The ORF
of Rd acuH contains 777 bp, encoding a protein ( RdAcuH) of
258 amino acid residues. The MW and isoelectric point (pI)
of RdAcuH monomer is predicted to be 28.3 kDa and 5.07,
2http://www.pymol.org/
respectively, using the compute pI/Mw tool 3 (Gasteiger et al.,
2005). In addition, RdAcuH contains no signal peptide based
on the prediction by SignalP 4.0 Server 4 (Petersen et al., 2011),
suggesting that RdAcuH is an intracellular protein.
Conserved domain analysis (Marchlerbauer et al., 2015)
suggests that RdAcuH belongs to the crotonase superfamily
(1.07e−74) and is predicted as an enoyl-CoA hydratase
(6.64e−150). RdAcuH presents 56 and 79% identities to the
known AcuHs from H. sp. HTNK1 and Ruegeria pomeroyi
DSS-3, respectively (Todd et al., 2010). In addition, E. coli, a
model prokaryote, and R. norvegicus, a model vertebrate, also
have several RdAcuH homologues. The most similar sequences
from E. coli and R. norvegicus show 45% and 53% identities to
RdAcuH, respectively (Figure 2).
Expression and Puriﬁcation of RdAcuH
RdacuH was recombined to vector pET-22b and the recombinant
RdAcuH was expressed in E. coli BL21 (DE3). RdAcuH
was puriﬁed to electrophoretic homogeneity by a three-step
puriﬁcation. SDS-PAGE analysis of the puriﬁed enzyme showed
that the apparent MW of RdAcuH is about 28 kDa ( Figure 3A),
which is consistent with the predicted MW of 28.3 kDa. DLS
analysis revealed that the estimated MW of RdAcuH in solution
is 97.37 kDa ( Figure 3B), which is approximately three times of
the apparent MW ofRdAcuH, suggesting thatRdAcuH is a trimer
in solution. The %Pd is 0.74, indicating that the sample has high
uniformity and the result is reliable.
Activity Assay of RdAcuH
It has been reported that acryloyl-CoA, the substrate of
RdAcuH, was synthesized by chemical methods (Stadtman,

1957). However, during the synthesis process, we found that
the production was very low and that acryloyl-CoA was very
unstable. So we used PrpE ( Figure 1 ), an acrylate-CoA ligase,
to biologically produce acryloyl-CoA. The prpE gene was cloned
from D. shibae DFL 12, a Roseobacter that can also metabolize
DMSP (Dickschat et al., 2010). After a 2-h reaction of PrpE,

R. norvegicus are circled out. Glu144 and Glu164 of RdAcuH are colored in blue and the acetic acid in RdAcuH is colored in orange. Their 2Fo-Fc electron density

yellow. DAC-CoA represent the possible position of acryloyl-CoA of RdAcuH.
RdAcuH was added to the reaction system of PrpE for the enzyme
activity detection of RdAcuH (see “Materials and Methods” for
details).
LC-MS were used to detect the activity ofRdAcuH. The results
of liquid chromatography showed that a peak vanished (peak1)
and another peak (peak2) increased after a 5-min reaction of
RdAcuH (Figure 4A). The MW of the component of the vanished
peak is 822.1357, which is equal to the MW of acryloyl-CoA
(Figures 4A,B) and the MW of the component of the increased
peak is 840.1351, which is equal to the MW of 3-HP-CoA
(Figures 4A,C). This indicated that, during the reaction, acryloyl-
CoA was hydrated by RdAcuH and 3-HP-CoA was produced.
There was also a small peak (peak 3) in the same position of
the increased peak in the control group, and a little 3-HP-CoA
was detected from this peak ( Figures 4A,D ), probably because
acryloyl-CoA is unstable and trace of acryloyl-CoA could be

impurity peak with complex composition and no acryloyl-CoA
or 3-HP-CoA was detected. The activity assay results showed that
RdAcuH has acryloyl-CoA hydratase activity and can catalyze
acryloyl-CoA to 3-HP-CoA.
Crystallization and Structure
Determination of RdAcuH
To investigate the structure and catalytic mechanism, RdAcuH
was crystallized. Shuttle-shaped crystals of RdAcuH grew to a
size of 0.8 ×0.25 ×0.25 mm in 2 days ( Figure 5A). The X-ray
diﬀraction data of the crystals were collected with the wavelength
of 0.9791 Å. After data integration, the crystal was identiﬁed in
the space group of C121. The unit cell of the crystal is a =127.81
Å, b =119.453 Å, c =120.276 Å, and α =90◦, β =102.769◦,
γ =90◦, and the completeness of the data is 99.34%. Data
redundancy is high enough for structure determination.
A similarity search in Protein Data Bank (PDB) 5 (Berman
et al., 2000) revealed that RdAcuH shares 53% sequence identity
with a typical enoyl-CoA hydratase from R. norvegicus (PDB
code: 1EY3) (covering 100% of the sequence). With the enoyl-
CoA hydratase from R. norvegicus as a model, the structure of
RdAcuH was solved at the resolution of 1.9 Å. After reﬁnement,
the structure ofRdAcuH was reﬁned to anRwork of 17.3%, anRfree
of 19.9% and the average B-factors of 31.6 Å2. Ramachandran plot
shows that 97.4% of the residues are in the favored regions and
2.6% of the residues are in the allowed regions. Details of data
collection parameters, structure determination and reﬁnement
are summarized in Table 1.
Overall Structure of RdAcuH
The overall structure of RdAcuH is a dimer of trimers in
an asymmetric unit of the crystal, in which three monomers
associate end to end to form a tight trimer, and two trimers
associate back to back to form a dimmer ( Figure 5B ). There
are few strong interactions between these two trimers. Thus, the
dimer should result from crystal packing.
The ﬁrst 2 and the last 23 residues of eachRdAcuH subunit are
missing in our structure. The electron densities of residues 66–76
in all chains are ambiguous except chain A in which these residues

Cao et al. Catalytic Mechanism of AcuH for Acryloyl-CoA Hydration
FIGURE 7 | A proposed catalytic mechanism of RdAcuH. The two residues,
Glu112 and Glu132, play important roles in the reaction. They would be
ionized under a neutral condition. Firstly, Glu132 acts as the brønsted base
and transfers an electron to the water molecule. Then the activated water
molecule attacks the C3 atom of acryloyl-CoA and the transition state is
formed. Finally, the redundant electron is transferred to Glu132, the water
molecule is added to acryloyl-CoA and 3HP-CoA is produced.
still have very high B-factors, indicating that these residues form
a ﬂexible loop (Figure 5C).
The overall structure of RdAcuH is very similar to the
structure of the enoyl-CoA hydratase from R. norvegicus. The
RMSD between the two structures after superposition is 0.857
Å for 1239 common C α-atoms and 0.938 Å for all 7948
common atoms. Each RdAcuH subunit contains two domains,
an N-terminal domain (NTD) and a C-terminal domain (CTD).
The NTD adopts a typical spiral crotonase fold which is organized
by two perpendicular β-sheets. The two perpendicular β-sheets
contain six and two β-strands, respectively ( Figure 5D ). The
CTD without the last 23 residues only contains two α helices
(Figure 5D ). The last 23 residues of the CTD missing in
our structure probably form another helix according to the
conservative analysis and structure alignment (Figure 5E). Thus,
the complete structure of the CTD of RdAcuH probably contains
three α helices. There are three active centers in each trimer and
each active center is located between the NTD of a subunit and
the CTD of the neighboring subunit (Figure 5E).
Analysis of the Key Residues Involved in
the Catalysis of RdAcuH
In the structure of the enoyl-CoA hydratase from R. norvegicus,
two conserved residues, Glu144 and Glu164, are close to the
water molecule and the bounded substrate DAC-CoA molecule
(Bahnson et al., 2002). Because RdAcuH and the enoyl-CoA
hydratase from R. norvegicus have high similarity in their
sequences and structures, we found that the corresponding
residues of these two glutamates in RdAcuH are Glu112 and
Glu132 according to the sequence and structure alignment
(Figures 2 , 5E). Draw on the experience of the enoyl-CoA
hydratase from R. norvegicus, these two residues are probably
also essential in the catalytic process of RdAcuH. To conﬁrm
this, site-directed mutagenesis on these two residues were
performed. Biochemical analysis showed that mutations on each
of the glutamates to alanine resulted in the inactivation of
RdAcuH ( Figure 6A ). CD spectral analysis showed the site-
directed mutations caused little change in the secondary structure
of RdAcuH ( Figure 6B ), indicating that the loss of enzyme
activity was caused by the residue substitution rather than
structural change. Thus, we suggest that Glu112 and Glu132 play
important roles in the catalytic reaction of RdAcuH, like the
function of Glu144 and Glu164 in the enoyl-CoA hydratase from
R. norvegicus.
DISCUSSION
AcuH is likely very important in the DMSP catabolism
in bacteria because it is capable to participate in both
the demethylation pathway and the cleavage pathway. In
the demethylation pathway, AcuH is able to function as
an isoenzyme of DmdD to catalyze methylthioacryloyl-CoA
(MTA-CoA) hydration (Sullivan et al., 2011; Reisch et al., 2013;
Bullock et al., 2017). In the cleavage pathway, it is involved
in acrylate catabolism via catalyzing acryloyl-CoA hydration.
Acrylate and acryloyl-CoA are all poisonous intermediate
products during the metabolism of DMSP , and thus should be
metabolized quickly in DMSP-catabolizing bacteria. Therefore,
the involvement of AcuH in the metabolism pathway of acrylate
is important for the detoxiﬁcation of acrylate and acryloyl-CoA
in DMSP-catabolizing bacteria.
There has been no report on the property, structure or
catalytic mechanism of AcuH from a DMSP catabolizing
bacterium. In this study, we conﬁrmed that the AcuH ( RdAcuH)

Cao et al. Catalytic Mechanism of AcuH for Acryloyl-CoA Hydration
from Roseovarius nubinhibens ISM, a DMSP catabolizing
bacterium, has acryloyl-CoA hydration activity in vitro. Then we
determined the structure of RdAcuH. Due to the high similarity
of RdAcuH and the enoyl-CoA hydratase from R. norvegicus in
structure, and similar conserved residues involved in catalysis,
they likely have similar catalytic mechanism. The molecular
mechanism of the enoyl-CoA hydratase from R. norvegicus for
catalysis has been reported (Bahnson et al., 2002). Therefore,
based on our structural and site-directed mutagenesis analyses,
the catalytic mechanism for RdAcuH could be deduced. Like the
enoyl-CoA hydratase from R. norvegicus, there should be a water
molecule in the position of the acetic acid molecule that acts
as a catalytic water, and the carboxylates of Glu112 and Glu132
are expected to be ionized under a neutral condition. When an
acryloyl-CoA molecule enters the active center, Glu132 would
attack the water molecule and transfer an electron to it. Then
the activated water molecule attacks the C3 atom of acryloyl-CoA
and forms the transition state with the double bond. After that,
acryloyl-CoA transmits the redundant electron to Glu132, and
the water molecule is added to the acryloyl-CoA, leading to the
production of 3HP-CoA ( Figure 7). Then, 3HP-CoA is released
and the RdAcuH molecule is ready to catalyze the hydration of
another acryloyl-CoA molecule. The elucidation of the catalytic
mechanism of AcuH to hydrate acryloyl-CoA would shed light on
the mechanism of acrylate detoxiﬁcation in DMSP catabolizing
bacteria.
Enoyl-CoA hydratases have a broad substrate speciﬁcity and
can use enoyl-CoA of diﬀerent lengths as substrates. For example,
bovine liver enoyl-CoA hydratase can use CoA derivatives from
crotonyl-CoA (4 carbons of the acyl chain) to 2-hexadecenoyl-
CoA (16 carbons of the acyl chain) as substrates and the hydration
rate ( Vmax) decreases markedly with increasing chain length
of the substrates (Waterson and Hill, 1972). Similarly, ECHS1
from human can also hydrate C4-C12 enoyl-CoA and has the
highest activity for crotonyl-CoA (Y amada et al., 2015). These
evidence suggests that the activity of enoyl-CoA hydratases
increase with decreasing acyl chain length of the substrates.
As an enoyl-CoA hydratase, RdAcuH may also accept various
substrates with diﬀerent acyl chain length. Because acryloyl-CoA
has only 3 carbons of the acyl chain, RdAcuH should have a
pretty high hydration rate for acryloyl-CoA, corresponding to
its detoxiﬁcation function in the acrylate metabolism pathway in
DMSP catabolizing bacteria, which, however, still needs further
conﬁrmation.
Acryloyl-CoA can also be produced in other metabolic
pathways in addition to DMSP metabolism pathway. For
example, acryloyl-CoA in liver can be produced from
5,6-dichloro-4thia-5-hexenoyl-CoA (DCTH-CoA) by medium-
chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase or be produced from
4-(2-benzothiazole)-4-thiabutanoyl-CoA (BTTB-CoA) by the
enoyl-CoA hydratase from R. norvegicus (Fitzsimmons et al.,
1995; Baker-Malcolm et al., 2000). In addition, AcuH and its
homologues are widespread (Bullock et al., 2017; Wang et al.,
2017). Thus, the acryloyl-CoA detoxiﬁcation mechanism by
AcuH may be extended to other metabolic processes and have
a wider signiﬁcance.
