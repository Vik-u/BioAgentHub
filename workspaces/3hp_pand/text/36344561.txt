Microbial consortia have been considered potential platforms for bioproces-
sing applications. However, the complexity in process control owing to the use
of multiple strains necessitates the use of an efﬁcient population control
strategy. Herein, we report circuit-guided synthetic acclimation as a strategy to
improve biochemical production by a microbial consortium. We designed a
consortium comprising alginate-utilizingVibrio sp. dhg and
3-hydroxypropionic acid (3-HP)-producingEscherichia colistrains for the
direct conversion of alginate to 3-HP. We introduced a genetic circuit, named
“Population guider”,i nt h eE. colistrain, which degrades ampicillin only when
3-HP is produced. In the presence of ampicillin as a selection pressure, the
consortium was successfully acclimatedfor increased 3-HP production by 4.3-
fold compared to that by a simple co-culturing consortium during a 48-h
fermentation. We believe this concept is a useful strategy for the development
of robust consortium-based bioprocesses.
Microorganisms grow as consortia across domains by optimizing
community structures for their survival by acclimatizing to their
environments
1– 4. They communicate by the secretion and uptake of
metabolites or chemicals typically used for cellular communication5.
These communications facilitate diverse social interactions (e.g.,
commensalism, cooperation, amensalism, and competition). One of
the important features that is observed in these community structures
is the division of labor
6– 8. While community participants usually com-
pete for limited resources, they often complement each other by
performing different tasks, and also exhibit emergent properties,
which enables the expression of improved phenotypes (i.e.,ﬁtness)
compared to those expressed in independent cultures
2,9– 11.
Based on these facts, microbial consortia have been studied as
attractive bioprocessing platforms for biochemical production7,12– 15.
While single-cell engineering of genetically well-known microorganisms
has been performed widely, it is difﬁcult to efﬁciently introduce large or
complicated metabolic pathways, which are required for the utilization
of non-conventional substrates (e.g., single-carbon gases, alginate) or
production of complex chemicals (e.g., natural products). Microorgan-
isms that naturally exhibit such abilities can be considered potential
hosts; however, their use in bioprocessing is often limited owing to
insufﬁcient engineering tools or understanding
16. On the contrary, the
use of a microbial consortium does not require extensive engineering
and can exploit the innate abilities of microorganisms that have been
optimized through evolution. Furthermore, the division of labor
achieved by the spatial compartmentalization of metabolic pathways in
different cells may relieve the metabolic burden
13,17 and provide addi-
tional control for balancing various activities in the pathway18– 20.I n d e e d ,
in the past years, several synthetic consortia have been developed for
the conversion of various substrates (e.g., cellobiose

oxygenated taxanes19,m u c o n i ca c i d25, vitamin C26, hydroxytyrosol27,
cadaverine28).
While the utilization of microbial consortia is promising, a critical
challenge is the control of process performance for the maximization
of production efﬁciencies, which is primarily governed by the popu-
lation composition29. Furthermore, there were also efforts in devel-
oping artiﬁcial quorum sensing circuits21,30– 32 for programmed growth
control of consortium participants depending on population densities.
In addition, to achieve stability in co-cultures, symbiotic communities
were designed mainly via creating mutualistic interactions, including
carbon cross-feeding
33 and feeding a growth-inhibiting byproduct to
another member as a sole carbon source19,23.
While these efforts have successfully improved biochemical pro-
duction, and also highlighted the importance of population control, it
remains difﬁcult to predict and control the optimal population com-
position of each participant for biochemical production. In particular,
the microbial population of a consortium with different physiological
attributes is rarely controllable simply using initial conditions, because
the growth of each cell is signiﬁcantly affected by the medium com-
position that changes dynamically throughout the cultivation period.
Therefore, the optimization process relies on pre-determined empiri-
cal parameters that can only be determined through labor-intensive
experimental trials.
In this study, we report a population-guiding strategy for
improving biochemical production by a microbial consortium based
on its synthetic acclimation. Speciﬁcally, we designed a genetic circuit,
named “population guider”, for the degradation of speciﬁc com-
pounds inhibiting the growth of the consortium when a target che-
mical is produced. In the presence of the growth inhibitor, a
population guider tightly associates the growth of a microbial con-
sortium with the biochemical production capability. Therefore, a
population is expected to be autonomously acclimated for improved
biochemical production by its optimization even under dynamically
changing environments. As a model system, we applied this strategy to
a consortium ofVibrio sp. dhg
34,35 and an engineeredE. colistrain for
the direct production of 3-hydroxypropionic acid (3-HP), an important
platform chemical36, from alginate, a promising non-conventional
feedstock material obtainable from marine biomass. We chose ampi-
cillin as a growth-inhibiting compound and developed a population
guider to express the ampicillin degradation gene (bla)i nr e s p o n s et o
the 3-HP concentration. WhenVibriosp. dhg was co-cultivated with a 3-
HP-producingE. coliharboring the population guider in the presence
of ampicillin, notably, it was observed that 3-HP production was
drastically increased (up to 4.3-fold) with the minimized accumulation
of acetate, a key intermediate in co-cultures. A population analysis
revealed that the improvement occurred due to changes in the
population compositions of co-cultures based on the concentrations
of the growth-inhibiting compounds. Collectively, these results sug-
gest that the concept of synthetic acclimation can serve as an efﬁcient
strategy for improving the production of diverse value-added bio-
chemicals by microbial consortia.
Results
Microbial consortium for production of 3-HP from alginate
A synthetic microbial consortium was constructed for the production
of 3-HP from alginate, in which an alginate-utilizingVibrio sp. dhg
strain and a 3-HP producingE. coli strain were co-cultured (Fig.1a).
Vibrio sp. dhg has a 42-kb cluster that encodes proteins that metabo-
lize alginate
34 and release acetate as a major byproduct. WhileE. coli
cannot utilize alginate, its biochemical production from various car-
bon sources, including acetate, has been performed frequently37– 40.I n
the current study,E. coliwas engineered to produce 3-HP from acetate
(Supplementary Note 1); the resulting ECFHPS strain produced
272.82 mg/L of 3-HP from 10 g/L of acetate (Supplementary Fig. 1 and
Supplementary Data 1). Therefore, it was expected that co-culturing
could be effectively used to convert alginate into 3-HP with acetate as
an intermediate.
To facilitate efﬁcient 3-HP production from alginate, we devised a
genetic circuit-based population-guiding strategy (Fig.1b). Given that
only Vibrio sp. dhg serves as a beneﬁcial strain (i.e., by providing
acetate) forE. coliby metabolizing alginate, whereasE. colidoes not
signiﬁcantly promote the growth ofVibriosp. dhg, the two strains were
expected to exhibit a commensal relationship, which would lead to the
dominance ofVibrio sp. dhg in co-cultures. Consequently, the excess
growth ofVibriosp. dhg would inevitably reduce theE. colipopulation,
as the former would compete for other nutrients in the medium
41.T o
obtain the optimal population ratio for 3-HP production, we estab-
lished a cooperative relationship between the two strains by introdu-
cing a population guider inE. coli. This population guider was designed
to express thebla gene for the degradation of ampicillin in the pre-
sence of 3-HP in a medium. In the presence of ampicillin, which inhibits
the growth of the microbial strains (primarilyVibrio sp. dhg),E. coli
served as a beneﬁcial strain by improving the growthﬁtness ofVibrio
sp. dhg. We expected that strains would be acclimated to the increased
production of 3-HP by cooperative survival under selection pressure.
Cultivation of consortium without population control
Initially, we constructed a synthetic consortium by co-culturingVibrio
sp. dhg andE. coli and examined whether 3-HP could be produced
directly from alginate. To monitor the population composition, we
labeled Vibrio sp. dhg and ECFHP (3-HP-producingE. coliW, Supple-
mentary Data 1) strains by introducing gene expression cassettes for
the constitutive expression of mcherry and sgfp (Supplementary
Fig. 2), which led to the formation of the VDHG and ECFHPS strains,
respectively (Supplementary Data 1). To initiate the culture, cells of the
VDHG and ECFHPS strains (with the cell cultures having concentra-
tions corresponding to OD
600 values 0.5 and 2, respectively) were used
as inoculum, considering thatVibrio sp. dhg cultured in the presence
of alginate exhibited a considerably higher growth rate (0.83 h−1)t h a n
that ofE. coli cultured in the presence of acetate (0.16 h−1) (Supple-
mentary Fig. 3). After the culture was initiated in a minimal medium
supplemented with alginate, an immediate increase in the OD600 value
was observed (Fig.2a). Along with cell growth, acetate accumulation
was also observed in the medium (1.67 g/L), indicating thatVibrio sp.
dhg responded positively to the co-culture conditions (in terms of
growth). At 12 h, 3-HP was also detected (38.45 mg/L), which conﬁrmed
that 3-HP can be produced directly from alginate using the consortium
approach. Nevertheless, only a small quantity of 3-HP (52.95 mg/L from
20 g/L of alginate) was produced by the consortium even when the
acetate level was lowered. The signiﬁcant accumulation of acetate
(1.83 g/L at maximum) indicated the low efﬁciency of 3-HP production
(i.e., insufﬁcient activity of the 3-HP-producingE. coli). The population
composition analysis revealed that the population ratio of ECFHPS
reduced signiﬁcantly with time and remained low (lowest: 8.25% at
18 h, Fig.2b). These results indicate that the overgrowth ofVibrio sp.
dhg should be avoided for efﬁcient 3-HP production.
To investigate the effect of population ratios to 3-HP production,
we tested four different inoculum sizes of the VDHG and ECFHPS
strains (0.5:4, 0.5:1, 0.1:2.4, and 2.4:0.1), which were varied from the
0.5:2 ratio (Supplementary Fig. 4). As a result, the changes of the
population ratio affected the 3-HP production signiﬁcantly; the 3-HP
titers at 48 h varied from almost zero to 211.05 mg/L (a 4.0-fold
increase), implying the importance of a consortium population to 3-HP
production. In particular, when the initial amount of VDHG is high,
3-HP production greatly decreased likely due to poor growth of the
ECFHPS strain. Despite the inoculum size control, acetate was still
consistently observed at high levels, implying signiﬁcant room for
further optimization. It was also found that generated 3-HP was also
often decreased likely due to its degradation by either of the two

microorganisms after alginate was depleted, indicating the necessity
of efﬁcient carbon utilization; the degradation of 3-HP was observed in
another bacterium previously42.W i t ht h ec o nﬁrmed importance of the
population ratio control, we applied the population control strategy to
optimize production by this consortium.
Population guider for 3-HP-dependent growth regulation
To guide the microbial population for improved 3-HP production, we
constructed a population guider and tested its controllability in terms
of the growth of the consortium depending on the presence of 3-HP.
We utilized a 3-HP-responsive transcription factor (C4-lysR)a n di t s
cognate promoter (P
C4M) from a recently characterized 3-HP inducible
system in Pseudomonas denitriﬁcans43– 45 (Fig. 1b). For the effective
control of 3-HP-dependentbla expression, we assessed two 5’-UTR
sequences (weak and strong) with different predicted expression
levels (Supplementary Table 1). The ECPG1 strain harboring the
pPopG1 plasmid with the weak 5’-UTR forbla was unable to grow in the
absence of 3-HP (Supplementary Fig. 5a). Conversely, when the strong
5’-UTR was used (in the ECPG2 strain), the strain could grow regardless
of the presence of 3-HP, probably owing to the high basal expression of
bla (Supplementary Fig. 5b). Therefore, the population guider with the
weak 5’-UTR forbla expression was selected for subsequent studies.
Next, we assessed whether the growth of the consortium could be
controlled by the exogenous addition of 3-HP using the developed
population guider (Fig.3). We prepared an inoculum by mixing the
VDHG and ECPG (E. coli W harboring the pPopG plasmid, Supple-
mentary Data 1) strains at a ratio of 1:4, considering their growth rates
(see above). We monitored the growth of the consortium in the pre-
sence of sub-lethal concentrations of ampicillin (0, 1, 2, 5, 10, and
20 µg/mL, Supplementary Fig. 6). For the inducible expression of the
bla gene, three different concentrations of 3-HP (0, 0.5, and 2 g/L) were
used. Notably, after 24 h of cultivation, successful growth control was
observed; the consortium generally exhibited better growth in the
presence of 3-HP when the ampicillin concentrations ranged from 1 to
10 µg/mL. The differences in biomass formation depending on the
presence of 3-HP were generally more pronounced when the

Without population control, the population is dominated byVibrio sp. dhg,
resulting in the wasteful utilization of resources and a low production of 3-HP.
The introduction of the population guider intoE. colileads to the establishment
of a cooperative interaction between the two microorganisms and allows the
consortium to optimize the population for improving 3-HP production by
synthetic acclimation.

concentration of ampicillin was higher. However, when the ampicillin
concentration was excessively high (20µg/mL), the growth beneﬁtw a s
unclear, probably owing to the excessive inhibition of the growth of
both strains. Nevertheless, this result indicates the potential of the
population guider for regulating the growth of the microbial con-
sortium in response to the presence of 3-HP in the medium.
Acclimation of a microbial population for 3-HP production
We applied the population-guiding strategy for the robust production
of 3-HP from alginate by co-culturing the VDHG strain with the ECFHPG
strain (an engineered ECF strain harboring the pPopG-3HP plasmid,
Supplementary Data 1) in the presence of ampicillin (Fig.4a– df o rt h e
culture proﬁles and Fig.4e– h for their comparisons). In the initial
attempt, we added 5µg/mL of ampicillin, and the fermentation proﬁle
was compared to that observed in the absence of ampicillin (Fig.4 and
Supplementary Table 2). In the absence of ampicillin, the culture
proﬁles and levels of 3-HP production (68.35 mg/L) were almost
identical with those observed for the initial consortium, in which VDHG
and ECFHPS were co-cultured (Fig.4a). This observation indicates that
the population guider did not affect the cultures. When 5µg/mL of
ampicillin was added, the growth rate decreased marginally along with
the alginate consumption rate (Fig.4b). Nevertheless, the increased
3-HP titer (125.40 mg/L) and low levels of accumulated acetate (1.44 g/
L at most) were notable observations, indicating the improved 3-HP
production following population control. Subsequently, we investi-
gated a potential change in the population of the consortium and
observed that the ratio of ECFHPG increased from 18.50% to 29.15% of
the total population at 48 h (Fig.4h). Such population changes resul-
ted in the redirection of carbonﬂux toward 3-HP production, repre-
sented by a 1.89-fold increase in the C-mole yield of 3-HP
(Supplementary Table 2).
We increased the selection pressure by adding 10µg/mL of
ampicillin, at which point the growth of the VDHG strain was almost
completely inhibited (Supplementary Fig. 6). Although the addition of
excess ampicillin strongly inhibited the growth of the consortium in
t h ea b s e n c eo ft h ep o p u l a t i o nr e g u l a t i o nm o d u l e( S u p p l e m e n t a r y
Fig. 7), when the population guider was used, the OD
600 value of the
consortium reached 13.99 (Fig. 4c). This indicates the successful
cooperative interaction between the two microorganisms. The
increase in selection pressure further increased the 3-HP titer
(293.55 mg/L), a 4.3-fold increase compared to that observed in the
absence ampicillin (68.35 mg/L) after a 48-h fermentation period.
Acetate accumulation was signiﬁcantly low (1.05 g/L at 6 h) and
undetectable after 18 h, which was accompanied by robust 3-HP pro-
duction. This result indicated higher activity of the ECFHPG strain.
Indeed, while the total biomass decreased, the abundance of the
ECFHPG strain increased by 2.2-fold (40.4%) compared to that in the
absence of ampicillin at 48 h (Fig.4h). It was also observed that
the C-mole yield of 3-HP increased by 4.38-fold compared to the case
where ampicillin was not added (Supplementary Table 2), showing that
the population control strategy facilitated the successful acclimation
of the population for improvement of 3-HP production.
We further applied a higher level of the selection pressure by
increasing the concentration of ampicillin to 20µg/mL to determine
whether 3-HP production could be further increased. In response to
this alteration, the growth of the consortium was inhibited sig-
niﬁcantly; only 2.53 g/L of alginate was consumed, which resulted in
low biomass formation (ﬁnal OD
600 value: 5.30) (Fig.4d). Probably due
to the very small of alginate consumption and biomass formation, the
acetate levels also remained low (below 0.23 g/L) throughout the fer-
mentation period. Nevertheless, even at such high selection pressure,
199.40 mg/L of 3-HP was produced with the highest yield (Supple-
mentary Table 2). However, 20µg/mL of ampicillin appeared to be
excessively high, given that 3-HP was produced only during the initial
12 h at a lower titer than that obtained with 10µg/mL of ampicillin
(293.55 mg/L). The 3-HP production was stalled probably due to
unviable VDHG cells. The population analysis further conﬁrmed the
hypothesis that the production of 3-HP during the initial phase of
culturing resulted from the increased population ratio of ECFHPG.
Comparison with a 3-HP independentbla expression strategy
We compared this 3-HP-dependentbla expression strategy (i.e., con-
ditional cooperation) with a staticbla expression strategy (i.e., simple
cooperation). For this comparison, we constructed the pC112-3HP,
pC100-3HP, and pC119-3HP plasmids that expressbla under one of
four constitutive promoters with different strengths by more than 10

cultured VDHG and ECFHPC1-3 (harboring eachbla expression plas-
mid instead of the population guider, Supplementary Data 1) in the
presence of 10μg/mL of ampicillin (Supplementary Fig. 8). With the
bla expression under P
J23119, the highest amount ofﬁnal biomass was
achieved, indicating the greatest degradation of ampicillin. Notably,
up to 168.00 mg/L of 3-HP was produced at 48 h, which was higher
than that of the co-culture of the VDHG and ECFHPG strains without
addition of ampicillin, indicating the simple cooperative interaction
was also advantageous for 3-HP production. However, no signiﬁcant
correlation in 3-HP production and promoter strengths was observed.
In addition, 1~2 g/L of acetate was consistently accumulated until 24 h,
suggesting the suboptimal performance of the consortia compared
with the results of the previous 3-HP-dependent bla expression
strategy.
We utilized mathematical modeling (see Supplementary Note 2
and Supplementary Table 3) for better understanding and comparing
the achieved results. Due to limitations to model a dynamically chan-
ging environment, we accounted alginate consumption and remaining
acetate for estimating cell growth of both strains and 3-HP production
under each condition. As observed, the construction of the synthetic
cooperation was expected to yield higher 3-HP production over the
simple co-cultivation (Supplementary Fig. 9). Moreover, a superior
production with the 3-HP dependentbla expression to that with static
bla expression was expected. The strong expression ofbla led to the
outgrowth of VDHG, resulting in a similar proﬁle from the simple co-

expression, likely owing to insufﬁcient growth of both microorgan-
isms. Collectively, we concluded that the 3-HP dependentbla expres-
sion strategy can efﬁciently improve the 3-HP production by the co-
culture ofVibrio sp. dhg and 3-HP producingE. colistrains.
Discussion
In this study, we demonstrated the efﬁcient conversion of alginate to
3-HP by constructing a microbial consortium of alginate-metabolizing
Vibrio sp. dhg and 3-HP-producingE. coli strains and introducing a
population-guiding genetic circuit to acclimatize their populations for
improving 3-HP production. Although simple co-cultivation of the
strains also led to the production of 3-HP from alginate, the dominance
of Vibrio sp. dhg in the culture resulted in the high accumulation of
acetate, which is a pathway intermediate, and the levels of 3-HP pro-
duction were also low. From the observation that the population ratio
signiﬁcantly affected the biochemical production efﬁciencies, we
introduced the population-guiding circuit and selection pressure to
establish cooperative interaction between the strains. Consequently,
acclimated consortium population led to a signiﬁcant improvement in
3-HP production from alginate.
The results clearly indicate that synthetic microbial consortia can
serve as a powerful platform for biochemical production from non-
conventional substrates. Although several successful attempts have
been made, the engineering of microorganisms that can utilize non-
conventional substrates is mostly difﬁcult owing to insufﬁcient genetic
information and molecular tools. However, co-culturing with micro-
organisms with known genetic information can help overcome the
intrinsic limitations of the single-cell engineering approach. As shown
in this study, a synthetic consortium can leverage the useful properties
of each microorganism to develop a novel pathway or function that
does not exist in a single microorganism, and resultantly, synthesize
value-added biochemical products successfully.
To leverage the huge potential of the co-culture approach, efﬁ-
cient population control strategy needs to be devised. However,
despite its potential, only limited strategies (e.g., programmed cell
lysis depending on the level of a quorum sensing molecule) for opti-
mizing the composition of consortia have been proposed and applied
for biochemical production. Although previous approaches success-
fully demonstrated that a microbial population is controllable to some
extent, since we still do not know what composition is optimal for
biochemical production during dynamically changing fermentation
environment, the application of these strategies in bioproduction can
be challenging. On the contrary, a“population guider” was designed to
directly associate the“survival” of cells with biochemical production
and toﬁnd an optimal population by autonomous acclimation of the
population toward improved production of a target.
Despite the success, there are several issues for broad applica-
tions of our approach. (i) This strategy was applied to a two-party
bacterial consortium where only one strain can utilize the substrate
and the other strain relies on the byproduct formation. However, co-
culturing two different strains are very relevant for bioprocesses,
especially for the conversion of non-conventional feedstocks. In
addition, acclimation of a consortium with more than two members
can be also attempted if oneﬁnds a suitable pair of a growth inhibitor
and its degradation gene to construct a“conditional cooperation”
based on target chemical production. (ii) The requirement of anti-
biotics itself or potential difference in antibiotic susceptibility of each
party can act as a signiﬁcant constraint
47,48. We expect that ampicillin
can be replaced by any growth inhibitors which can commonly inhibit
consortium participants. The use of antibiotics can be avoided by
directly engineering cells to produce growth-inhibiting compounds
(e.g., bacteriocins)
49,50. For example, microcin S (encoded bymcsS)
from probioticE. coliG3/10 is known to inhibit the growth of neigh-
boring microorganisms50. The population would be similarly
acclimated for higher production if a gene (e.g.,mcsI)f o rd e g r a d i n g
microcin S is expressed or the expression ofmcsS is reduced when a
target chemical is produced. Furthermore, in the case that consortium
participants show different extent of susceptibility, multiple growth
inhibitors speciﬁcally effecting a single strain can be also utilized. (iii)
To build a“population guider” for the production of other chemicals, a
molecular part that can detect a target chemical must be available.
However, with growing interest in developing synthetic circuits which
can process diverse inputs, the capability of excavating or developing
protein- and RNA-biosensors has been extensively improved. For
example, parts were newly found or designed for small metabolites
51,52
and natural products53. Thus, we foresee that the“molecular catalog”
of biosensors is more expanded and widely available. (iv) The choice of
the level of the selection pressure also plays a critical role and thus it
needs an optimization. There was room for further optimization of the
ampicillin condition between 10 and 20μg/mL (Fig.4). And during a
separate repeated culture, it seemed that the level also affects the
degradation of 3-HP after the depletion of available carbon source
(Supplementary Fig. 10). Therefore, to achieve even higher produc-
tion, a detailed follow-up study about an optimal strategy to apply the
selection pressure needs to be carried out.
One still may question“Is a consortium approach still needed
even if genetic engineering of a non-model host becomes readily
available?”. Indeed, genetic engineering ofVibrio species has been
recently studied
35,54,55 to leverage their rapid growth and high meta-
bolic capacities. Therefore, it is expected that direct conversion of
3-HP from alginate using a single strain will be available soon. Although
there is no clear answer, as mentioned in the introduction section, the
consortium approach can be more efﬁcient since it allows division of
labor, simpliﬁcation of a complex metabolic pathway
4. However, since
a population control is the key to develop a successful multi-strain
bioprocess, diverse strategies should be devised and tested. In this
regard, we believe that a production-dependent synthetic cooperation
can be an effective strategy as shown with the current model con-
sortium ofVibrio sp. dhg andE. coli.
Collectively, this study shows the circuit-based population-guid-
ing strategy is a promising tool for the development of efﬁcient
consortium-based bioprocesses. The highﬂexibility in the design of a
microbial consortium can facilitates the development of novel pro-
cesses to produce diverse biochemicals from nonconventional feed-
stocks by employing multiple modularized strains.
Methods
Bacterial strains, plasmids, and reagents
The bacterial strains and plasmids used are listed in Supplementary
Data 1. Methods for plasmid construction are elaborated in Supple-
mentary Note 3. The primers were synthesized by Cosmogenetech
(Seoul, Korea) and are listed in Supplementary Data 2. Plasmid DNA
was isolated using an Exprep
TM Plasmid SV kit from GeneAll (Seoul,
Korea). DNA fragments ampliﬁed by PCR were puriﬁed using an
ExpinTM Gel SV kit (GeneAll). Q5 polymerase and restriction enzymes
were purchased from New England Biolabs (Ipswich, MA, USA). The
reagents for cell cultures were purchased from BD Bioscience (Sparks,
MD, USA). All other chemicals were obtained from Sigma (St. Louis,
MO, USA) as listed in Supplementary Data 2, unless otherwise
indicated.
Culture conditions forVibrio sp. dhg andE. colistrains
All ﬂask-scale cell cultures were performed using 300-mLﬂasks con-
taining 50 mL of a modiﬁed minimal medium34. The medium consisted
of 15 g/L NaCl, 5 g/L (NH4)2SO4, 0.5 g/L MgSO4·7 H2O, 100 mM potas-
sium phosphate buffer (pH 7), and 2 mL/L trace metal solution (ATCC
MD-TMS, pH 7.0). The trace metal solution contained 0.5 g/L ethyle-
nediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA), 3.0 g/L MgSO
4·H2O, 0.5 g/L
MnSO4·H2O, 1.0 g/L NaCl, 0.1 g/L FeSO4·7H2O, 0.1 g/L Co(NO3)2·6 H2O,

0.1 g/L CaCl2, 0.1 g/L ZnSO4·7H2O, 0.01 g/L CuSO4·5H2O, 0.01 g/L
AlK(SO4)2,0 . 0 1 g / LH3BO3,0 . 0 1 g / LN a2MoO4·2 H 2O, 0.001 g/L
Na2SeO3,0 . 0 1g / LN a2WO4·2 H2O, and 0.02 g/L NiCl2·6 H2O. The con-
centration of NaCl in the medium was adjusted to 15 g/L for the co-
culture ofVibrio sp. dhg andE. colistrains. Alginate or acetate (neu-
tralized to pH 7 by the addition of NaOH) was provided as a carbon
source depending on the experimental conditions. All cell culture
experiments were performed at 30 °C with continuous shaking at
200 rpm.
Seed cultures ofVibrio sp. dhg were prepared by inoculating a
colony into minimal medium supplemented with 10 g/L alginate. In
case ofE. colistrains, minimal medium supplemented with 1 g/L yeast
extract and 4 g/L acetate was used. After overnight culture, the cells
were refreshed by inoculating in fresh media without yeast extract at
an OD
600 of 0.05. After the refreshed cells were cultured till an OD600
value of 1.0 was achieved, the microorganisms were co-cultured at
OD
600 0.5 and 2 forVibrio sp. dhg andE. coli, respectively. For 3-HP
production, isopropyl β-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside was added to a
ﬁnal concentration of 0.1 mM in bothE. colirefreshing and co-cultures.
Depending on the experimental conditions, various quantities of 3-HP
(0, 0.5, and 2 g/L) or ampicillin (0, 1, 2, 5, 10, and 20μg/mL) were
added. For the stable maintenance of plasmids, streptomycin (50µg/
mL) or chloramphenicol (10µg/mL) was added to the media.
Construction of the population guider and its testing
To construct the population guider, we generated two 5’-UTR variants
(Supplementary Table 1) with different predicted expression levels of
22,884 and 115,863 using the 5’-UTR Library Designer56.T h et w op l a s -
mids with each 5’-UTR of bla (pPopG1 and pPopG2 plasmids) were
introduced into theE. coliW strain, which led to the formation of the
ECPG1 and ECPG2 strains. For testing the population guider, the cul-
tures were performed on a small scale (180μL as culture volume) using
a BioscreenC MBR (Oy Growth Curves Ab, Helsinki, Finland). Seed
cultures were prepared using the method used forﬂask-scale cultures.
Refreshed seed cultures were diluted in fresh media at an OD
600 of
0.05 and supplemented with ampicillin (50μg/mL) and 3-HP (0, 0.5,
and 2 g/L). The growth of the cultures (in terms of OD600 value) was
monitored for 24 h at 30 °C under normal shaking with high amplitude.
Three biological replicates of the small-scale cell cultures were used.
Metabolite quantiﬁcation
Alginate was quantiﬁed using a previously reported protocol34,57.
Brieﬂy, 200 μL of each sample was mixed with 1 mL of 0.025 M
Na2B4O7·10H2Oi nH2SO4 (95– 98% v/v). After cooling the mixture to
0° C ,4 0μL of 0.125% (w/v) carbazole dissolved in absolute ethanol was
added, and the mixture was shaken gently. The absorbance was mea-
sured at 530 nm using a Hidex Sense microplate reader (Hidex, Turku,
Finland). A standard curve was generated using alginate samples with
concentrations in the range of 0-2 g/L. For calculation of fermentation
parameters shown in Supplementary Table 2, alginate concentrations
at 48 h were utilized.
Acetate and 3-HP were quantiﬁed using an UltiMate 3000 analy-
tical HPLC system (Dionex, Sunnyvale, CA, USA) equipped with an
Aminex HPX-87H column (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Richmond, CA, USA).
For the mobile phase, 5 mM sulfuric acid was used at aﬂow rate of
0.6 mL/min. The temperature of the column compartment was main-
tained at 14 °C. Acetate and 3-HP signals were monitored using a
Shodex RI-101 refractive index detector (Shodex, Klokkerfaldet,
Denmark).
Quantiﬁcation of the population ratio ofVibrio sp. dhg and
E. coli
The population ratios ofVibriosp. dhg (expressingmcherry)a n dE. coli
(expressingsgfp) were determined by counting the number of cells of
each strain emitting ﬂuorescence using a Beckman Coulter ﬂow
cytometer (Brea, CA, United States). The cultured samples were
washed using fresh minimal medium and injected into theﬂow cyt-
ometer after their OD600 value was adjusted to 1 (corresponding to 106
cells/μL). mCherryﬂuorescence was detected using a 488-nm excita-
tion laser and 610/20-nm emission channel with an energy-coupled
dye bandpassﬁlter. sGFPﬂuorescence was detected using a 488-nm
excitation laser and a 525/40-nm emission channel with aﬂuorescein
isothiocyanate (FITC) bandpassﬁlter. For each sample, theﬂuores-
cence signals of at least 100,000 cells were monitored. The ratio of
Vibrio sp. dhg andE. colicells was calculated by dividing eachﬂuor-
escent cell number value by the total cell number value. A standard
curve was generated using known ratios ofVibrio sp. dhg andE. coli
(Supplementary Fig. 2).
Statistical analysis
Statistical tests were performed using the two-tailed Student’s t-test by
SigmaPlot (SigmaStat).
