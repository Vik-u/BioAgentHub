abstract
Background: In our recent study using [Ue13C3]glycerol, a small subset of hamsters showed an unusual
proﬁle of glycerol metabolism: negligible gluconeogenesis from glycerol plus conversion of glycerol to
1,3-propanediol (1,3PDO) and 3-hydroxypropionate (3HP) which were detected in the liver and blood.
The purpose of the current study is to evaluate the association of these unusual glycerol products with
other biochemical processes in the liver.
Methods: Fasted hamsters received acetaminophen (400 mg/kg; n¼ 16) or saline (n¼ 10) intraperito-
neally. After waiting 2 h, all the animals received [Ue
13C3]glycerol intraperitoneally. Liver and blood were
harvested 1 h after the glycerol injection for NMR analysis and gene expression assays.
Results: 1,3PDO and 3HP derived from [Ue
13C3]glycerol were detected in the liver and plasma of eight
hamsters (two controls and six hamsters with acetaminophen treatment). Glycerol metabolism in the
liver of these animals differed substantially from conventional metabolic pathways. [Ue13C3]glycerol was
metabolized to acetyl-CoA as evidenced with downstream products detected in glutamate and b-
hydroxybutyrate, yet13C labeling in pyruvate and glucose was minimal (p< 0.001,13C labeling difference
in each metabolite). Expression of aldehyde dehydrogenases was enhanced in hamster livers with
1,3PDO and 3HP (p< 0.05).
Conclusion: Detection of 1,3PDO and 3HP in the hamster liver was associated with unorthodox meta-
bolism of glycerol characterized by conversion of 3HP to acetyl-CoA followed by ketogenesis and
oxidative metabolism through the TCA cycle. Additional mechanistic studies are needed to determine the
causes of unusual glycerol metabolism in a subset of these hamsters.

1. Introduction
The pathways of glycerol metabolism in mammals are well-
known. When the body uses triglycerides as an energy source,
glycerol and fatty acids are released into the circulation. The
concentration of circulating glycerol is generally less than 0.5 mM
[1e3], but it may rise several fold during starvation, exercise and
diabetes [3e5]. Glycerol in the bloodstream is predominantly uti-
lized by the liver after phosphorylation via glycerol kinase, and it
participates in gluconeogenesis, the glycolytic pathway, or fatty
acid esteriﬁcation. Glycerol metabolism in bacteria is also well-
investigated and quite different from mammals. Glycerol is con-
verted to glyceraldehyde via glycerol dehydrogenase (GlyDH)
linked to NADþ [6,7] or to 3-hydroxypropionaldehyde (3HPA) via
GlyDH in the presence of coenzyme B12 [8e10]. The latter process
occurs in some gut bacteria such as Lactobacillus reuteri and
Klebsiella pneumonia. 3HPA is further metabolized [8e12]; the
reduction of 3HPA via 1,3-propanediol oxidoreductase yields 1,3-
propanediol (1,3PDO) while the oxidation of 3HPA via aldehyde
dehydrogenase (ALDH) produces 3-hyroxypropionate (3HP).

1,3PDO is readily produced by the bacteria while 3HP production by
natural microbiome was reported limited [9]. Production of 1,3PDO
and 3HP using engineered bacterial strains has been extensively
investigated because of multiple commercial applications
[8,13e16]. However, these metabolites have received much less
attention in association with host metabolism. It is also known that
3HP may rise in blood and urine of humans in the deﬁciency of
propionyl-CoA carboxylase (PCC), a rare autosomal recessive dis-
order, causing propionic acidemia [17,18].
In an earlier study, we examined the impacts of glutathione
depletion on the pentose phosphate pathway in the liver using
analysis of 13C distribution in plasma glucose after the adminis-
tration of [Ue13C3]glycerol [19]. The study group received a toxic
dose of acetaminophen to deplete glutathione in the liver while
controls received saline. Since all the animals (n¼ 16 with acet-
aminophen and n¼ 10 with saline) were overnight fasted prior to
the administration of [Ue13C3]glycerol, plasma glucose was highly
enriched with 13C in most hamsters, indicating active gluconeo-
genesis from glycerol, as anticipated. However,13C-labeled glucose
was nearly undetectable in eight hamsters (six acetaminophen-
treated animals and two controls) due to minimal gluconeogen-
esis from the glycerol. Data from these hamsters were not reported
previously [19], and they were re-examined. Unexpectedly, we
found detectable.1,3PDO and 3HP in the liver and the blood of these
animals and co-existing substantial changes in hepatic metabolism
in the presence of the glycerol products.
The aims of this study are to report unusual glycerol metabolism
in the liver in the presence of 1,3PDO and 3HP and to suggest the
underlying pathway of glycerol metabolism to acetyl-CoA after the
generation of these products. The appearance of 1,3PDO and 3HP in
the liver of mammals is surprising because they are typically
known as metabolites derived from the gut microbiome. To our
knowledge this is theﬁrst report of unexpected hepatic metabolism
in association with these unusual products of glycerol. After the
administration of [Ue
13C3]glycerol, this subset of hamsters was
characterized by negligible gluconeogenesis and increased keto-
genesis. The production of 1,3PDO and 3HP from glycerol was also
associated with oxidative metabolism of glycerol through the TCA
cycle.
2. Methods
2.1. Animal studies
The study was approved by the Institutional Animal Care and
Use Committee at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical
Center. Male golden Syrian hamsters were purchased from Charles
Rivers Laboratories (Wilmington, MA). All animals were placed on a
12:12-h day-night cycle and had free access to rodent chow and
water. Chow was withdrawn at 4 p.m. for an overnight fast. At 9
a.m. on the next day, a group of hamsters (n¼ 16; 141 ± 3g )
received acetaminophen (400 mg/kg) dissolved in warm saline
(2 mL) intraperitoneally under isoﬂurane® anesthesia while the
other group of hamsters (n¼ 10; 144± 4 g) received saline only.
Hamsters quickly awakened and remained physically active. After
waiting 2 h, all hamsters received [Ue13C3]glycerol (50%, 100 mg/
kg; Cambridge Isotopes, Andover, MA) dissolved in deionized water
(1 mL) intraperitoneally in an abdominal site under anesthesia.
Again, they awakened quickly and were physically active. After 1 h,
they were sacriﬁced under general anesthesia. Blood was harvested
from the inferior vena cava, and the liver was excised and freeze-
clamped with aluminum tongs at liquid nitrogen temperature.
Plasma and liver tissue were kept at /C0 80 /C14 C prior to further
processing.
2.2. Sample processing for NMR acquisition
Liver tissue was ground in liquid nitrogen using a mortar and
pestle. Ground tissue (3 g) was treated with cold perchloric acid
(10%, 15 mL) to extract water-soluble metabolites. Plasma (4e6 mL)
was also treated using perchloric acid (70%) to aﬁnal concentration
of 10%. The mixture was vortexed for 1 min, centrifuged and the
supernatant was transferred to a new tube. After repeating the
extraction, the supernatant was adjusted to pH 8 using KOH solu-
tions. The mixture was centrifuged and the supernatant was
transferred and lyophilized.
2.3. NMR acquisition
13C NMR spectra were collected using a 14.1T spectrometer
(Varian INOVA, Agilent, Santa Clara, CA) equipped with a 3-mm
broadband probe with the observe coil tuned to13C (150 MHz).
The samples were dissolved in2H2O (300mL for liver extracts and
200 mL for plasma extracts) containing 4,4-dimethyl-4-silapentane-
1-sulfonic acid (DSS; 5 mM), centrifuged, and the supernatant was
transferred to a 3-mm NMR tube. NMR spectra of the extracts or
reference chemicals, 1,3PDO and 3HP (Sigma, St. Louis, MO), were
acquired using a 45/C14 pulse, a 36,765-Hz sweep width, 55,147 data
points and a 1.5-s acquisition time with 1.5-s interpulse delay at
25
/C14 C. Proton decoupling was performed using a standard WALTZ-
16 pulse sequence. Spectra averaged approximately 23,000 scans
requiring 20 h. All NMR spectra were analyzed using ACD/Labs
NMR spectral analysis program (Advanced Chemistry Develop-
ment, Inc., Toronto, Canada).
2.4. 13C NMR analysis for metabolite quantitation and13C
enrichment
The relative concentration of each metabolite was calculated
using a singlet from the metabolite normalized by the signal of DSS.
The singlet from natural13C abundance reﬂects the pool size of a
metabolite. Excess 13C enrichment in metabolites was calculated
using a doublet, the signal due to13Ce13C spin-spin coupling, based
on an assumption that a singlet was natural abundance (1.1%). In
addition, the relative levels of13C-labeled metabolites in13C NMR
spectra were calculated using the peak areas of speciﬁed doublets
normalized by the peak area of DSS. Glucose concentration in
plasma was measured using glucose oxidase method (YSI 2300
Glucose Analyzer; GMI, Inc).
2.5. RNA extraction and real-time quantitative PCR analysis
Total RNA was isolated from the liver of hamsters using TRIzol
(Ambion, Carlsbad, CA). Complementary DNA (cDNA) was synthe-
sized from 1
mg total RNA with oligo-dT primers using high capacity
cDNA reverse transcription kit according to the manufacturer’s
protocol (Applied Biosystems, Grand Island, NY) on the S1000™
Thermal cycler (Bio rad laboratories, Hercules, CA). Real-time
quantitative PCR (RTeqPCR) was performed with the iTaq™ Uni-
versal SYBR® Green Supermix (Bio rad laboratories, Hercules, CA)
on the CFX384™real time system (Bio rad laboratories). The results
were normalized by a housekeeping gene, glyceraldehyde 3-
phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH). The followings are PCR
primers for acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC), aldehyde dehydrogenase
(ALDH), PCC and GAPDH.

3. Results
3.1. 13C NMR detection of 1,3PDO and 3HP in the liver and plasma
Two unexpected metabolites, 1,3PDO and 3HP derived from
[Ue13C3]glycerol, were detected in extracts from the liver and
plasma of eight hamsters (Fig.1A). Six of these animals had received
acetaminophen and the remaining two hamsters had not.13C NMR
spectra of the extracts from these animals showed characteristic
multiplet signals from [U e13C3]1,3PDO and [U e13C3]3HP. The
multiplets (D, doublet; T, triplet; Q, quartet) arose due to13Ce13C
spin-spin couplings in 1,3PDO (J12 ¼ J23 ¼ 37 Hz coupling constant)
and 3HP (J12 ¼ 51 Hz; J23 ¼ 37 Hz). The chemical shifts and coupling
constants of these metabolites were conﬁrmed using standard
chemicals with natural13C abundance.
Glycerol metabolism differed dramatically in the liver of these
animals with 1,3PDO and 3HP. The changes in hepatic metabolism
were essentially the same regardless of acetaminophen treatment,
but the data from two control hamsters with 1,3PDO and 3HP were
not included in statistical data in the current study. Statistical
analysis was performed using the data from acetaminophen-
treated hamsters only; the absence of 1,3PDO and 3HP (n¼ 10)
versus the presence of 1,3PDO and 3HP (n¼ 6).
The content of [Ue13C3]1,3PDO in the liver was determined by
measuring the area of the doublet from 1,3PDO C1&C3 normalized
by DSS (Fig. 1B). The same procedure was used to measure the
content of [Ue13C3]3HP in the liver by referencing the doublet of
3HP at the C3 relative to DSS. The content of 3HP in the liver was
higher than that of 1,3PDO. Statistical correlation cannot be deter-
mined due to a small sample size, but the level of 3HP paralleled the
level of 1,3PDO in the liver (Fig. 1C). The signals from [Ue13C3]
1,3PDO and [Ue13C3]3HP were presented together with those from
[Ue13C3]glycerol and [U e13C3]glycerol 3-phopshate (G3P) for
comparison (Fig. 1D). In the absence of 1,3PDO and 3HP, animals
had strong doublet signals from [Ue13C3]glycerol and [Ue13C3]G3P
in the liver, and from [Ue13C3]glycerol in plasma. In the presence of
1,3PDO and 3HP, however, doublet signals from these13C-labeled
glycerol and G3P were minimal (Fig. 1D).
3.2. Minimal glycerol phosphorylation and gluconeogenesis in the
liver with 1,3PDO and 3HP
In the normal liver, glycerol phosphorylation produces glycerol
3-phosphate (G3P) that may be converted to other trioses such as
dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP) and glyceraldehyde 3-
phosphate (GA3P). GA3P is metabolized to pyruvate through the
glycolytic pathway while condensation of GA3P and DHAP leads to
glucose through gluconeogenesis. In 13C NMR of liver extracts,
glycerol and G3P with natural13C abundance (S, singlet, inFig. 2A)
were detected in all animals regardless of detecting 1,3PDO and
3HP. However, signals from [Ue13C3]glycerol and [Ue13C3]G3P (D,
doublet, in Fig. 2A) were minimal in the liver from animals with
1,3PDO and 3HP. Conversely, signals from [Ue13C3]glycerol and
[Ue13C3]G3P were readily identiﬁed in animals without the glyc-
erol products. The concentrations of glycerol and G3P were un-
changed in the livers with 1,3PDO and 3HP, but their 13C
enrichments were dramatically reduced (Fig. 2B). Since doublet
signal from [Ue13C3]glycerol was also minimal in hamster plasma
with 1,3PDO and 3HP, the difference in13C enrichments was due to
reduced delivery of [Ue13C3]glycerol to the liver.
After the administration of [U e13C3]glycerol, triple-labeled
([1,2,3e13C3] and [4,5,6e13C3]) glucose appears as a consequence
of direct gluconeogenesis (Fig. 2C). [1,2,3e13C3]glucose produces a
doublet in glucose C1 region due to13Ce13C scalar coupling, J12,
whereas natural abundant glucose is detected as a singlet. In the13C
NMR of liver extracts, the doublet signal from [1,2,3e13C3]glucose
was strong in animals without 1,3PDO and 3HP. However, among
animals with detectable.1,3PDO and 3HP, the glucose C1 doublet
was minimal, indicating little conversion of [Ue13C3]glycerol to
glucose. The concentration of glucose in the liver and plasma were
unchanged in the presence of 1,3PDO and 3HP (Fig. 2D), indicating
preservation of overall glucose homeostasis. These data also indi-
cate that delivery of [Ue13C3]glycerol to the liver for gluconeo-
genesis was substantially reduced in these animals.
3.3. Active ketogenesis and oxidative metabolism through the TCA
cycle in the liver with 1,3PDO and 3HP
Pyruvate is in rapid exchange with lactate and alanine in the
cytosol and13C enrichment in pyruvate is reﬂected by the enrich-
ments in lactate and alanine. After entering the mitochondrion,
pyruvate is decarboxylated via pyruvate dehydrogenase, producing
acetyl-CoA (Fig. 3A). Acetyl-CoA is further metabolized to acetate,
ketone bodies includingb-hydroxybutyrate, or citrate in the TCA
cycle. In13C NMR of liver extracts, signals from [Ue13C3]lactate and
[Ue13C3]alanine are readily detected in the liver without 1,3PDO
and 3HP, but they were substantially reduced in the liver with
1,3PDO and 3HP. Paradoxically, signals from [U e13C2]acetate,
[1,2e13C2]- and [3,4e13C2]b-hydroxybutyrate, and [4,5e13C2]gluta-
mate were enhanced in the liver with 1,3PDO and 3HP (Fig. 3B). The
condensation of [1,2e13C2]acetyl-CoA and oxaloacetate produces
[4,5e13C2]citrate and consequently [4,5 e13C2]a-ketoglutarate
through the TCA cycle (Fig. 3A). Sincea-ketoglutarate is in exchange
with glutamate, the appearance of [4,5e13C2]glutamate indicates
oxidative metabolism of [Ue13C2]acetyl-CoA through the TCA cycle.
These ﬁndings in acetate,b-hydroxybutyrate and glutamate were
surprising because13C labeling in lactate and alanine indicated low
enrichment in upstream pyruvate.
The concentrations of lactate and alanine were unchanged in the
liver with 1,3PDO and 3HP, but 13C enrichments in these

metabolites were substantially reduced (Fig. 3C and D). The con-
centration of b-hydroxybutyrate and its 13C enrichment were
increased in the hamster liver with 1,3PDO and 3HP (Fig. 3E). The
level of acetate was unchanged, but its 13C enrichment was
increased in the liver with 1,3PDO and 3HP (Fig. 3F). Metabolism
through the TCA cycle was also activated in the liver with 1,3PDO
and 3HP because the concentration of glutamate was increased and
[4,5e13C2]glutamate was detected only in the liver with 1,3PDO and
3HP (Fig. 3G).
3.4. Enhanced aldehyde dehydrogenase expression in the liver with
1,3PDO and 3HP
Genes involved in 3HP production in the liver were examined
including ACC, PCC and ALDH. ACC catalyzes the irreversible
carboxylation of acetyl-CoA to produce malonyl-CoA that is con-
verted to 3HP through malonate semialdehyde. PCC catalyzes the
carboxylation of propionyl-CoA to methylmalonyl-CoA, and the
deﬁciency of PCC, as seen in propionic acidemia, leads to 3HP and

propanediol (PDO) and [Ue13C3]3-hydroxypropionate (3HP). The chemical shifts of 1,3PDO are 34.9 ppm (C2) and 59.8 ppm (C1& C3), and those of 3HP are 41.1 ppm (C2),
60.0 ppm (C3) and 181.9 ppm (C1). Multiplets (D, doublet; T, triplet; Q, quartet) are due to13Ce13C spin-spin couplings in these metabolites. (B) 13C NMR spectra of liver extracts
show resonance at glycerol C1&C3 (63.6 ppm), G3P C1 (63.5 ppm), 3HP C3 (60.0 ppm) and 1,3PDO C1&C3 (59.8 ppm). In the absence of 1,3PDO and 3HP, doublet signals from13C-
labeled glycerol and G3P are well detected along with singlets with natural abundance. In the presence of 1,3PDO and 3HP, however, doublet signals from[ Ue13C3]glycerol and
[Ue13C3]G3P are minimal while singlets are still detectable. (C) A graph shows that the content of [Ue13C3]3HP parallels that of [Ue13C3]1,3PDO based on doublet signals in13C NMR

propionic acid. ALDH catalyzes the oxidation of aldehyde and it
produces 3HP from 3HPA (Fig. 4A). The mRNA expressions of ACC
isoforms (ACACA and ACACB) and PCC (PCCA) were not altered in
the liver with 1,3PDO and 3HP, but some of ALDH isoforms
(ALDH3A2 and ALDH7A1) were increased (Fig. 4B).
4. Discussion
This study identiﬁed 1,3PDO and 3HP derived from glycerol in
the liver and the circulation of a subset of hamsters, and detection
of both products was associated with signiﬁcant disruption of he-
patic metabolism. The usual pathways of glycerol metabolisme
phosphorylation followed by incorporation into gluconeogenesis or
glycolysis - were minimal in the hamster livers with 1,3PDO and
3HP. Surprisingly, glycerol metabolism tob-hydroxybutyrate and
glutamate was stimulated despite minimal glycerol conversion to
pyruvate. This study demonstrated that glycerol metabolism to
1,3PDO and 3HP interrupted gluconeogenesis but activated

catabolism through unusual pathways in the liver.
Conventional metabolic pathways in the liver are not consistent
with the 13C-labeling patterns of metabolites in the presence of
1,3PDO and 3HP. The well-established pathways from glycerol to
lactate, alanine and acetyl-CoA occur through glycerol phosphor-
ylation followed by the glycolytic pathway. Pyruvate produced
through glycolysis is in exchange with lactate and alanine, or
decarboxylated to acetyl-CoA. Glucose is also readily produced
from glycerol through the condensation of GA3P and DHAP. These
processes were expected and conﬁrmed by strong signals from13C-
labeled glucose, lactate, alanine and G3P after the administration of
[Ue13C3]glycerol in the liverswithout 1,3PDO and 3HP. However,
livers with 1,3PDO and 3HP had minimal 13C-labeling in these
metabolites (Figs. 2 and 3). Interestingly, however, downstream
products of acetyl-CoA had enhanced13C-labeling based on the
signals from [1,2 e13C2]- and [3,4 e13C2]b-hydroxybutyrate,

and [1,2e13C2]acetate are stronger while the signals from [Ue13C3]lactate and [Ue13C3]alanine are substantially lower in the liver with 1,3PDO and 3HP compared to the liver
without them. (C-D) The concentrations of lactate and alanine were unchanged, but their13C enrichments were reduced in the liver with 1,3PDO and 3HP. (E) The concentration of

[1,2e13C2]acetate and [4,5 e13C2]glutamate ( Fig. 3 ). All these
double-labeled metabolites indicated the presence of [1,2e13C2]
acetyl-CoA. However, since13C-labeling in upstream pyruvate was
minimal in the liver with 1,3PDO and 3HP, the conversion of
[Ue13C3]glycerol to [1,2e13C2]acetyl-CoA is not consistent with the
standard pathways of glycerol metabolism and must occur through
unconventional pathways that bypass pyruvate.
Three alternative models were considered to understand the
evidence for unusual glycerol metabolism observed in the current
study. One hypothesis is that all theseﬁndings occurred through
under-appreciated pathways in the mammalian liver. The liver can
convert glycerol to 3HP through acetyl-CoA and malonyl-CoA
[20,21] after entering the glycolytic pathway, as brieﬂy illustrated
in Fig. 4A. However, the liver metabolism alone cannot explain the
production of 1,3PDO. The production of 3HP paralleled that of
1,3PDO (Fig. 1C), which strongly suggested a common pathway for
the two products through 3HPA. However, glycerol conversion to
3HPA via GlyDH in mammals has not been reported to our
knowledge. Another hypothesis is that theﬁndings occurred via gut
microbiome. As noted, some microbiome such as Lactobacillus
reuteri and Klebsiella pneumonia converts glycerol to 1,3 PDO and
3HP through 3HPA [8e10]. However, this hypothesis is not fully
consistent with the current data, either, because natural micro-
biome was reported to have minimal activities of ALDH enzymes to
produce 3HP [9,22,23]. In addition, bacteria do not have mito-
chondria and they have an incomplete TCA cycle [ 24]. Thus,
enhanced ketogenesis and oxidative metabolism through the TCA
cycle in the presence of 1,3PDO and 3HP cannot be explained by
microbial metabolism alone. The third hypothesis is that these
ﬁndings required some interaction between the microbiome and
the liver. Because ALDH expressions were enhanced in the hamster
liver with 1,3PDO and 3HP, the combination of theseﬁndings and
earlier studies of glycerol metabolism in microbiome suggests that
3HPA generated from glycerol by gut bacteria was presumably
metabolized to 3HP via ALDH in the liver. It was also reported that
liver converts 3HP to acetyl-CoA through malonate semialdehyde
Fig. 4. Enhanced aldehyde dehydrogenase expressions in the liver with 1,3PDO and 3HP.( A) Schematics show metabolic processes involved in the production of 3HP. 3HP can be
produced from acetyl-CoA through acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC). The lack of propionyl-CoA carboxylase (PCC) accumulates propionyl-CoA, which leads to 3HP and propionic acid
production. Glycerol dehydrogenase converts glycerol to 3HPA that is further metabolized to 3HP via aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH). (B) A graph shows mRNA expressions of
enzymes associated with 3HP production. Two isoforms of ALDH (ALDH3A2 and ALDH7A1) were increased in the liver with 1,3PDO and 3HP, but ACC and PCC remained unchanged.

[20,21]. Thus, it is more likely that13C-labeled b-hydroxybutyrate
and glutamate were downstream products of [1,2e13C2]acetyl-CoA
in the liver derived from [Ue13C3]3HP (Fig. 5).
The signiﬁcance of 1,3PDO and 3HP production is not clear, nor
is the relevance of these metabolites for the general health of the
host despite the dramatic changes in liver metabolism. The ham-
sters with 1,3PDO and 3HP did not show any unusual external signs
of distress. Healthy humans also have trace amounts of 1,3PDO and
3HP in plasma and urine [25]. 1,3PDO seems not to be toxic [26], but
accumulated 3HP is associated with acidosis. 3HP is one of diag-
nostic metabolites in propionic acidemia caused by the deﬁciency
of PCC [17,18]. There are few reports regarding these products in the
association with host health, but an early study reported high
concentrations of the products in the urine of patients who died in
infancy [27]. Since glycerol was utilized for catabolism instead of
gluconeogenesis in the presence of 1,3PDO and 3HP, this unusual
glycerol metabolism may conceivably contribute to glycemic con-
trol. Glycerol is an important substrate for gluconeogenesis, and
glucose production derived from this substrate may increase in
type 2 diabetic patients [28]. Thus, glycerol oxidation through the
TCA cycle instead of its conversion to glucose would ameliorate
hyperglycemia. If we assume that these metabolites were produced
via microbiome, however, the translocation of bacterial products to
the liver meant leaky gut barrier. In addition, most animals with
1,3PDO and 3HP in the current study had minimal glutathione in
the liver due to an acetaminophen overdose [19]. It is known that
an aldehyde (-CHO) of 3HPA reacts with a thiol (-SH) of glutathione
or proteins [22,29,30]. The shortage of glutathione in the liver
might drive 3HPA conversion to 3HP instead of detoxiﬁcation by
glutathione.
The current study has limitations. First, the mechanism for
production of these unusual products is not known. The results
from measurements of ALDH expression may account for produc-
tion of 3HP from 3HPA, but the direct causes of glycerol conversion
to 3HP and 1,3PDO are unknown. Second, this study does not
demonstrate microbial involvement, although the unanticipated
products and labeling patterns are consistent with commonly
known microbial processes. It remains to be investigated whether
and what type of microbiome is associated with glycerol meta-
bolism to 1,3PDO and 3HP. Third, it is unknown if there are any
long-term effects of unusual glycerol metabolism for the general
health of the host. Finally, it also remains to be investigated if the
unexpected metabolism observed in a subset of hamsters occurs in
human subjects.
In summary, a subset of hamsters receiving glycerol had
detectable 1,3PDO and 3HP in the liver and the circulation, aﬁnding
that was associated with impaired gluconeogenesis from glycerol.
These animals utilized glycerol for both ketogenesis and oxidative
metabolism through acetyl-CoA. It remains to be investigated what
triggered the appearance of 1,3PDO and 3HP in the liver of these
Fig. 5. Potential alternative pathway from glycerol to acetyl-CoA in the liver with 1,3PDO and 3HP.In the normal liver without 1,3PDO and 3HP, phosphorylated [Ue13C3]
glycerol was incorporated to gluconeogenesis or the glycolytic process. In the liver with 1,3PDO and 3HP, it is considered that 3HPA was produced from[Ue13C3]glycerol via glycerol
dehydrogenase (GlyDH) and 3HPA was metabolized to 1,3PDO possibly by bacteria. Once 3HPA was produced, it could be also metabolized to 3HP via aldehyde dehydrogenase
(ALDH) in the liver. 3HP could be further metabolized to acetyl-CoA through malonate semialdehyde and consequently producing13C-labeled acetate, b-hydroxybutyrate and
glutamate. Abbreviations: DHAP, dihydroxyacetone phosphate, GA3P, glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate; G3P, glycerol 3-phosphate; Glu, glutamate; 3HPA, 3-hydroxypropionaldehyde;a-

animals and if the metabolic changes are beneﬁcial to the host.
Though the precise role of the microbiome in production of these
metabolites is uncertain, the current study demonstrated the dra-
matic impact of metabolites typically associated with bacteria on
glycerol metabolism in the liver of the host.
