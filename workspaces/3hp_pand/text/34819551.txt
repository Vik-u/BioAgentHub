The ammonia‑oxidizing thaumarchaeal 3‑hydroxypropionate/4‑hydroxybutyrate (3HP/4HB) cycle 
is one of the most energy‑efficient  CO2 fixation cycles discovered thus far. The protein encoded by 
Nmar_1308 (from Nitrosopumilus maritimus SCM1) is a promiscuous enzyme that catalyzes two 
essential reactions within the thaumarchaeal 3HP/4HB cycle, functioning as both a crotonyl ‑CoA 
hydratase (CCAH) and 3‑hydroxypropionyl‑CoA dehydratase (3HPD). In performing both hydratase 
and dehydratase activities, Nmar_1308 reduces the total number of enzymes necessary for  CO2 
fixation in Thaumarchaeota, reducing the overall cost for biosynthesis. Here, we present the first 
high‑resolution crystal structure of this bifunctional enzyme with key catalytic residues in the 
thaumarchaeal 3HP/4HB pathway.
CO2 fixation allows autotrophic organisms to use inorganic carbon and energy acquired from light or chemical 
reactions as a means to synthesize the entirety of their  biomass1. This process is dually important: in addition to 
biosynthesis, it also serves a role in the removal of  CO2 from the environment. Humans have significantly altered 
the  CO2 concentrations present in the Earth’s atmosphere through industrialization and burning of fossil  fuels2. In 
order to curb this increase in atmospheric  CO2 levels, improvements must be made in sequestration methods and 
energy  efficiency3. Studying the means by which microorganisms have adapted their carbon fixation pathways and 
metabolisms to be more efficient in low-energy/nutrient environments offers a possible solution to this problem.
Archaea belonging to the phylum Thaumarchaeota (formerly known as Marine Group I Crenarchaeota) 
are well adapted to life in low nutrient  environments1,4,5 such as the open ocean, where they are estimated to 
comprise over 30% of planktonic bacterial and archaeal  populations6. Over 15 years ago, Thaumarchaeota were 
first discovered and shown to play a key role in the global nitrogen cycle—oxidizing ammonia to nitrite as the 
first step in nitrification—through molecular/genomic surveys and the subsequent isolation of Nitrosopumilus 
maritimus7–10. Since that time, Thaumarchaeota have been found in nearly every environment on Earth, and 
often have higher abundances than their ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB)  counterparts11–14. Marine Thau-
marchaeota are believed to thrive in nutrient-limited environments due to specific  adaptations4,5, requiring only 
nano-molar level  ammonia15,16. This provides an advantage for ammonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA), as they are 
in competition for the same limited resources as AOB and other microorganisms in shared  environments17,18.

All known ammonia-oxidizing Thaumarchaeota fix  CO2 with a modified version of the 3HP/4HB cycle 
originally described in Crenarchaeota and further characterized in N. maritimus1,19,20 (Fig. 1). This cycle can be 
broken down into two characteristic halves: (1) In the first part of the cycle, one acetyl-CoA and two bicarbonate 
molecules are converted to succinyl-CoA through 3-hydroxypropionate intermediate; (2) this is followed by 
the conversion of succinyl-CoA to regenerate acetyl-CoA, producing two molecules of acetyl-CoA by way of a 
4-hydroxybutyrate intermediate. From here, one of the acetyl-CoA molecules generated then serves as a carbon 
precursor for the next round of the  cycle1,21. The individual steps of this cycle, however, distinguish it from other 
known aerobic and autotrophic  CO2 fixation pathways, as well as provide further evidence of the differentiation 
and efficiency of the 3HP/4HB cycle used by Thaumarchaea versus their Crenarchaeal  ancestors1. Notably, the 
thaumarchaeal 3HP/4HB cycle requires two fewer high-energy phosphoric anhydride bonds of ATP per acetyl-
CoA molecule than the crenarchaeal 3HP/4HB cycle and three fewer than the Calvin-Benson-Bassham  cycle1.
By breaking down the 3HP/4HB cycle into individual steps, we can focus on the enzymes responsible for 
catalyzing each respective reaction. In doing so, the structure and kinetics of each enzyme can be determined to 
provide more insight into how the overall 3HP/4HB cycle in Thaumarchaeota is so energy efficient. Here we have 
focused on the Nmar_1308 enzyme because it plays an essential bifunctional role in the thaumarchaeal 3HP/4HB 
cycle, functioning as both as a 3-hydroxypropionyl-CoA dehydratase (3HPD) and crotonyl-CoA hydratase 
(CCAH)1,22. In its capacity as a 3HPD, Nmar_1308 catalyzes the conversion of 3-hydroxypropionyl-CoA to 
acryloyl-CoA and water. Conversely, as a CCAH Nmar_1308 converts crotonyl-CoA to 3-hydroxybutyryl-CoA 
through a dehydration reaction. The promiscuity of Nmar_1308 and a second bifunctional enzyme in the N.

maritimus 3HP/4HB cycle (acetyl-CoA/propionyl-CoA carboxylase) reduces the cost of protein biosynthesis 
as another means to increase overall  efficiency1. In addition, it was recently discovered that the Nmar_1308 
homolog in the crenarchaeon Metallosphaera sedula (5ZA1; Msed_2001), previously characterized as  3HPD23, 
can also function as a  CCAH22,23.
Despite the critical role of Nmar_1308 protein in this aerobic archaeal  CO2 fixation pathway, high-resolution 
structural details and dynamics of this novel enzyme remain unknown. Here, we determined the first high-
resolution crystal structure of Nmar_1308, in order to better understand the role this enzyme plays in the 
thaumarchaeal modification of the autotrophic 3HP/4HB cycle that allowed it to become one of the most energy-
efficient  CO2 fixation pathways known.
Results and discussion
Apo‑form Nmar_1308 structure. The Nmar_1308 gene encodes a bifunctional protein that plays criti-
cal roles in the 3HP/4HB cycle by functioning both as 3HPD and  CCAH1,22 (Fig.  1). The apo-form structure 
of Nmar_1308 was determined as hexameric form at 2.15 Å resolution in space group P3 2 (Fig.  2, Table 1). 
The homohexameric structure consists of a dimer of trimers arrangement. The asymmetric unit contains 6 
Nmar_1308 monomers with a total of 1422 residues. Chain A has 232 modeled residues while chain B has 236; 
chain C has 237; chain D&E have 230 and chain F has 229 modeled residues. Each subunit contains an active site 
with catalytic residues Gly109, Glu112 and Glu132 and none of the chains have bound substrates/products or 
metal ions. These three residues are a part of the well documented canonical active site of bacterial and archaeal 
enoyl-CoA hydratase/dehydratases, involving two glutamate residues and two backbone amides forming the 
oxyanion hole (Fig. 3A–C).

Water molecule between catalytic residues at the active site. Two catalytic residues Glu112 and 
Glu132 play key roles during catalysis, one as an acid and the other as a base. In the Nmar_1308 structure, they 
form hydrogen bonds with a water molecule (W71) (Fig.  3D). Two other chains in the hexamer have water 
molecules at the same position, chain E (W188) and chain F (W239), while the other three are empty. The posi-
tion of these water molecules (W71, W188, and W239) are very close to the water positions bridged by the cor-
responding two glutamic acid side chains of the other hydratase  structures24,25. This addition of the water to the 
C3 catalyzes the hydration reaction from crotonyl-CoA to 3-hydroxybutyryl-CoA, and the dehydratase reaction 
performs in the reverse direction from 3-hydroxypropionyl-CoA to acryloyl-CoA by removal of water (Fig. 3A). 
In the hydratase reaction, Glu132 protonates C2 of a ligand while Glu112 activates the water molecule that is to 
be added to C3 from the other side of the  substrate24,26. In the reverse reaction, Glu112 acts as an acid attacking 
the hydroxyl oxygen of C3 for removal of water assisted by Glu132 as a base to extract a proton from C2. The 
hexamer of Nmar_1308 with three monomers having the water and the other three without may indicate the 
flexibility of the enzyme in accommodating either substrate for hydratase or dehydratase reactions.
Dynamic oxyanion hole. The apo-form Nmar_1308 crystal structure lacks electron density for residues 
62–69 (some monomers lack one or two fewer residues) in 6 monomers, indicating the flexible nature of this 
loop located on the outer surface of each monomer. This loop is visible in ligand-bound structures of the related 
hydratases and dehydratases, indicating that the loop is flexible without a bound ligand. The residues near this 
loop display high B factors in both the apo-form Nmar_1308 and the inhibitor-bound structure of enoyl-CoA 
hydratase from Rattus norvegicus (PDB ID: 1DUB) (Fig.  3C). In contrast, the core of the enzyme hexamer is 
rather rigid including the regions in and around the binding pocket for the enoyl-group of substrates (Fig. 3C). 
In the proposed hydratase/dehydratase reaction mechanisms, two conserved residues alanine and glycine (Ala64 
and Gly109 in Nmar_1308) in the binding pocket act as an oxyanion hole by offering their backbone amides 
to the carbonyl oxygen  (O1) of the substrate and stabilizing the negative charge accumulated on O1 oxygen in

the transition state. Interestingly, Ala64 is part of the abovementioned flexible loop disordered in the apo-form 
Nmar_1308 structure while Gly109 is at the N-term end of a relatively rigid α3 helix. Again, in the holo-form of 
the hydratase and dehydratase structures, the conserved alanine of the oxyanion hole is stable. Taken together, 
the oxyanion hole is dynamically assembled when a substrate is bound at the active site and disassembled as the 
product leaves.
Comparison with other hydratase/dehydratase structures and substrate specificity. To fur-
ther confirm these notions of the active site architecture and flexibility, we then expanded the structure com-
parison to representative homologous structures (Fig.  4). Superposition of the Nmar_1308 structure with 11 
available structures indicates that there are minor conformational differences between Nmar_1308 protein and 
homologous hydratase/dehydratases structures. These structures were classified based on their catalytic proper-
ties (hydratase vs. dehydratase) or their complex states (apo or holo). Among these structures, hydratases in holo 
form (PDB IDs: 1MJ3, 1DUB, 2DUB, 1EY3, 3Q0G) and in apo form (PDB IDs: 3PZK, 3Q0J, 3H81, 5XZD); and 
a dehydratase in complex with its ligand (holo form) were (PDB IDs: 5JBX) superposed with the Nmar_1308 
structure with the indicated root mean squared deviation (RMSD) values. Msed_2001 (PDB IDs: 5ZAI) is shown 
as  bifunctional22,26. It is notable that the RMSD value between Msed_2001 and Nmar_1308 is quite small, 0.91 Å, 
the lowest among the hydratase/dehydratase compared in this study (the other RMSD are 1.04 Å to 1.22 Å). 
To provide a better understanding of these conformational differences and highlight the importance of these 
specific residues (which may define Nmar_1308 as a bifunctional enzyme), a multiple sequence alignment was 
performed using  Jalview27 (Fig. 5). The structure-based sequence alignment analysis shows the residues critical 
for the hydratase/dehydratase reactions, Ala64, Gly109, Glu112 and Glu132 are well conserved (Fig. 5A,B), and 
consistent with the active site residues reported  earlier26,28,29.
The structure-based multiple sequence alignment shows how Nmar_1308 restricts the range of short enoyl-
CoA and 3-hydroxy-acyl-CoA substrates using Trp141 in the enoyl-CoA binding pocket. In other short enoyl-
CoA hydratases this residue is Tyr142 in 3HPD of M. sedula (PDB ID: 5ZAI) 26. These bulky residues serve as 
a limiter of the substrate length by closing the bottom of the substrate enoyl-CoA binding pocket. In contrast, 
smaller or thinner side chains such as alanine (Rattus norvegicus (2DUB)), methionine (Roseovarius nubinhibens 
(5XZD)), Myxococcus xanthus (5JBX)), and glycine ( Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv (3Q0J)) can allow for 
longer chain enoyl-CoA as substrates. In addition, Trp231 provides additional hydrophobic constriction from 
helix α11 of the neighboring monomer, hence the trimer is the minimal biological enzyme unit for hydratase and 
dehydratase functions. This is well conserved between long and short chain enoyl-CoA hydratases/dehydratases; 
tryptophan, phenylalanine, or tyrosine. These residues play important roles to define substrate specificity.

synchrotron structure of Nmar_1308 with published apo/ligand bound structures of enoyl-CoA hydrates and 
3-hydroxypropionyl-CoA dehydratase (3HPD). Average RMSD values were calculated from all pairwise RMSD 
values between Cα atoms of an Nmar_1308 monomer and one of the superimposed monomers of homologous 
enzymes (36 pairs for hexamers and 18 for trimers), and are indicated below each panel. All standard errors of 
the RMSDs are below 0.01 Å. Chain A of Nmar_1308 is colored in pale green while the superposed structure

Extended hydrogen bond network at the active site of dual function hydratase/dehy ‑
dratase. The multiple sequence alignment also suggests that there are several less well conserved residues: 
Cys111, Ser116, and Gln130 (Fig. 5A,C). They might play a role for assisting the bifunctionality of this protein, 
as they are in the vicinity of the active site of the hydratase/dehydratase (Fig.  6, Table 2). For example, while 
Cys111 is conserved in homologous hydratase  structures29,30, dehydratase structures show either threonine or 
 leucine26,31. The sulfur atom of Cys111 is actually very close to side chain oxygen of Gln130 (distance of 3.5 A). 
In the structures where Cys111 is replaced with leucine, the residue corresponding to Gln130 is replaced by 
another leucine, hence forming a hydrophobic interaction. These Cys111-Gln130 or Leu-Leu/Thr pairs are prob-
ably the results of co-evolution of these two residues to keep the stable active site architecture (Fig.  6, Table 2). 
Another residue which shows variation is Ser116 that is one turn upstream of the catalytically important Glu112 
along α3 helix, partnering in the hydrogen bond network with Glu112. The serine is replaced by a methionine in 
homologous hydratase structures and alanine in the homologous dehydratase structure, both of which may not 
be able to participate in the hydrogen bond network of Glu112. Gln130 is near the other glutamic acid Glu132 
with a hydrogen bond between their oxygen atoms, hence participating indirectly in the hydratase/dehydratase 
reaction. This glutamine is conserved in homologous hydratase structures while both dehydratase and bifunc-
tional enzyme have a leucine (Leu130 for dehydratase from Myxococcus xanthus (5JBX), and Leu 131 for the 
bifunctional enzyme from Metallosphaera sedula (5ZAI)). These leucine residues will not be able to participate 
in the hydrogen bond network.
In summary, this study has provided the first high-resolution crystal structure of an enzyme within the 
thaumarchaeal 3HP/4HB cycle. Thaumarchaeota not only represent one of the most abundant microbial groups 
on the entire planet, but this  CO2 fixation pathway is one of the most energy-efficient pathways known. Thus, 
the molecular insights into the bifunctional Nmar_1308 enzyme obtained in this study have implications for 
understanding the global C cycle (e.g., dark  CO2 fixation) as well as for bioengineering applications using syn-
thetic biology approaches.

Methods
Cloning. Initially, the Nmar_1308 gene was cloned into various expression vectors for expression tests by the 
JGI Synthetic Biology Group. After finding the optimal expression vector, the Nmar 1308 gene construct was 
purchased from Genscript Biotech (codon-optimized with cleavable N-terminal hexa-Histidine tag). Within the 
gene, NdeI and BamHI endonuclease restriction sites were used to insert Nmar_1308 into the pET28a vector 
plasmid. The plasmid was transformed into E. coli, strain BL21(Rosetta-2), from EMD Millipore. Transformed 
E. coli were then grown overnight on agar plates (50 µg/ml kanamycin, 30 µg/ml chloramphenicol) at 37 °C.
Protein expression and purification. Overnight cultures started with single colonies from agar plates 
in LB media, followed with 1:100 dilution into 2L cultures for large-scale protein purification. After cultures 
reached an optical density of 0.8 at 600 nm, IPTG (final concentration 0.7 mM) was added to induce protein 
expression. Cultures were incubated overnight at 16 °C, and cell pastes were collected after centrifugation at 
4000 rpm. The cells were resuspended in a lysis buffer (pH 7.0, 1 M KCl), and sonicated. Following another 
centrifugation, soluble protein solution was collected and kept at 4 °C. Protein was further purified using Ni–
NTA affinity resin (GE Healthcare). The column was first washed with a binding buffer containing pH 7.0, 
300 mM NaCl, 20 mM TRIS, and bound protein was eluted in elution buffer containing 500 mM imidazole, 
300 mM NaCl, 50 mM TRIS, pH 7.5. Thrombin was then added to cleave N-terminal histidine tag followed by 
a reverse Ni–NTA chromatography to remove the cleaved hexa-histidine tag. The cleaved fractions containing 
the enzyme without any affinity tag were pooled, concentrated and applied to the S200 (Superdex 200) column 
as a final purification step. Concentration of the final protein solution before crystallization was measured using 
UV absorption at 280 nm (Nanodrop UV spectra) and the purity is determined by SDS-PAGE. Protein solution 
concentrated to 10 mg/ml—confirmed by Nanodrop UV spectra (280 nm).
Crystallization. The purified protein solution was added to crystal screen conditions in Terasaki plates 
(BioExpress), in 1:1 (v/v) ratio and sitting drop geometry. For the quaternary complex, protein solution was first 
mixed with equimolar amounts of 3-hydroxypropionate, coenzyme-A, and ATP . Initial screens produced no 
crystals, in apo-enzyme; beta-mercaptoethanol (BME) was added in both contexts, to reduce possible disulfide 
bonds between oligomers. Following the BME addition, crystals were obtained in both contexts. The apo-enzyme 
crystallized exclusively in 0.2 M  MgCl2, 0.1 M sodium citrate tribasic dihydrate (pH 5), 10% w/v PEG. To prepare 
for diffraction experiments at 100 K, apo-enzyme was soaked overnight in 2.5 µl of 33% glycerol cryoprotect-
ant (v/v) and 77% (v/v) mother liquor. Following cryoprotection, crystals were flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen.
Data collection and processing. Synchrotron X-ray diffraction images were collected from a single crys-
tal of Nmar_1308 using the Pilatus 6 M detector at beamline BL12-2 of the Stanford Synchrotron Radiation 
Lightsource (SSRL), SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory in Menlo Park, CA, USA. The diffraction data were 
collected to 2.1 Å resolution with unit cell dimensions a = 75.87 Å b = 75.87 Å c = 207.96 Å α = 90 β = 90 γ = 120, 
the space group P32 at a wavelength of 1.0000 Å and temperature 100 K. The diffraction data were processed with 
the XDS package for indexing and scaled by using  XSCALE32.
Structure determination and refinement. Apo-Nmar_1308 structure was determined by using the 
automated molecular replacement program  PHASER33 implemented in PHENIX  software34 with the previously 
published structure as a search model and initial rigid body refinement (PDB ID: 2DUB). After simulated-
annealing refinement, individual coordinates and TLS parameters were refined. Potential positions of altered 
side chains and water molecules were checked by using the program  COOT35. Then, positions with strong 
difference density were retained. The Ramachandran statistics for cryo-synchrotron structure (most favored/
additionally allowed/disallowed) were 94/5/0% respectively. Monomer–monomer superposition was performed 
with the similar structures of Nmar_1308 and root-mean-squared deviations (RMSDs) were calculated based on 
C-alpha atom positions. Average RMSD values were calculated by taking the average of each pairwise alignment 
RMSD between one chain of Nmar_1308 and another from the superposed homologous structure (Fig. 4). For 
the overall RMSD, the average RMSDs for each chain is averaged again. Standard errors (SEs) for the average 
RMSDs were calculated from the standard deviations of the pairwise RMSD values between two proteins using 
SE = (standard deviation of pairwise RMSDs)/sqrt (N), N is the number of monomer pairs used, 6 × 6 = 36 for 
hexamers and 6 × 3 = 18 for trimers. SE values range from 0.0003 Å to 0.008 Å. This average RMSD value between 
different monomers within the Nmar_1308 hexamer range from 0.16 to 0.24 A, substantially smaller than those 
between Nmar_1308 and the superposed homologous structures. Sequence alignment was performed by using 
homologous sequences from different organisms via Jalview  software27. During the alignment,  ClustalW36 was 
used as an algorithm with default parameters of Jalview. All figures were generated by  PyMOL37 (www. schro 
dinger. com/ pymol).
