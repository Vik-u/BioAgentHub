For an industrial fermentation process, it can be advantage ous to decouple cell growth
from product formation. This decoupling would allow for the rapid accumulation of
biomass without inhibition from product formation, after w hich the fermentation can be
switched to a mode where cells would grow minimally and prima rily act as catalysts
to convert substrate into desired product. The switch in fer mentation mode should
preferably be accomplished without the addition of expensi ve inducers. A common cell
factory Saccharomyces cerevisiaeis a Crabtree-positive yeast and is typically fermented
at industrial scale under glucose-limited conditions to av oid the formation of ethanol.
In this work, we aimed to identify and characterize promoter s that depend on glucose
concentration for use as dynamic control elements. Through analysis of mRNA data of
S. cerevisiaegrown in chemostats under glucose excess or limitation, we i dentiﬁed 34
candidate promoters that strongly responded to glucose pre sence or absence. These
promoters were characterized in small-scale batch and fed- batch cultivations using
a quickly maturing rapidly degrading green ﬂuorescent prot ein yEGFP3-Cln2 PEST as
a reporter. Expressing 3-hydroxypropionic acid (3HP) path way from a set of selected
regulated promoters allowed for suppression of 3HP product ion during glucose-excess
phase of a batch cultivation with subsequent activation in g lucose-limiting conditions.
Regulating the 3HP pathway by the ICL1 promoter resulted in 70% improvement of 3HP
titer in comparison to PGK1 promoter.

INTRODUCTION
Budding yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, is widely used for the production of fuels, chemicals, food
ingredients, food and beverages, and pharmaceuticals (
Nielsen and Jewett, 2008; Hong and Nielsen,
2012). S. cerevisiae is further being exploited for production of many new products, e .g., farnesene,
butanol, resveratrol or melatonin ( Hong and Nielsen, 2012; Shin et al., 2012; Germann et al., 2016 ;
Meadows et al., 2016 ) and many more are under development. The enabling technolog y in the
development of yeast cell factories is metabolic engineerin g, which is the introduction of directed
genetic modiﬁcations with the objective to improve the perfor mance of the cell factory ( Nielsen
and Jewett, 2008 ). Development of cell factories that can meet the high requir ements for yield, titer

and productivity, generally requires multiple rounds of meta bolic
engineering. In connection with implementation of cell fact ories
for industrial production, it is necessary to scale-up the pro cess,
and the ﬁnal process will typically involve subsequent rounds of
cultivation at diﬀerent conditions ( Figure 1). A typical process
could comprise a large-scale main cultivation in a so-called
continuous or fed-batch mode in which at least one substrate
is growth limiting, such as in the resveratrol process (
Shin
et al., 2012 ). Usually, a number of serial cultivations in batch
mode precede the main cultivation step in order to propagate
the inoculum. In principle, serial cultivation steps aim at
building up biomass while for the ﬁnal-stage cultivation it is
desirable to re-direct the metabolic ﬂuxes such that the prod uct
of interest is formed at high yield and rate (
Borodina and
Nielsen, 2014) (Figure 1). Constraints are therefore very diﬀerent
between the seed train, which prioritizes strain stability, eﬃcient
biomass production, process convenience and robustness, and
the main cultivation step, often referred to as the “productio n
phase, ” where maximal yield and product formation rate are
ultimate goals. The bioprocess is therefore imposing a number
of constraints on strain design that need to be taken into acc ount
early in process development.
In order to better match expression of metabolic pathways
to changing conditions in the cells or in the fermentation
process, a number of research groups have recently developed
strategies for dynamic regulation. As opposed to static up- or

production. The lower panel illustrates the corresponding metabolic ﬂuxes and the switch from biomass generation to pro duct formation.
down-regulations, dynamic regulation allows for re-balan cing
ﬂuxes along with changing conditions. Dynamic gene expressi on
proﬁles allow trade-oﬀs between growth and production
to be better managed and can help avoid build-up of
undesired intermediates (
Brockman and Prather, 2015b ). In their
review, Brockman and Prather (2015b) provide experimental
demonstration of the beneﬁts arising from dynamic control
on production of a number of chemicals. Farmer and Liao
improved the yield of lycopene production by 18-fold in E. coli
by implementing a sensor responding to the build-up of acetyl-
phosphate (
Farmer and Liao, 2000 ). By modulating protein levels
of glucokinase via a genetic inverter, Solomon et al. redire cted
glucose into gluconate production and improved titers by 30%
(
Solomon et al., 2012 ). Using a metabolic toggle switch in E. coli
to conditionally downregulate citrate synthase expression, Soma
et al. redirected acetyl-CoA into isopropanol production with
an improvement on titer and yield of more than 3-fold (
Soma
et al., 2014 ). Dahl et al. used whole-genome transcript arrays
to identify promoters that respond to the accumulation of a
toxic intermediate of the isoprenoid biosynthetic pathway, i. e.,
farnesyl di-phosphate (FPP), and used the identiﬁed promoters t o
regulate FPP formation and improve amorphadiene production
two-fold over constitutive or inducible promoters (
Dahl et al.,
2013). Lo et al. presented a synthetic gene circuit that decouples
E. coli cell growth from metabolite production through a two-
layered circuit based on two genetic sensor controller modul es:

one sensing feedstock substrate, the other one sensing nutr ients
(Lo et al., 2016 ). By delaying enzyme expression until cells
have depleted key nutrients and attained high cell densities , the
system positively impacted conversion of hydroxycinnamic ac ids
and oleic acid into value-added compounds ( Lo et al., 2016 ).
Conditional degradation of essential enzymes has also been
exploited to stop elongation of fatty acids and improve octano ate
production (
Torella et al., 2013 ), or to increase yield and titer
of myo-inositol production ( Brockman and Prather, 2015a ).
Conditional degradation of enzymes is an eﬃcient method for
rapidly depleting an enzyme of interest even at slow growth
rates where removal via dilution is slow (
Brockman and Prather,
2015b).
Dynamic regulation has also been employed in a number
of cases in budding yeast. On/oﬀ regulation systems like
those making use of native repressible promoters like MET3
promoter, responding to the concentration of methionine, or
HXT1 promoter reacting to glucose concentration were used
to redirect the ﬂux in the ergosterol biosynthetic pathway an d
improve production of isoprenoids of commercial interest (
Ro
et al., 2006; Asadollahi et al., 2008; Scalcinati et al., 201 2). David et
al. demonstrated the beneﬁts of hierarchical dynamic contr ol on
3-hydroxypropionic acid (3HP) production ( David et al., 2016 ).
Here, a two-layered control with a growth stage control, bas ed
on a carbon source responsive promoter, and an intracellular
metabolite concentration control, based on a malonyl-CoA
sensor, allowed for a suﬃcient build-up of biomass in the ini tial
growth phase while gradually redirecting metabolism toward
3HP production in the production phase (
David et al., 2016 ).
David et al. report a 10-fold increase in 3HP production ( David
et al., 2016 ). More recently, dynamic control was used to establish
the production of very long chain fatty acid-derived (VLCFA)
compounds in S. cerevisiae . Production suﬀered from impaired
biomass formation caused by deprivation of essential precurs ors
C22-CoA (
Yu et al., 2017 ). Dynamic control, based on carbon-
source regulated promoters, was used to relieve the competiti on
between VLCFA product formation and cell-growth associated
processes. This strategy divided the process in a production pha se
and a cell growth phase and resulted in an increase of docosano l
production of almost 4-fold. After further optimization, a ti ter of
83.5 mg/L was achieved which represents a 80-fold improvement
compared to the control strain (
Yu et al., 2017 ).
The aim of our study is to increase the number of genetic
elements that can be used by metabolic engineers for dynamic
control of metabolic pathways. As industrial fermentation
processes often comprise diﬀerent phases ( Figure 1), we
embarked on identifying and characterizing a set of native y east
promoters that can be used to control expression of metabolic
pathways in a dynamic manner, and will positively impact
production of value-added chemicals in an industrially rele vant
context. In order for our tools to be potentially applicable to
various kinds of industrial production processes, from bulk t o
high value-added products, it was decided to use elements alr eady
present in the cultivation medium to drive transient expressi on
of genes. Amongst others, glucose is a nutrient often used as
a carbon source. Furthermore concentrations of glucose lar gely
diﬀer in the seed train, usually operated as batch, and the ﬁnal
stage fermentation where glucose is often fed in limiting am ounts
to avoid overﬂow metabolism. Glucose was thus identiﬁed as
the element that will trigger the dynamic regulation of gene
expression in our system.
Through analysis of genome-wide transcription datasets
retrieved from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database
(GEO database), a number of promoters were identiﬁed, cloned
upstream of a quickly maturing, rapidly degrading green
ﬂuorescent protein yEGFP3-Cln2 PEST and integrated into S.
cerevisiae genome. Promoter activity was then characterized
in microscale batch and fed-batch conditions. As a proof of
the concept, the most promising promoters for transient gene
expression were successfully applied to control the production of
3-hydroxypropionic acid.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Analysis of Transcriptome Data
Transcription data was retrieved from the GEO database, using
the R package GEOquery (
Davis and Meltzer, 2007 ), for a
microarray study comparing diﬀerent nutrient limited chemost at
cultivations of CEN.PK113-7D (accession GDS777) ( Tai et al.,
2005). The summarized expression values provided by the
authors were log2 transformed before applying a linear model
(LIMMA) to identify diﬀerentially expressed genes between
the glucose-limited experiments and the other nutrient limi ted
experiments for the aerobic series of chemostat cultivations .
The diﬀerential expression proﬁles (log2-fold-change of glucos e-
limited vs. others) for HXT1, TEF1, ADH1, MAL12 genes were
used to ﬁnd other correlated genes using the Pearson correlat ion
coeﬃcient and test for signiﬁcance.
Cloning of the Selected Promoters

S. cerevisiaeGenome
Primers for PCR ampliﬁcation and Uracil excision mediated
cloning of the diﬀerent promoters into the integrative vector
pCFB0125 were designed and are listed as Table S1. As the
length of promoter regions is not always well deﬁned, the
promoter sequence length was either deﬁned based on previous
reports or as starting approximately 1,000 bp upstream of the
start codon (ATG) when no reference in the literature could
be identiﬁed. In order to closely follow promoter activity,
promoters were cloned upstream of a quickly maturing and
rapidly degrading green ﬂuorescent protein encoding gene:
yEGFP3-Cln2PEST (
Mateus and Avery, 2000 ). yEGFP3-Cln2PEST,
as reporter gene, was ampliﬁed using the following primers:

GAATTATTC and uGFP_rv: CACGCGAUTCATATTACTTGG
GTATTGCCC) with pCFB0058 (pFA6a-yEGFP3-CLN2-PEST-
natMX6, EUROSCARF). Uracil excision was used as cloning
method to combine the diﬀerent promoter-yEGFP3-Cln2 PEST
expression cassettes together onto pCFB0125. pCFB0125 is a
pESC-URA-ccdB vector devoid of its 2micron replication origin ,
which makes it a non replicative vector that will integrate at

cloning conditions were used, as described previously ( Jensen
et al., 2014 ). After veriﬁcation of successful cloning, each and
every vector was linearized by digestion with restriction e nzyme

cerevisiae CEN.PK 113-5D. Transformants were selected on agar
plates containing SC-Ura medium and were used for cultivation
experiments.
Construction of 3-hydroxypropionic Acid
S. cerevisiaeProducing Strains
All strains from this study were derived from S. cerevisiae
CEN.PK102-5B MATa ura3-52 his31 leu2-3/112 MAL2-8c
SUC2 obtained from Peter Kötter (Johann Wolfgang Goethe-
University Frankfurt, Germany). This strain was further
modiﬁed by integration of single copy integrative vectors
pCFB0380 (PTEF1-SeACS_L641P; PPGK1-ALD6; KlLEU2) and
pCFB0382 (PTEF1-PDC1; SpHIS5). The latter strain is the
parent strain for the 3HP producing strains of this study.
Four Plasmids were constructed based on pCFB0343 (PTEF1-
ACC1**; PPGK1/CaMCR; KlURA3; insertion site Easyclone X-
2). More details about the Easyclone plasmid set and integrati on
sites can be found at
Jensen et al. (2014) . Backbone vector
fragment was prepared for USER cloning by PCR using
primers vec_open_mid_ptrTEF1-PGK1 and vec_open_CaMCR
and template pCFB0343. Three promoter containing fragments
were prepared by PCR using S. cerevisiae genomic DNA
as template and primers pHXT7_switch and pHXT7_rev for
promoter pHXT7, pADH2_switch and pADH2_rev for promoter
PADH2, and primers pICL1_switch and pICL1_rev for promoter
pICL1. Primer sequences can be found in Table 1.
By combining, under standard uracil exclusion cloning
conditions (
Jensen et al., 2014 ), backbone vector prepared as
described above and insert PHXT7, PADH2 or PICL1, one
obtains three single integrative vectors pCFB0728 (PTEF1-
ACC1**; PHXT7-CaMCR; insertion site Easyclone X-2),
pCFB0727 (PTEF1-ACC1**; PADH2-CaMCR; insertion site
Easyclone X-2) and pCFB0729 (PTEF1-ACC1**; PICL1-CaMCR;
insertion site Easyclone X-2), respectively. After transfo rming

Cultivation
Strains bearing the diﬀerent promoter-yEGFP3-Cln2 PEST
expression cassettes were cultivated in two diﬀerent conditi ons:
(1) in batch mode with mineral medium containing glucose
as sole carbon source (
Jensen et al., 2014 ); (2) in fed-batch
mode with synthetic fed-batch medium for S. cerevisiae M-
Sc.syn-1000 purchased from m2p-labs GmbH (Baesweiler,
Germany). M-Sc.syn-1000 medium was supplemented
with the supplied vitamins solution (ﬁnal 1% v/v) and the
enzyme mix (ﬁnal concentration 0.5% v/v) immediately prior
to use.
Mineral medium contained (L −1): 7.5 g (NH4) 2SO4, 14.4 g
KH2PO4, 0.5 g MgSO 4-7H2O, 22 g dextrose, 2 mL trace metals
solution, and 1 mL vitamins. The pH of the medium was adjusted
to 6 prior to autoclavation. Vitamin solution was added to the
medium after autoclavation. Trace metals solution was adde d
after autoclavation. Trace metals solution contained (L −1): 4.5 g
CaCl2-2H2O, 4.5 g ZnSO 4-7H2O, 3 g FeSO 4-7H2O, 1 g H 3BO3,
1 g MnCl 2-4H2O, 0.4 g Na 2MoO4-2H2O, 0.3 g CoCl 2-6H2O, 0.1
g CuSO 4-5H2O, 0.1 g KI, 15 g EDTA. The trace metals solution
was prepared by dissolving all the components except EDTA in
900 mL ultrapure water at pH 6. The solution was then gently
heated and EDTA was added. In the end, the pH was adjusted to
4, and the solution volume was adjusted to 1 L and autoclaved
(121◦C in 20 min). This solution was stored at + 4◦C. Vitamin
solution contained (L-1): 50 mg biotin, 200 mg p-aminobenzoi c
acid, 1 g nicotinic acid, 1 g Capantothenate, 1 g pyridoxine-HC l,
1 g thiamine-HCl, 25 g myo-inositol. Biotin was dissolved in 2 0
mL 0.1 M NaOH and 900 mL water is added. pH was adjusted to
6.5 with HCl and the rest of the vitamins were added. pH was
re-adjusted to 6.5 just before and after adding m-inositol. T he
ﬁnal volume was adjusted to 1 L, sterile-ﬁltered and stored a t
+ 4◦C.
Composition of M-Sc.syn-1000, vitamin solution and enzyme
mix are proprietary and were not disclosed to us.
The main diﬀerence between the mineral medium and
the synthetic M-Sc.syn-1000 used here deals with the carbon
source that each contains. In mineral medium used for batch
cultivations, glucose is present as at a starting concentrat ion of
20g.L−1 while synthetic medium M-Sc.syn-1000, used for fed-
batch, contains a solubilized glucose polymer which, due to th e
activity of glucose releasing enzymes, allows for the slow r elease
of glucose monomers and limits biomass production.
All cultivations were performed at 30 ◦C with 1,000 rpm in
the microbioreactor system BioLector (m2p-labs). Forty eig ht
cultivations were run in parallel in FlowerPlates (m2p-labs) with
a working volume of 1.1 mL per well. Biomass growth (light
scattering units, LSU) and ﬂuorescence (relative ﬂuorescen ce
units, RFU) were monitored online approximately every 12 min.

Outlier Removal and Data Correction
Some cultivations were removed before further analysis due t o
data quality or failure of the cultivation to proceed normally .
Background Correction and Alignment of
Measurements
To correct the biomass measurements for background signal,
we calculated the growth rates µ via two diﬀerent methods and
compared them for various possible backgrounds to determine
the optimal background value. The ﬁrst method is derived from
Poulsen et al. (2003) , and is known as the log of slope (LOS)
method.
Poulsen et al. (2003) note that experimental data that can
be described by an exponential function sometimes contains a n
oﬀset, giving a function of the form
b = b0 ·exp(µ t) + c (1)
Where b is biomass and t is time, µ is growth rate, c is the
background, b0 is the initial value of of b at t = 0. In order to
remove the background and calculate µ , take the derivative with
respect to t and take the natural log to get
log
( db
dt
)
= log(b0µ ) + µ t (2)
Thus, the slope of any rectilinear section of the LOS plot will be
the speciﬁc growth rate µ .
Here, we extend this past what is described by
Poulsen et al.
(2003) by taking the derivative of Equation (2) with respect to
time and further simplifying with the chain rule to get:
µ = d
dt
(
log
( db
dt
))
= d2b
dt
/ db
dt (3)
Thus, we see that if we have a function describing the data,
assuming an underlying exponential dependence on t, dividing
the second derivative of this function by the ﬁrst derivativ e
will give us µ . This expression for µ is not dependent on the
magnitude of b and is thus independent of background.
The second method of calculating growth rate is simply the
deﬁnition of a growth rate normalized to population size:
µ = db/ dt
b (4)
This method is commonly applied for calculating growth rate of
cell populations (
Ronen et al., 2002; De Jong et al., 2010; Rudge
et al., 2016 ). As this depends directly on b, it is thus dependent on
background.
It was observed that the biomass proﬁles of batch cultures
exhibit a slight peak at the diauxic shift ( Altintas et al., 2016 ;
Figure 3B). For each biomass proﬁle, the time of the peak was
identiﬁed by determining the time at which light scattering began
decreasing. If no peak was found, the peak was artiﬁcially set
to 10 h for batch cultures and 33 h for fed-batch cultures. A
window of 7.5 to 0.5 h before the diauxic shift peak for batch
cultures and 20.5 to 1.5 h before the diauxic shift peak for
fed-batch cultures was then used to calculate growth rates vi a
each of the two methods described above in Equations (3) and
(4). These time windows were chosen as the growth curves
appeared approximately exponential in these regions, which is
an assumption of the LOS method. Derivatives were computed
numerically from a smoothing spline ﬁt to the data. The ﬁrst
and last 6 points of the calculated growth rates were trimmed t o
account for edge eﬀects of the smoothing spline and the sum of
squared errors (SSE) between the remaining growth rate proﬁl es
were compared. The growth rate calculation via the Equation ( 4)
was repeated for a range of background values from 0 to 13 for
batch cultures and 0 to 10 for fed-batch and compared for each
value to growth rate calculated via Equation (3). The backgr ound
value giving the minimum SSE for each biomass proﬁle was
chosen.
To correct for background ﬂuorescence, we used ﬂuorescence
measurements from a control strain (p0125) cultivated under the
same conditions as experimental strains. These measurement s
were used to deﬁne a function relating control ﬂuorescence
(autoﬂuorescence) as a function of biomass, which we will ca ll
fc(b). For each experimental strain, each biomass measurement
was input into fc(b) to obtain the autoﬂuorescence for that
amount of biomass. This autoﬂuorescence was then subtracte d
from the corresponding experimental ﬂuorescence associated
with that biomass measurement. This process was carried out
for all biomass/ﬂuorescence measurements in each experimen tal
strain, resulting in a background-corrected ﬂuorescence pr oﬁle
for each replicate.
In order to compare replicates we aligned the growth
curves such that landmark events occur at the same time.
This is necessary as the lag phase may last diﬀerent amounts
of time for diﬀerent cultivation experiments even when the
pattern of biomass accumulation is the same after entry to
exponential phase. In this case we are interested in the diauxi c
shift so we used this as the landmark with which to align
the growth curves. As previously described we identiﬁed the
diauxic shift peak and determined the diﬀerence between this
landmark and a reference time, which we set to be at 15 h for
batch cultures and 30 h for fed-batch cultures. This diﬀerenc e
was subtracted from the entire set of times corresponding
to both biomass and ﬂuorescence measurements to determine
the corrected times; moving forward, we only use data from
corrected times greater than 0. A similar procedure for growt h
curve alignment is discussed by
van Ditmarsch and Xavier
(2011).
Promoter Activities in Small-Scale Batch
Cultivations
Background-corrected biomass and ﬂuorescence proﬁles were
input into the PromAct model (
Kannan et al., 2018 ) using a
protein maturation rate of 0.45 h−1 as described for EGFP
(Heim et al., 1995 ) and a protein degradation rate of 0.5 h−1
as described for yEGFP3-Cln2 PEST (Mateus and Avery, 2000 ).
mRNA degradation rate was set as 1
3 h−1 based on genome-wide
estimates of mRNA degradation in S. cerevisiae (Munchel et al.,
2011; Neymotin et al., 2014 ).

Maury et al. Glucose-Dependent Promoters for Dynamic Regulation
The promoter activity proﬁles were cropped to 35 h for batch
and 60 h for fed-batch cultures on the corrected time scale fo r
standardization. Lag phase was identiﬁed as when the rate of
change of the average biomass proﬁle over all replicates from
a given promoter ﬁrst surpassed 0.5 LSU per h. The diauxic
shift was identiﬁed as the time between the characteristic pe ak,
identiﬁed as where the derivative of the average biomass proﬁ le
over all replicates becomes crosses 0, to when the derivative next
surpasses 0.5 LSU per h following this peak. For batch cultures,
the stationary phase was also identiﬁed using the same peak
detection method as with the diauxic shift identiﬁcation, a s a
similar characteristic peak is seen. A similar method for gro wth
phase identiﬁcation was used by
Altintas et al. (2016) . “Early” and
“Late” designations in Figure 4 indicate the ﬁrst and second half
of each growth phase, respectively.
Measurement of 3-hydroxipropionic Acid
Concentration
Strains expressing CaMCR (malonyl-CoA reductase from
Chloroﬂexus aurantiacus ) for the production of 3HP were
cultivated in FlowerPlates in the BioLector, in the same
conditions as described above, in batch and fedbatch modes.
Samples for 3HP measurement were taken during the course
of the cultivations, 3HP concentration was measured using a
dedicated enzyme assay. The enzyme assay was performed as
described in the supplementary materials of
Borodina et al.
(2015).
RESULTS
Selection of Promoters Through Analysis
of Genome-Wide Transcription Datasets
In order to identify promoters with glucose-dependent
expression proﬁles, we searched the literature for genome-
wide expression datasets comparing glucose-limited and gluc ose
excess conditions.
Boer et al. (2003) characterized the speciﬁc
transcriptional responses of S. cerevisiae cells growing at steady
state in chemostats under growth limitation by carbon, nitr ogen,
phosphorus, or sulfur. We performed an analysis of this dataset
in order to directly compare gene expression levels in the gluc ose
limiting condition to the average of expression levels obser ved
while not glucose limited (e.g., combining the results from the
sulfur, the phosphorus and the nitrogen limiting conditions)
which we describe as “glucose excess” conditions.
The 2D histogram ( Figure 2B) displays the comparison of
gene expression levels between glucose-limited and glucose
excess conditions. The volcano plot ( Figure 2A) displays the
genes found signiﬁcantly diﬀerently expressed between gluco se-
limited and glucose excess conditions. Four archetypes of
gene expression were identiﬁed for their known roles and are
represented in Figure 2: (1) TEF1 archetype with constitutive
expression in both conditions, (2) HXT1 archetype with high
expression in glucose-excess and low expression in glucose-
limiting conditions, (3) ADH2, and (4) MAL12 archetypes
with low expression in glucose-excess and high expression in
glucose limiting conditions. As some of the archetypes are
not diﬀerentially expressed in this comparison, e.g., TEF1,
the identiﬁed genes correlated with them are most often not
diﬀerentially expressed in this comparison. By contrast, genes
signiﬁcantly correlated to ADH2 and HXT1 were among the most
diﬀerentially expressed in glucose-excess vs. glucose limitin g
conditions.
From the archetype correlation analysis, 34 genes were
identiﬁed with diverse expression proﬁles in respect to dynami c
regulation of gene expression. Promoter regions from all 34
genes were cloned (or attempted) as reported in the materials
and methods section. Although not all were expected to
be signiﬁcantly diﬀerentially expressed, 20 genes were found
signiﬁcantly up-regulated in glucose limiting conditions an d
5 genes were signiﬁcantly down-regulated in glucose excess
conditions (p < 0.05 after Benjamini-Hochberg correction).
Characterization of Promoter Activities in
Microfermentations
Microscale Batch Cultivations
Batch cultivations were followed until stationary phase was
reached. As presented in Figure 3, the two classical growth phases
of a S. cerevisiae batch fermentation, where glucose is the sole
carbon source, were clearly observed with a glucose growth phas e
followed by an ethanol growth phase separated by a diauxic shift
(
Monod, 1941 ). A few typical proﬁles of promoter activity are
presented in Figure 3: constitutive expression, i.e., TEF1, high
expression in glucose-excess conditions, i.e., PGK1 and TDH3,
activation at low glucose concentration, i.e., HXK1, HXT7, and
MAL12 or expression when growing on ethanol in the absence
of glucose, i.e., ADH2, ICL1, and ACS1. None of the promoters
tested showed sustained activity in stationary phase, likely due to
the lack of metabolic activity in the absence of carbon sourc es.
Promoter activities of other promoters tested can be found in
Figure S1.
A heat map and cluster analysis were applied to all
promoter activities in the batch condition ( Figure 4). The
cluster analysis reveals a tight correlation between promote r
activities experimentally determined here and the gene
expression categories deﬁned from the analysis of genome-
wide transcription data presented in Figure 2, which reﬂects
that the diﬀerent promoters cloned upstream of yEGFP3-
Cln2PEST respond mostly in a similar fashion as when they are
in their native context. Globally, two main branches appear,
at the top of the ﬁgure promoters active in glucose excess
conditions, and at the bottom can be observed promoters
activating at low glucose concentration or when glucose is
absent ( Figure 4). This cluster analysis grouped proﬁles by
archetype group in all but 6 cases where cluster grouping
seemed to contradict with the gene expression data. This
was observed for the promoters of ISF1, FDH1, FOX2, RGI2,
YIG1, and EGO4 (Figure 4). In the case of EGO4, ( RGI2
YIL057C), and FOX2, this may be explained by their unclear
promoter activity patterns (Figure S1). The three others, ISF1,
FDH1, and YIG1, clearly behave in opposite fashion compared
to what was expected from the gene expression analysis
(Figure 2).

Microscale Fed-Batch Cultivations
In this microscale fed-batch cultivation, realized using t he
glucose slow release technology Feed-In-Time (m2p-labs), t wo
main growth phases are observed: (1) an initial phase until
approximately 25 h of cultivation where residual glucose is st ill
present at a low level (2) a glucose-limiting growth phase afte r
25 h of cultivation where biomass growth is limited by the slo w
release of glucose ( Figure 5).
In terms of promoter activity, two major activity proﬁles
appear: (1) promoters characterized by a higher and sustained
activity in the ﬁrst growth phase that remain active in the sec ond
phase, although to a lower extent (e.g., TEF1, PGK1, TDH3,
HXT7, MAL12); and (2) promoters that strongly activate at the
onset of glucose limiting phase and that quickly become at mos t
weakly active or inactive ( ADH2, ACS1, ICL1).
Based on the outcome of promoter activity characterization,
it was decided to run a proof of concept study and test a subset
of promoters for transient expression and controlled producti on
of a commercially relevant compound, with the objective of
restricting its production only in “production” phase in fed-b atch
and not during the seed train phases carried on as batch.
Proof of Concept Study: Dynamic
Regulation of 3-hydroxypropionic Acid
(3HP) Production
3HP is a platform chemical that can be converted into
acrylic acid, 1,3-propanediol, malonic acid, and other
valuable chemicals. In 2011, the world annual production
of acrylic acid was 5000 kMT and the market size was USD
11.5 billion (
Borodina et al., 2015 ). Acrylic acid-derived
products include superabsorbent polymers used in diapers
and incontinence products, plastics, coatings, adhesives,
elastomers, and paints (
Borodina et al., 2015 ). In biological
systems, 3HP can be synthesized via at least four diﬀerent
intermediates: glycerol, lactate, malonyl-CoA or β -alanine
(
Kumar et al., 2013 ). Production of 3HP based on the β -
alanine or the malonyl-CoA have been reported in S. cerevisiae
(Chen et al., 2014; Borodina et al., 2015; Kildegaard et al.,
2016). Furthermore, Kildegaard et al. reported a reduced
growth rate of the strains expressing the malonyl-CoA route
for 3HP production, especially in the case where pathway
genes were integrated in multiple copies (
Kildegaard et al.,
2016).
In an attempt to control production of 3HP via the
malonyl-CoA route, with the objective to drive 3HP productio n
only in “production” phase in fed-batch and not during
the seed train phases carried on as batch, three promoters
were selected based on their expression proﬁles: p HXT7,
pADH2, and p ICL1. They were selected for their weak (if
not absent) expression in cultivation with excess of glucose
and their induction in glucose limiting conditions ( Figure 3).
Promoters of HXT7, ADH2, and ICL1 were then cloned
upstream of the gene encoding bi-functional malonyl-CoA
reductase from Chloroﬂexus aurantiacus (CaMCR), which is
the only heterologous enzyme necessary for producing 3HP
via the malonyl-CoA route in S. cerevisiae . As a reference,
CaMCR was expressed under the control of p PGK1, a promoter
which is both active in glucose excess and glucose limiting
conditions ( Figures 3, 5). When p PGK1 is controlling the
expression of CaMCR, a clear accumulation of 3HP is observed
already at the early stages of growth on glucose in the batch
condition ( Figure 6). This is clearly not the case when the
(glucose-) regulated promoters p HXT7, p ADH2 and p ICL1 are

controlling CaMCR expression, as here production of 3HP
remains below detection limit of the assay ( Figure 6). In the
fed-batch cultivation condition, where all promoters are be ing
activated, 3HP production is restored. Expressing CaMCR from
the regulated ICL1 promoter resulted in a 1.7-fold increase in
3HP production when compared to the constitutive expression
from PGK1 promoter (Figure 6).
It is clearly demonstrated here that production of a metaboli te
of interest can be turned on and oﬀ by using a set of dynamicall y
activated promoters. Furthermore, turning oﬀ 3HP production
in growth phases of batch fermentation did not aﬀect the
ﬁnal production titer in the fed-batch condition, and was
even beneﬁcial, especially when p ICL1 controlled expression of
CaMCR.
DISCUSSION
In this study, speciﬁc genome-wide expression datasets were
analyzed in order to identify genes characterized by diﬀerent
expression patterns in glucose excess as compared to glucose
limiting conditions. Four archetypes of gene expression were
deﬁned. A number of genes with expression patterns qualiﬁed as
interesting were selected and their promoters cloned upstream
of a quickly maturing rapidly degrading GFP. Destabilized

GFP variants are better suited for the study of transient gen e
expression as native GFP variants have particularly long half -
lives. In this study, it was decided to use yEGFP3-Cln2 PEST which
is a destabilized variant of GFP that has successfully been us ed
to monitor dynamic changes in gene expression in yeast ( Mateus
and Avery, 2000 ). After characterizing promoter activities both
in batch with glucose as sole carbon source and glucose-limi ting
fedbatch conditions, a hand full of promoters were chosen for
a proof of concept study where controlled production of the
commercially relevant chemical 3HP was demonstrated.
Comparing results from the genome-wide gene expression
analysis and from the characterization of promoter activity in
the batch cultivation conditions, it was interesting to not ice
the correlation between the archetypes deﬁned for the genome -
wide gene expression analysis ( Figure 2) and the clusters
obtained for the promoter activity characterization ( Figure 4).
This conﬁrmed that most of the promoters cloned upstream
yEGFP3-Cln2PEST respond according to the archetype deﬁned
for the gene they relate to. It also indicated that elements
responsible for transcriptional regulation of those genes ar e
present in the promoter sequence used in this study. This
validated the promoter sequences that were chosen here.
Discrepancies were observed though for six genes. For three
of them, ISF1, FDH1, and YIG1, the promoter that was
cloned triggered an expression pattern opposite to what was
reported for the genome-wide gene expression analysis. This m ay
indicate that the chosen promoter sequence is lacking regula tory
elements otherwise present in the native promoter, or that DNA
structure at the integration site aﬀects activity pattern of t hese
promoters.
Taking a look at promoter activities measured during the
microscale fedbatch cultivation, it appeared that while some
promoters were only activated at the onset of glucose limitatio n
(e.g., promoters of ACS1, ADH2, ICL1, SFC1, SPG4 ), others
were characterized by a much wider expression time window,
with an early activation (e.g., promoters of HXT7, MAL12,
FMP3) ( Figure 5). This may be explained by the fact that the
latter promoters are active already in the phase where residua l
glucose is present but at a low concentration. This early phase
of the microscale fedbatch experiment is an intermediary phas e
caused by the technology employed here, i.e., the Feed-In-Ti me
technology as a low amount of free glucose is initially present i n
the medium and acts as a carbon source until the slow enzymati c
release of glucose from the polymer takes over and triggers
glucose limitation. The low concentration of glucose in this
early phase may still allow for activation of the above-mentio ned
promoters (Figure 5).
Surprisingly, promoters like ADH2, ICL1, or ACS1 were
characterized by a burst of expression at the onset of the
glucose limiting phase. These promoter activity proﬁles
suggest a rapid increase and decrease in their activity altho ugh
they appear to maintain some activity for roughly 10 h
after activation. This was not necessarily expected as the
corresponding genes were clearly maintaining expression in
the glucose limited continuous cultivation of the genome-
wide gene expression analysis ( Figure 2). It further underlines
the necessity for testing genetic elements for controlled
expression in conditions as close as possible to the intended
bioprocess.
Beneﬁts of dynamic control of metabolic pathways have
been demonstrated before, as described in the introduction .
Nevertheless, this study further conﬁrms that transient ac tivation
of a metabolic pathway does not negatively impact production of
a compound of interest, here 3HP , but rather beneﬁts productio n
performance, as shown here in the case where ICL1 promoter
restricts expression of CaMCR to the microscale fedbatch
cultivation stage ( Figure 6). Even-though other factors, e.g.,
timing of MCR expression, substrate availability or pathway
intermediate concentrations may also contribute to the bene ﬁts
observed on 3HP production, it is surprising that such a sudden
and short expression timespan triggered by ICL1 promoter
can result in superior production of the compound of interest

as compared to longer expression timespan as in the case of
pHXT7 or p PGK1. This certainly raises the question whether
sudden, short but high expression bursts at the onset of chang ing
conditions could not be suﬃcient to sustain eﬃcient producti on
of chemicals of interest. Reducing the timespan of expression o f
a promoter may be beneﬁcial to the overall production process
as it may restrict the loads of energy spent on transcription an d
translation of the speciﬁc gene only to a brief time-window.
Recently Christiano et al. measured 8.8–12 h as median half li ves
of proteins in S. cerevisiae (
Christiano et al., 2014 ). Therefore,
once synthesized the functional protein would still remain i n the
cells even though the promoter of its gene, hence transcriptio n
and translation of that gene, would be oﬀ during most of
the cultivation. Promoters like ICL1, ADH2, ACS1, combined
with other synthetic biology tools that could expand mRNA
half-lives, e.g., sequences improving mRNA stability (
Curran
et al., 2013; Yamanishi et al., 2013 ), may certainly play an active
role.
CONCLUSION
Through analysis of gene expression data, promoters showing
speciﬁc responses to glucose excess or limitation were identi ﬁed.
DNA sequences of these promoters were cloned upstream of
a quickly maturing and rapidly degrading green ﬂuorescent
protein to allow the study of promoter activities. Dynamics of
promoter activities for a number of promoters in batch with
glucose as sole carbon source, or glucose limiting condition s
were analyzed. A subset of promoters, p ADH2, p ICL1, and
pHXT7, were demonstrated as suitable for dynamic control
