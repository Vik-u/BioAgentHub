Abstract 
Background: 3‑Hydroxypropionic acid (3‑HP) is an important platform chemical, serving as a precursor for a wide 
range of industrial applications such as the production of acrylic acid and 1,3‑propanediol. Although Escherichia coli or 
Saccharomyces cerevisiae are the primary industrial microbes for the production of 3‑HP , alternative engineered hosts 
have the potential to generate 3‑HP from other carbon feedstocks. Methylobacterium extorquens AM1, a facultative 
methylotrophic α‑proteobacterium, is a model system for assessing the possibility of generating 3‑HP from one‑
carbon feedstock methanol.
Results: Here we constructed a malonyl‑CoA pathway by heterologously overexpressing the mcr gene to convert 
methanol into 3‑HP in M. extorquens AM1. The engineered strains demonstrated 3‑HP production with initial titer of 
6.8 mg/l in shake flask cultivation, which was further improved to 69.8 mg/l by increasing the strength of promoter 
and mcr gene copy number. In vivo metabolic analysis showed a significant decrease of the acetyl‑CoA pool size 
in the strain with the highest 3‑HP titer, suggesting the supply of acetyl‑CoA is a potential bottleneck for further 
improvement. Notably, 3‑HP was rapidly degraded after the transition from exponential phase to stationary phase. 
Metabolomics analysis showed the accumulation of intracellular 3‑hydroxypropionyl‑CoA at stationary phase with the 
addition of 3‑HP into the cultured medium, indicating 3‑HP was first converted to its CoA derivatives. In vitro enzy‑
matic assay and β‑alanine pathway dependent 13C‑labeling further demonstrated that a reductive route sequentially 
converted 3‑HP‑CoA to acrylyl‑CoA and propionyl‑CoA, with the latter being reassimilated into the ethylmalonyl‑CoA 
pathway. The deletion of the gene META1_4251 encoding a putative acrylyl‑CoA reductase led to reduced degrada‑
tion rate of 3‑HP in late stationary phase.
Conclusions: We demonstrated the feasibility of constructing the malonyl‑CoA pathway in M. extorquens AM1 to 
generate 3‑HP . Furthermore, we showed that a reductive route coupled with the ethylmalonyl‑CoA pathway was the 
major channel responsible for degradation of the 3‑HP during the growth transition. Engineered M. extorquens AM1 
represents a good platform for 3‑HP production from methanol.

Background
3-Hydroxypropionic acid (3-HP) is an important plat -
form chemical, serving as a precursor for a wide range of 
industrial applications such as the production of acrylic 
acid and 1,3-propanediol [1, 2]. Additionally, 3-HP can 
be polymerized alone to generate poly-3-hydroxypropi
-
onate or in combination with other monomers to obtain 
biodegradable polymers [3, 4]. There are two major 
routes that have been developed for 3-HP synthesis in 
engineered microorganisms including Escherichia coli, 
Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Pyrococcus furiosus. One 
route is referred as the malonyl-CoA pathway, which 
reduces malonyl-CoA to synthesize 3-HP by either a 
bifunctional malonyl-CoA reductase (Mcr) or the com
-
bined malonyl-CoA reductase and malonate semial -
dehyde reductase [5–8]. Another recently developed 
route is called the β-alanine dependent pathway, which 
involves decarboxylation of aspartate to β-alanine and 
conversion of β-alanine to malonate semialdehyde then 
3-HP [9, 10]. So far the highest titer of 3-HP produc
-
tion (3.7 g/l) by expressing the malonyl-CoA pathway in 
shake flasks has been achieved in E. coli grown on glu
-
cose [11, 12]. It is noteworthy that in nature 3-HP serves 
in central metabolism either as an intermediate of C3/C4 
assimilation cycles or as an input carbon source in some 
bacteria and archaea. For example, Chloroflexus auran
-
tiacus can utilize 3-HP as an intermediate in the 3-HP/
malyl-CoA cycle to assist in two  CO
2 fixation pathways 
[13], and Rhodobacter sphaeroides can utilize 3-HP as 
the sole carbon and energy source by reducing 3-HP to 
3-hydroxypropionyl-CoA, then through acrylyl-CoA to 
propionyl-CoA for incorporating into cell components 
[14]. Furthermore, in some engineered bacteria such as 
Pseudomonas denitrificans, 3-HP is rapidly degraded and 
reassimilated in the late period of cultivation through an 
oxidative route leading to the generation of acetyl-CoA 
and  CO
2 [15–18]. Hence, understanding the function and 
regulation of reassimilation is another important issue 
for stably enhancing the titer of 3-HP .
One goal of metabolic engineering is to develop renew
-
able and sustainable alternatives to produce 3-HP . In par-
ticular, methanol is an important C1 feedstock that can 
be generated from synthesis gas (a mixture of CO and 
 H
2) or from biogas, assuming high quantity and low mar -
ket price [19, 20]. Methylobacterium extorquens AM1, 
a facultative methylotrophic α-proteobacterium capa -
ble of using methanol and multiple carbon compounds 
as carbon and energy sources, has served as the best-
characterized model organism for studying one-carbon 
metabolism [21, 22]. In M. extorquens AM1 assimilation 
during methylotrophic metabolism involves three inter
-
locked cycles: the serine cycle, the ethylmalonyl-CoA 
pathway (EMC pathway) and the poly-3-hydroxybu -
tyrate (PHB) cycle [23, 24]. The main function of the 
EMC pathway is to regenerate glyoxylate from acetyl-
CoA for reincorporation into the serine cycle during C1 
assimilation [25–29]. It has been shown that significant 
metabolic flux goes through the serine cycle and EMC 
pathway during the cell grown on methanol, generating 
a stable supply of acetyl-CoA as a precursor for the pro
-
duction of mevalonate acid, α-humulene and 1-butanol 
in engineered M. extorquens AM1 [30–33]. This feature 
is an advantage for engineering a modified malonyl-CoA 
pathway in M. extorquens to produce 3-HP as acetyl-CoA 
can be directly converted to malonyl-CoA. In addition, 
the growth rate of M. extorquens AM1 on methanol is 
significantly faster than that of C. aurantiacus which has 
native pathway to produce 3-HP from  CO
2 fixation [34], 
which added another advantage to use M. extorquens 
AM1 as a C1 platform for 3-HP production.
When M. extorquens AM1 is grown on multicarbon 
compounds, they are utilized through different entry 
points. Succinate has an entry point at the tricarbox
-
ylic acid cycle (TCA cycle), and pyruvate can be utilized 
through an overlap of the serine cycle and TCA cycle 
[35, 36]. Acetate is first converted to acetyl-CoA, which 
is further assimilated through both the EMC pathway 
and TCA cycle [37]. Moreover, some dicarboxylic acids 
such as methylsuccinic acid and mesaconic acid are also 
able to be assimilated via the EMC pathway although the 
growth rate is much slower than that on succinate and 
methanol [38]. 3-HP is a molecule of carboxylic acid and 
propionyl-CoA involved in its natural assimilation is an 
intermediate of the EMC pathway as well. From the view
-
point of carboxylic acid use in M. extorquens AM1, it is 
important not only to study how to improve 3-HP titer 
but also to investigate whether there is a loss of 3-HP due 
to product reuptake.
In this study, we constructed and tuned the malo
-
nyl-CoA pathway to produce 3-HP (Fig.  1) and then 
improve 3-HP titer in M. extorquens AM1 grown on 
methanol. Further, we used metabolomics, enzymatic 
assay and β-alanine pathway dependent 
13C-labeling as 
a combined approach to demonstrate a reductive route 
coupled with the EMC pathway as the major route for 
reassimilation of 3-HP into central metabolism upon 
the transition from exponential phase to stationary 
phase. We also determined how the deletion of an acid 
transporter and putative acrylyl-CoA reductase from 
M. extorquens AM1 affected 3-HP degradation. This 
research sheds light on engineering M. extorquens AM1 
as an alternative microbial factory for producing 3-HP 
and related downstream products such as acrylic acid 
from methanol.

Construction of a malonyl‑CoA pathway for 3‑HP 
production in M. extorquens AM1
In order to produce 3-HP in M. extorquens AM1, we 
constructed a malonyl-CoA pathway by overexpress -
ing  the mcr  gene from Chloroflexus aurantiacus DSM 
635 encoding a bifunctional enzyme with alcohol dehy -
drogenase and aldehyde dehydrogenase activities under 
the control of a weak promoter  (P
meta1_3616), yield -
ing the YHP2 strain. As shown in Fig.  2a, YHP2 gen -
erated 6.8  mg/l of 3-HP when grown on methanol in 
shake flasks. To further improve the production level, 
the expression of  mcr  was tuned with three stronger 
promoters [32, 39]. The titer of 3-HP was increased 
in a promoter strength-dependent manner. The strain 
overexpressing  mcr  with the strongest promoter mxaF 
(YHP5) produced 52.8 mg/l of 3-HP , which was 7.8-fold 
higher than that of strain YHP2. Moreover, the specific 
growth rate and biomass yield were not significantly 
different among the strains of YHP3, YHP4 and YHP5 
(Fig.  2b and Table  1), suggesting that gradual increase 
of Mcr expression did not lead to significant metabolic 
burden. To further improve expression of  mcr, we con
-
structed a dual-promoter of mxaF–mxaF. The strength 
of this promoter was 1.2-fold higher than that of  P
mxaF 
as shown in Additional file  1: Table S1. Surprisingly, the 
titer in the YHP6 strain was decreased by 1.2-fold com -
pared to the YHP5 strain, and specific growth rate was 
also decreased by 16.7% (Fig.  2b and Table 1). It has been 
reported that N-terminal region of Mcr (Mcr-N, amino 
acids 1–549) and the C-terminal region of Mcr (Mcr-C, 
amino acids 550–1219) were functionally distinct (shown 
in Fig.  1) and Mcr-C had the lower enzymatic activity. 
[11]. We then inserted the mcr
550–1219 sequence pro -
moted by  Pmeta1_3616 after the full mcr on the plasmid and 
transferred it into the BHBT5 strain, an adaptive evolved 
strain which has been isolated from M. extorquens AM1 
with faster growth rate [33]. The new recombinant strain 
YHP7 produced 69.8  mg/l of 3-HP , representing 1.3-
fold improvement over that of the YHP5 strain, while 
the specific growth rate was not changed compared to 
the YHP5 strain (Fig.  2b and Table  1). Acetyl-CoA, a

precursor of the malonyl-CoA pathway was further ana -
lyzed and found to be 1.9- and 2.9-fold lower in the YHP6 
and YHP7 strain compared to the YHP5 strain (Fig.  2c). 
Notably, when the cells reached the stationary growth 
phase, 3-HP was rapidly reduced to lower than 10.0 mg/l 
within 10 h in either the YHP5 strain (Additional file  2: 
Figure S1) or the YHP7 strain (Fig.  2d). Therefore, it is 
important to investigate the potential mechanism of 
3-HP degradation in M. extorquens AM1.
Discovery of intermediates involved in 3‑HP assimilation
Different concentrations of 3-HP were added to the cul -
ture of the YHP8 strain carrying empty plasmid pJY80. 
As shown in Fig. 3a, the extracellular 3-HP concentration 
decreased rapidly from 200.0 mg/l to less than 40.0 mg/l 
during the transition from exponential to stationary 
growth phase, and the growth rates was not significantly 
changed with the addition of 3-HP up to 200.0  mg/l 
(Fig. 3b). To clarify the fast degradation of 3-HP , we com
-
pared the metabolic profiles between the YHP8 with and 
without the addition of 3-HP by LC–MS and GC–MS. 
The samples were harvested in the late of exponential 
phase. For untargeted metabolome analysis, a partial 
least squares discrimination analysis (PLS-DA) method 
was used to analyze data. Examination of the scores plot 
in Fig.  3c showed the YHP8 strain with the addition of 
200.0 mg/l of 3-HP was clearly separated from the YHP8 
strain without the addition of 3-HP . The loading plot fur

separation were the scattered dots outside the circle. 
Among seven features, one feature with m/z 840.1436 
was solely synthesized in the YHP8 strain with the addi
-
tion of 200.0  mg/l 3-HP . Its detailed MS/MS fragmen -
tal information is shown in Fig.  3d and it is identified as 
3-hydroxypropionyl-CoA (3-HP-CoA). Targeted meta -
bolic profiling suggested that the amounts of several 
EMC intermediates including propionyl-CoA, succinate, 
acetyl-CoA and 3-hydroxybutryryl-CoA were increased 
1.4-, 1.8-, 1.5- and 1.6-fold in the YHP8 strain in the 
presence of 200.0 mg/l of 3-HP compared to the control 
(Fig. 3e). Other metabolites such as glycine and serine in 
the serine cycle maintained a similar level with or with
-
out 3-HP . In addition, mesaconyl-CoA and methylsucci -
nyl-CoA were found to be slightly decreased by 0.8- and 
0.7-fold. Overall, these results suggested that 3-HP might 
be converted to 3-hydroxypropionyl-CoA, which was 
reassimilated by the EMC pathway.
13C‑labeling experiment demonstrates a reductive 
route as the major pathway for 3‑HP assimilation
In order to verify this hypothesis, the dynamic 13C-incor-
poration of intermediates was studied through a tracing 
experiment. 
13C-labeled 3-HP is not commercially avail -
able but labeled β-alanine is, so we first constructed a 
β-alanine pathway by overexpressing genes yhxA  and 
ydfG in the BHBT5 strain to generate 3-HP [10]. As 
shown in Additional file  2: Figure S2, 32.1 mg/l of 3-HP 
was produced in the YHP9 strain with the addition of 
1  g/l β-alanine. Then a 
13C-tracing experiment was car -
ried out by switching from 12C-β-alanine to 13C-β-alanine 
in the middle of exponential phase as shown in Addi -
tional file  2: Figure S3. Major possible labeling patterns 
are shown in Fig. 4a. Triply labeled 3-HP-CoA was gener-
ated with 81.5% of the total pool within 2 h, demonstrat -
ing that triply labeled 3-HP was converted to 3-HP-CoA 
(Fig.  4b). Triply labeled propionyl-CoA appeared later, 
followed by triply labeled malate, which were 51.0 and 
16.2% of the total pool up to 12  h, respectively. Doubly 
labeled acetyl-CoA was detected from 5 h, and increased 
to a total pool of 33.0% at 12  h. In addition, quadruply 
labeled 3-hydroxybutyryl-CoA was generated from the 
combination of two doubly labeled acetyl-CoA. Phos
-
phoenolpyruvate (PEP) and glucose 6-phosphate/fruc -
tose 6-phosphate (G6P/F6P) were not obviously labeled. 
These data provide metabolic proof of 3-HP reassimila
-
tion through the reductive route coupled with the EMC 
pathway. The relatively low 
13C-incorporation into pro -
pionyl-CoA, malate, acetyl-CoA and 3-hydroxybutyryl-
CoA can be explained by the additional synthesis of 
unlabeled intermediates via the EMC pathway.
Enzymatic assay to specifically and quantitatively detect 
acrylyl‑CoA
Surprisingly, acrylyl-CoA was not detected in either 
the metabolomic analysis or 13C-labeling experiments 
but was known to be involved in natural assimilation of 
3-HP in a previous report [14]. This nondetection is pos
-
sibly due to the decomposition of acrylyl-CoA during 
the extraction process. An in  vitro enzymatic assay was 
conducted to demonstrate if acrylyl-CoA was gener
-
ated during 3-HP reassimilation in M. extorquens AM1. 
As shown in Fig.  5a, b and Additional file  2: Figure S4, 
3-HP-CoA was significantly accumulated at 5  min after 
the addition of 20 mM 3-HP into the crude cell extracts 
from the YHP8 strain. In the meantime, a metabolite

with MRM of m/z 822.1 to 315.1 was found to be accu -
mulated at 5 and 10 min before the addition of NADPH, 
which had two m/z less than the parental ion of propio -
nyl-CoA (Fig.  5b). The acid derivative of this metabolite 
was further analyzed and confirmed as acrylic acid by 
GC–MS (Fig.  5b). When NADPH was initially omitted 
from the assay mixture, the main product was 3-HP-CoA 
(Fig.  5a), which was consistent with the previous study 
that the ratio of 3-HP-CoA to acrylyl-CoA at equilibrium 
was greater than 50:1 [14]. Acrylyl-CoA was found to be 
quickly decreased after the addition of NADPH at 12 min 
and propionyl-CoA was increased accordingly, suggest
-
ing the acrylyl-CoA was rapidly reduced to propionyl-
CoA. Moreover, the pre-addition of 200.0  mg/l 3-HP to 
the YHP8 strain did not change the consumption pattern 
of 3-HP and production patterns of 3-HP-CoA, acrylyl-
CoA and propionyl-CoA, indicating that the activation 
of the reductive route was unlikely due to the presence 
of 3-HP (Fig.  5c). Together, these results clearly indicate 
that 3-HP was mainly reduced to propionyl-CoA through 
3-HP-CoA and acrylyl-CoA as intermediates.
Deletion of genes in 3‑HP assimilation
To determine the possible genes involved in 3-HP reas -
similation, we firstly knocked out dctA (META1_3271) 
encoding a putative protein transporter responsible for 
the uptake of C3 to C5 acids (e.g. pyruvic acid, succinic 
acid and methylsuccinic acid), then analyzed the 3-HP 
production in the deletion mutant YHP12 (YHP10 car
-
rying pYM07). As shown in Fig.  6a, the deletion of dctA 
did not result in an obvious change of 3-HP degrada -
tion and cell growth. Since it might exist additional DctA 
system and DctA transporter has been reported to be 
sodium ion dependent [40], we hypothesized that reduc
-
ing sodium concentration in the medium might effect 
the degradation. As shown in Fig.  6b, it indicated that a 
decrease of sodium ion in the culture medium did not 
prevent the degradation either, although the cell growth 
rate was increased by 1.2-fold and 3-HP production level 
was improved to 91.0  mg/l. Moreover, we blasted the 
previously reported enzymes involved in catalyzing two 
steps of 3-HP reduced to propionyl-CoA against the pro
-
teome of M. extorquens AM1. As summarized in Table 2, 
several homologues of acrylyl-CoA reductase and 
CoA-transferase/CoA-synthetase were identified in the 
genome of M. extorquens including META1_4251 and 
META1_2054. No growth change was observed for the 
deletion of gene META1_4251 (Fig.  6c). Moreover, the 
mutant strain YHP13 showed a similar decreasing rate 
of 3-HP degradation with the YHP7 strains in early sta
-
tionary phase, but a slower decrease was observed when 
the 3-HP titer was reduced to 15.0  mg/l. In addition, it 
was not possible to obtain a deletion of the putative CoA-
transferase gene META1_2054 growing on different car
-
bon sources, suggesting that a null mutant is lethal for M. 
extorquens AM1. The protein encoded by META1_2054 
was then expressed in E. coli BL21 (DE3) and purified. An 
in  vitro assay showed much less 3-HP-CoA production 
than that in the crude enzymatic assay (Additional file  2: 
Figure S5).
Discussion
Methylobacterium extorquens AM1 has been consid -
ered as a potential platform strain for industrial produc -
tion of valuable chemicals such as mevalonate, 1-butanol 
and 2-hydroxyisobutyrate [30, 32, 33, 41]. In this work, 
we first optimized a 3-HP synthetic pathway in M. 
extorquens AM1, and then focused on the demonstration 
of the mechanism of 3-HP reassimilation.
It has been reported that tuning of gene expression lev
-
els was critical for proper functioning of a heterologous 
synthetic pathway in M. extorquens AM1. For instance, 
Hu et al. found that the strain expressing the adhE2 and 
ter from a promoter of intermediate strength produced 
the highest 1-butanol [32]. In our case, four different pro
-
moter strengths were tested and the strongest promoter 
mxaF was shown to generate the highest 3-HP , com
-
parable with the preliminary titer of other engineered 
microorganisms [5]. The pool size of precursor acetyl-
CoA was similar between the YHP5 strains and the 
other three recombinant strains, implying that upstream 
metabolic fluxes were not significantly affected by the 
introduction of the malonyl-CoA pathway. Moreover, 
overexpressing mcr

strain carrying dual strongest promoters of mxaF–mxaF, 
the titer of 3-HP and the pool of acetyl-CoA were both 
lower than that in the YHP5 strain. This was presumably 
because high expression of Mcr could cause metabolic

tion. In order to pull more flux to acetyl-CoA, we overex-
pressed the gene pyk encoding pyruvate kinase which was 
predicted to lead to higher relative fluxes into acetyl-CoA 
in M. extorquens AM1 [42]. However, the improvement 
of 3-HP production was not observed (Additional file  2: 
Figure S6). In addition, the constructed malonyl-CoA 
pathway led to the net consumption of 2 molecules 
of NADPH per 1 molecule of 3-HP produced. In M. 
extorquens AM1 grown with methanol, cell growth is 
limited by reducing power [36], suggesting that an insuf

ficient supply of NADPH is another bottleneck for 3-HP 
production. Further multiple genes manipulation for 
improving acetyl-CoA and reducing power supply is nec

β-alanine pathway with malonyl-CoA pathway to figure 
out whether the combined pathways would improve the 
titer of 3-HP further.
Recent reports have demonstrated that 3-HP was 
steadily produced by utilizing either the malonyl-CoA 
pathway or the β-alanine pathway [5–10, 43]. However, 
in M. extorquens 3-HP was rapidly degraded upon the 
transition from exponential to stationary growth phase. 
The addition of 3-HP into the medium of the cell cul
-
ture further demonstrated that 3-HP degradation was 
lower than the release during exponential phase but 
higher during stationary phase. This degradation phe
-
nomenon was also observed in the recombinant P. deni -
trificans, Meyerozyma guilliermondii and Rhodococcus 
erythropolis [15, 44, 45]. Lee et  al. demonstrated that 
the genes hpdh and hbdh encoding 3-HP dehydrogenase 
and 3-hydroxyisobutyrate dehydrogenases in P. deni -
trificans were mainly responsible for 3-HP degradation 
through the oxidative route, in which 3-HP was first oxi
-
dized to malonate semialdehyde and then metabolized 
to acetyl-CoA [17]. However, neither untargeted nor tar
-
geted metabolome analysis detected the accumulation of 
malonate semialdehyde, which might be due to its insta
-
bility in the extraction or low pool abundance in cell. But 
3-HP-CoA, propionyl-CoA and its downstream interme
-
diates were observed to build up in the cell, suggesting 
3-HP was reduced to 3-HP-CoA via the reductive route 
and then reassimilated by the EMC pathway.
Previously we have demonstrated a highly efficient 
pyrophosphate-mediated glycolytic pathway for meth
-
ane assimilation in Methylomicrobium alcaliphilum 
strain 20Z by tracing the pyruvate 
13C-labeling pattern 
[46]. Here, if 3-HP reassimilation flux through the reduc -
tive pathway produced triply labeled 3-HP-CoA and 
propionyl-CoA, and the latter enters the EMC pathway, 
malate would maintain the same labeled pattern and have 
faster 
13C-incorporation than its downstream metabolite, 
acetyl-CoA. If 3-HP was reassimilated by the oxidative 
route, it would be expected to generate more amounts of 
doubly labeled acetyl-CoA and fewer amounts of doubly 
and triply labeled propinyl-CoA in a time course. Our 
results demonstrated that both routes operated but the 
reductive route functioned as the major one for reas
-
similating the 3-HP based on two possible explanations. 
Firstly 3-HP-CoA and propionyl-CoA were more signifi
-
cantly labeled compared to acetyl-CoA, proposing that 
reductive route flux was higher than oxidative route. Sec
-
ondly by 5 and 12 h, the labeled pool of acetyl-CoA was 
much higher than its precursor of malate, suggesting part 
of labeled acetyl-CoA might come from the oxidative 
route. Moreover, the enzymatic assay not only confirmed 
that the reductive route for 3-HP assimilation in M. 
extorquens AM1 was through acrylyl-CoA as intermedi
-
ates, but also suggested that the genes encoding enzymes 
for the reductive route were unlikely able to be induced 
by 3-HP . The latter finding differed with the previous 
observation that the degradation of 3-HP by the oxidative 
route in P. denitrificans was increased greatly when cells 
were exposed to 3-HP [47]. In that study, the transcrip
-
tion of hpdh and hbdh involved in the oxidative route was 
found to be induced by a LysR-type transcriptional regu -
lator binding with 3-HP molecule.
Methylobacterium extorquens AM1 harbors a pre -
dicted DctA dicarboxylic acid transporter, which has 
been proposed to uptake C4 or C5 dicarboxylic acid 
and even C3 pyruvate [35, 38, 48]. Therefore, a knock 
out mutant of the dctA homologue (META1_3271) is 
expected to have an impact on the production of 3-HP . 
Unfortunately, dctA mutant was still able to degrade the 
3-HP , which may either be due to an incomplete disrup
-
tion of acid transport or to the existence of at least one 
additional system that can transport 3-HP into the cell 
[48, 49]. In addition, the transport function of some DctA 
examples has been shown to be sodium ion dependent,

and reduced sodium ion has been demonstrated to block 
the reuptake of mesaconic acid and methylsuccinic acid 
in engineered M. extorquens AM1 [48]. However, in our 
study 3-HP degradation was not decreased when the 
sodium ion was reduced to 60-fold lower, suggesting 
either DctA is not playing a role in 3-HP degradation or it 
is independent of sodium ion.
An acrylyl-CoA reductase (AcuI) catalyzing the reduction 
of acrylyl-CoA to propionyl-CoA has been identified in Rue
-
geria pomeroyi and R. sphaeroides (Table 2) [50]. The acuI 
mutant was unable to grow on 3-HP as sole carbon source 
in R. sphaeroides [14]. The deletion of gene META1_4251 
encoding a protein with 59% amino acid sequence identity 
to AcuI of R. sphaeroides resulted in slower degradation 
of 3-HP in late stationary phase. One possible explanation 
is that low accumulation of acrylyl-CoA in the beginning 
of stationary phase would not be capable of disrupting the 
reaction equilibrium between 3-HP-CoA and acrylyl-CoA, 
but high accumulation of acrylyl-CoA would generate a 
strong feedback to shift the equilibrium against acrylyl-
CoA production. Hence, we propose that META1_4251 is 
involved in the third reaction of 3-HP assimilation. In addi
-
tion, acyl-CoA transferase or acetyl-CoA/propionyl-CoA 
synthetase was reported to be responsible for converting 
3-HP to 3-HP-CoA in engineered E. coli for the produc
-
tion of acrylic acid (Table 2) [51]. An attempt was made to 
delete the gene META1_2054 encoding a putative acyl-CoA 
transferase with 51% amino acid sequence identity to YdiF 
of Cupriavidus necator. However, we failed to obtain the 
null mutant, suggesting this gene might have an essential 
function for M. extorquens AM1 growth. The purified pro
-
tein was shown to exhibit poor catalysis with 3-HP as a sub-
strate, suggesting that META1_2054 was unlikely a key gene 
for the first reaction in the reductive route. Therefore, once 
other genes are identified and biochemically characterized, 
it may become clearer how M. extorquens AM1 reassimi

lates 3-HP and will prevent the degradation and enhance 
product formation rate.

Conclusions
The engineered M. extorquens AM1 demonstrated the 
production of 3-HP on methanol with a titer of 6.8 mg/l 
in shake flask cultivation, which was further improved 
over tenfold by increasing the promoter strength and 
copy number of mcr
550–1219. Although further strain 
optimization is required to make this system industri -
ally relevant, metabolic engineering precedents exist 
that have resulted in similar magnitudes of increase [7]. 
It has been shown in engineered P. denitrificans that 
3-HP was degraded through an oxidative route, in which 
3-HP was first oxidized to malonate semialdehyde and 
then metabolized to acetyl-CoA [17, 18]. However, our 
metabolomics, 
13C-labeling analysis, in  vitro enzymatic 
assays and knockout experiment demonstrated that 3-HP 
was mainly reduced to 3-HP-CoA and then sequentially 
converted to acrylyl-CoA and propionyl-CoA during the 
growth transition in engineered M. extorquens AM1. 
This novel work makes a good start for bioconversion of 
methanol into economically important product of 3-HP .
Methods
Culture medium and condition
Escherichia coli strain Top10 used as a host to con -
struct all recombinant plasmids was cultivated at 37  °C 
in Luria–Bertani (LB) medium. M. extorquens AM1 was 
routinely cultured in a minimal medium as described 
previously [52]. Briefly, the strains were grown in tube 
at 30  °C to the middle exponential phase, sub-cultured 
(0.5 ml) into 50 ml of minimal medium in 250 ml flasks, 
and then grown at 30  °C on rotary shaker at 200  rpm. 
Substrates and antibiotics were supplied at the following 
concentrations: methanol (125 mM), succinate (15 mM), 
20 μg/ml tetracycline (Tet) and 50 μg/ml ampicillin (Ap). 
During the cultivation process, measurements of the 
cell growth were conducted in biological triplicate. To 
assess the growth rates in the presence of 3-HP , 0.5 ml of 
each culture was distributed into 50 ml fresh medium in 
250 ml flasks containing different concentrations of 3-HP . 
The growth rates presented represent the mean plus 
STDEV calculated from triplicate biological replicates.
All chemicals were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. 
Louis, MO, USA) unless otherwise specified. Millpore 
water (Billerica, MA, USA) was used for the preparation 
of all the media, buffers, standards, and sample solutions.
Plasmids and strains construction
For constructing the malonyl-CoA pathway, the protein 
sequence of malonyl-CoA reductase (Mcr) was retrieved 
from GenBank accession number of YP_001636209. 
Gene coding for this enzyme was cloned from Chloro
-
flexus aurantiacus DSM 635 genomic DNA. The strains 
and plasmids were listed in Table  3 and the primers 
were provided in Additional file  1: Table S2. Standard 
restriction enzyme digestion and ligation techniques 
were used to construct plasmids. The mcr gene was 
PCR amplified with PrimeSTAR HS DNA Polymer
-
ase and assembled into the Hin dIII–BamHI restriction 
sites of pJY80 plasmid with different promoter regions. 
The strength of promoters was tested based on the con
-
struction of promoter fusion as described before [53]. 
The promoter fragments of meta1_3616 and coxB from 
genomic M. extorquens AM1 DNA and mxaF from 
pCM80 plasmid were amplified by PCR. And the dual-
promoter mxaF–mxaF was obtained by an overlapping 
PCR method [54]. The amplified fragments were then 
cloned into Bam HI–HindIII restriction sites of the pro
-
moter probe vector pCM130 [55]. Catechol dioxygenase 
(XylE) was assayed as described previously to evaluate 
the promoter strength [56]. For plasmid construction 
of the YHP7 strain, two PCR fragments of the pro
-
moter meta1_3616 and mcr550–1219 were assembled into 
the plasmid of the YHP5 strain after full mcr fragment 
under a mxaF promoter. For constructing the β-alanine 
pathway, the protein sequence of β-alanine-pyruvate 
aminotransferase (YhxA) and 3-hydroxypropanoate 
dehydrogenases (YdfG) was retrieved from GenBank 
with the following accession number of EEL86940 and 
12932746. Gene yhxA  coding for the YhxA enzyme was 
synthesized into the vector pUC57 (GenScript, Nan
-
jing, China) with codon usage optimized for expression 
in M. extorquens AM1. And gene ydfG coding for the 
YdfG enzyme was cloned from E. coli str.K-12 genomic 
DNA. As described above, the fragments of yhxA  and 
ydfG were assembled into the Hin dIII–BamHI restric
-
tion sites of pJY80 plasmid with the mxaF promoter to 
obtain pYM09 plasmid. All the plasmids were trans
-
formed into M. extorquens AM1 by electroporation as 
described before [57].
Allelic exchange was performed using the sacB-
based vector pCM433 [58]. Briefly, the PCR product 
obtained corresponding to merged 600-bp upstream 
and downstream flanking regions of META1_3271 or 
META1_4251 from the adaptive strain of M. extorquens  
AM1 (strain BHBT5) [33] was inserted into the BglII 
and NdeI restriction sites of pCM433. The plasmids 
were then electroporated into the BHBT5 strain. Sin
-
gle-crossover mutants were selected using Tet resist -
ance, and double-crossover mutants selected by growth 
on plates containing 5% w/v sucrose. Successful allele 
swapping was confirmed by diagnostic PCR with gene 
sequencing.
The restriction enzymes were purchased from Fisher 
Scientific (Pittsburgh, PA, USA). PrimeSTAR HS DNA 
Polymerase and T4 ligase were purchased from Takala 
(Dalian, China).

3‑HP quantification
The culture medium containing 3-HP was collected by 
centrifuging at 10,000×g for 10 min and the supernatant 
was used for product analysis. The concentration of 3-HP 
was determined by LC–MS carried out on an Agilent LC-
QQQ-MS system (Agilent 1290 Infinity-6460, Agilent 
Corp, SantaClara, CA, USA) in the negative-ion mode. 
3-HP standard was purchased from Tokyo Chemical 
Industry (Tokyo, Japan). The sample was separated on an 
Agilent SB C18 column (100  × 2.1 mm, 1.8 μm). Mobile 
phase A consisted of 10% (v/v) buffer in water, while 
mobile phase B was 10% (v/v) buffer in acetonitrile. The 
buffer consisted of 200  mM formic acid adjusted to pH 
4.0 with ammonium hydroxide solution. The linear gradi
-
ent was as following: 0–3 min, 5–10% B; 3–5 min, 100% B; 
5–7 min, 5% B. The flow rate was 0.2 ml/min and the col
-
umn was set at 35 °C. The injection volume was 5 μl. The 
3-HP titer was measured in biological triplicate. The sig
-
nificance of differences between the different engineered 
strains was determined by t tests (MS excel) with a p value 
less than 0.05 considered to be statistically significant.
Measurement of methanol consumption
Methanol consumption was analyzed on gas chromato -
graph with a flame ionization detector (GC-FID7900, 
Tian Mei, Shanghai, China). The sample was separated 
on a RtxR-1 column (30 m  × 0.25 mm, 0.25 μm, Restek, 
Bellefonte, USA). The inlet and FID temperatures were 
set at 200 and 220 °C. The temperature program was as 
follows: 60 °C with a hold time of 4 min, followed by an 
increase to 220  °C at a rate of 15  °C/min. Temperature 
was held at 220 °C for 5 min. 0.5 μl of sample was injected 
in split-less mode.
Extraction and measurement of metabolites
Samples (20  ml) of the later exponential phase at the 
 OD
600 of 1.3  ±  0.1 were rapidly harvested by vacuum 
filtration using MILLEX-GP PES membrane filters 
(0.22  μm, 33  mm) and quickly washed with the growth 
medium as described before [59]. Extraction of metab
-
olites was carried out as previously published for M. 
extorquens AM1 [60, 61]. Briefly, 10 ml of boiling water 
was added to a given sample and incubated at 100 °C for 
10 min. The extracted cell suspension was cooled on ice 
for 5 min, then cell debris was removed by centrifugation 
at 5000×g for 5 min. The cell-free metabolite extract was 
centrifuged at 14,000×g for 8 min. The supernatant was 
dried in a rotational vacuum concentrator (Christ, Oster
-
ode, Germany) and stored at − 80 °C. For LC–MS analy -
sis, each dried sample was dissolved in 100 μl of purified 
water. For GC–MS analysis, each sample was further 
derivatized in two steps. First, keto group were methoxi
-
mated by adding 50 μl of methoxyamine solution [25 mg/
ml methoxyamine hydrochloride in pyridine] and incu -
bated at 60 °C for 30 min. Second, trimethylsilylation was 
performed by adding 50  μl of a TMS reagent (BSTFA/
TMCS, 99:1) and incubated at 30 °C for 90 min.
Sugar phosphates and acyl-CoAs were measured by 
LC–MS analysis. The sample analyzed on either an Agi

lent LC-QQQ-MS system (Agilent 1290 Infinity-6460, 
Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA), an Agilent

-
nologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA) or a LC-QExactive-MS 
system (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, Massachu
-
setts, USA). For LC-QQQ-MS, multiple reaction moni -
toring (MRM) precursor/product ion pairs were carried 
out as before [60]. For LC-QTOF, the m/z range was 
set to 50–1200 in centroid mode with a scan rate of 
1.5  spectra/s. The ESI conditions were as follows: capil

lary voltage of 4000  V, fragmentor of 135  V, gas tem -
perature of 300 °C, nebulizer of 35 psig, gas flow of 10 l/
min. For LC-QExactive-MS system, spray voltage was 
set to  + 3.2 kV, sheath gas pressure was 35 arb, aux gas 
pressure was 10 arb, capillary temperature was 320  °C 
and heater temperature was 350  °C. Full MS (Resolu

tion 70,000) and MS2 (Resolution 17,500) were car -
ried out with the scan range from m/z 100 to 1500. The 
sample was separated on an AdvanceBio Glycan col
-
umn (150  ×  2.1  mm, 1.8  μm; Agilent, Santa Clara, CA, 
USA). Mobile phase A consisted of 100 mM ammonium 
formate in water adjusted to pH 4.5 with ammonium 
hydroxide solution, while mobile phase B was 100% ace

tonitrile. The linear gradient was as following: 0–2  min, 
75–71% B; 2.1–6  min, 65% B; 6–7  min, 65–75% B; 
7–12 min, 75% B. The flow rate was 0.2 ml/min and the 
injection volume was 5 μl.
Amino acids and carboxylic acids were determined by 
GC–MS. The derivatized samples were analyzed on Agi
-
lent 5975B/6890N GC–MS instrument (Agilent Technol-
ogies, Santa Clara, CA, USA). The column was a HP-5MS 
(30 m × 0.25 mm × 0.25 μm film; Restek, Bellefonte, PA, 
USA). Ultra high purity helium was used as the carrier 
gas in a constant flow mode of 1  ml/min, and 1  μl of a 
given sample was injected in split-less mode via an Agi
-
lent 7890 autosampler. The inlet and transfer line tem -
peratures were set at 280  °C. The temperature program 
started at 60  °C with a hold time of 0.25  min, and then 
increased at 5  °C/min to 280  °C with a hold time of 
10  min at 280  °C. The ion source and quadrupole tem
-
peratures were set to 250 and 150 °C, respectively. Mass 
spectra were collected from m/z 40 to 500 at a rate of 
3 spectra/s after a 4.5 min solvent delay.
Metabolomics data processing
For the targeted metabolome, the data were presented as 
the mean of three independent biological replicates. For

the untargeted metabolome, six independent biological 
samples were collected. LC–MS data was converted into 
mzML format using MS Convert software [62]. Data pre

processing and statistical analysis were performed with 
MZmine 2.11 and SIMCA-P 11.5 (Umetrics, Umea, Swe

with MassFrontier 7.0 [65].
Dynamic 13C‑labeling analysis
13C-labeling analysis was performed by the protocol 
reported before with a slight modification [59]. 15  ml 
cells of the later exponential phase at the  OD
600 of 
1.3  ±  0.1 were pre-cultured in minimal medium with 
12C-methanol and 5  g/l 12C-labeled β-alanine, and 
then were rapidly passed through the membrane filter 
(0.22 μm, 47 mm, Sartorius). The filter was immediately 
removed and placed on an agar plate with 
12C-methanol 
and 12C-labeled β-alanine for 30 min at 30 °C, then trans-
ferred to another agar plate with the same concentration 
of 
12C methanol and 13C-labeled β-alanine for different 
times (i.e. 2, 5 and 12  h). Then the filter was immedi -
ately transferred to a 50 ml tube with liquid nitrogen for 
quenching. The sample was stored at − 80 °C freezer until 
it was ready for subsequent extractions. The metabolites 
were extracted and analyzed as the described above.
Heterologous expression of META1_2054 in E. coli 
and protein purification
The META1_2054 gene was first amplified by PCR and 
cloned into the EcoRI and HindIII sites of pET.32M.3C. 
E. coli BL21 (DE3) harboring pET.32M.3C:: META1_2054 
were grown in 100 ml of LB medium to an  OD
600 of 0.8 at 
37 °C and were then induced with 200 μM isopropyl-β-
d-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) for 18  h at 18  °C. Har
-
vested cells were resuspended in 100  ml wash buffer A 
(50  mM  NaH
2PO4, 300  mM NaCl, pH 8.0). Crude cell 
extracts were obtained by passing the cells through One 
Shot cell disruptor (Constant Systems Ltd, United King
-
dom) at 3.5  × 107 psi, followed by 30 min of centrifuga -
tion at 14,000×g at 4  °C. The soluble fraction was then 
used for his-tagged purification by Ni-nitrilotriacetic acid 
(NTA) resin according to the manufacturer’s instruction 
(Pointbio, Shanghai, China). Then non-specifically bound 
proteins were removed from the column with wash buffer 
B (50  mM  NaH
2PO4, 300  mM NaCl, 40  mM imidazole, 
pH 8.0), while bound his-tagged protein were eluted 
with elution buffer (50  mM  NaH
2PO4, 300  mM NaCl, 
100 mM imidazole, pH 8.0). Purified protein was verified 
by 12% SDS-PAGE, and the protein concentrations were 
determined according to the method of Bradford [66], 
using bovine serum albumin as a standard. To replace 
the elution buffer with enzyme reaction buffer (100 mM 
Tris–HCl, 5 mM  MgCl
2, 10 mM KCl, pH 8.0), the eluted 
solution was centrifuged through a centrifugal filter with 
a molecular cutoff of 30  kDa (Millipore, Billerica, MA), 
and the concentration of the enzyme was finally adjusted 
to 5 mg/ml by the reaction buffer.
In vitro enzyme assays
Methylobacterium extorquens AM1 cell extracts was car -
ried out as previously published with slight modification 
[32]. Briefly, 50  ml cells of the later exponential phase 
were harvested and then resuspended in 7 ml of 100 mM 
Tris–HCl (pH 8.0) buffer containing 5  mM  MgCl
2 and 
10 mM KCl. Crude cell extracts were obtained by passing 
the cells through One Shot cell disruptor at 3.8 × 10
7 psi. 
Dithiothreitol (2  mM) was added to cell extracts imme -
diately after cell lysis. The reaction mixture (1  ml) was 
used to monitor the product formation of the reductive 
conversion of 3-HP [14]. The reaction mixture contained 
100 mM Tris–HCl buffer at pH 8.0, 5 mM  MgCl
2, 10 mM 
KCl, 0.5  mM CoA, 3  mM ATP , 0.3  mM NADPH, 2  mM 
dithiothreitol and 0.3 mg cell extracts. The enzymatic reac
-
tion was started by the addition of 20 mM 3-HP but not 
NADPH to the mixture and stopped after 5 and 10  min 
respectively by transferring 100 μl of the reaction mixture 
into 4 μl 25% HCl. After 10 min, NADPH was added to the 
mixture, and the reaction was stopped at different time 
points as described above. The samples were centrifuged 
at 10,000×g for 5 min to remove the precipitated protein. 
Acyl-CoAs were analyzed by LC–MS as the described 
above. For assaying the META1_2054 coding enzyme, the 
product formation was measured as the described above 
except that NADPH was not add to the mixture.
