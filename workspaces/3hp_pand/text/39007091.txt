ABSTRACT  
3-Hydroxypropionic Acid (3-HP) is recognized as a high value-added chemical with a broad range of applica -
tions. Among the various biosynthetic pathways for 3-HP production, the β -alanine pathway is particularly 
noteworthy due to its capacity to generate 3-HP from glucose at a high theoretical titer. In this study, the 
β -alanine biosynthesis pathway was introduced and optimized in Corynebacterium glutamicum . By strategically 
regulating the supply of precursors, we successfully engineered a strain capable of efficiently synthesizing 3-HP 
through the β -alanine pathway, utilizing glucose as the substrate. The engineered strain CgP36 produced 47.54 
g/L 3-HP at a yield of 0.295 g/g glucose during the fed-batch fermentation in a 5 L fermenter, thereby attaining 
the highest 3-HP titer obtained from glucose via the β -alanine pathway.   
1. Introduction 
3-Hydroxypropionic acid (3-HP) is regarded as a bulk chemical with 
great potential [ 1 ], and a range of chemicals produced from 3-HP are 
widely used in people ’ s daily life [ 2 ]. Based on market forecasts, the 
market value of 3-HP is projected to surpass $10 billion per year and the 
size is expected to exceed 3.6 million tons per year [ 3 ]. Given its 
extensive market prospects, various biosynthetic pathways, such as the 
1,3-propanediol pathway, β -alanine pathway, malonyl coenzyme A 
pathway and glycerol oxidation pathway, have been developed for the 
3-HP production [ 2 , 4 ]. 
Recent advances in metabolic engineering have enabled substantive 
yields of 3- HP using various pathways across different host organisms. 
Among these, Halomonas bluephagenesis utilizing the 1,3-propanediol 
pathway achieved a high titer of 154 g/L of 3-HP, although the pro -
cess is costly [ 5 ]. A co-culture system involving Lactobacillus reuteri and 
recombinant Escherichia coli achieved 125.93 g/L of 3-HP [ 6 ]; however, 
this method suffers from the inevitable byproduct accumulation of 1, 
3-propanediol. Seo et al. [ 7 ] developed a strategy to synthesize 3-HP 
in E. coli via the glycerol oxidation pathway, achieving 3-HP yields of 
53.7 g/L. However, this pathway is dependent on vitamin B
12, 
which is 
not naturally produced by most microorganisms [ 8 ]. Glycerol uptake 
rates also notably influence 3-HP yields [ 8 ]. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae , 
the malonyl-CoA pathway demonstrated a potential, achieving a titer of 
71.09 g/L from glucose [ 9 ]. Moreover, alternative pathways in 
S. cerevisiae [ 10 ] and engineered E. coli [ 11 ] strains utilizing the 
β -alanine pathway have demonstrated substantial potential. S. cerevisiae 
engineered to incorporate this pathway produced 25 g/L of 3-HP in 
fed-batch fermentation [ 12 ]. Song et al. [ 13 ] reported that an engi -
neered E. coli strain producing 3-HP from glucose via heterologously 
introduced β -alanine/pyruvate transaminase (BAPAT) and overex -
pressed native hydroxypropionate dehydrogenase (YdfG) achieved a 
titer of 31.1 g/L. The recent study by Raquel et al. [ 14 ] demonstrated 
that glycerol is a promising substrate for 3-HP production in E. coli via 
the β -alanine pathway, and a titer of 72.2 g/L was achieved in fed-batch 
fermentation. 
While these studies underscore diverse strategies for 3-HP biosyn -
thesis, they also reveal limitations such as costly inputs, substrate uti -
lization and dependence on exogenous additives. In this context, the 
β -alanine pathway in C. glutamicum presents a compelling alternative, 
especially given its proven capability to produce β -alanine at yields 
exceeding 160 g/L [ 15 ]. Furthermore, β -alanine pathway is capable of

higher theoretical titers compared to other pathways [ 10 ]. Despite these 
advantages, converting β -alanine to 3-HP in C. glutamicum has not been 
studied yet, representing an important gap in the current research 
landscape. One of the primary challenges to address in leveraging this 
pathway for 3-HP production is the efficient conversion of β -alanine to 
3-HP. This study aims to develop and optimize a genetically engineered 
C. glutamicum strain that efficiently converts glucose to 3-HP via the 
β -alanine pathway, exploring a more cost-effective, efficient, and scal -
able method for industrial 3-HP production. 
In this study, the β -alanine biosynthetic pathway was introduced into 
C. glutamicum , and further strategies such as optimizing key enzymes 
expression within the production routes, downregulating the expression 
of gltA and blocking branched-chain metabolism were implemented to 
increase the yield of 3-HP ( Fig. 1 ). Finally, the metabolically engineered 
modified strain CgP36 produced 47.54 g/L of 3-HP at a yield of 0.295 g/ 
g after 100 h of fed-batch fermentation, achieving the highest produc -
tion titer in the current study of 3-HP production via the β -alanine 
pathway from glucose. This study demonstrated the excellent perfor -
mance of C. glutamicum in the production of 3-HP via the β -alanine 
pathway, which lays a good foundation for subsequent related 
researches. 
2. Results and discussion 
2.1. Introduction of heterologous pathway to produce 3-HP from glucose 
The biosynthesis of 3-HP is intricately divided into two main mod -
ules: the synthesis of the precursor β -alanine and the synthesis of 3-HP. 
Despite the inherent metabolic pathway in C. glutamicum , which theo -
retically enables the conversion of glucose into β -alanine, β -alanine was 
not detected in the culture under standard culture conditions. This 
suggests the existence of a bottleneck or regulatory mechanism that 
restricts the accumulation of β -alanine. In addition, aspartate decar -
boxylase (PanD) - an aminotransferase - catalyzes the conversion of L - 
aspartate to β -alanine. However, this enzymatic activity is often 
reported as being insufficient in prokaryote [ 16 ], including 
C. glutamicum , thus representing a significant limitation for β -alanine 
production in vivo. 
In an effort to overcome these limitations, our study has explored the 
potential of heterologously expressed PanD from two diverse sources: 
Bacillus subtilis [ 15 , 17 ] and Tribolium castaneum [ 10 ]. Both showed high 
levels of catalytic activity in β -alanine production studies, providing a 
novel avenue for improving the catalytic efficiency in β -alanine 
biosynthesis. Consequently, the introduction of two different sources of 
PanD into the ldh knockout strain CgP1, which was used as a substrate 
strain, significantly increased the β -alanine production. Notably, the 
T. castaneum -derived PanD exhibited superior efficiency, achieving a 
β -alanine concentration of 1.26 g/L after 48 h of fermentation, as 
illustrated in Fig. 2 . This observation supports the hypothesis that the 
introduction of a more efficient aspartate decarboxylase can signifi -
cantly impact β -alanine biosynthesis. 
Additionally, the co-expression strategy involving C. glutamicum ’ s 
self-derived L -aspartate aminotransferase (AspB) was investigated to 
further enhance β -alanine production. Contrary to expectations, this 
approach did not significantly increase β -alanine production. This 
outcome aligns with previous discoveries by Muhammad et al., which 
highlighted the already elevated flux of L -aspartate in C. glutamicum , 
suggesting that the bottleneck in β -alanine production may not reside 
primarily in the availability of L -aspartate [ 15 ]. 
To augment the pathway leading towards 3-HP synthesis, we intro -
duced heterologous genes encoding β -alanine-pyruvate aminotrans -
ferase (BAPAT) from Pseudomonas aeruginosa and YdfG transaminase 
from E. coli into the bioengineered strains CgP3 and CgP4. This strategic 
inclusion aimed to leverage β -alanine as a substrate for 3-HP production. 
Notably, despite overexpressing aspB in strain CgP6, engineered to 
introduce the 3-HP synthesis module, there was no substantial increase 
in 3-HP production when compared to the strain CgP5. Nevertheless, a 
slight enhancement in the production rate was evident as detailed in 
Supplementary Fig. S1 . This may be attributed to the robust amino acid 
production capabilities of C. glutamicum , where the supply of the

precursor aspartic acid is not a major limiting factor for 3-HP synthesis. 
It is speculated that an imbalance between the 3-HP synthesis module 
and the β -alanine synthesis module or the supply of other key precursors 
may have limited the further increase in 3-HP production. The findings 
highlight the complex interplay between β -alanine synthesis and its 
conversion to 3-HP. 
Finally, the bioengineered strain CgP6, specifically developed to 
optimize the 3-HP biosynthetic pathway, generated 3.37 g/L of 3-HP 
after 48 h of fermentation. It is noteworthy that during this process, 
only a minor accumulation of β -alanine (0.17 g/L) was detected, illus -
trating the pathway ’ s efficiency in rapidly converting β -alanine to the 
targeted end product, 3-HP. This finding highlights the engineered 
strain ’ s capability to effectively channel β -alanine into the 3-HP 
biosynthetic route, thereby minimizing the intermediary accumulation 
of β -alanine and emphasizing the potential of metabolic engineering in 
redirecting central metabolites towards desired bioproducts. 
2.2. Optimizing the expression of key enzymes improves 3-HP production 
In this subsection, we employed promoter engineering approaches to 
fine-tune the expression levels of genes involved in the β -alanine syn -
thesis module and the 3-HP synthesis module, thereby enhancing the 
efficiency of the metabolic pathway ( Fig. 3 a). We selected four consti -
tutive promoters with varying strengths, including P
sod*
, P
tuf
, P
H36 
and 
P
H30
, which were utilized to replace the original P
tac 
and P
trc 
promoters. 
The P
sod 
and P
tuf 
promoters are well-established, robust constitutive 
promoters frequently employed in C. glutamicum studies. In a prior 
investigation, we obtained a mutated, highly active constitutive pro -
moter, P
sod *
, which demonstrated a 5-fold increase in gene expression 
levels when compared to its unmutated counterpart, P
sod 
[ 18 ]. The P
H36 
and P
H30 
promoters were initially isolated from a 70 bp random 
sequence promoter library in C. glutamicum by employing 
fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) techniques, with the green 
fluorescent protein (GFP) serving as a reporter gene in the study con -
ducted by Yim et al. [ 19 ] According to the literature, the transcriptional 
strengths of the aforementioned promoters can be ranked as follows: 
P
sod*
> P
tac
> P
tuf
, P
H36
> P
H30
> P
trc
. 
The results of the fermentation tests conducted on the engineered 
strains formed through promoter engineering strategies are presented in 
Fig. 3 b. Remarkable 3-HP production titers were observed in the strains 
CgP11-CgP15, all of which employed an upregulated β -alanine synthesis 
module under the control of the P
sod* 
promoter. Thus, when producing 
3-HP via the β -alanine pathway, increasing the supply of β -alanine 
serves as a crucial factor in enhancing 3-HP yields, thereby facilitating a 
more efficient carbon flux towards 3-HP production. 
When compared to engineered strain CgP6, the 3-HP production in 
strains CgP12 and CgP13 increased by 31.7 % and 25.8 %, reaching 
concentrations of 4.44 and 4.24 g/L, respectively. In strain CgP12, both 
the β -alanine synthesis module and the 3-HP synthesis module were 
overexpressed using the P
sod* 
promoter; whereas, in strain CgP13, the 
β -alanine synthesis module was upregulated by the P
sod* 
promoter, and 
the 3-HP synthesis module was regulated by the P
tuf 
promoter. To 
explore the underlying causes for the enhanced production observed in 
strains CgP12 and CgP13, relative transcript levels of the β -alanine

synthesis module and the 3-HP synthesis module were measured via RT- 
qPCR. The results are depicted in Fig. 3c. There was a 3.46- and 3.42- 
fold increase in transcript levels of the genes correlated with the 
β-alanine synthesis module in strains CgP12 and CgP13, respectively, 
when compared to strain CgP6. Moreover, the transcript levels of the 
genes linked to the 3-HP synthesis module were elevated by 21 % in 
strain CgP12; conversely, strain CgP13 exhibited a reduction to 38 % of 
that observed in strain CgP6. In Fig. 3d, this comparison between CgP12 
and CgP13 indicates that CgP13 exhibited better growth metrics and a 
faster rate of 3-HP production. This suggests that moderately reducing 
the expression of the EcydfG-PaBAPAT operon helps lighten the meta -
bolic burden on cells, thereby boosting production rates. Therefore, 
while there is merit in increasing the supply of β-alanine precursors, it is 
crucial to strategically balance the synthesis of precursors with the 
downstream production of the 3-HP. The objective should be to refine 
the interaction between these two modules to optimize overall pathway 
efficiency and maximize flux, ensuring that the host cells are not sub -
jected to undue metabolic stress. 
To alleviate the metabolic burden of the strain due to the dual 
plasmid expression system, we attempted to express both P
sod*
-TcpanD- 
CgaspB and P
tuf
-EcydfG-PaBAPAT manipulators on the pEC-XK99E 
plasmid. However, the strain CgP31 using a single plasmid produced 
only 1.55 g/L of 3-HP, which is less than half the yield of strain CgP6 
using the dual plasmid expression system (Supplementary Fig. S2a). As 
shown in Figs. S2a and S2b, the growth status of strain CgP31 and the 
transcript levels of the two modular of the β-alanine pathway were 
examined, and it was found that the decrease production of strain CgP31 
appeared to be due to a greater flow of carbon fluxes to biomass syn -
thesis. Therefore, reducing TCA cyclic flux to limit biomass synthesis 
could be considered in subsequent studies, which might be an effective 
strategy to increase 3-HP production. 
2.3. Optimization of the intracellular supply of oxaloacetate 
The tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle plays a pivotal role in cellular 
metabolism by serving as a source of both energy and biosynthetic 
precursors. However, the TCA cycle competes with 3-HP synthesis for 
the key precursor oxaloacetate, and decreasing the flux of the TCA cycle 
is critical for increasing the titer of oxaloacetate-derived compounds. It 
is understood that while the TCA cycle is essential for providing the 
metabolites necessary for cell growth and amino acid synthesis, exces -
sive down-regulation of this cycle could detrimentally impact the cell’s 
metabolic balance [20]. Thus, fine-tuning the carbon flux entering the 
TCA cycle emerges as a promising approach to optimize the synthesis of 
desired metabolites such as 3-HP. 
Citrate synthase (CS), encoded by the gene gltA, is acknowledged as 
the rate-limiting enzyme of the TCA cycle, facilitating the conversion of 
oxaloacetate and acetyl-CoA to citrate [21]. Prior studies by Xu et al. 
[20] have demonstrated that diminishing CS activity can indeed favor 
the accumulation of oxaloacetate-derived compounds by conserving 
oxaloacetate for pathways other than the TCA cycle. Thereby, our 
research has aimed to decrease the flux through the TCA cycle by spe -
cifically down-regulating gltA expression, therefore allocating a greater 
share of oxaloacetate for 3-HP production. 
In previous work, Chang et al. [22] successfully generated a collec -
tion of engineered strains exhibiting varying citrate synthase (CS) 
enzyme activities. This change was achieved by strategically replacing 
the native gltA promoter with three weak promoters, P1, P5 and P7 (1 %, 
6 %, and 13 % of the strength of P
trc
, respectively). These promoters 
were selected from the C. glutamicum promoter library constructed in 
previous work [23]. The promoter sequences are detailed in Supple -
mentary Table 1. Further modifications included altering the start codon 
of gltA to TTG in conjunction with the weakest promoter P1, aiming to 
systematically reduce CS enzyme activity. The series of strains were 
named Cgz2, Cgz3, Cgz4, and Cgz5, and their CS enzyme activities were 
8.8 %, 12.3 %, 15.8 %, and 3.62 % of strain Cgz1, respectively [22]. The 
engineered strains, harboring the 3-HP production pathway and ordered 
by decreasing CS activity, exhibited a correlation between reduced CS 
activity and increased 3-HP production, as evidenced in fermentation 
outcomes presented in Fig. 4a. Among the strains, CgP35, which had the 
lowest CS enzyme activity, displayed the highest 3-HP production titer 
of 5.94 g/L and a yield of 0.273 g/g. This result was 33 % higher 
compared to that of CgP12, a strain unmodified in terms of CS activity. 
Further analysis, as illustrated in Fig. 4b, revealed that the reduction in 
CS enzyme activity had a negative impact on the growth rate and 
maximum biomass achieved by the engineered strains. Specifically, the 
maximal and 12-h incubation optical density (OD
600
) values for strain 
CgP12 were 29 and 15, respectively. In contrast, the corresponding 
OD
600 
values for the engineered CgP35 strain were observed to be 
remarkably lower, at 23 and 7, respectively. 
Furthermore, enhancing the intracellular availability of oxaloacetate 
via the overexpression of key metabolic enzymes like phosphoenolpyr -
uvate carboxylase (PPC) or pyruvate carboxylase (PYC) has been 
explored as a strategy to boost the production of oxaloacetate-derived 
compound [10,11,20]. In our investigations, we used the P
tuf 
promoter 
to overexpress various forms of the pyc and ppc genes from C. glutamicum 
and E. coli, along with their feedback inhibition-resistant mutant. A se -
ries of plasmids overexpressing pyc and ppc were constructed to enhance 
the biosynthetic pathways. Despite these efforts, the overexpression of 
pyc and ppc in engineered C. glutamicum strains did not yield a positive 
impact on 3-HP production. A range of engineered strains over -
expressing pyc and ppc showed a trend towards increased maximum cell 
OD
600 
and reduced growth rates (Supplementary Fig. S3), the exact 
mechanism by which overexpression of these enzymes affects cell 
growth and 3-HP synthesis remains to be elucidated. This observation 
highlights the complexity of metabolic interactions and the need for a 
nuanced understanding of metabolic engineering strategies aimed at 
optimizing the production of value-added chemicals such as 3-HP. 
2.4. Increase of 3-HP production flow by blocking of the branch pathway 
The ineffective oxaloacetate-aspartate-fumarate cycle could result in 
a metabolic bottleneck in the production of L -aspartic acid and its de -
rivatives, as shown by Piao et al. [24] In the previous section, we found 
that the main competing pathway for oxaloacetate was into the TCA 
cycle for cell metabolism. Malate dehydrogenase, encoded by mdh, 
catalyzes the reversible conversion of oxaloacetate to malate. This re -
action, while integral to cellular metabolism, can inadvertently lead to 
the diversion of oxaloacetate away from desired biosynthetic pathways, 
effectively reducing the efficiency of cofactor utilization and thereby 
impacting reactions dependent on these cofactors. 
In addition, L -aspartate aminotransferase (AspA) naturally occurs in 
C. glutamicum and facilitates the reversible conversion between L - 
aspartate and fumarate, an intermediate in the TCA cycle. In strains 
engineered to have reduced citrate synthase (CS) activity, there is a 
tendency for AspA to favor the conversion of L -aspartate to fumarate 
over its reverse reaction. This preference potentially detracts from the 
metabolic flux towards the β-alanine synthesis pathway, highlighting a 
critical area for metabolic engineering interventions. In an effort to 
address these challenges, we engineered strains with targeted knockouts 
of aspA and mdh, aiming to optimize the OAF cycle and, by extension, 
enhance 3-HP production. 
As depicted in Fig. 5, a comparative analysis was conducted on the 
engineered strains CgP36, CgP37, and CgP38, which disrupted the 
suboptimal oxaloacetate-aspartate-fumarate cycle. Among these strains, 
CgP36, which features a knockout of aspA alone, achieved the most 
notable increase in 3-HP production, registering a titer of 6.20 g/L and a 
yield of 0.292 g/g, alongside an accumulation of 0.63 g/L of β-alanine. 
Interestingly, the strain with both aspA and mdh knockouts (CgP38) also 
showed enhanced 3-HP production metrics relative to the control 
(CgP35), albeit with a slightly lesser titer of 6.13 g/L and a yield of 
0.290 g/g. This indicates a nuanced interplay between these metabolic 
X. Wang et al.

modifications and 3-HP production. Conversely, the strain with a sole 
knockout of mdh (CgP37) did not display a beneficial effect on 3-HP 
yields, underscoring the more critical role of AspA in this context. 
In the genetically engineered strain CgP36, the production of 3-HP 
was increased due to the knockout of aspA . However, the sugar con -
sumption rate, growth rate and 3-HP production rate were all dimin -
ished. This observation lends support to our hypothesis that, in 
engineered strains possessing a weakened TCA cycle, AspA demon -
strates a stronger propensity to catalyze the conversion of L -aspartic acid 
into fumaric acid, a TCA cycle intermediate metabolite, rather than 
promoting the reverse reaction. Consequently, the downregulation of 
aspA would curtail the levels of TCA cycle intermediates, thereby further 
impeding the TCA flux and resulting in the deceleration of the engi -
neered strains ’ growth. Such findings illuminate the intricate balance 
between metabolic pathway optimization and the broader impacts on 
cellular metabolism. 
2.5. Fed-batch fermentation in a 5 L bioreactor 
To further evaluate the 3-hydroxypropionic acid production capa -
bilities of the engineered microbial strain CgP36, an extensive cultiva -
tion experiment was conducted in a 5-litre bioreactor containing semi- 
synthetic CGXIIM medium supplemented with 3 g/L citric acid and 
10 g/L yeast extract to promote optimal growth conditions. The result -
ing fermentation data are systematically presented in Fig. 6 . 
The recombinant strain CgP36 successfully produced 47.54 g/l of 3- 
HP during a fermentation cycle lasting 100 h. This yield corresponds to a 
conversion yield of 0.295 g/g glucose and achieved a volumetric pro -
ductivity of 0.475 g/l/h, highlighting the efficiency of this engineered 
strain in the biosynthesis of 3-HP. Notably, at the end of the fermenta -
tion phase, CgP36 produced β -alanine at a concentration of 1.70 g/l, 
suggesting a targeted shift of its metabolic flux towards the target 
compound, 3-HP.Moreover, the analysis revealed the negligible 
presence of secondary by-products such as lactic and acetic acids, which 
are often observed in microbial fermentations. These findings suggest 
that the metabolically engineered strain CgP36 is capable of efficiently 
producing 3-HP through the β -alanine-dependent biosynthetic route. 
3. Conclusions 
In the present investigation, we focused on the de novo biosynthesis 
of 3-HP in C. glutamicum by engineering the β -alanine pathway. While 
the achieved production titers of 3-HP were encouraging, this high -
lighted several points for further enhancement. Firstly, the efficiency of 
the enzymes involved in converting β -alanine to 3-HP remains subop -
timal. Future efforts should focus on modifying these enzymes to

between precursor synthesis and product generation is crucial for 
maximizing the overall production efficiency. Secondly, the biosynthesis 
of 3-HP via the β -alanine pathway entails the consumption of NADPH, a 
critical cofactor whose availability limits production rates. By redirect -
ing carbon flux to the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) [ 25 ] or over -
expression of the pyridine nucleotide transhydrogenase gene ( pntAB ) 
[ 26 ] have been shown to improve NADPH supply. Moreover, as 3-HP is 
an organic acid, the discovery of an effective export mechanism could 
further increase its tolerance by the host strain. Currently, the yohJK 
manipulator-encoded transport proteins have been found to be used for 
3-HP export in E. coli [ 27 ], however the mechanism of 3-HP transport in 
C. glutamicum remains unclear. 
In this study, the titer of 3-HP was elevated by 31.7 % using the 
strongest promoter, P
sod*
, to overexpress genes related to the production 
pathway. Down-regulation of gltA expression to appropriately attenuate 
TCA cyclic flux and knocking out the branch metabolic pathways to 
prevent metabolic overflow were both effective strategies to elevate 3- 
HP production of the via β -alanine pathway, with a 39.6 % increase in 
this study. Remarkably, our engineered strain, designated as CgP36, 
notably generated 47.54 g/L of 3-HP, with an associated yield of 0.295 
g/g. To the best of our knowledge, these results represent the most 
substantial 3-HP yield attained from glucose via the β -alanine biosyn -
thetic pathway to date. 
4. Materials and methods 
4.1. Construction of plasmids and mutant strains of C. glutamicum 
All plasmids and strains used in this study are listed in Supplement 
Table 2 . Plasmid construction was carried out using E. coli DH5 α . The 
gene encoding aspartate beta-decarboxylase ( aspB ) was amplified 
directly from the genome of C. glutamicum , while the ydfg gene was 
sourced from E. coli . To construct the complete β -alanine pathway, 
T. castaneum -derived PanD, P. aeruginosa -derived BAPAT (codon-opti -
mized) were synthesized at Azenta (Suzhou, China). Gene editing 
methods and plasmid expression in C. glutamicum consistent with pre -
viously published studies [ 22 ]. 
The target fragment was amplified using Phanta Max high-fidelity 
DNA polymerase followed by ligation of the multiple fragments using 
a Seamless Cloning Kit (ABclonal Technology), and the ligation products 
were transformed into E. coli DH5 α cells. As previously described, the 
recombinant vectors were transformed into C. glutamicum . 
4.2. Media and culture conditions 
For plasmid host E. coli DH5 α : colonies were inoculated in test tubes 
containing 5 mL of LB medium at 37 
◦
C and 220 rpm, with 40 μ g/mL 
kanamycin or 10 μ g/mL chloramphenicol added as needed. 
For shake flask cultures of C. glutamicum : 1) single colonies were 
inoculated into test tubes containing 5 ml of BHI medium for overnight 
incubation; 2) 1 mL of seed cultures were transferred into 250 mL shake 
flasks containing 50 mL of CGIII medium (Media formulations are 
detailed in previous studies [ 22 ]) and incubated for 12 h; 3) seed in -
oculations into 250 mL of CGXIIM medium containing 25 mL of CGXIIM

50 g/L glucose. The temperature was maintained at 30 
◦
C and the air 
flow rate was set at 1 vvm. The initial stirring speed was 300 rpm and 
was automatically adjusted to keep the dissolved oxygen above 30 % 
saturation. Feeding with 750 g/L glucose and 10 g/L yeast extract was 
performed manually when the glucose concentration in the fermenta -
tion broth fell below 10 g/L, and was restored to 50 g/L. 
4.3. Analytical methods 
A conventional spectrophotometer (Puxi, Beijing) was used to 
monitor growth of engineered C. glutamicum by measuring the optical 
density at 600 nm (OD
600
). 
For analysis of β -alanine, 100 μ L of fermentation supernatant was 
mixed with freshly prepared derivatization reagent (100 μ L of 15 mg/ 
mL 2,4-dinitrobiphenyl (DNFB) dissolved in acetonitrile and 100 μ L of 
0.5 M NaHCO
3 
solution with pH 9.0), incubated for 1 h at 60 
◦
C. Then 
700 μ L of 0.05 M phosphate buffer was added, centrifuged at 12000 r/ 
min for 30 min, and the supernatant was taken for detection. The su -
pernatant was filtered through a 0.22 μ m membrane and immediately 
analyzed on Dionex UltiMate 3000 HPLC using a Diamonsil C18 column 
(4.6 × 250 mm, 5 μ m). The column temperature was set at 30 
◦
C, the 
detection wavelength was set at 360 nm, the constant flow rate was set 
at 1 mL/min, the mobile phase was 0.02 M NaAc-HAc buffer or aceto -
nitrile, and the conditions throughout the 55-min sequence were as 
follows: organic solvent (v/v) 5% – 40 % for 30 min, 40% – 70 % for 5 min, 
70 % organic solvent for 10 min, and 70 % – 5 % organic solvent for 5 min 
each followed by 5 % organic solvent for 5 min. The concentrations of 
glucose and organic acids in the fermentation broth were determined by 
high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), and the details of the 
determination were referred to the previous description [ 22 ]. 
4.4. Real-time quantitative PCR 
RNA extraction, cDNA synthesis and qRT-PCR procedures followed 
previous descriptions [ 22 ]. The internal reference was the transcript 
level of 16S ribosomal RNA of C. glutamicum . Three measurements were 
performed for the target gene of each strain.
