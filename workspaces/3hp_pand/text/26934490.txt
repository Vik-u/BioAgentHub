Abstract
Saccharomyces cerevisiaeis widely used in the biotechnology industry for production of
ethanol, recombinant proteins, food ingredients and other chemicals. In order to generate
highly producing and stable strains, genome integration of genes encoding metabolic path-
way enzymes is the preferred option. However, integration of pathway genes in single or
few copies, especially those encoding rate-controlling steps, is often not sufficient to sustain
high metabolic fluxes. By exploiting the sequence diversity in the long terminal repeats
(LTR) of Ty retrotransposons, we developed a new set of integrative vectors, EasyClone-
Multi, that enables multiple and simultaneous integration of genes inS. cerevisiae. By creat-
ing vector backbones that combine consensus sequences that aim at targeting subsets of
Ty sequences and a quickly degrading selective marker, integrations at multiple genomic
loci and a range of expression levels were obtained, as assessed with the green fluorescent
protein (GFP) reporter system. The EasyCloneMulti vector set was applied to balance the
expression of the rate-controlling step in theβ-alanine pathway for biosynthesis of 3-hydro-
xypropionic acid (3HP). The best 3HP producing clone, with 5.45 g.L
-1 of 3HP, produced
11 times more 3HP than the lowest producing clone, which demonstrates the capability of
EasyCloneMulti vectors to impact metabolic pathway enzyme activity.
Introduction
Budding yeastSaccharomyces cerevisiaeis used in the biotech industry for the production of a
wide range of chemicals, ranging from biofuels and bulk chemicals to nutraceuticals and phar-
maceuticals [
1– 4]. S. cerevisiae is an excellent host for heterologous production of metabolites
and fine chemicals at industrial scale, since it has a GRAS (Generally Recognized As Safe) sta-
tus and is tolerant to low pH. MoreoverS. cerevisiae is well-amenable to genetic engineering, so

strains for novel processes can be developed relatively fast [2,5,6]. The list of chemicals that
have been produced inS. cerevisiae at proof-of-concept levels counts several hundreds of com-
pounds and includes alcohols, organic acids, terpenes [7,8], polyphenols [9,10], and glucosino-
lates [11], to name a few. In order to produce a chemical of interest, yeast strains are usually
metabolically engineered by inserting and optimizing the required heterologous pathways as
well as by improving the host properties, such as precursor and co-factor supply, tolerance to
the product, or by-products formation [12]. Pathway optimization often includes balancing of
the expression levels of each pathway enzyme, some of which need to be overexpressed [13].
It has been shown that higher copy number of genes causes higher level of transcription and
therefore more efficient production of (heterologous) proteins [14]. However, using high copy
plasmids such as 2μ-based vectors is not the preferred option, since these plasmids are not
mitotically stable and thereby lead to heterogeneous gene expression in a population of cells
[15,16]. Therefore, integrating genes in multiple copies into the genome to maintain stable pro-
duction of the desired molecule for many generations is of high interest.
Yeast retrotransposons are a family of transposable elements that are dispersed throughout
the eukaryotic genome in high numbers [17,18]. Ty elements are a subclass of retrotransposons
that belong to Class-I elements, which transpose using a copy-paste mechanism with an RNA
as intermediate [
19]. Ty elements play a role in the mobilization of genome fragments through-
out the genome, probably due to the ectopic recombination involving Ty element repetitive
sequences, which can lead to chromosomal rearrangements and gene duplications in an evolu-
tionary context [
20]. Ty elements consist of two long terminal repeats (LTRs) that flank the
open reading framesTYA and TYB [21]. S. cerevisiae has five distinct families of Ty elements,
designated Ty1 to Ty5. Ty1, Ty2, Ty4 and Ty5 are Ty1-copia group elements, while Ty3 is a
Ty3-gypsy retrotransposon [22,23]. A total of 331 Ty insertions have been identified in theS.
cerevisiae genome, 85% of which are LTR fragments or solo LTRs [23]. Ideally, target sites for
genomic integrations in multiple copies would be present in high numbers and would prefera-
bly be spread across the entire genome to limit the risk of loss of DNA material by homologous
recombination, as target sites in this case will most probably be interspaced by elements essen-
tial for growth. Therefore, LTRs represent potential candidates as target sites for multiple
integrations.
Sequences from Ty retrotransposons have previously been used as target sites for gene inte-
gration. Sakaiet al. used the sequence of the terminal repeats,δ sequence, of a Ty element as
recombination sites to express heterologous genes and reported three to five insertions, on one
particular chromosome. Recombinant protein production increased significantly and the inte-
grations were mitotically stable over a period of 50 generations [
24]. Parekhet al. constructed
yeast integration vectors carrying the NEOR resistance marker that targets Ty LTR sequences
and reported tandem integrations ranging from one to 30 copies. Thereby, secretion levels of
bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor were significantly increased. This system could be tuned by
applying different concentrations of the antibiotic G418 [25]. A flocculentS. cerevisiae strain
was engineered to stably secreteβ– galactosidase by integrating theβ– galactosidase expression
cassette atδ sequences of the retrotransposon Ty1 [26]. Integrants producing the highest levels
of β– galactosidase were shown to carry approximately eight gene copies [26]. δ sequences
have also been successfully applied to metabolic pathway engineering. For the production of
1,2-propanediol, Leeet alengineered a strain with increased copy numbers of two heterologous
genes, mgs and gldA, integrated atδ sequences [
27]. In this case, the strain containing three
copies ofmgs and gldA produced the highest amount of 1,2-propanediol, although a clear cor-
relation with copy number was not apparent [27]. Even though the abovementioned studies
reported about integrations that proved stable for their copy number, most of the integrations
occurred at a limited number of sites and mostly as tandem arrays. This likely owes to the fact

that the vectors for integration were designed for single cross-over type integrations. More
recently, Yamadaet alused a novel approach,“cocktail δ-integration”, to optimize expression
levels of cellulolytic enzymes [28], while Yuan and Ching usedδ sequences to successfully
assemble and integrate multi-step pathways inS. cerevisiae [29]. In these two studies, gene con-
version events are expected as mechanism for integration. Ribosomal DNA, with 100– 200 tan-
dem repeats, was also identified as a potential target sequence for multiple integrations: Lopes
et alreported 100– 200 stable integrations using rRNA homology arms in combination with the
deficient LEU2-d selection marker in order to promote multiple integration events [30].
In this study, we utilized the possibilities offered by the five families of Ty elements inS. cer-
evisiae and specifically the sequence diversity of their LTRs to create a new set of multicopy
integrative vectors, named EasyCloneMulti. This vector set targets different subsets of Ty
sequences inS. cerevisiae genome. Like the previously described single integration EasyClone
vectors from which they are derived, EasyCloneMulti vectors are designed to integrate and
replace the targeted integration loci via a gene conversion type mechanism and offer the same
possibilities as the EasyClone vectors in terms of uracil-excision based cloning of up to two
genes with uni- or bidirectional promoters of choice [
11,16,31]. Multicopy integration and pro-
tein expression levels were analyzed using green fluorescent protein (GFP) as a reporter. As a
further proof of concept, we applied EasyCloneMulti to engineer the rate controlling enzymatic
step, catalyzed by L-aspartate-α-carboxylase, of theβ– alanine-dependent metabolic pathway to
produce 3-hydroxypropionic acid (3HP) [
32].
Materials and Methods
Strains
Escherichia coliDH5α was used for cloning procedures.S. cerevisiae strains are listed inS2
Table.
Media
Drop-out media and agar plates were prepared using pre-mixed drop-out powders from
Sigma-Aldrich. Mineral medium was prepared as described previously [16]. Synthetic fed-
batch medium forS. cerevisiae M-Sc.syn-1000 was purchased from M2P labs GmbH (Ger-
many). The medium was supplemented with the supplied vitamins solution (final 1% v/v) and
the enzyme mix (final concentration 0.5% v/v) immediately prior to use.
Identification of consensus sequences for the different Ty families ofS.
cerevisiae
All Ty sequences reported on the genome ofS. cerevisiae S288C were retrieved from the Sac-
charomyces Genome Database (www.yeastgenome.org). All sequences labeled as LTR and
larger than 200 nucleotides were uploaded to ClustalW2 to perform a multiple sequence align-
ment (
www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/msa/clustalw2). From the resulting alignment, five consensus
sequences were defined: Ty1Cons1, Ty1Cons2, Ty2Cons, Ty3Cons and Ty4Cons (S1 Table).
The consensus sequences were then included in the input file together with all Ty sequences of
more than 200 nucleotides and a new alignment was performed. From the output of the align-
ment, a phylogenetic tree was constructed using the maximum likelihood method for tree
building provided by the software MEGA6 [
33].

for consensus sequences were purchased as gBlocks from IDT Integrated DNA Technology.
Initially, a Ty4Cons bearing vector, pCfB312, was constructed in two subsequent In-Fusion
cloning events, and as follows: pCfB255 was PCR amplified using primers PR-512 and PR-
513, resulting in a pCfB255 linear fragment devoid of the“upstream” region for homologous
recombination. In parallel, the gBlock containing Ty4 consensus sequence was PCR amplified
using PR-517 and PR-518, in order to generate the upstream Ty4 sequence for homologous
recombination. Amplifications were carried out using Phusion DNA polymerase (Finnzymes,
now Thermo Fisher Scientific) and recommended conditions. Resulting PCR products
were treated withDpnI and gel-purified according to manufacturer’s recommendations
(Macherey-Nagel, NucleoSpin Gel and PCR clean-up). The two PCR fragments share homol-
ogous regions at their 5’and 3’ends so that the In-Fusion reaction can be carried out accord-
ing to the manufacturer’s recommendations (ClonTech Laboratories Inc.). After In-Fusion,
2.5 μL of the In-Fusion mix (total reaction volume of 5μL) was transformed into 100μLo f
chemically competentE. coli DH5α cells [
34]. Correct vectors were isolated and verified by
restriction digest. The resulting vector was used as template for a PCR reaction using primers
PR-514 and PR-515, resulting in a linear fragment devoid of the“downstream” region for
homologous recombination. In parallel, the gBlock containing Ty4 consensus sequence was
PCR amplified using PR-519 and PR-526, in order to create the downstream Ty4 sequence
for homologous recombination. Amplifications were carried out using Phusion DNA poly-
merase, reactions were then treated byDpnI and gel-purified. Like above, the two latter PCR
fragments share homologous regions at their 5’and 3’ends so that In-Fusion reaction can
be performed. Correct vectors corresponding to vector pCfB312, bearing an EasyClone
USER cassette and aKluyveromyces lactis URA3selection marker (Kl.URA3) surrounded by
upstream and downstream regions for homologous recombination at LTR from the Ty4 fam-
ily, were verified by restriction digest.
Kl.URA3 on pCfB312 was further modified by the addition of a degradation signal for
quicker degradation of the Ura3 protein [
35]. This was done by amplifying pCfB312 using
primers PR-521 and PR-522 using PfuX7 [36]. AfterDpnI treatment, separation and gel-purifi-
cation, the fragment was circularized on itself in a uracil-excision reaction mediated by the
USER enzyme mix (New England Biolabs). The resulting vector was pCfB322, which has
already been used in a metabolic study by Borodina et al. [
32]. pCfB322 bears an EasyClone
USER cassette and aKluyveromyces lactis URA3selection marker fused to the degradation
signal (Kl.URA3-degradation signal) surrounded by upstream and downstream regions for
homologous recombination at LTR from the Ty4 family.
As reporter, a GFP expression cassette comprising theS. cerevisiae TEF1promoter and the
coding sequence for the green fluorescent protein was cloned using the classical uracil excision
protocol reported previously [16]. The GFP-encoding sequence was prepared for uracil exci-
sion cloning by PCR amplification using primers PR-311 and PR-312 and PfuX7 [36]. Simi-
larly, the GFP expression cassette was cloned into pCfB312, pCfB322, pCfB255, pCfB054
resulting into vectors pCfB321, pCfB326, pCfB329 and pCfB319.
EasyCloneMulti vectors bearing consensus sequences targeting different families of Ty
sequences. pCfB326, bearing the pTEF1-GFP reporter cassette and theKl.URA3-degradation
signal as selective marker surrounded by upstream and downstream regions for homologous
recombination at LTR from the Ty4 family, was used as template to generate four new vectors
targeting LTRs of the Ty1, Ty2 or Ty3 family of Ty elements for integration. As two different

consensus sequences for the Ty1 family were selected (Ty1Cons1 and Ty1Cons2), we con-
structed two vectors, pCfB1136 and pCfB1137 for the Ty1 family.
The overall principle was that the upstream and the downstream regions for homologous
recombination at Ty4 type of LTRs, borne on pCfB326, were exchanged in a single uracil-exci-
sion based reaction for upstream and downstream regions for LTRs of the other families, i.e.
Ty1, Ty2 and Ty3. In order to do this, two PCR fragments were generated from pCfB326: 1)
using primer set PR-1700/PR-1702 and 2) using PR-1698/PR-1704. These two fragments
encompass all features of pCfB326 but the upstream and downstream regions for homologous
recombination at Ty4 elements. Upstream regions for homologous recombination at Ty1, Ty2
and Ty3 elements were generated by PCR using primers PR-1697/PR-1699 and gBlock tem-
plates Ty1Cons1, Ty1Cons2, Ty2Cons, TY3cons, respectively. Downstream regions for homol-
ogous recombination at Ty1, Ty2 and Ty3 elements were generated by PCR using primers PR-
1701/PR-2051 and gBlock templates Ty1Cons1, Ty1Cons2, Ty2Cons, Ty3cons, respectively.
After uracil-excision reaction and transformation of chemically competentE. coli DH5α, the
following vectors were obtained: pCfB1136, pCfB1137, pCfB1138, pCfB1139.

of USER cassette containing EasyCloneMulti vectors are explained in detail in the Supplemen-
tary Methods (
S1 File). All these additional EasyCloneMulti vectors are listed inS4 Table.
Transformation ofS. cerevisiae
S. cerevisiae was transformed with different vectors using the lithium acetate transformation
protocol [37]. Prior to transformation, integrative vectors were digested byNotI and column-
purified (NucleoSpin Gel and PCR cleanup kit, Macherey Nagel). Approximately 1μg DNA
was transformed into competent yeast cells. The cells were selected on drop-out agar medium.
Measurement of fluorescence on a microtiter plate reader
Colonies ofS. cerevisiae strains to be tested were inoculated in 0.8 mL of drop-out medium in a
96 deep-well plate with air-penetrable lid (EnzyScreen, NL). After approximately 24 hours of
cultivation at 30°C with 300 rpm in deep-well plate, a fresh 96 deep-well plate was inoculated
from the first cultivation plate to an initial OD
600 = 0.05. After cultivation for 36– 48 hours at
30°C with 300 rpm agitation, fluorescence (λExcitation 485nm, λEmission 515nm) and OD600 were
measured on a microtiter plate reader BioTek Synergy MX (BioTek). Results are reported as
specific fluorescence, which is obtained by dividing measured average fluorescence by the mea-
sured OD
600.
Single cell measurements of fluorescence
S. cerevisiae strains were inoculated from solid drop-out medium lacking uracil into 24 deep-
well plates (EnzyScreen, NL) containing 2 mL liquid drop-out medium without uracil for over-
night cultivations at 30°C with 300 rpm. The next day, a fresh 24 deep-well plate, containing 2
mL per well of drop-out medium without uracil, was inoculated to an initial OD
600 of 0.05.
After approximately 24 hours of cultivation at 30°C with 300 rpm agitation, the cells were har-
vested and fixed with paraformaldehyde according to the following protocol. 1.5 mL samples
were taken and immediately cooled in ice-water bath and subsequently centrifuged at 4°C,
2000 x g for 2 min. Supernatant was removed and pellet resuspended in 200μL of 2% parafor-
maldehyde. The mix was incubated on ice for 1 hour and subsequently centrifuged at 4°C,

2000 x g for 2 min. Finally, the paraformaldehyde was removed and the cell pellet was resus-
pended in 200μL PBS. The fixed cells were stored at 4°C until further analysis.
Cells were analyzed on a BD FACSAria (BD Biosciences) equipped with three solid state
diode lasers: air-cooled CoherentTM SapphireTM solid-state diode laser (488 nm, 100 mW),
air-cooled CoherentTM Yellow Green laser (561 nm, 100 mW), and an air-cooled Coher-
entTM Deep Blue laser (445 nm, 50 mW). The FITC-A filter was applied for measurement of
green fluorescence. Flow cytometry data were analyzed and interpreted using Cyflogic software
(
www.cyflogic.com/).
Cultivation ofS. cerevisiae for the production of 3HP
For each strain, at least sixteen single colonies originating from independent transformants
were inoculated in 0.5 mL drop-out liquid medium without uracil, histidine, and leucine in a
96 deep-well plate with air-penetrable lid (EnzyScreen, NL). Plates were incubated at 30°C with
300 rpm agitation at 5.1 cm orbit cast overnight (Eppendorf innova 44). 20μL of the overnight
cultures were used to inoculate synthetic fed-batch medium (Feed-In-Time fed-batch medium,
m2p-Labs) in a 96 deep-well plate. Fermentation was carried out for 72 hours at the same con-
ditions as above.
At the end of the cultivation OD600 was measured using the microtiter plate reader BioTek
Synergy MX (BioTek). The culture broth was filtered (Acroprep 0.2μm, Supor membrane,
VWR) and the supernatant analyzed for 3-hydroxypropionic acid concentration on HPLC. For
measuring 3HP on HPLC, 30μL of the sample was analyzed for 30 min using an Aminex
HPX-87H ion exclusion column with a 1 mM H
2SO4 flow of 0.6 mL.min-1. The temperature of
the column was 60°C. The refractive index at 45°C and the UV absorption at 210 nm were
recorded. 3HP quantification was performed based on RI chromatograms. The UV spectrum
was recorded with a diode array and the identity of 3-hydroxypropionic acid was additionally
verified by comparison with the spectrum of a commercial standard.
Genomic DNA extraction and library sequencing
Genomic DNA was extracted using QIAamp DNA Mini Kit (QIAGEN, Germany). The geno-
mic libraries were generated using the TruSeq Nano DNA LT Library Prep Kit (Illumina Inc.,
San Diego CA). Briefly, 100 ng of genomic DNA diluted in 52.5μL TE buffer was fragmented
in Covaris Crimp Cap microtubes on a Covaris E220 ultrasonicator (Woburn, MA) with 5%
duty factor, 175 W peak incident power, 200 cycles/burst, and 50-s duration under frequency
sweeping mode at 5.5 to 6°C (Illumina recommendations for a 350-bp average fragment size).
The ends of fragmented DNA were repaired by T4 DNA polymerase, Klenow DNA polymer-
ase, and T4 polynucleotide kinase. The Klenow exo minus enzyme was then used to add an 'A'
base to the 3' end of the DNA fragments. The adapters were ligated to the ends of the DNA
fragments, and the DNA fragments ranging from 300– 400 bp were recovered by beads purifi-
cation. Finally, the adapter-modified DNA fragments were enriched by 3 PCR cycles. Final
concentration of each library was measured by Qubit 2.0 Fluorometer and Qubit DNA Broad
range assay (Life Technologies). Average dsDNA library size was determined using the Agilent
DNA 7500 kit on an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer. Libraries were normalized and pooled in 10
mM Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, plus 0.05% Tween 20 to the final concentration of 10 nM. Denaturated in
0.2N NaOH, 10 pm pool of 20 libraries in 600μL ice-cold HT1 buffer was loaded onto the flow
cell provided in the MiSeq Reagent kit v2 (300 cycles) (Illumina Inc., San Diego CA) and
sequenced on a MiSeq (Illumina Inc., San Diego CA) platform with a paired-end protocol and
read lengths of 151 nt.

Next generation sequencing data analysis
Illumina reads were aligned to bothS. cerevisiae S288C (www.yeastgenome.org/strain/S288C/
overview) and CEN.PK113-7D (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/assembly?LinkName=bioproject_
assembly_all&from_uid=52955) reference genomes as well as relevant integrative vector
sequences (seeS1 File) using bowtie2 [38]. Copy numbers for integrated genes (GFP,Kl.URA3
marker) as well as other sequence elements present on the vectors (e.g. left and right consensus
sequences used for homologous recombination) were determined by taking the ratio of read
coverage across these elements to the average coverage for coding regions in the chromosomal
DNA sequences. The coverage (the depth of sequencing) was calculated using coverageBed
tool in bedtools [
39]. Potential integration loci were determined by taking advantage of paired
end sequencing as follows using samtools [40] and custom Python scripts: First, reads that
mapped uniquely into regions on the integration construct that do not have significant similar-
ity to regions on theS. cerevisiae genome were identified. Second, the corresponding paired
end reads to the reads found in step #1 were identified. Third, if these paired ends mapped
(even partially) to the reference genomes, the regions with significant paired end read enrich-
ment were further examined manually using Tablet [
41]. Potential tandem duplications were
identified by manual inspection of read mappings against vector sequences using Tablet.
Results
Identification of consensus sequences for multiple integrations
LTRs of Ty retrotransposons are scattered in multiple copies throughout the entire genome
of S. cerevisiae and are present on all chromosomes. Therefore, they are attractive target
sequences for vectors aiming at multiple integrations inS. cerevisiae. Integration at Ty
sequences was previously reported and successfully used to trigger multiple integrations of
DNA constructs into the genome [24,25,27]. However, it was not shown whether it is possible
to define specific DNA sequences that would trigger the insertion of a DNA construct into a
subset of Ty sequences only. Importantly, the different Ty families are present in different
numbers, which could potentially be exploited to achieve different ranges of expression levels.
Therefore, we first investigated whether we could identify consensus sequences amongst
reported LTR sequences that would be specific to a certain subset of Ty sequences belonging
to the same family. These sequences should preferably share a high degree of identity with a
maximum number of LTRs belonging to the samefamily while being highly dissimilar to
sequences belonging to other families.
The distribution of the different Ty sequences on the genome ofS. cerevisiae is presented in
Fig 1. The Ty1 family is the largest one with 217 members scattered throughout the entire
genome (Fig 1)[ 23]. An interesting feature of all families, besides Ty5, is that they consist of
members distributed on most of the chromosomes. Ty2, Ty3 and Ty4 sequences appear partic-
ularly appealing as, although consisting of fewer members than the Ty1 family, these elements
are largely spread on all chromosomes and only a small fraction of members of each family is
present on the same chromosomes (
Fig 1). With the objective of creating a vector toolset for
multiple and stable integrations, this would be valuable to reduce the possibility of integrations
close to each other on the same chromosome, as this could lead to genomic instability of inte-
grated DNA sequences triggered by homologous recombination. Indeed, integration sites for
the single integrative vector toolset EasyClone were defined in a way that integration sites are
interspersed by essential genes, thereby limiting the risk of losing DNA material by homolo-
gous recombination [
11,16]. Ty sequences of the Ty5 family were not considered suitable for

the vector system presented here, as most of these elements are located in telomeric regions
(Fig 1).
Five LTR consensus sequences were defined as reported in the material and methods sec-
tion: Ty1Cons1, Ty1Cons2, Ty2Cons, Ty3Cons and Ty4Cons. The phylogenetic tree relating
the five consensus sequences to the other Ty sequences ofS. cerevisiae is presented in
Fig 2.I n
general, it can be observed that LTR sequences belonging to either of the families Ty2, Ty3 or
Ty4, cluster significantly together in one main cluster with few divergent sequences (Fig 2A).
Especially, Ty3Cons and Ty4Cons share high identity levels with sequences of their respective
families. In the case of Ty3Cons, 21 sequences showed identity levels over 95% within the same
family, and 17 out of these 21 showed over 98% of identity. In the case of Ty4Cons, 14 out of
17 sequences have identity levels higher than 98% (
Fig 2B). Interestingly, cluster Ty2 is the
only cluster that consists of sequences originating from different families as both Ty2- and
Ty1-labeled sequences are present in that cluster, at an approximate 60/40 ratio (Fig 2A). The
Ty1 family can be divided into four main clusters, although a high number of sequences
belonging to it are highly divergent (
Fig 2A). Two consensus sequences were therefore defined
for this family as Ty1Cons1 and Ty1Cons2. Ty1Cons1 and Ty1Cons2 share only 85% of iden-
tity with each other and locate at two different Ty1 family clusters (Fig 2C). Ty1Cons1 shares

more than 95% identity with 30 Ty1 sequences, while Ty1Cons2 shares the same degree of
identity with 21 Ty1 sequences.
The five different consensus sequences defined in this analysis are also characterized by a
low level of identity to each other, with exception of Ty2Cons and Ty1Cons2 (Fig 2C).
Ty3Cons and Ty4cons are highly dissimilar with a maximum of 32% identity to the other con-
sensus. While the highest identity level is observed for Ty2Cons and Ty1Cons2 with 94% of
identity, those sequences are still dissimilar with the other consensus sequences defined (
Fig
2C). In conclusion, we assume that the different consensus sequences defined here are both
identical enough to certain subsets of Ty sequences and dissimilar enough between each other
to trigger multiple integrations at specific subsets of Ty sequences. These consensus sequences
are the basis for constructing EasyCloneMulti vector backbones for multiple insertions.
The main features of EasyCloneMulti vectors
EasyCloneMulti vector backbones for multicopy integrations were constructed based on the
EasyClone vector series previously reported [16]. Each of the EasyCloneMulti vectors com-
prises the following features (Fig 3): i) an upstream and downstream region for insertion at a
specific subset of Ty sequences, HR 5’and HR 3’, ii) a selective marker, i.e.URA3 from Kluyver-
omyces lactis(Kl.URA3), iii) flanking loxP sites for recycling the selective marker, iiii) a USER
cloning site (AsiSI/Nb.BsmI). HR 5’and HR 3’correspond to the 5’and the 3’end of each of
the LTR consensus sequences (S1 Table). Their size varies between 164 and 186 bp. HR 5’and
HR 3’are in direct orientation with respect to one another in order to trigger integration via a
gene conversion type mechanism. In every EasyCloneMulti vector, a further modification was

added, i.e. the in-frame fusion ofURA3 with a degradation signal leading to the quick degrada-
tion of the Ura3 protein [35,42]. The signal for degradation is a DNA sequence encoding the
following amino acid sequence: ACKNWFSSLSHFVIHL. This C-terminal extension is pre-
sumed to contain degradation signals channeling proteins to the ubiquitin system. Therefore,
we chose to fuseKl.URA3 to the degradation signal CL-1, as a fusion to this particular C-
terminal sequence was shown to result in rapid degradation of the Ura3 protein [
35]. The latter
feature proved to be essential for triggering insertions at multiple loci (Fig 4). Similar to Easy-
Clone vectors, EasyCloneMulti vectors can be linearized by digestion withNotI and then trans-
formed intoS. cerevisiae.
Combining a Ty4 targeting consensus sequence and a fast degrading
selective marker leads to high expression levels of green fluorescent
protein
Fluorescence levels of GFP arising from the EasyCloneMulti vector bearing the Ty4 consensus
sequence were compared to the same vector backbone bearing the Ty4 consensus sequence but
devoid of the signal for degradation ofKl.URA3, to an episomal vector, and to a single integra-
tive vector targeting locus 2 on chromosome X (an integration site described by [
11]). Single
cell fluorescence levels were measured and analyzed (Fig 4). We initially observed that fluores-
cence levels of cells harboring a Ty4Cons based vector devoid of the signal for degradation of
Kl.URA3 were very similar to the fluorescence levels of cells bearing the single integrative vec-
tor (
Fig 4). Higher fluorescence levels were only obtained when vector backbones combined
Ty4Cons together with the expression of the fusion proteinKl.Ura3-degradation signal (Fig 4).
Fig 3. Functional map of the EasyCloneMulti vectors.Two types of EasyCloneMulti were constructed: A) EasyCloneMulti with a USER cassette for
cloning purposes and B) EasyCloneMulti with a reporter cassette consisting of PTEF1-GFP-TCYC1. All EasyCloneMulti vectors share the following features: 1)
upstream and downstream regions for insertion at specific Ty sequences, HR 5’and HR 3’, flanked byNotI restriction sites for linearization 2) a selective
marker, i.e.URA3 from Kluyveromyces lactis, flanked by loxP sites; 3) an in-frame fusion of the marker gene with a degradation signal. HR 5’and HR 3’are in
direct orientation with respect to one another to trigger gene conversion based integrations. EasyCloneMulti with a USER cassette support the same USER
cloning possibilities as EasyClone vectors [16].

In that case, fluorescence levels of the cell population are highly homogeneous with 91% of the
cell population characterized by high expression levels, while equivalently high expression lev-
els are observed for a smaller fraction of the cell population in the case of the episomal 2μ
based (57%), the Ty4 based vector devoid ofKl.Ura3-degradation signal fusion (2%), and the

vector is highly heterogeneous with regards to fluorescence levels as a large fraction of the cell
population, i.e. 25% of the cell population, are expressing very low levels of fluorescence. This
fraction becomes marginal in the case of the EasyCloneMulti vector. In conclusion, the vector
backbone comprising both Ty4Cons for integration at Ty4 sequences and theKl.URA3
selective marker fused to the degradation signal was successful in triggering high expression
levels of GFP and largely eliminated the fraction of cells expressing low levels of fluorescence
observed in the case of the episomal vector.
Multi-integration into different subsets of Ty sequences leads to different
expression levels and copy numbers
The EasyCloneMulti vector set was expanded to include the respective Ty1Cons1, Ty1Cons2,
Ty2, or Ty3 consensus sequences. All contained the fusion proteinKl.Ura3-degradation signal
as selective marker. Each vector was linearized byNotI and transformed intoS. cerevisiae.
Resulting fluorescence levels are presented inFig 5. All EasyCloneMulti vectors led to increased
average fluorescence levels as compared to the single integrative vector that integrates at locus
2 on chromosome X (
Fig 5). In general, the different EasyCloneMulti vectors are characterized
by different ranges of fluorescence levels, which may reflect different numbers of insertions or
differences in gene expression depending on the location of the insertion sites on the genome.
Ty1Cons2 and Ty2 based EasyCloneMulti vectors sustain a highly similar range of fluorescence
levels, which may reflect the high level of identity of Ty1Cons2 and Ty2 (
Fig 2C). Average
fluorescence levels for EasyCloneMulti vectors are 19 to 26 times higher than the fluorescence
level of the single integrative vector, with extreme clones showing increased fluorescence levels
up to about 50 times. Within the same vector type, the range of fluorescence level spans from
2-fold increase for the Ty3Cons based vector, to a 7-fold increase for the Ty1Cons1 based vec-
tor (
Fig 5).
Interestingly, transformation efficiency for the EasyCloneMulti vectors was only reduced
approximately 3-fold, with 1.5.103 transformants.μg-1 digested plasmid DNA, compared to the
transformation efficiency of the single integrative vector that integrates at locus 2 of chromo-
some X, with 5.10
3 transformants.μg-1 digested plasmid DNA. It is however likely that the effi-
ciency of transformation will drop when genes encoding enzymes of metabolic pathways are to
be overexpressed. This is indeed what we observed in the case of the proof of concept study on
3HP production and report further below. We further expanded the EasyCloneMulti vector
collection with a different selective marker:Kl.LEU2, fused to the CL-1 degradation signal as
described above [
35]. We observed the same pattern for these five new EasyCloneMulti vectors,
which can therefore also conveniently be used for multicopy integration (S1 Fig). We also con-
structed EasyCloneMulti vectors with theSp.HIS5 marker fused to the CL-1 degradation signal.
Interestingly, we observed a 10-fold higher transformation efficiency, i.e. a 10-fold increase in
surviving colonies on drop-out media, for all five EasyCloneMulti vectors with theSp.HIS5
marker compared to the EasyCloneMulti vectors with theKl.URA3 and Kl.LEU2 markers (data
not shown). However,Sp.HIS5 based vectors only led to weak GFP fluorescence levels, very
close to fluorescence levels of the single integrative vector (S1 Fig). We therefore conclude that
EasyCloneMulti vectors, based onKl.URA3 and Kl.LEU2 markers fused to the CL-1 degrada-
tion signal, trigger simultaneous and multiple integrations into theS. cerevisiae genome. In
turn, this leads to multiple gene copies and to a range of expression levels of the GFP reporter.
We then used next generation sequencing to analyze copy numbers and integration loci for
five S. cerevisiae clones containing an EasyCloneMulti vector expressing GFP. From the experi-
ment reported inFig 5, one isolate from each type of EasyCloneMulti vector was analyzed by
next generation sequencing (S2 Fig). One additional isolate expressing GFP from a single
EasyCloneMulti: Vectors for Multiple Genomic Integrations in Yeast

locus, locus X-2, was used as reference for GFP integrated at a single locus (Fig 5and S2 Fig).
As expected, the copy number was one for the isolate with single integration. The isolates with
Ty sequence-targeted integrations had copy numbers ranging from ~30 to ~260 (Table 1). The
specific fluorescence was found to depend linearly on the logarithm of the estimated copy
number (
S2 Fig). The copy numbers estimated for GFP and the heterologousKl.URA3 marker
present on all EasyCloneMulti vectors were consistent with each other indicating that the copy
number estimation is reliable and that intact vectors integrated in multiple copies (Table 1).
We hereby confirmed by whole genome sequencing that EasyCloneMulti vectors trigger multi-
ple integrations on the genome ofS. cerevisiae.

We next determined potential insertion loci by examining cases where one paired read
mapped to a unique sequence on the integrative vector and the other paired read mapped to a
specific region on the chromosomes. This analysis confirmed the correct integration locus for
the single copy X-2 integrated GFP and identified 1 to 12 high confidence integration sites for
three of the Ty sequence based integrations (
Table 1). However, for the other isolates we could
not confidently determine any integration locus although some loci with a few mapped reads
could be found. This is somewhat expected due to the high copy numbers observed for the iso-
lates with Ty sequence based integrations, meaning that very few reads would map to any spe-
cific locus. For example if we sequence the genome at 100X coverage and a construct had a
copy number of 50, we would expect to find on average two reads mapping at each integration
locus. This number is too low to be detected with confidence from background non-specific
mapping of reads. We have included all potential integration loci found, even with low confi-
dence, as
S5 Table. Nevertheless, the 6 and 12 high confidence insertion loci identified for the
two isolates bearing Ty2Cons and Ty4Cons based vectors indicate that 5/6 and 7/12 insertions
are located on different chromosomes, respectively (S5 Table). Furthermore, the distance
between insertion loci on similar chromosomes is at least 5000bp (S5 Table). This indicates
that, as intended, EasyCloneMulti vectors are able to target different loci for integration that
are mostly located on different chromosomes.
We further investigated whether there was a potential for tandem duplication at a single
locus. Tandem duplicates could be detected by manually inspecting read mappings to the vec-
tor sequences and identifying read pairs that mapped in a pattern indicative of a tandem dupli-
cation. Tandem duplications were also supported by observing differential copy numbers for
the left and right integration regions on the vector (
Table 1). Out of the five isolates sequenced,
we observed one clear case of tandem duplication (Ty1-Cons2_H4), which may partially
explain the unusually high GFP copy number obtained (Table 1). Tandem duplications are not
surprising for integration at Ty sequences and have previously been reported in the literature
[
25,26]. In most of the studies, integrations occurred in a limited number of integration sites
but in tandem arrays [26]. It is believed that the first event of integration of the Ty targeting
vector may accelerate the next integration at the same site because more Ty sequences are avail-
able around the first target site, making the first integration region a hot spot for integration
[
26]. The design of the EasyCloneMulti vectors, which comprise two homologous regions for
recombination of approximately 170bp of length, in direct orientation with respect to one
another, flanking the expression cassette and the selective marker, may reduce the possibility of
insertions in tandem and favor integrations at distinct loci.
Stability of expression from the different EasyCloneMulti vectors was challenged during a
serial transfer cultivation experiment in synthetic drop out medium (
S3 Fig). After 16 genera-
tions of growth, isolates from most of the EasyCloneMulti constructs tested retained more than
75% or their initial fluorescence level (S3B Fig). Ty2Cons based vectors proved the least stable
with only 31% of the isolates retaining over 75% of their original fluorescence after 16 genera-
tions. This number further decreased to 19% after 32 generations (
S3B Fig). After 32 genera-
tions, for most of the EasycloneMulti constructs tested, more than 50% of the isolates retained
over 75% of their original fluorescence levels (S3B Fig). It is therefore possible to identifyS. cer-
evisiae strains that carry multiple copies of EasyCloneMulti borne genes in their genomes and
stably express them over generations. For this purpose, maintaining selective pressure for the
vectors is a requirement, as decreased GFP expression levels were observed upon cultivation in
non-selective media, i.e. YPD (data not shown). As EasyCloneMulti bearing strains are proto-
trophic, the use of minimal medium for cultivation is a cheap and convenient way to maintain
selection for the vectors during growth.

Balancing gene expression level in the 3HP pathway using
EasyCloneMulti vectors
3HP is a platform chemical, which can be converted into acrylic acid, 1,3-propanediol, malonic
acid, and other valuable chemicals. In 2011, the world annual production of acrylic acid was
5000 kMT and the market size was USD 11.5 billion. Acrylic acid-derived products include
superabsorbent polymers used in diapers and incontinence products, plastics, coatings, adhe-
sives, elastomers, and paints [
32]. Borodinaet al. recently demonstrated a synthetic route for
the biosynthesis of 3HP inS. cerevisiae via β– alanine [32]. They identified the enzymatic reac-
tion catalyzed by PanD from the red flour beetleTribolium castaneumas the main flux control-
ling step. Integration ofT. castaneum panDin multiple copies, using a Ty4 based integrative
vector, led to approximately 4-fold increase in 3HP production in their best producing strain
[32]. Here we decided to investigate whether varying expression levels ofpanD by the EasyClo-
neMulti vector set could impact and potentially further improve 3HP production. The DNA
fragment containingpanD from T. castaneum under the control of the nativeS. cerevisiae
TEF1 promoter was cloned into EasyCloneMulti vectors for multiple insertions at different Ty
sequences. The different types of EasyCloneMulti vectors bearingpanD were transformed into
a S. cerevisiae strain overexpressing three steps of theβ– alanine pathway (SCE-iL1-155) and
thereby completed the metabolic pathway to yield 3HP. A reduced transformation efficiency
for EasyCloneMulti vectors bearing theT. castaneum panDexpression cassette compared to a
single integrative vector bearing the same gene was observed, with efficiencies of 10
1 to 102
transformants.μg-1 digested plasmid DNA and 4.103 transformants.μg-1 digested plasmid
DNA, respectively (data not shown). Despite this reduction in transformation efficiency when
using the different EasyCloneMulti vectors, we were still able to further improve 3HP produc-
tion, as the overall span of 3HP titers obtained for this experiment was approximately 11-fold
(
Fig 6). An approximate 20% increase in 3HP average titer was also observed whenpanD was
expressed from Ty2Cons based vectors, as compared to Ty4Cons based ones. The highest pro-
ducing clone based on a Ty2Cons EasyCloneMulti vector produced 40% more than the average
3HP titer of the Ty4Cons EasyCloneMulti vector (Fig 6). It should be further mentioned that
no major impact on final biomass concentration was observed (S6 Table). We hereby demon-
strate the usefulness of the EasyCloneMulti vectors to vary and increase expression levels of a
metabolic enzymatic step.
Discussion
We demonstrate in this work that the EasyCloneMulti vector set is an efficient and reliable
strain construction tool to integrate heterologous genes in multiple copies into the genome of
S. cerevisiae. Recently, the combinatorial assembly of biochemical pathways into yeast via con-
structs targeting one retrotransposonδ-site coupled with antibiotic selection has been reported
[
29,43]. In these studies, copy number was adjusted using different antibiotics concentrations.
Another new system, the D-POP system, integrates genes in high copy in consecutive integra-
tion events [44]. Our EasyCloneMulti vector set is distinct from these studies, since EasyClone-
Multi vectors are based on the EasyClone system, and thereby offer the convenient and
efficient assembly of standardized DNA bricks into multi-loci targeting vectors via USER-clon-
ing [
16]. We show that EasyCloneMulti vectors result in simultaneous multiple integrations on
the genome ofS. cerevisiae, during one single yeast transformation step. Multiple integrations
at distinct loci and on different chromosomes were confirmed by genome sequencing. This fea-
ture, as opposed to previous studies which mostly report about multiple integrations in tandem
arrays [
24– 27], owes to the design of the EasyCloneMulti vectors. With the upstream and
downstream regions for homologous recombination flanking expression cassettes and the

PLOS ONE | DOI:10.1371/journal.pone.0150394 March 2, 2016 15 / 22
selective marker, our vector system favors integrations via gene conversion events. In previous
studies, integrations at Ty sequences in tandem are probably the consequence of the integration
vectors being designed for integrations via single cross over mechanisms. We believe that inte-
gration at several and distinct loci, mediated by the EasyCloneMulti vectors, will prove benefi-
cial for genomic stability as, in this case, integrated genes will most likely be separated by
essential elements for growth which in turn may reduce chances for loop out events. Similar to
our system, the most recent reports also rely on gene conversion events for integration at Ty
sequences [
28,29,43]. Additionally, EasyCloneMulti can readily be used with two different
types of auxotrophic markers,Kl.URA3 or Kl.LEU2, which makes it possible to study the effect
of varying expression levels of up to four genes. Importantly, it was shown that high expression
levels of GFP from EasyCloneMulti vectors can be maintained for 32 generations (
S3 Fig), sup-
porting a genomic stability suitable for the construction of production strains.
The two different selective markers,Kl.URA3 and Kl.LEU2 are fused to the CL-1 degrada-
tion signal. InS. cerevisiae, destabilizing or weakening the expression of a selective marker to
increase the copy number of a plasmid has previously been reported [45,46]. It should be
highlighted here that, in our study, the quick degradation of the selective marker caused by the
CL-1 degradation signal is essential for the multi-integration phenotype. This may be explained
by the fitness penalty such a feature provides. A quick degradation of Ura3 or Leu2 reduces the
half-life of the protein and in turn imposes a positive selection for increased copy number of
that gene in yeast cells. BothKl.URA3 and Kl.LEU2 markers yield the same results with regards
to GFP fluorescence levels, and can therefore conveniently be used for multicopy integration of
genes. However, EasyCloneMulti vectors containing theSp.HIS5 marker fused to the CL-1 deg-
radation signal only led to marginal increases of fluorescence levels compared to a single inte-
grative vector (
S1 Fig). This might reflect the low efficiency of the chosen degradation signal on
His5 possibly due to protein structure that could potentially bury the C-terminal degradation

tail. Also, high protein stability or long half-life of the His5 protein might be causative reasons
for the low integration frequencies observed. It might also be that only trace amounts of the
His5 protein are needed for survival on drop-out media. In any case, using this last set of vec-
tors based onSp.HIS5 for multicopy integration is not recommended.
As a proof of concept, we used EasyCloneMulti vectors to integrate the rate-controlling
enzyme PanD fromT. castaneum into a strain that contains theβ– alanine dependent metabolic
pathway to produce 3HP [
32]. We demonstrated the ability of the vector set to significantly
increase 3HP titers. It has been established earlier that multiple copies ofpanD integrated
using a Ty4Cons based EasyCloneMulti vector led to a higher production of 3HP as compared
to single integration ofpanD [32]. Here we could further increase production by using an Easy-
CloneMulti vector targeting Ty2Cons sites. Interestingly, when compared to the high fold-
increase of GFP fluorescence of EasyCloneMulti constructs, 3HP production was increased to
a lesser extent, although still significantly higher than with single-copypanD (extrapolated
from [32]). This might indicate that PanD ceases to be the flux-controlling step of theβ-Ala-
nine pathway at such high levels of expression. The number of integrated copies in the different
isolates was not measured here but other studies from Borodina’s laboratory which used Easy-
CloneMulti types of vectors reported integrated copy numbers. Stoviceket al., for example,
worked on laboratory and industrial strains and C5 sugars fermentation. They reported 6 to 8
integrated copies of two genes necessary for xylose consumption and borne on EasyCloneMulti
type vectors targeting Ty2 loci [31]. The strains carrying this number of multiple copies were
obtained after selection on increased antibiotic concentration and sustain growth rates in the
order of 0.28 h-1 [31]. Liet al. integrated multiple copies of genes encoding enzymes of the res-
veratrol pathway using a Ty4 targeting EasyCloneMulti vector, they obtained 8 to 11 integrated
copies [
47]. Eventually, Kildegaardet al. in their study of the malonylCoA pathway for 3HP
production, reported 3 to 4 integrated copies of two genes of that pathway using a Ty4 target-
ing EasyCloneMulti vector [Kildegaard et al, submitted].
Interestingly, depending on the Ty family targeted, different ranges of expression levels
were achieved. This offers the unique possibility of easy and fast balancing of vector-borne
gene expression by screening a small number of clones and identifying the best producer. This
can be of great interest to metabolic engineers aiming at balancing expression levels of multi-
step metabolic pathways. As was observed in our proof of concept study for 3HP production,
transformation efficiency for the multi-integrative vectors was reduced compared to a single
integrative one. This is somewhat expected due to the metabolic perturbation that may result
from the overexpression of metabolic genes. In order to obtain a sizeable pool of transformants
to screen from, increasing the amount of transformed linear DNA can be considered. Addi-
tionally, uncoupling transformation and integration events from expression of the borne gene
of interest, by e.g. using inducible promoters, may improve transformation efficiency. One
could then think of combining the EasyCloneMulti system with a set of user-defined promoters
of different strengths, in a similar fashion to previous promoter studies [
48,49], and generate
combinatorial libraries of several genes with a broad range of expression levels. Associated to
an easy screening method and combined with systems biology tools, this may contribute to
understanding intrinsic control of multi-step metabolic pathways and constructing improved
production strains.
As Ty sequences have been identified in a number of industrial yeast strains, it is likely that
EasyCloneMulti vectors can be applied to industrial strain genetic engineering [
50]. In fact, Sto-
vicek et al. successfully integrated in the genome of the industrial strains Ethanol Red and
CLIB382, and in multiple copies, two metabolic genes for xylose consumption using an EasyClo-
neMulti type of vector targeting Ty2 loci [31]. Furthermore, yeast production strains with genes
integrated at Ty sequences have been reported for the industrial production of resveratrol [10],
EasyCloneMulti: Vectors for Multiple Genomic Integrations in Yeast

confirming the possibility of implementing our EasyCloneMulti vector set in industrial applica-
tions for biosustainable metabolite production. In the rare case where a specific yeast strain
would be devoid of Ty sequences, other repeated DNA sequences such as ribosomal DNA
sequences may be considered as targets for multiple integrations, as previously reported [
30, 51].
In conclusion, EasyCloneMulti vectors complement the EasyClone and EasyClone 2.0 vec-
tor collections and provide a ready-to-clone and convenient solution for multiple integrations
into S. cerevisiae genome. We believe that the EasyCloneMulti vector set is of high interest for
balancing gene expression in metabolic pathways, and for industrial yeast metabolic engineer-
ing applications. Vectors will be deposited and be available at Addgene (www.addgene.org).

Ty4, Kl.URA3/C3-deg), or pCfB319 (episomal, 2micron,URA3). A) Sixteen isolates from each of
the six strains were inoculated from solid drop out medium without uracil (transformation plate)
into liquid drop out medium without uracil. The experiment was then realized in 96 deep well-
plates, with 800μL as cultivation volume. After 24h of cultivation, OD
600 was measured and a
new 96 deep-well-plate containing fresh liquid drop out medium without uracil was inoculated
at an initial OD600 of 0.05. After 48h of cultivation, OD600 and green fluorescence (λExcitation
485nm, λEmission 515nm) were measured for each cultivation plate on a microtiter plate reader
BioTek Synergy MX (BioTek). Results are reported as specific fluorescence which is obtained by
dividing the measured fluorescence by the measured OD600.O D600 and specific fluorescence
were followed for four subsequent cultivations. B) In this table, the specific fluorescence relative
to the initial specific fluorescence measured in the first cultivation, cultivation 1, is compared for
the sixteen isolates of each strain at two time points: 16 generations (cultivation 2) or 32 genera-
tions (cultivation 4). Percent of isolates characterized by a specific fluorescence above 75%,
between 50 and 75% or below 50% of the initial specific fluorescence measured in cultivation 1 is
reported for the abovementioned time points, as a function of the type of EasyCloneMulti vector.

S5 Table. Putative insertion loci identified from isolate sequencing.Candidate insertion loci
were identified by finding reads mapped to a specific chromosomal location whose paired end
partner read mapped to a unique region (i.e. a region with no similarity to the yeast genome)
on the vector insert. The table indicates all loci identified using this approach, but the candidate
loci that either have narrow mapped read stacks or low coverage are not likely to be real inser-
tion loci. The percentage of mapped reads indicates what percentage of reads identified as map-
ping to candidate insertion loci map to the particular location specified in the table.
