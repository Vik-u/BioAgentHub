Abstract
Background Bioconversion of methanol derived from CO2 reduction into value-added chemicals provides a unique 
approach for mitigating global warming and reducing fossil fuels dependence. Production of 3-hydroxypropionic 
acid (3-HP), a key building block for the development of biobased products such as acrylates and 1,3-propanediol, 
has been successfully achieved using methanol as the sole carbon and energy source in the methylotrophic 
yeast Komagataella phaffii (syn. Pichia pastoris). However, challenges remain in meeting commercially relevant 
concentrations, yields and productivities of 3-HP , prompting further strain optimization. In the present study, we have 
combined metabolic engineering strategies aiming at increasing metabolic precursors supply and redirecting carbon 
flux towards 3-HP production.
Results A combinatorial metabolic engineering strategy targeting precursors supply and 3-HP export was applied 
to the original 3-HP producing K. phaffii strain harboring the synthetic β-alanine pathway and a mutated NADP-
dependent formate dehydrogenase from Pseudomonas sp. 101 (PseFDH(V9)). To do so, several genes encoding 
enzymes catalyzing reactions immediately upstream of the β-alanine pathway were overexpressed to enhance 
precursors availability. However, only the overexpression of the pyruvate carboxylase PYC2 gene significantly 
increased the 3-HP yield on biomass (YP/X) in small-scale cultivations. Co-overexpression of PYC2 and the lactate 
permeases ESBP6 and JEN1 genes led to a 55% improvement in 3-HP titer and product yield in methanol deep-well 
plate cultures compared to the reference strain, mostly due to Esbp6 activity, proving its effectiveness as a 3-HP 
transporter. Deletion of the native formate dehydrogenase gene FDH1 did not increase methanol flux entering 
the assimilatory pathway. Instead, knockout strains showed severe growth defects due to toxic intermediates 
accumulation. Co-expression of the PseFDH(V9) encoding gene in these strains failed to compensate for the loss of 
the native FDH. The strain combining PYC2, ESBP6, and JEN1 overexpression was further tested in fed-batch cultures 
at pH 5, achieving a 3-HP concentration of 27.0 g l− 1, with a product yield of 0.19 g g− 1, and a volumetric productivity 
of 0.56 g l− 1 h− 1 for the methanol feeding phase of the cultivations. These results represent a 42% increase in final 
concentration and over 20% improvement in volumetric productivity compared to the original 3-HP-producing 
strain. Furthermore, bioreactor-scale cultivations at pH 3.5 revealed increased robustness of the strains overexpressing 
monocarboxylate transporters.

Background
The valorization of industrial CO 2 effluents has the 
potential to play a crucial role in addressing climate cri -
sis and advancing towards a more sustainable produc -
tion cycle. CO2 can be reduced with hydrogen to produce 
methanol, a sustainable carbon and energy source [ 1, 2]. 
Bioconversion of this low-cost one-carbon (C1) feed -
stock into valuable chemicals not only has the potential 
to reduce reliance on fossil fuels but also to help miti -
gate climate change, representing a promising approach 
within the framework of a circular economy [3–5].
3-Hydroxypropionic (3-HP) acid is a key building block 
that can be used as a precursor to produce several valu -
able chemicals, including acrylates, 1,3-propanediol, pro -
piolactone, malonic acid, and hydroxyamides. Moreover, 
as a homopolymer or when integrated into other biopoly-
mers, 3-HP has the potential to replace petrochemistry-
based polymers, offering a sustainable alternative for the 
synthesis of advanced materials [ 6, 7]. In 2004, the US 
Department of Energy (DOE) ranked this C3 organic 
acid in a significant third position among the top twelve 
biobased value-added chemicals [ 8]. An updated version 
of this ranking was published six years later, where 3-HP 
was included again [ 9]. Despite its potential, chemical 
synthesis of 3-HP faces several challenges, including the 
high cost of raw materials, low yields, complex reaction 
steps, and the involvement of toxic, noxious, or carcino -
genic compounds [10]. Several microorganisms naturally 
synthesize 3-HP , either as an intermediate or as a prod -
uct, through different metabolic pathways and diverse 
substrates such as glycerol, glucose, CO 2 or uracil. The 
most studied pathways include the coenzyme B 12-depen-
dent glycerol pathways (both CoA-dependent and CoA-
independent) and the malonyl-CoA reductase pathway, 
which is part of the 3-hydroxypropionate/malyl-CoA 
and 3-hydroxypropionate/4-hydroxybutyrate autotrophic 
cycles [11, 12]. However, significant byproduct formation 
and suboptimal yields and productivities still hinder the 
commercial viability of biological 3-HP production. To 
overcome these issues, metabolic engineering of both 
natural and non-natural producers has been investigated.
Among bacterial hosts, Escherichia coli  and Klebsiella 
pneumoniae have been the most widely used for 3-HP 
production via the glycerol pathway [ 13]. These bac -
teria have produced by far the highest reported 3-HP 
titers (76.2 and 102.6  g l − 1, respectively) and volumet -
ric productivities (1.89 and 1.07  g l − 1 h − 1, respectively) 
[14, 15]. Several yeast species have also been engineered 
to produce 3-HP , primarily through the introduction of 
the malonyl-CoA reductase pathway and the synthetic 
β-alanine pathway [ 16]. The bifunctional malonyl-CoA 
reductase from Chloroflexus aurantiacus  (MCR Ca) has 
been successfully expressed in Saccharomyces cerevi -
siae [ 17, 18], Schizosaccharomyces pombe  [ 19, 20], and 
Komagataella phaffii  (syn. Pichia pastoris ), achieving 
the highest volumetric productivity reported so far in 
yeast (0.712  g l − 1 h − 1) [ 21]. Additionally, the synthetic 
β-alanine pathway has been engineered into S. cerevisiae 
[22, 23], and subsequent bioprocess optimization enabled 
a final concentration of 27 g l − 1, with a product yield on 
glucose of 0.26  g g − 1 [ 24]. Recently, the β-alanine path -
way has been targeted to mitochondria in S. cerevisiae , 
leading to higher 3-HP production compared to the cyto-
plasmic pathway [25]. Interestingly, yeasts can withstand 
a pH as low as 3 [26, 27], which is more than 1 unit below 
the pKa of 3-HP (4.51) [ 28]. In these circumstances, the 
undissociated form of 3-HP is the most abundant frac -
tion in the solution, lowering costs of downstream pro -
cessing [ 29]. Therefore, yeasts stand as promising cell 
factories for 3-HP production.
Of particular interest is the methylotrophic yeast K. 
phaffii, which shows a distinct ability to grow on metha -
nol as the sole carbon and energy source, making it an 
attractive cell factory to produce high-value-added 
chemicals from this low-cost and renewable substrate 
[30]. Moreover, methanol is a highly reduced carbon 
source (γ = 6.0), whose oxidation provides more redox 
equivalents than most sugars, potentially becoming a 
competitive substrate for the synthesis of highly reduced 
compounds such as terpenoids [ 31, 32], and fatty acids 
and their derivatives [ 33, 34]. In addition, recent studies 
have demonstrated K. phaffii ’s ability to produce differ -
ent organic acids from methanol as sole carbon source, 
including malic acid [35], D-lactic acid [36], itaconic acid 
[37], and 3-HP [ 38]. Recently, we have successfully engi -
neered K. phaffii for 3-HP production from methanol by 
implementing the β-alanine pathway [ 39]. Specifically, 
we expressed the genes coding for a β-alanine-pyruvate 
aminotransferase from Bacillus cereus  (BAPAT Bc), a 
3-hydroxypropionate dehydrogenase from E. coli  (YDF -
GEc), and two copies of an aspartate-1-decarboxylase 
from Tribolium castaneum (PANDTc), obtaining a 3-HP-
producing base strain (PpCβ21) that produced up to 
21.4  g l− 1 of 3-HP in methanol fed-batch cultures, with 
a yield of 0.15  g g − 1 and a volumetric productivity of 
0.48 g l− 1 h− 1. Additional redox engineering of this strain 
Conclusions Our results point out the potential of lactate transporters to efficiently drive 3-HP export in K. phaffii, 
leading to higher titers, yields, and productivities, even at lower pH conditions.

to increase NADPH availability further improved both 
methanol consumption (q S) and specific productivity 
(qP) rates in strain PpCβ21-P . Despite our demonstra -
tion of the potential of K. phaffii  for 3-HP production 
from renewable C1 feedstocks, the obtained yield and 
productivity fell short of the commercially feasible met -
rics. Typically, minimum values of 0.5 g g − 1 and 2.5 g l − 1 
h− 1, respectively, are required to develop an economically 
viable bioprocess for carboxylic acid production [8, 40].
Besides increasing NADPH availability, other strate -
gies have been investigated to improve 3-HP yield in 
engineered yeast harboring the β-alanine pathway. In 
particular, improvement of the supply of the β-alanine 
pathway’s metabolic precursors in S. cerevisiae  has been 
demonstrated to have a significant positive impact on 
3-HP production [23]. This was achieved by overexpress -
ing the AAT2, PYC1 and PYC2 genes, encoding enzymes 
catalyzing the conversion of pyruvate into aspartate, the 
precursor of this synthetic pathway.
Another engineering strategy commonly used in yeast/
fungi to enhance organic acid production is the over -
expression of genes encoding membrane transporters 
to facilitate final product export [ 41, 42]. To date, no 
3-HP-specific transporters have been identified in yeast. 
However, given that lactate and 3-HP are structural iso -
mers, some studies have focused on existing lactate 
transporters as potential candidates for 3-HP export. 
In S. cerevisiae , two monocarboxylate permeases have 
been identified, Esbp6 [ 43] and Jen1 [ 44]. Esbp6, also 
known as Mch3, may play a role in acid-stress adapta -
tion responses, as well as in functions related to cell wall 
integrity maintenance. K. phaffii’s genome has a potential 
ORF annotated as ESBP6 (GenBank accession number 
CAH2449939). However, it has not been experimen -
tally characterized, and its function remains unknown. 
Overexpression of ESBP6 in the plasma membrane of 
an engineered S. cerevisiae  strain improved lactic acid 
production by 20% under non-neutralizing conditions, 
probably due to enhanced lactic acid tolerance [45]. Simi-
larly, Qin et al. [46] demonstrated that deleting ESBP6 in 
a wild-type strain cultivated in the presence of 50  g l − 1 
3-HP at pH 3.5 inhibited growth considerably, whereas 
ESBP6 overexpression significantly increased cell tol -
erance to 3-HP compared to the wild-type strain. The 
lactate-proton symporter Jen1 can mediate the elec -
troneutral transport of lactic acid when it accumulates 
inside the cell [ 29]. In fact, overexpression of Jen1 has 
been shown to improve lactic acid production in recom -
binant S. cerevisiae  strains [ 47–50]. This effect has also 
been observed in the non-conventional yeast K. phaffii by 
Lima et al. [ 51], who identified a JEN1 ortholog in the K. 
phaffii genome showing 50.19% identity to the S. cerevisi-
ae’s JEN1 gene. Overexpression of the gene encoding this 
putative lactate transporter in a recombinant K. phaffii

strain producing L-lactic acid from glycerol resulted in 
a 46% increase in lactate yield compared to the control 
strain.
In this study, we further optimized our previously 
developed 3-HP-producing strains [ 39] by implementing 
a range of metabolic engineering strategies. First, efforts 
were focused on a “push” strategy aiming at increasing 
the supply of intermediates of the β-alanine pathway, i.e. 
oxaloacetate and aspartate, and to further channel flux 
through the heterologous NADP-dependent formate 
dehydrogenase by deleting the FDH1 gene encoding the 
endogenous NAD-dependent analogous enzyme. Sec -
ond, using a “pull” strategy, we sought to promote 3-HP 
export by overexpressing the endogenous JEN1 gene and 
the ESBP6 gene from S. cerevisiae . Notably, the latter 
strategy resulted in a substantial increase in 3-HP pro -
ductivity. Both strategies were tested individually and in a 
combined way. Moreover, we characterized the resulting 
strains at pH 3.5, an industrially relevant condition for 
carboxylic acid production.
Materials and methods
Plasmid and strain construction
The parental strains K. phaffii  PpCβ21 and PpCβ21-P 
[39] were used as platform chassis to construct a new 
generation of strains with optimized metabolic pathway 
towards 3-HP production and exportation. Homology-
directed integrations of heterologous genes and knockout 
of the endogenous FDH1 coding sequence were per -
formed using CRISPR/Cas9 technology. Plasmids and 
strains constructed in this study are listed in Table 1. Fur-
ther description of the molecular biology workflow fol -
lowed in this study can be found in Additional file 1.
Following the CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genome edit -
ing protocol in K. phaffii, two sgRNAs were individually 
designed and generated for each locus to target (Table  2) 
and inserted into the BB3cN_p GAP_23*_pLAT1_Cas9 
plasmid from the CRIS Pi kit [ 52]. Potential sgRNA 
candidates binding target regions within the selected 
loci were assessed with CHOPCHOP [ 53], as described 
in Àvila-Cabré et al. [ 39]. Shortly, the highest-scoring 
protospacers (20-nucleotide target sites followed by a 
PAM sequence) identified by CHOPCHOP were chosen 
for sgRNAs design. Additionally, two secondary criteria 
were considered: avoiding the presence of four consecu -
tive thymine bases (TTTT) and aiming for a GC content 
of 20–80% (excluding the PAM sequence), as outlined by 
Yang et al. [54].
Electrocompetent K. phaffii  cells were prepared as 
described elsewhere [ 55]. Co-transformation of the 
donor DNA template and the BB3 plasmid harboring the 
sgRNA and a human codon optimized Cas9 for episomal 
expression in K. phaffii  was performed as described in 
Gassler et al. [52].
Most of the genomic regions for CRISPR/Cas9-medi -
ated integration of expression cassettes were selected 
based on previous studies showing stable expression and 
unaffected cell fitness [ 56, 57], focusing on intergenic 
regions such as upstream or downstream of promoters or 
terminators, respectively (Table  2). The AAT2 and Asp -
DHSpe expression cassettes were individually targeted 
into an intergenic region located 250-bp upstream of 
PENO1 (PP7435_Chr3-1154). PYC2 expression unit was 
located 600-bp downstream of AOX1tt (PP7435_Chr4-
0131). JEN1 and ESBP6Sc heterologous cassettes were ini-
tially targeted right after GUT1tt (PP7435_Chr4-0174). 
However, no positive transformants were found after 
several attempts. Alternatively, these expression cas -
settes were individually targeted to PP7435_Chr3-1154 
in strains that did not harbor AAT2/AspDHSpe overex -
pression. When co-expressing both monocarboxylate 
permeases, ESBP6Sc was targeted to PP7435_Chr3-1154, 
while JEN1 was located into an intergenic region 1000-
bp upstream of P OPT1−1 (PP7435_Chr4-1011). Finally, 
the FDH(V9) Pse expression cassette was targeted within 
50-bp upstream of P AOX1 (PP7435_Chr4-0130) [ 39].

Correct genomic insertions from three individual trans -
formants from each strain were checked at both 5’ and 3’ 
ends of the integrated donor DNA by Sanger sequencing.
The K. phaffii FDH1  gene (PP7435_Chr3-0238) was 
disrupted using insertions or deletions (InDel) mutations 
by expressing a BB3 vector containing both a sgRNA and 
Cas9. The resulting double-strand break (DSB) in the 
genomic DNA occurred 25–32 base pairs from the FDH1 
start, depending on the specific sgRNA used (Table  2). 
The disrupted locus was verified by Sanger sequencing. 
The sequencing was performed by the Genomics and 
Bioinformatics Service of the Universitat Autònoma de 
Barcelona.
Recombinant yeast strains were grown at 30 °C in YPD-
agar plates (1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, 2% dextrose 
and 15 g l − 1 agar). The medium was supplemented with 
Nourseothricin (200  µg ml − 1 working concentration for 
K. phaffii) from Dismed S.A. (Asturias, Spain).
Screening in deep-well plates
Three clones of every K. phaffii  strain were inoculated 
into 50-ml falcon tubes containing 5 ml of YPG medium 
(1% yeast extract, 2% peptone and 1% v/v glycerol) and 
grown overnight at 30  °C and 180  rpm in an incubator 
shaker Multitron Standard from Infors HT (Bottmingen, 
Switzerland) with a 2.5 cm orbit. Overnight cultures were 
inoculated in triplicate at a starting OD 600 of 0.1 into 
24-deep-well plates containing 2 ml of buffered minimal 
methanol medium (BMM; 100 mM potassium phosphate 
buffer pH 6, 1.34% yeast nitrogen base (YNB), 0.4 mg l − 1 
biotin and 0.5% v/v pure methanol). Cultures were incu -
bated at 25 °C and 220 rpm in the same incubator shaker. 
The deep-well plates were placed on a platform with a 
slope of 20° to improve aeration. Relative humidity (rh) 
in the incubation chamber was fixed to 80%. After 24 h, 
1% v/v pure methanol pulse (7.9 g l − 1) was added to each 
well. Cultures were grown for 48  h to ensure full con -
sumption of the substrate.
At the end of the culture, the endpoint OD 600 of each 
well was measured in duplicate with a 96-well microtiter 
plate using a Multiskan FC Microplate Photometer from 
Thermo Fisher Scientific (Waltham, MA, USA). Thereaf -
ter, culture samples were collected into 2-ml microcen -
trifuge tubes and centrifuged at 13,400  rpm for 5  min 
using a MiniSpin from Eppendorf (Hamburg, Germany). 
Supernatant was then filtered with a 0.2-µm pore size 
single-use syringe filter (SLLGX13NK) from Merck Mil -
lipore (Burlington, MA, USA). 3-HP and methanol were 
quantified from the filtered supernatant by HPLC analy -
sis. Raw datasets of small-scale cultivations are provided 
in Additional file 2.
Bioreactor cultivations
For the bioreactor cultivations, the batch medium con -
sisted of 40  g l − 1 glycerol, 1.8  g l − 1 citric acid, 0.02  g 
l− 1 CaCl 2·2H2O, 12.6  g l − 1 (NH 4)2HPO4, 0.5  g l − 1 
MgSO4·7H2O, 0.9  g l − 1 KCl, 50  µl antifoam Glanapon 
2000 kz (Bussetti and Co GmbH, Vienna, Austria), 0.4 
mg l− 1 biotin, 2 ml l − 1 of vitamin stock solution [ 58], and 
5 ml l− 1 of PTM1 trace salts [59]. The pH was adjusted to 
5 using 5 M HCl. The vitamins, the biotin and the trace 
salts were filter-sterilized and added to the bioreactors 
after cooling down.
Fed-batch cultures were performed in duplicate using 
a DASGIP Parallel Bioreactor System from Eppendorf 
(Hamburg, Germany). Reactors were inoculated at a 
starting OD 600 equal to 1, and the initial volume was 
500 ml. The pH was controlled at 5 throughout the cul -
ture using 15% ammonia. The temperature was set to 
28 °C during the batch phase. The inlet gas was fed into 
the reactors at an aeration rate of 1 vvm (0.5  l min − 1). 
The dissolved oxygen (DO) was set to 30%. The agitation 
gradually increased from 400 to 1,000  rpm to maintain 
DO set point. When agitation reached 1,000  rpm, pure 
oxygen was mixed with air in the inlet gas to maintain 
a pO 2 above 30%, while maintaining an aeration rate of 
0.5 l min− 1. For the fed-batch phase, the temperature was 
set to 25  °C. Pure methanol (ρ = 792  g l− 1) and feeding 
salts were added separately to the culture to avoid precip-
itation. The feeding salts medium composition was 0.35 g 
l− 1 CaCl 2·2H2O, 10  g l − 1 KCl, 6.45  g l − 1 MgSO 4·7H2O, 
200  µl antifoam Glanapon 2000 kz, 1.2 mg l − 1 biotin, 6 
ml l− 1 of vitamin stock solution, and 15 ml l − 1 of PTM1 
trace salts. This media was prepared at 2× concentration 
since pure methanol was used. The vitamins, the biotin, 
and the trace salts were filter-sterilized and added to this 
final feeding solution.
At the end of the glycerol batch phase (glycerol deple -
tion indicated by spike in the dissolved oxygen tension 
and verified by HPLC at the start of the methanol feed 
phase), two consecutive pulses of pure methanol (1 and 
2  g l− 1, respectively) were added to the reactors. Once 
methanol was fully depleted, the cultures were fed with 
a constant methanol feed (F o) to complete the transi -
tion phase. For cultivations at pH 3.5, the pH set point 
was adjusted from 5 to 3.5 at the start of the second stage 
of the transition phase (i.e. during the constant metha -
nol feed), allowing the pH to gradually decrease over 
the following hours (see Additional file 3). After that, 
the feeding medium was added to the bioreactors using 
a pre-programmed exponential feeding strategy for con -
trolled specific growth rate described in the following 
equation:

where growth rate (µ) was set to 0.03 h − 1, initial biomass 
concentration (X 0) was fixed at 22  g l − 1, biomass yield 
(YX/S) was 0.273 g g− 1, and initial substrate concentration 
(So) was 792 g l− 1.
The reactors were sampled during 39  h to measure 
OD600, biomass dry cell weight (DCW), and superna -
tant metabolites. DCW was determined gravimetrically 
in triplicate using paper filters. A volume of 10  ml of a 
9  g l− 1 NaCl solution was used to wet the pre-weighed 
glass microfiber filters (APFF04700) from Merck Milli -
pore (Burlington, MA, USA) before filtering 2 ml of cul -
ture for each triplicate. Filters were subsequently washed 
using the same volume of NaCl solution, dried for 24  h 
at 105 °C, and weighed to calculate the DCW. To quan -
tify glycerol, methanol and 3-HP , 2 ml of culture samples 
were centrifuged 5 min at 13,400 rpm using a MiniSpin 
(Eppendorf, Germany), and the supernatant was filtered 
with a 0.2-µm pore size single-use syringe filter (SLL -
GX13NK, Merck Millipore).
Raw datasets and calculations of growth and 3-HP pro -
duction parameters of bioreactor cultivations are shown 
in Additional file 4.
Analytical methods and data processing
Methanol and 3-HP were quantified using an HPLC 
Ultimate3000 from Dionex (Thermo Fischer Scientific, 
Waltham, MA, USA) equipped with an ionic exchange 
column ICSep ICE-COREGEL 87H3 from Transgenomic 
(Omaha, NE, USA) and a Refractive Index detector. The 
mobile phase consisted of 6 mM sulphuric acid with a 
flow rate of 0.6 ml min− 1.
The OD600 measurements were performed in triplicate 
using a Lange DR 3900 spectrophotometer from Hach 
(Loveland, CO, USA). Analytical replicates were aver -
aged, and the standard deviation (SD) was calculated 
for each OD 600 determination. Biomass (dry cell weight, 
DCW) was determined in triplicate for three samples 
throughout the fed-batch. For the rest of the samples, the 
biomass DCW values were calculated from the measured 
OD600 values, based on the calibration curve made for 
the given strain.
Offline and online state variables —such as biomass 
(X), substrate (S), product (P), flow rate (F), and initial 
volume (Vo)— were recorded during the fed-batch phase 
of the bioreactor-scale experiments (see Additional files 
3 and 4). These variables were used to calculate derived 
metrics, including growth rate (µ), q-rates, and yields, 
following the methodology described elsewhere [ 39]. For 
mass balance verification, the elemental biomass compo -
sition CH 1.88O0.63N0.20S0.004 was assumed, based on cells 
growing on methanol at µ = 0.035  h− 1 [ 60]. Carbon and 
electron balances were satisfied with a deviation of less 
than 7%. A statistical χ2 consistency test, based on the 
h-index, was applied to the measured data balances [ 61, 
62], following the detailed method described by Ponte et 
al. [ 63]. The consistency tests passed with a confidence 
level of 95%, confirming no major measurement errors.
Computational methods
The genome-scale metabolic model iMT1026 v3.0 of K. 
phaffii [ 60] was employed to calculate the theoretical 
maximum 3-HP yield (Υ 3−HP max ) achievable on metha -
nol via the β-alanine pathway under different growth 
conditions. This model was expanded to include 3-HP 
production and excretion reactions. Simulations were 
constrained using experimental values obtained for 
the key physiological macroscopic parameters µ and 
qS, derived from methanol fed-batch cultivations. Spe -
cifically, µ was set to 0.028 h − 1 and q S was 0.109 g MetOH 
gDCW
−1 h − 1 (Table  3). Additionally, the Υ 3−HP max  was 
calculated under non-growth conditions (µ = 0 h− 1). The 
non-growth associated maintenance energy (NGAME) 
parameter for methanol growth from Tomàs-Gamisans 
et al. [ 60] was also applied as a constraint. Flux Balance 
Analysis (FBA) was performed in COBRA Toolbox v3.0 
[64] with Matlab R2021a (Mathworks, Inc., Natick, MA, 
USA) to maximize specific 3-HP productivity (q P) as the 
objective function. Finally, q P values resulting from the 
FBA, together with the experimental q S, were used to 
determine the Υ3−HP max.

Results and discussion
Engineering precursor supply of the β-alanine pathway for 
3-HP production
To enhance pyruvate flux to aspartate, the precursor of 
the β-alanine pathway, we individually overexpressed 
native genes encoding the pyruvate carboxylase iso -
form 2 ( PYC2), which catalyzes the ATP-dependent car -
boxylation of pyruvate to form OAA, and the cytosolic 
aspartate aminotransferase 2 ( AAT2), which enables 
the conversion of OAA to aspartate by transferring an 
amino group from glutamate (Fig.  1). These genes were 
overexpressed in the original strain PpCβ21 [ 39] by 
integrating a second copy of the corresponding cod -
ing sequence under the control of methanol-inducible 
promoters into the K. phaffii  genome. The expression 
of AAT2 in strain PpCβ21-A was driven by the strong 
dihydroxyacetone synthase 1 promoter (P DAS1), while 
PYC2 in strain PpCβ21-Y was expressed under the con -
trol of the medium-strength sedoheptulose bisphospha -
tase promoter (P SHB17) to avoid additional disturbances 
in the central metabolic node of pyruvate. Additionally, 
a highly active and stable NAD- or NADP-dependent 
aspartate dehydrogenase from Serratia proteamaculans  
(SpeAspDH) [ 65], which directly aminates OAA using 
ammonium as the amino donor, was tested as an alter -
native to K. phaffii AAT2 under PDAS1, resulting in strain 
PpCβ21-D strain (Fig. 1).
None of the individually overexpressed genes led to 
a significant improvement in final 3-HP concentra -
tion or yield on methanol (Y P/S) after 48  h of cultiva -
tion in 24-deep-well plates with BMM medium, except 
in the case of PYC2 overexpression (strain PpCβ21-Y),

are indicated with colored gears. While uncharged 3-HP (HOCH2CH2COOH) can passively diffuse across the plasma membrane, its anionic form (HOCH -
2CH2COO−) is hypothesized to require active transport via ABC transporters or permeases (i.e., Jen1 symporter). Dissociation of 3-HP in the cytosol re -
leases protons (H+), which are mainly extruded by H+-ATPases, maintaining pH balance and electrochemical potential across the membrane (Z∆pH) [70].

which resulted in a slight but statistically significant 
5.4% increment ( p = 0.03) in the 3HP yield on biomass 
(YP/X), increasing from 0.556 to 0.586  g l − 1 of 3-HP per 
OD600 unit compared to the reference strain (PpCb21). 
We hypothesize that the modest increase in 3-HP yields 
could be due to an insufficient ATP supply, as the carbox-
ylation of pyruvate by Pyc2 enzyme is ATP-dependent 
[66]. Additionally, bicarbonate, a co-substrate in this car -
boxylation reaction, might also become a rate-limiting 
factor in these strains [46, 67].
Neither AAT2 nor the S. proteamaculans  AspDH’s 
encoding gene overexpression did improve 3-HP produc-
tion, suggesting that the conversion of OAA into aspar -
tate may not be a rate-limiting step of the 3-HP pathway. 
These findings are consistent with those from a previ -
ous study involving a recombinant K. phaffii  strain that 
converted methanol into β-alanine, in which overexpres -
sion of either mitochondrial AAT1 or cytosolic AAT2 
did not significantly enhance β-alanine production [ 65]. 
Coherently, engineering the entire upstream module of 
the β-alanine pathway, i.e., co-overexpression of an addi -
tional copy of both PYC2 and AAT2, resulting in strain 
PpCβ21-YA, did not lead to significant improvements in 
YP/S and Y P/X compared to the PpCβ21-Y strain ( p = 0.58 
and 0.30, respectively).
Further engineering attempts to boost the precursors 
supply of the β-alanine pathway included the overexpres-
sion of a mutated NADP-dependent formate dehydro -
genase from Pseudomonas sp. 101, PseFDH(V9), aiming 
at enhancing NADPH supply of this pathway (Fig.  1). 
In a previous study, PseFDH(V9) overexpression in 
the PpCβ21 reference strain, generating the PpCβ21-P 
strain, resulted in a 14% and 10% increase in Y P/X and qP, 
respectively, as well as higher q s in methanol fed-batch 
cultivations, despite performing poorly in 24-deep-well 
plates [ 39]. Similarly, introduction of PseFDH(V9) cod -
ing gene under the control of the formate dehydrogenase 
promoter (P FDH1) in strain PpCβ21-YA, creating strain 
PpCβ21-YAP , decreased 3-HP titers by 11% ( p = 0.0017) 
in 24-deep-well plate cultures. Nevertheless, based on 
the observed enhanced performance of PpCβ21-P in 
bioreactor-scale cultivations, we considered this strain as 
a base strain for further metabolic engineering for 3-HP 
production.
Overexpression of monocarboxylate permeases encoding 
genes leads to higher 3-HP production
Overexpression of the genes encoding the synthetic 
β-alanine pathway combined with higher PYC2 expres -
sion levels may lead to 3-HP accumulation in the cyto -
sol. Owing to the near-neutral pH of the cytoplasm, 3-HP 
dissociates at the time of being produced, releasing pro -
tons and anions that poorly diffuse to extracellular space. 
Therefore, high intracellular 3-HP concentrations are 
likely to have a negative effect on cell metabolism.
To maintain intracellular pH (pHi) homeostasis, (an)
ions must be actively exported through different free 
energy-dependent processes such as: (i) primary trans -
port, via ATP-Binding Cassette (ABC) transporters and 
plasma membrane H+-ATPases, and (ii) secondary trans-
port, via transporters that use (electro-)chemical gradi -
ents as the driving force (e.g., Jen1 symporter) (Fig.  1). To 
date, no specific ABC transporters have been identified 
for 3-HP export.
In this study, the JEN1 and ESBP6 genes encoding 
putative monocarboxylate permeases were individually 
introduced into the PpCβ21-P strain [39], under the con-
trol of strong methanol-inducible promoters, resulting 
in strains PpCβ21-PJ and PpCβ21-PE, respectively. After 
48  h of cultivation in BMM medium in 24-deep-well 
plates, the highest concentration of 3-HP (1.40 ± 0.04  g 
l− 1) was obtained with strain PpCβ21-PE, resulting in 
a 44% increase in both titer and yields compared to the 
reference strain (Fig.  2). Notably, although PpCβ21-PE 
produced a higher amount of 3-HP than PpCβ21-P , both 
strains reached similar biomass levels. While the func -
tion of Esbp6 remains unknown [ 43], overexpression 
of its gene clearly enhanced 3-HP titer and yields in the 
recombinant strain PpCβ21-PE. These results are con -
sistent with findings from other studies [ 45, 46], where 
overexpression of ESBP6 improved yeast tolerance to 
acid-stressing conditions by reducing the intracellu -
lar 3-HP content, ultimately leading to a higher 3-HP 
production.
Conversely, overexpression of JEN1 in strain PpCβ21-PJ 
led to modest yet statistically significant increase of 8% in 
YP/S and 12% in Y P/X (p = 0.0008 and 0.044, respectively) 
compared to PpCβ21-P (Fig. 2), suggesting that Jen1 may 
have a lower export efficiency or capacity for 3-HP com -
pared to Esbp6. Further characterization of these trans -
porters could provide insights into the distinct effects on 
3-HP export observed in this study.
Interestingly, disruption of the endogenous JEN1 gene 
in a S. cerevisiae  3-HP-producing strain did not result 
in significant differences in the final 3-HP concentration 
compared to the parental strain, indicating that 3-HP 
efflux in the Δ jen1 strain remained functional [ 46]. Simi-
lar results were observed in S. cerevisiae  strains produc -
ing lactic acid, where Δ jen1 strains, and even isogenic 
yeast mutants Δ jen1Δady2, showed no differences in 
lactic acid production compared to the wild-type strain, 
suggesting the presence of other lactic acid exporters 
besides Jen1 [ 48, 49]. However, Lima et al. [ 51] reported 
a 46% increase in lactate yield when JEN1 was overex -
pressed in a recombinant K. phaffii  strain. Therefore, it 
is also plausible that the limited impact of JEN1 overex-
pression in strain PpCβ21-PJ might be due to the lower 
Page 10 of 16
Àvila-Cabré et al. Journal of Biological Engineering            (2025) 19:19 
affinity of this putative lactate transporter for 3-HP 
anions compared to lactate.
When JEN1 and ESBP6 were overexpressed simultane-
ously in strain PpCβ21-PEJ, the Y P/X was similar to that 
of ESBP6 overexpression alone, while the Y P/S showed 
a modest but significant increase of 6% ( p = 0.001), ris-
ing from 0.118 g g − 1 in strain PpCβ21-PE to 0.125 g g − 1 
(Fig. 2). These findings corroborate that the monocarbox-
ylate transporters, particularly Esbp6, effectively facili -
tated the export of 3-HP in K. phaffii.
Finally, to combine “push” and “pull” metabolic engi -
neering strategies, a second copy of the K. phaffii PYC2  
gene was integrated into the PpCβ21-PEJ genome, aiming 
to enhance metabolic precursors supply to the β-alanine 
pathway, resulting in strain PpCβ21-PEJY. However, this 
strain did not show significant changes in Y P/S and Y P/X 
compared to PpCβ21-PEJ when grown in 24-deep-well 
plates, with p-values of 0.34 and 0.31, respectively.
Overall, strains PpCβ21-PEJ and PpCβ21-PEJY showed 
the highest improvements in both Y P/S (53 and 55%, 
respectively) and YP/X (44 and 48%) compared to the ref -
erence strain PpCβ21-P (Fig.  2). As a result, both strains 
were taken for further evaluation in bioreactors.
Production of 3-HP in fed-batch cultivations
Strains PpCβ21-PEJ and PpCβ21-PEJY were further 
characterized in bioreactor-scale fed-batch cultivations 
consisting of three phases, i.e. an initial glycerol batch 
phase for biomass production (at the end of which glyc -
erol was depleted), followed by a transition phase includ -
ing two pulses of methanol and a 6-h constant methanol 
feed to adapt cells to methanolic conditions, and a final 
methanol-feed phase of about 40 h for 3-HP production 
using a pre-programmed exponential methanol feeding 
strategy at a growth rate of µ = 0.02  h− 1. At the start of 
the exponential methanol feed phase biomass and 3-HP 
levels were 21 g l − 1 and 5 g l − 1, respectively. Both strains 
reached a 3-HP concentration of 24.6  g l − 1 and nearly 
identical biomass levels (38.0 and 37.8 g l − 1, respectively) 
at the end of the process. Approximately 70 g of metha -
nol were added during the exponential feed phase of the 
respective cultivations, yielding a 3-HP yield on metha -
nol (YP/S) of 0.20 g g − 1 for both strains. Residual metha -
nol was not detected by HPLC analysis over the course of 
fermentation.
Given that both PpCβ21-PEJ and PpCβ21-PEJY strains 
performed similarly, one of them, strain PpCβ21-PEJY, 
was further tested in an analogous fed-batch cultivation 
process where the exponential methanol feed phase was 
adjusted at a µ SP = 0.03  h− 1, i.e. under the same condi -
tions used for characterization of our original strains 
[39]. During this phase, 3-HP augmented from 5 g l − 1 to 
27.0 ± 0.4  g l− 1. This represents a 42% increase in 3-HP 
titer compared to the parental strain PpCβ21-P cultivated

show the standard deviation. Significant differences between two groups are shown in the graph. Statistical analysis was conducted using a two-tailed 
unpaired Student’s t-test (*p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001)

Àvila-Cabré et al. Journal of Biological Engineering            (2025) 19:19 
under the same conditions (Fig.  3), which is consistent 
with results observed in small-scale experiments. These 
findings corroborate that lactate transporters, such as 
Esbp6 and Jen1, effectively facilitate 3-HP export.
Interestingly, strain PpCβ21-PEJY significantly 
decreased the CO 2 yield on methanol (Y CO2/S) from 
0.81 (strain PpCβ21-P) to 0.68 g CO2 g MetOH
−1 ( p = 0.01), 
while both Y P/S and Y X/S were significantly increased by 
27 and 19%, respectively (Table  3) (p = 0.04 and 0.01). A 
plausible explanation for this observation may be that 
the increased export of 3-HP caused by the overexpres -
sion of monocarboxylate permeases in the PpCβ21-PEJY 
strain, particularly Esbp6, seems to provoke a metabolic 
“pull” effect, draining a higher proportion of the incom -
ing methanol flux towards the assimilatory pathway, 
thereby favoring 3-HP production and biomass synthesis, 
while reducing CO2 generation through the dissimilatory 
methanol oxidation pathway.
A global Y P/S of 0.17  C-mol C-mol − 1 was obtained 
when considering both glycerol and methanol cultivation 
phases, while a Y P/S of 0.20  C-mol C-mol − 1 was calcu -
lated for the exponential methanol feeding phase. These 
yields are comparable to that of our top-performing K. 
phaffii strain engineered with the malonyl-CoA pathway 
for 3-HP production on glycerol (0.19  C-mol C-mol − 1) 
[21]. This finding is particularly significant considering 
that the Υ 3−HP max  achievable on methanol is consider -
ably lower than on C-sources such as glucose or glycerol, 
assuming all carbon is used solely for 3-HP synthesis 
(µ = 0  h− 1) [ 39]. The yield achieved here corresponds to 
70% of the Υ 3−HP max  under biomass-generating condi -
tions (0.27 g 3 − HP g MetOH
−1), i.e., reflecting the specific 
growth rate in our fed-batch experiments. Coherently, 
the Υ 3−HP max  is considerably higher when all carbon is 
exclusively channeled toward 3-HP production, with no 
biomass generation (0.78 g 3 − HP g MetOH
−1). Under these 
conditions, our experimental Y P/S represents 24.4% of 
this theoretical yield (see Materials and Methods sec -
tion). Strain PpCβ21-PEJY also demonstrated over a 20% 
improvement in volumetric productivity (Q P) compared 
to the reference strain (Table  3). Notably, a recent study 
using an extensively engineered K. phaffii strain harbor -
ing the malonyl-CoA reductase pathway has reported a

3-HP yield on methanol slightly higher than in our study 
(0.23 g g− 1) [38].
ESBP6 and JEN1 overexpression improves strain robustness 
at pH 3.5
Production of 3-HP at a low pH would allow for a more 
economical downstream processing, while reducing the 
risk of bacterial contamination. For instance, acidification 
is not needed for product recovery, effectively reducing 
costs. Furthermore, the amounts of base titrant required 
for neutralization during fermentation are greatly 
decreased at low pH, especially at industrial scale [8, 29].
To evaluate if differences exist in terms of tolerance to 
acidic conditions between the reference and the engi -
neered strains overexpressing the lactate transport -
ers encoding genes, production of 3-HP with strains 
PpCβ21-P and PpCβ21-PEJY was also tested in fed-batch 
cultures at pH 3.5, following the same strategy used for 
their initial characterization at pH 5.
Both PpCβ21-P and PpCβ21-PEJY strains produced 
3-HP at acidic pH, achieving final titers of 15.9 ± 0.1  g 
l− 1 and 24.2 ± 0.1 g l − 1, respectively (Fig.  4). As expected, 
strain PpCβ21-PEJY outperformed PpCβ21-P also at 
lower pH values. It is known that the energy demands 
of product export could hinder 3-HP production, par -
ticularly if the metabolic pathway involved has little to 
no net ATP yield [29]. Accordingly, the two tested strains 
produced lower 3-HP yields on methanol at pH 3.5 com -
pared to pH 5. However, while strain PpCβ21-P produced 
3-HP at a yield of 0.11 g g − 1 at pH 3.5, that is, a decrease 
of 26.7% compared to the yield at pH 5, strain PpCβ21-
PEJY achieved a 3-HP yield of 0.17 g g − 1 at low pH, that 
is, just 10.5% decrease from that obtained at pH 5 (0.19 g 
g− 1). These findings are coherent with earlier research on 
3-HP synthesis by S. cerevisiae  [23] and K. phaffii  culti-
vated under pH 3.5 conditions [68].
Under such acidic conditions, the undissociated frac -
tion of 3-HP is the predominant form in the solution. 
Particularly at high concentrations, uncharged 3-HP may 
cross the cell membrane through either simple diffusion 
or facilitated diffusion (via a channel or a permease). 
Once in the cytoplasm, neutral pH leads to dissociation 
of the 3-HP acid, releasing protons and anions (Fig.  1). 
The released protons may cause cytosolic acidification, 
which is harmful to the cell, whereas anions may trig -
ger the generation of free radicals, resulting in severe

oxidative stress [ 69, 70]. Hence, to maintain pH homeo -
stasis in the cytosol, active transport mechanisms, which 
require metabolic energy, allow for exporting these accu -
mulated (an)ions from the cytosol. The lower 3-HP yields 
achieved at pH 3.5 compared to pH 5 may reflect this 
increased ATP demand, underscoring ATP as a limiting 
factor in 3-HP production, consistent with previous find -
ings [ 68]. Nevertheless, overexpression of genes encod -
ing monocarboxylate transporters, especially ESBP6, 
effectively facilitated the export of anionic 3-HP in strain 
PpCβ21-PEJY. This could explain why the lower pH had a 
reduced effect on the 3-HP yield of strain PpCβ21-PEJY 
compared to strain PpCβ21-P .
Interestingly, both strains PpCβ21-P and PpCβ21-PEJY 
reached comparable levels of biomass concentration in 
cultures at the two pH values (Figs.  3 and 4), suggesting 
that acidic pH had no impact on biomass yields. How -
ever, studies investigating carboxylic acid production 
in S. cerevisiae  [ 71] and K. phaffii  [ 68] found contrast -
ing results, linking reduced biomass yields to increased 
maintenance-energy requirements in such conditions.
Knockout of the endogenous NAD-dependent formate 
dehydrogenase encoding gene (FDH1) to reduce carbon 
loss through the methanol dissimilatory pathway reveals 
limited efficiency of the heterologous NADP-dependent 
formate dehydrogenase
Despite the essential role of the methanol dissimilatory 
pathway in formaldehyde detoxification and energy pro -
duction, it leads to a huge loss of carbon atoms through 
CO2 release [72].
The combination of different metabolic engineer -
ing strategies described so far resulted in a shift of car -
bon flux from the dissimilatory pathway towards 3-HP 
production. Strain PpCβ21-PEJY, which overexpresses 
a mutated NADP-dependent formate dehydrogenase 
(PseFDH(V9)), two monocarboxylate transporters (Esbp6 
and Jen1), and pyruvate carboxylase isoform 2 (Pyc2), 
showed a 16% reduction in CO 2 yield and a 27% increase 
in 3-HP yield in methanol fed-batch cultures compared 
to the parental strain (Table 3).
To further decrease CO2 formation, the K. phaffii FDH1 
endogenous gene, encoding a NAD-dependent formate 
dehydrogenase, was deleted in strains PpCβ21-PEJ and 
PpCβ21-PEJY, resulting in strains PpCβ21-PEJΔ fdh1 and 
PpCβ21-PEJYΔfdh1, respectively. This strategy aimed to 
channel formate oxidation to CO 2 exclusively through 
the NADP-dependent PseFDH(V9) (Fig. 1).
Strains PpCβ21-PEJΔ fdh1 and PpCβ21-PEJYΔ fdh1 
were cultivated in triplicate alongside their parental 
strains in 24-deep-well plates containing BMM medium. 
Both 3-HP production and cell growth were drasti -
cally reduced by over 90% compared to their respective 
parental strains (see Additional file 2). This suggests that 
NADH generated from dissimilated formaldehyde via 
FLD was not sufficient to make up for the loss of NADH 
(and consequently, ATP) typically produced by native 
FDH, leading to an energy imbalance and suboptimal 
growth on methanol. Notably, around 1  g l − 1 of formic 
acid (FA) accumulated at the end of the cultivation, indi -
cating that PseFDH(V9) activity alone was not enough to 
fully oxidize FA to CO 2, creating a bottleneck in the dis -
similatory pathway. The accumulation of toxic interme -
diates, such as FA (and formaldehyde), likely contributed 
to the impaired growth observed, also supporting the 
proposed physiological role of FDH in formate detoxifi -
cation rather than in energy production [ 73]. Moreover, 
partial blocking of the dissimilatory pathway also led to 
up to 4.3 g l− 1 of residual methanol, suggesting additional 
metabolic bottlenecks downstream the methanol assimi -
latory pathway.
Similar challenges were reported by Guo et al. [ 35] 
when the methanol dissimilation pathway was completely 
blocked through FDH deletion in a K. phaffii strain engi-
neered to produce malic acid from methanol. In contrast, 
a recent study found no significant growth differences 
between a K. phaffii GS115 strain and an FDH-deficient 
GS115 strain grown on 1% YPM, suggesting context-
dependent effects of FDH deletion on methanol metab -
olism. Moreover, comparative transcriptomic analysis 
revealed that the impact of FDH deletion was less pro -
nounced than that caused by the deletion of other genes 
involved in the methanol dissimilatory pathway ( FLD, 
FGH) [74].
Conclusions
In this study, we enhanced the performance of our pre -
viously developed 3-HP-producing strains through sev -
eral metabolic engineering strategies focusing on the 
improvement of yields and productivities. These strate -
gies included: (i) overexpressing the upstream module of 
the β-alanine pathway, (ii) partially blocking the metha -
nol dissimilation pathway, and (iii) reducing intracel -
lular 3-HP accumulation. To our knowledge, this is the 
first time the S. cerevisiae ’s gene encoding the lactate 
transporter Esbp6 has been expressed in K. phaffii, prov-
ing its effectiveness in facilitating 3-HP export. Overall, 
co-overexpression of ESBP6 and JEN1, encoding two 
lactate transporters, along with PYC2 to enhance oxalo -
acetate supply, led to a total 3-HP concentration of 27.0 g 
l− 1, with a product yield of 0.19  g g − 1 and a volumetric 
productivity of 0.56 g l − 1 h− 1 for the exponential metha -
nol feeding phase. However, deleting FDH1 in K. phaffii 
impaired growth, probably due to an energy imbalance or 
poor performance of the heterologous PseFDH(V9).
Notably, we further demonstrated 3-HP production 
under industrially relevant cultivation conditions, spe -
cifically at a low pH of 3.5, and highlighted the beneficial

Àvila-Cabré et al. Journal of Biological Engineering            (2025) 19:19 
effects of overexpressing genes encoding lactate trans -
porters, such as Esbp6 and Jen1, to support 3-HP pro -
duction at pH 3.5.
While this work highlights the potential of using effi -
cient monocarboxylate transporters to achieve high pro -
ductivities, yields, and titers of the target carboxylic acid, 
further improvements are needed to reach industrially 
relevant metrics. Furthermore, a deeper understanding of 
the export mechanisms, substrate specificity, and regula -
tion of carboxylate transporters is crucial for the success-
ful development of microbial cell factories for industrial 
carboxylic acid production, regardless of the pH condi -
tions used in the fermentation processes.
Advancements in the field of metabolic engineering 
[75] are paving the way for K. phaffii to emerge as a rel -
evant industrial cell factory for 3-HP production from 
methanol. Improving the efficiency of methanol assimi -
lation and metabolic network-wide analysis to inves -
tigate the optimality of energy and redox metabolism 
under 3-HP overproducing conditions should guide the 
development of efficient chassis strains, taking also into 
account pathway compartmentalization [25, 76].
