ABSTRACT Acetyl coenzyme A (acetyl-CoA) carboxylase (ACCase) plays a central role in carbon metabolism and has been the site
of action for the development of therapeutics or herbicides, as its product, malonyl-CoA, is a precursor for production of fatty
acids and other compounds. Control of Acc1 activity in the yeastSaccharomyces cerevisiaeoccurs mainly at two levels, i.e., regu-
lation of transcription and repression by Snf1 protein kinase at the protein level. Here, we demonstrate a strategy for improving
the activity of ACCase inS. cerevisiaeby abolishing posttranslational regulation of Acc1 via site-directed mutagenesis. It was
found that introduction of two site mutations in Acc1, Ser659 and Ser1157, resulted in an enhanced activity of Acc1 and in-
creased total fatty acid content. As Snf1 regulation of Acc1 is particularly active under glucose-limited conditions, we evaluated
the effect of the two site mutations in chemostat cultures. Finally, we showed that our modiﬁcations of Acc1 could enhance the
supply of malonyl-CoA and therefore successfully increase the production of two industrially important products derived from
malonyl-CoA, fatty acid ethyl esters and 3-hydroxypropionic acid.
IMPORTANCE ACCase is responsible for carboxylation of acetyl-CoA to produce malonyl-CoA, which is a crucial step in the con-
trol of fatty acid metabolism. ACCase opened the door for pharmaceutical treatments of obesity and diabetes as well as the devel-
opment of new herbicides. ACCase is also recognized as a promising target for developing cell factories, as its malonyl-CoA
product serves as a universal precursor for a variety of high-value compounds in white biotechnology. Yeast ACCase is a good
model in understanding the enzyme’s catalysis, regulation, and inhibition. The present study describes the importance of pro-
tein phosphorylation in regulation of yeast ACCase and identiﬁes potential regulation sites. This study led to the generation of a
more efﬁcient ACCase, which was applied in the production of two high-value compounds derived from malonyl-CoA, i.e., fatty
acid ethyl esters that can be used as biodiesel and 3-hydroxypropionic acid that is considered an important platform chemical.

A
cetyl coenzyme A (acetyl-CoA) carboxylase (ACCase; EC
6.4.1.2), recognized as an essential enzyme in most living or-
ganisms, is responsible for the carboxylation of acetyl-CoA to
form malonyl-CoA. ACCase is a multisubunit enzyme in pro-
karyotes, whereas it is a single, multidomain enzyme in eu-
karyotes. Although the structures are different between pro- and
eukaryotic species, the reaction mechanisms are essentially the
same in all types of cells (1).
ACCase plays a critical role in regulating fatty acid metabolism,
as the enzyme catalyzes the ﬁrst committed and rate-limiting step
in fatty acid biosynthesis, representing an attractive target for
therapeutic intervention in the control of obesity and the treat-
ment of metabolic syndrome (2), in addition to being the site for
development of new herbicides (1). Besides being an essential
component forde novofatty acid synthesis required for cell growth
(1, 3, 4), malonyl-CoA serves as a major building block for a vari-
ety of relevant compounds in industrial biotechnology (Fig. 1),
such as polyketides and ﬂavonoids (5, 6) or fatty acid-derived
products (7, 8). However, it has been shown that the intracellular
malonyl-CoA concentration is tightly regulated to be very low,
resulting in limited production of malonyl-CoA-derived com-
pounds (5–7, 9).
The transfer of malonyl-CoA-dependent pathways into heter-
ologous hosts or their overexpression in native hosts for various
applications relies on the availability of malonyl-CoA. Metabolic
engineering applications of ACCase have been focused on the ma-
nipulation of enzyme levels through gene ampliﬁcation. The ﬁrst
example was overexpression of a set of fourEscherichia coli sub-
unit proteins of ACCase in a coordinated manner, which resulted
in a nearly 50-fold increased activity of the enzyme and a 6-fold
increase in the rate of free fatty acid synthesis inE. coli(10). This
was proven to be an effective approach for fatty acid production in
additional studies, where a set ofE. coliACCase genes was (over)
expressed in cyanobacteria (11) andE. coli(7, 9). This strategy also

allows the development of engineered strains for enhanced pro-
duction of various fatty acid-derived products (12). In another
study, introduction ofCorynebacterium glutamicumACCase, con-
sisting of only two subunits, intoE. coliled to an increase of the
cellular malonyl-CoA concentration by 3-fold and improved
malonyl-CoA-derived phloroglucinol production (5). Similarly,
related to an increased availability of malonyl-CoA, it was ob-
served that expression of the ACCase genes fromC. glutamicumor
Photorhabdus luminescens in E. coli could lead to increased pro-
duction of ﬂavonones, which are direct precursors of ﬂavonoids
(13, 14). It was also reported that overexpression of ACCase in
Streptomyces coelicolor resulted in an improved polyketide pro-
duction (15). Changing the promoter ofACC1 to the strong con-
stitutive TEF1 promoter inSaccharomyces cerevisiaehas been seen
to increase the production of 6-methylsalicylic acid by about 60%
(6). Although many examples of ACCase overexpression were
shown to be suitable for production of a variety of malonyl-CoA-
derived products, these are still limited by the inherent low capac-
ity of the enzyme itself and in particular its tight posttranslational
regulation. Several other attempts to utilize overexpression of AC-
Case in various systems were not satisfactory (5, 8, 16), and there
remains a need to increase ACCase enzyme activity by modifying
its native regulation.
Microbial systems are increasingly being developed as produc-
tion platforms for a wide variety of chemicals and biofuels to de-
crease the dependency on fossil resources. These target chemicals
and biofuels are frequently produced by incorporating heterolo-
gous or modifying endogenous metabolic pathways in well-
characterized host microorganisms, such asE. colior S. cerevisiae.
Nowadays, the yeastS. cerevisiaeis often preferred as the host for
the development of a new process due to its robustness and toler-
ance toward different environmental conditions, an extensive
technology platform available for this organism, well-studied ge-
netics, and a long history of industrial use with a well-established
reputation (17, 18). There are therefore many examples that illus-
trate the suitability of this cell factory for the production of a range
of fuels (16–18) and chemicals (17–19). In addition, to reduce the
production costs, many efforts have been reported to make
S. cerevisiaeefﬁciently grow on and metabolize pentoses that are
present in hemicelluloses (20–23). Following decades of continu-
ous efforts,S. cerevisiaeis likely to become a key cell factory plat-
form in the future (17, 18).
In S. cerevisiae, cytosolic ACCase is encoded byACC1 and mi-
tochondrial ACCase byHFA1. To eliminate issues with transport
across the mitochondrial membranes, it is desirable to assemble
heterologous biosynthetic pathways in the cytosol for most bio-
technological projects. Therefore, it is of great interest to under-
stand the regulation of Acc1 activity.ACC1 is transcriptionally
regulated in coordination with phospholipid biosynthesis by pos-
itive (Ino2p and Ino4p) and negative (Opi1p) regulatory factors
(4). Since it belongs to a family of biotin-dependent carboxylases,
the efﬁciency of Acc1 biotinylation controls its activity at the pro-
tein level, and it has been reported that reduced levels of this vita-
min affect the synthesis of fatty acids (24). Protein phosphoryla-
tion is one of the most important posttranslational modiﬁcations
and plays a key role in signal transduction and gene regulation. It
has been suggested that phosphorylation by Snf1 inactivates puri-
ﬁed Acc1 (25, 26) (Fig. 1), and mutants lacking Snf1 display in-
creased Acc1 activity (3, 25). Except for the regulation of Acc1,
Snf1 is also responsible for the induction of genes involved in
gluconeogenesis, glyoxylate cycle, and
/H9252-oxidation of fatty acids as
well as involved in the general stress response, pseudohyphal
growth, aging, and ion homeostasis (27). Therefore, Snf1 could
not be simply deleted for enhancing Acc1 activity. Concerning
phosphorylation of Acc1, one site at Ser1157 was veriﬁed by phos-
phoproteome analysis (28). However, it remains to be shown
whether this serine (Ser) residue is the actual target site of Snf1-
mediated phosphorylation. According to the phosphorylation
recognition motif (Hyd-X-Arg-XX-Ser-XXX-Hyd) for Snf1 (29),
besides Ser1157, an additional putative phosphorylation site was
found at Ser659 of Acc1. There are no experimental data on phos-
phorylation of Ser659 reported so far. In this work, we intended to
characterize these proposed phosphorylation sites of Acc1 via site-
directed mutagenesis and evaluate the resultant mutant enzyme
activities.
Modulation of Acc1 activity would directly affect the cellular
concentration of the product malonyl-CoA, and, here, we dem-
onstrate that engineering the protein at the posttranslational level
can increase the enzyme activity of Acc1 and thereby enable im-
proved ﬂux through malonyl-CoA-dependent metabolic path-
ways for the production of chemicals and biofuels, e.g., (i)
3-hydroxypropionic acid (3-HP), a platform chemical that can be
used in synthesis of a variety of chemical derivatives, such as acry-
lates and malonic acid (30), and (ii) fatty acid ethyl esters (FAEEs)
that can be used as a main constituent of biodiesel used in trucks,
buses, and trains (31).
RESULTS
Site-directed mutagenesis of Acc1 increases enzyme activity and
total fatty acid content.Ser1157 of Acc1 has been reported to be a
site of phosphorylation (28), and using the phosphorylation rec-
ognition motif (Hyd-X-Arg-XX-Ser-XXX-Hyd) for Snf1 to search
for additional possible phosphorylation sites, we identiﬁed Ser659
as a putative site besides Ser1157. These two possible phosphory-
lation sites of Acc1 were mutated from Ser to Ala (see details in
Fig. S1 in the supplemental material). Thus, three versions of
ACC1 were constructed by PCR: (i) wild-typeACC1 (ACC1
wt),
FIG 1 Malonyl-CoA works as a major building block. The primary fate of
malonyl-CoA is to serve as a precursor for lipids. However, a wide range of
industrially interesting fuels and chemicals are derived from malonyl-CoA. A
cell factory with enhanced supply of malonyl-CoA could serve as a platform for
malonyl-CoA-derived products. Acc1 is a critical enzyme for malonyl-CoA
synthesis, and the global regulator Snf1 is involved in regulation of Acc1 at the
posttranslational level.

(ii) ACC1 with one site mutation at Ser1157 (ACC1ser1157ala), and
(iii) ACC1 with two site mutations at Ser1157 and Ser659
(ACC1ser659ala,ser1157ala).
To evaluate the effect of the point mutations on the ACCase
activity, ACC1wt, ACC1ser1157ala, and ACC1ser659ala,ser1157ala were
cloned into multicopy plasmid pSP-GM2 (32) and then trans-
formed intoS. cerevisiaeCEN.PK 113-5 D to construct the strains
CAW, CAS, and CAD (Table 1), respectively. CB0 holds the empty
plasmid pSP-GM2 and was used as a control. ACCase activities in
all strains were determined in stationary phase (Table 2). Overex-
pression of both wild-type and point-mutatedACC1 enhanced
the ACCase activity compared to that of control strain CB0.
In strain CAW, which harborsACC1
wt on plasmid, ACCase activ-
ity was increased by 20%. While the enzyme activity was 80%
higher in the single-mutated version ofACC1 (ACC1
ser1157ala)i n
strain CAS than for the control strain, overexpression of
ACC1ser659ala,ser1157ala resulted in a 3-fold increase of ACCase ac-
tivity, which was the highest increase.
Overexpression of wild-type or point-mutated Acc1 clearly led
to an increase in the enzyme activity and thereby supposedly in-
creased the formation of malonyl-CoA, a crucial precursor for
fatty acid biosynthesis. Therefore, we also measured the concen-
tration of total fatty acids in strains CB0, CAW, CAS, and CAD
(Table 2). We found no signiﬁcant increase in the total fatty acid
content when overexpressingACC1
wt compared with that of the
control strain. Overexpression of ACC1ser1157ala, however, re-
sulted in a 14/H110060.2% improvement in the total fatty acid content,
and overexpression of ACC1ser659ala,ser1157ala resulted in a 65/H11006
0.3% increase in the total fatty acid content (strain CAD).
Characterization of different Acc1 versions in the absence of
SNF1. The effect of increased activity of Acc1 shown in Table 2
could be explained by the introduced site mutations, Ser659 and
Ser1157, which are suggested to function as phosphorylation sites
recognized by Snf1 protein kinase (29). To evaluate this further,
we expressed the two mutated enzymes as well as the wild-type
form of the enzyme in ansnf1 strain.
SNF1 was deleted in strain CEN.PK 113-5 D, resulting in strain
SC00. Empty plasmid and plasmids holding three different ver-
sions of ACC1 were introduced into SC00, resulting in strains
SC01, SC02, SC03, and SC04 (Table 1). These strains were cul-
tured in glucose-limited chemostat cultures (growth rate at
0.1 h
/H110021), where Snf1 is normally active, and analyzed for their
ACCase activity. No apparent physiological difference was found
in chemostat cultures when different versions of Acc1 were over-

expressed. Compared to the higher enzyme activity for the mu-
tated versions of Acc1 in the presence ofSNF1 (Table 2), all the
strains with overexpression of different versions ofACC1, i.e.,
strains SC02, SC03, and SC04, had similar ACCase activities in the
absence of SNF1 (Table 3). These results clearly indicate that
Ser1157 and Ser659 play a role in regulation of Acc1 activity, most
likely as phosphorylation target sites of Snf1.
Using mutated Acc1 for production of malonyl-CoA-derived
products. From the above-given information, it is clear that site-
directed mutagenesis ofACC1 results in increased activity, leading
to higher total lipid content (Table 2), indicating increased supply
of malonyl-CoA. We therefore wanted to evaluate if this phenom-
enon could be applied for improving the production of malonyl-
CoA-derived products, of which FAEEs and 3-HP were taken as
examples (see Fig. 2).
FAEEs can be produced by yeast following the introduction of
a heterologous wax ester synthase gene (ws2), and the supply of
malonyl-CoA has been found to be limiting the production (31).
Therefore, as expected, overexpression of the different mutant
ACC1 genes increased FAEE production (Table 4). Compared to
the FAEE-producing reference strain CB2H1 that holds only the
ws2 gene with an FAEE production of 4.8/H110060.7 mg/liter, strain
CB2H2 that overexpressesACC1
wt has a slightly increased FAEE
production (around 20%), while strain CB2H3 that overexpresses
ACC1ser659ala showed a much higher increase (around 2-fold).
Furthermore, overexpression of ACC1ser659ala,ser1157ala in strain
CB2H4 resulted in the highest FAEE production, corresponding
to a 3-fold improvement. Some physiological parameters of the
different strains are listed in Table S1 in the supplemental mate-
rial. The strains with higher activity of Acc1 showed a lower
growth rate, and their ﬁnal biomass concentration was also re-
duced.
A second case study was the production of 3-HP. As shown in
Fig. 2, biosynthesis of 3-HP can be realized directly from malonyl-
CoA in two reaction steps catalyzed by the multifunctional
malonyl-CoA reductase encoded by themcr
Ca gene fromChloro-
ﬂexus aurantiacus, as reported before (33). The production of
3-HP (Table 4) in the different strains showed a trend similar to
FAEE production. In HPY16, whereACC1
wt was overexpressed,
3-HP production was improved by 60% compared to HPY15 that
carries onlymcrCa. Interestingly, whenACC1ser659ala was overex-
pressed instead of the wild-type gene in HPY17, there was a more
than 2.5-fold improvement in 3-HP production over the reference
strain HPY15, and by overexpressing ACC1
ser659ala,ser1157ala in
HPY18, an improvement of more than 3.5-fold over HPY15 was
obtained. Some physiological parameters of the different strains
are listed in Table S2 in the supplemental material. A reduction in
growth rate and biomass yield was found when the different ver-
sions ofACC1 were overexpressed. With regard to the accumula-
tion of 3-HP in glucose and ethanol phases (see Table S2), the
similar increasing trend was observed when ACC1
wt,
ACC1ser659ala,o rACC1ser659ala,ser1157ala were overexpressed. More
interestingly, it was found that the highest improvements, up to

DISCUSSION
In S. cerevisiae, as well as in other higher eukaryotes, the activity of
ACCase rather than the fatty acid synthetase complex determines
the regulation of fatty acid synthesis (1). Therefore, ACCase is
assumed to be a promising target for the development of thera-
peutics and herbicides and for biotechnology approaches.
Currently, a major challenge in understanding regulation of
yeast Acc1 (encoding cytosolic ACCase) is to deﬁne its character-
istics of posttranslational modiﬁcation through protein phos-
phorylation. We here show that introduction of site mutation at
Ser1157 and/or Ser659 of Acc1 resulted in an increase in Acc1
activity (Table 2), indicating that these two assumed phosphory-
lation sites are highly related to determining the enzyme activityin
vivo. We further demonstrated that there is no difference in activ-
ity of the different mutant enzymes in anSNF1 deletion strain.
Phosphorylation at Ser1157 has been indicated in a previous study
(28). Although no phosphorylation has been seen for Ser659 in
any study so far, it may still occur. Our data strongly indicate that
the introduced mutations were able to relieve Snf1-regulated re-
pression of Acc1. Whether this regulation, presumably through
protein phosphorylation, is directly or indirectly mediated by Snf1
remains to be seen. We also found that there is a 40% increased
activity of ACCase in ansnf1 deletion strain compared to that of
the reference strain (Tables 2 and 3), consistent with an earlier
study that suggested a key role of phosphorylation on Acc1 activity
with the evidence thatACC1 expression is reduced insnf1 mutants
but still displays higher activity of the enzyme (25). It is also inter-
esting that the deletion ofSNF1 in SC01 gives a higher ACCase
activity than elevation of its transcriptional level by overexpres-
sion ofACC1
wt on a plasmid in CAW (Tables 2 and 3). From these
results, it is clear that activity of Acc1 is controlled primarily at the
posttranscriptional level. Although there have been a variety of
projects targeted to modulate Acc1 activity, this study is the ﬁrst
describing modulation at the posttranslational level. It is observed
that the Acc1 activity measured in this study is much lower than in
previous reports (34, 35). One possible explanation could be bio-
tin deﬁciency. However, this would be reﬂected in a decrease in
C
18 fatty acids (24), which is not the case in our strains. The reason
for this difference could also be due to the fact that cell extracts
were used directly for enzyme analysis in this study, and previous
reports had puriﬁed the enzyme before enzyme analysis (34, 35).
Differences in media and sampling times may also explain the
differences in enzyme activity.
It is known that fatty acid biosynthesis highly depends on the
activity of Acc1 (1, 3, 7), and here we also found a positive effect of
the enhanced Acc1 activity on the total fatty acid content (Ta-
ble 2), indicating limitations for fatty acid biosynthesis associated
with Acc1 activity. Limitations in malonyl-CoA availability also
impede biotechnological synthesis of many industrially relevant
products.
Here, we demonstrated that expression of our identiﬁed more
efﬁcient Acc1 mutants could improve the production of two
malonyl-CoA-derived products, i.e., FAEEs and 3-HP (Table 4).
In both cases, the observed highest improvement was caused by
overexpression of ACC1
ser659ala,ser1157ala, and the fold changes
were similar to the improvement in ACCase activity by overex-
pression of this mutant enzyme (Table 2). This points to a signif-
icant ﬂux control at Acc1 for production of both products. An
impaired growth was observed in both cases when strains had an
enhanced activity of Acc1 and their ﬁnal biomass concentrations
were also reduced, as shown in Tables S1 and S2 in the supplemen-
tal material. This is presumably due to an imbalanced synthesis of
long-chain fatty acids or depletion of intermediates. A similar re-
sult has been reported in a previous review, which mentioned that
overexpression of Acc1 together with Bpl1 (encoding the enzyme
biotin-apoprotein ligase) can even be lethal (4). A harmful effect
on growth caused by overexpression of ACCase was also found in
bacteria (10).
The highest production of FAEEs in CB2H4 reached 15.8 mg/
liter, which is much lower than the value achieved using an engi-
neered E. coli strain (31), but it is comparable with the highest
FAEE production reported forS. cerevisiae from simple sugars,
which is 17.2 mg/liter (36). In the latter study, fatty acid metabo-
lism was heavily modiﬁed by eliminating nonessential fatty acid
utilization pathways (36), and it is interesting that here almost the
same titer was reached by simply overexpressing
ACC1
ser659ala,ser1157ala. Samples for FAEE measurements were
taken in stationary phase, as yeast cells can accumulate substantial
amounts of lipids during the late exponential and stationary
phases (37), which is also true for FAEE accumulation (see Ta-
ble S1). During this phase, FAEEs were produced and ACCase
would theoretically be inactived by Snf1 (3). In the case of 3-HP,
when overexpressing ACC1
ser659ala,ser1157ala, an approximately
6-fold increase was found during the ethanol phase, while only an
approximately 2-fold increase was observed in the glucose phase
compared to that in the control (see Table S2). This is probably
due to the fact that the availability of cytosolic acetyl-CoA is higher
during the ethanol phase than during the glucose phase (19). Still,
the improvements when overexpressing the mutated Acc1 (5- to
6-fold) are greater than the improvements with the wild-type Acc1
(2-fold). This difference reﬂects the efﬁciency of converting
acetyl-CoA into malonyl-CoA, indicating again a connection with
Snf1-mediated phosphorylation, since the kinase is active mainly
in this phase. These two cases suggest that regulation of this spe-
ciﬁc reaction was not only the result of gene expression but resides
to a large extent in posttranslational modiﬁcations, which should
be taken into account for future metabolic engineering strategies.
There are several other examples of enzymes that are regulated
posttranslationally rather than by expression level variation (38–
40). A very good example is the control of yeast central metabo-
lism by enzyme phosphorylation (40).
Yeast ACCase exhibits strong similarity to the respective en-
zyme sequences of mammals and plants (2). The AMP-activated
protein kinase (AMPK) is responsible for phosphorylation and
inhibition of ACCase in human; in yeast, Acc1 is phosphorylated
by Snf1 (25, 26); Snf1-related protein kinases (SnRKs) play the
regulatory role in higher plants. AMPK, Snf1, and SnRKs all be-
long to the Snf1 protein kinase family (41). The high conservation
of ACCases from yeast to mammals and plants suggests that the
yeast ACCase can be used as a model to study the molecular inter-
actions in human physiology as well as for the development of
targets in disease treatments (42), or it can be used as a guide to
control lipid metabolism in plants for developing high-lipid-
content plants as renewable and sustainable feedstocks for the
production of liquid biofuels (43). Our ﬁndings represent a step
forward in achieving these goals.
Increasing Malonyl-CoA Supply via Engineering of Acc1

Conclusion. ACCase, which is crucial for the anabolism of
malonyl-CoA and fatty acids (1), was also suggested to be the
major rate-controlling step for production of a variety of high-
value compounds derived from malonyl-CoA. Overexpression of
ACCase has previously been applied in many studies for redirect-
ing ﬂux toward malonyl-CoA (1, 5–7, 9, 10). However, these ap-
proaches are still limited by the inherent low enzyme activity. In
this study, it is interesting to note that a more efﬁcient Acc1 was
obtained by the introduction of two site mutations at Ser1157 and
Ser659, which are suggested to be related to Snf1-mediated phos-
phorylation. The strains with higher activity of Acc1 showed a
notable advantage for the production of malonyl-CoA-derived
products, as demonstrated for the production of FAEEs and 3-HP.
Our new ﬁnding is therefore also likely to be applicable for many
other products that are derived from malonyl-CoA. The present
study highlights the importance of engineering proteins along
with metabolic engineering as a key strategy in achieving im-
proved microbial cell factories.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Strains and plasmids.All DNA manipulations were carried out inE. coli
DH5/H9251as described (44). All constructs have been checked by sequencing.
The plasmids used are derived from pIYC04 (19) and pSP-GM2 (32).
The endogenousACC1 gene (wild type) encoding acetyl-CoA carbox-
ylase was ampliﬁed from genomic DNA of CEN.PK 113-5D by PCR with
Phusion high-ﬁdelity polymerase (Thermo Scientiﬁc, Waltham, MA,
USA). The primers are listed in Table S3 in the supplemental material. The
ACC1
ser1157ala single-point mutation andACC1ser659ala,ser1157ala double-
point mutation were introduced by oligonucleotide primers (details are
shown in Fig. S1). Three versions ofACC1 were digested with NotI and
SacI and then ligated into the corresponding sites of pSP-GM2 and con-
trolled by constitutivePGK1 promoter.
For FAEE production inS. cerevisiae, the codon-optimized wax syn-
thase gene (ws2) fromMarinobacter hydrocarbonoclasticusDSM 8798 was
adopted from a former study (16). Thews2 gene was ligated into pIYC04
under control of theTEF1 promoter. For 3-HP production inS. cerevisiae,
the gene mcr
Ca encoding malonyl-CoA reductase fromChloroﬂexus au-
rantiacus was codon optimized based on the codon preference ofS. cerevi-
siae (GenScript, Piscataway, NJ, USA). ThemcrCa gene was ligated into
pIYC04 downstream of theTEF1 promoter.
S. cerevisiaestrains used in this work are listed in Table 1. All experi-
ments were performed in the background of CEN.PK (45, 46). Yeast
transformation was conducted using the standard LiAc/SS carrier DNA/
PEG method (47).SNF1 was deleted inS. cerevisiaeCEN.PK 113-5 D to
construct strain SC00 using a fragment containing thekanMX marker
ﬂanked by SNF1 up- and downstream regions ampliﬁed from genomic
DNA of CEN.PK 506-1 C [MATa URA3 HIS3 TRP1 LEU2 SUC2
MAL2– 8
C snf1 (4-1899)::loxP-kanMX-loxP] (48) by PCR, with the fol-
lowing oligonucleotides:SNF1-UP andSNF1-DOWN (see Table S3). The
strains with SNF1 deletion were selected from yeast extract-peptone-
dextrose (YPD) plates containing G418 (0.2 mg/ml) and veriﬁed by PCR.
Plasmids were transformed into the corresponding host strains for con-
struction of new strains (Table 1). Successful mutants were picked from
synthetic dextrose (SD) agar plates with the appropriate medium compo-
sition (36).
Growth conditions.Strains were grown on SD agar plates containing
the appropriate medium composition for selection.
For enzyme activity and total fatty acid analysis, strains ofS. cerevisiae
were cultured in synthetic medium (19) with 20 g/liter glucose in shake
ﬂasks. The culture volume in the shake ﬂasks was 20 ml with an initial
optical density at 600 nm (OD
600) of 0.02 after inoculation from precul-
tures grown overnight in synthetic medium.
For FAEE and 3-HP production, strains ofS. cerevisiaewere cultured
in synthetic medium (19) with 20 g/liter glucose in 1.0-liter Dasgip stirrer-
pro bioreactors (Dasgip, Jülich, Germany). The working volume was
0.6 liters, and the cultivation was carried out at an agitation of 600 rpm,
with an aeration rate of 1 vvm (gas volume ﬂow per unit of liquid volume
per minute), a pH of 5, and using 2 M KOH and a controlled temperature
of 30°C. The initial OD
600 of the cultures was around 0.02 after inocula-
tion from precultures.
Chemostat cultivation. Chemostat cultures were carried out in 1.0-
liter Dasgip stirrer-pro bioreactors with a 0.6-liter working volume under
aerobic conditions using a dilution rate of 0.10 (/H110060.005) h
/H110021. The pH was
maintained at 5.0 with 2 M KOH, with a controlled temperature at 30°C,
an airﬂow rate at 1 vvm, and agitation at 600 rpm. The emission of CO2
and residual O2 was monitored by Dasgip fedbatch pro gas analysis sys-
tems, equipped with off-gas analyzer GA4 based on zirconium dioxide
and a two-beam infrared sensor (Dasgip). Strains were grown in synthetic
medium containing (per liter) 10 g of glucose, 5 g of (NH
4)2SO4,3go f
KH2PO4, 0.5 g of MgSO4 ·7 H2O, 1 ml of vitamin solution, 1 ml of trace
metal solution, and 50 ml of Antiform 204 (27). Samples were taken from
the cultures after a steady state was maintained for about 50 h. Steady state
refers to cultures without detectable oscillations in values of pH, volume,
and CO
2 and O2 in the off-gas and biomass concentrations.
Analytical methods.The growth was measured by optical density at
600 nm and cell dry weight (CDW). CDW was determined by ﬁltering
5 ml of the cell culture through a 0.45-
/H9262m-pore-size nitrocellulose ﬁlter
(Sartorius Stedim, Göttingen, Germany) and measuring the increased
weight of the dry ﬁlter. The concentrations of residual glucose and exter-
nal metabolites were analyzed using a Dionex Ultimate 3000 high-
performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) system (Dionex Softron
GmbH, Germering, Germany) with an Aminex HPX-87H column (Bio-
Rad, California) using 5 mM H
2SO4 as the mobile phase (16).
Lipid extraction and analysis.Cells were harvested from a volume of
50 ml, washed twice with distilled water, and centrifuged at 3,000/H11003g for
5 min at 4°C. These samples were then frozen at/H1100280°C and freeze-dried
for about 3 days or until they appeared dry. Dried cells were weighed
before extraction of lipids and FAEEs. The method for lipid extraction and
separation was described previously (16). The analysis was performed in
an ISQ single quadrupole GC-MS (Thermo, Fisher Scientiﬁc, Austin, TX)
adopting the previously reported method for fatty acid methyl ester
(FAME) or FAEE analysis (16, 49). FAME or FAEE peaks were identiﬁed
using their spectrum patterns compared to their corresponding standard
mix. The standard FAME mix consisted of methyl esters of myristic,
palmitic, palmitoleic, heptadecanoic (internal standard), stearic, oleic,
and arachidic acids (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, LA, USA), and the standard
FAEE mix consisted of ethyl esters of lauric, myristic, palmitic, palmito-
leic, heptadecanoic (internal standard), stearic, and oleic acids (Cayman
Chemical, Ann Arbor, MI, USA). The serial dilutions in hexane of FAME
or FAEE mix standards were injected to generate standard curves for their
quantiﬁcation performed with the help of the QuanBrowser function in
the Xcalibur software version 2.0 (Thermo Scientiﬁc).
Determination of 3-HP. The concentrations of 3-HP were deter-
mined by HPLC using the previously described method (33). Culture
samples were centrifuged at 12,000/H11003g for 10 min, and the supernatants
were ﬁltered through a 0.20-
/H9262m-pore-size nitrocellulose ﬁlter (Sartorius
Stedim) and analyzed by a Summit HPLC (Dionex, Sunnyvale, CA, USA)
with an Aminex HPX-87H column (Bio-Rad, Hercules) at 65°C using
0.5 mM H
2SO4 as the mobile phase at a ﬂow rate of 0.5 ml min/H110021.
Enzyme activity assay.Cell-free extracts were prepared using a previ-
ously reported fast preparation method for enzyme analysis (16). Protein
concentrations were measured according to the Bradford method. Acetyl-
CoA carboxylase activities in the extracts were measuredin vitroby mon-
itoring the incorporation of labeled carbon from NaH
14 CO3 into acid-
stable reaction material as reported previously (50). ACCase activity was
expressed as pmol of14C incorporated into acid-stable products per min-
ute per milligram of cell-free protein extract.
