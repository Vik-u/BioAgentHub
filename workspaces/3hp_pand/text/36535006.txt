ABSTRACT: Mesaconyl-CoA transferase (Mct) is one of the key
enzymes of the 3-hydroxypropionate (3HP) bi-cycle for
autotrophic CO
2
fixation. Mct is a family III/Frc family CoA
transferase that catalyzes an unprecedented intra-molecular CoA
transfer from the C1-carboxyl group to the C4-carboxyl group of
mesaconate at catalytic efficiencies >10

. Here, we show
that the reaction of Mct proceeds without any significant release of
free CoA or the transfer to external acceptor acids. Mct catalyzes
intra-molecular CoA transfers at catalytic efficiencies that are at
least more than 6 orders of magnitude higher compared to inter-
molecular CoA transfers, demonstrating that the enzyme exhibits
exquisite control over its reaction. To understand the molecular
basis of the intra-molecular CoA transfer in Mct, we solved crystal
structures of the enzyme from Chloroflexus aurantiacus in its apo form, as well as in complex with mesaconyl-CoA and several
covalently enzyme-bound intermediates of CoA and mesaconate at the catalytically active residue Asp165. Based on these structures,
we propose a reaction mechanism for Mct that is similar to inter-molecular family III/Frc family CoA transferases. However, in
contrast to the latter that undergo opening and closing cycles during the reaction to exchange substrates, the central cavity of Mct
remains sealed (“corked-up”) by the CoA moiety, strongly favoring the intra-molecular CoA transfer between the C1 and the C4
position of mesaconate.

INTRODUCTION
The thermophilic green non-sulfur bacterium Chloroflexus
aurantiacus uses the 3HP bi-cycle for autotrophic CO
2
fixation.
1−3
In the first part of the 3HP bi-cycle, CO
2
is
captured via two biotin-dependent carboxylases yielding
glyoxylate as the primary CO
2
-fixation product. In the second
part of the 3HP bi-cycle, glyoxylate is condensed with
propionyl-CoA into (2R,3S)-β-methylmalyl-CoA.
4
Methylmal-
yl-CoA is rearranged and converted into acetyl-CoA and
pyruvate, the final CO
2
-fixation product.
1
The rearrangement
sequence of the second cycle starts via dehydration of
methylmalyl-CoA into mesaconyl-C1-CoA (2-methylfumaryl-
CoA).
5
The CoA moiety of mesaconyl-C1-CoA is then
transferred from the C1- to the C4-carboxyl group by Mct,
resulting in mesaconyl-C4-CoA (3-methylfumaryl-CoA). Me-
saconyl-C4-CoA is further converted into (3S)-citramalyl-CoA,
which is ultimately cleaved into acetyl-CoA and pyruvate
1
(Figure 1).
The Mct reaction is a key reaction in the 3HP bi-cycle. It
conserves the energy-rich CoA-ester bond during C1-/C4-
transfer without the release of mesaconate or the transfer of
CoA onto other acceptors, which would result in a loss of
intermediates and require additional ATP for (re-)activation of
the free mesaconate. Overall, this makes the intra-molecular
C1-/C4-CoA transfer by Mct an elegant and energetically
highly efficient solution.
CoA transferases have been traditionally categorized into
three different families, although recent phylogenetic analysis
indicates that the evolutionary history of family I and II CoA
transferases is more complex and that CoA transferases fall into
six different monophyletic groups
6
(see Table S1 for Pfams).
“Family II” members (i.e., members of the CitF and MdcA
families) are enzyme complexes that naturally use acyl-carrier
proteins during catalysis but are also able to accept CoA esters
as substrates in vitro.
7−9
In contrast, “family I” members (i.e.,
members of the Cat1, OXCT1, and Gct families) and family
III members (i.e., members of the Frc family) are lone-standing
enzymes that typically catalyze the inter-molecular CoA
transfer between a CoA donor and an acceptor acid in a
similar fashion.
10−13
The initial step in these enzymatic
reactions is the nucleophilic attack of an active site, glutamate

(“family I” members) or aspartate (family III/Frc family
members), on the donor CoA ester, resulting in an acyl-
enzyme anhydride and free CoAS
−
. The CoAS
−
subsequently
attacks the acyl-enzyme anhydride, releasing the donor acid
and yielding a γ-glutamyl-bound (“family I”) or β-aspartyl-
bound (family III/Frc family) enzyme-CoA thioester inter-
mediate. The acceptor acid attacks the enzyme-CoA thioester
to release CoAS
−
and forms another acyl-enzyme anhydride. In
the last step, this anhydride is re-attacked by the CoAS
−
,
releasing the new CoA thioester.
9,10,12,14,15
The catalytic mechanisms of “family I” and family III/Frc
family CoA transferases follow similar principles. However,
while “family I” transferases use a classical ping-pong
mechanism,
11−13
family III/Frc family enzymes show a
modified mechanism, in which access of small acceptor acids
to the active site may be gated either through a flexible glycine
loop
10,16−20
or even larger domain movements as observed for
crotonobetainyl-CoA:carnitine CoA transferase (CaiB).
16
The
glycine-rich loop presumably opens and closes during the
catalytic cycle to allow access of the acceptor acid upon
formation of the β-aspartyl-CoA intermediate−with the donor
acid still present at the active site. After CoA transfer, the
newly formed acceptor acid-CoA thioester and the then free
donor acid are released. Crystallographic evidence for these
enzyme-bound intermediate states was presented for the
formyl-CoA transferase (Frc) of Oxalobacter formigenes.
10
While Mct falls within canonical family III/Frc family CoA
transferases, the enzyme catalyzes an unprecedented intra-
molecular CoA transfer, in which the acceptor acid (i.e., the
second carboxylic group of mesaconate) is already part of the
CoA donor. Since there is no need to introduce an additional
substrate during the catalytic cycle, it has been speculated that
the active site stays fully closed during catalysis.
1,21
This
hypothesis is consistent with the observation that small
inactivating molecules that could react with the acyl-enzyme
anhydride intermediate, such as hydroxylamine or borohy-
dride, had little or even no effect on Mct activity.
1
However,
this also means that mesaconate would need to re-orient within
the active site of Mct to enable CoA transfer from C1 to C4.
Because of these proposed major differences to the catalytic
cycle of inter-molecular CoA transferases, the mechanism of
intra-molecular CoA transfer by Mct remained elusive.
Recently, the structure of the Mct homologue from
Roseiflexus castenholzii (PDB 7XKG) was reported in its apo
form.
21
This structure showed that a flexible glycine-rich loop
that supposedly gates catalysis in some other inter-molecular
family III/Frc family CoA transferases
10,19
is absent in Mct,
indicating that the reaction may proceed differently in the
intra-molecular CoA transferases. Based on the structure of the
apoenzyme, molecular dynamics simulations with mesaconyl-
C1- and C4-CoA were performed
21
and a mechanism for the
intra-molecular CoA transfer of Mct was proposed, which
differed from the canonical family III/Frc family CoA
transferases. Notably, a direct, water-assisted attack of the
free CoAS
−
onto the free carboxy group of mesaconate has
been postulated.
21
However, this mechanism seems biochemi-
cally infeasible and support for this mechanism is lacking.
Here, we sought to further biochemically and structurally
characterize Mct from C. aurantiacus to better understand the
molecular basis of catalysis. We show that Mct is virtually an
exclusive intra-molecular CoA transferase and provide atomic-
resolution crystal structures of the enzyme with different
bound intermediates. Based on this data, we propose a
mechanism for Mct that is similar to those of inter-molecular
family III/Frc family transferases with the enzyme’s active site
being “corked-up” by the substrate’s CoA moiety. This active

site sealing likely favors the intra-molecular CoA transfer over
inter-molecular CoA transfer in Mct by several orders of
magnitude, resulting in a highly selective enzyme.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Synthesis of CoA Thioesters. Synthesis of Mesaconyl-
C1- and Mesaconyl-C4-CoA. First, 0.5 M mesaconic acid (116
mg) was dissolved in 2 mL of diethylether on ice. Then, 80 μL
water-free pyridine and 94 μL of ice-cold ethyl chloroformate
were added under constant stirring. After 15 min, the
supernatant containing mesaconic anhydride was slowly
added to a CoA solution (2.5 mM CoA, 25 mM NaHCO
3
).
After 30 min of constant stirring on ice, pH was adjusted to pH
of 3.0 with HCl.
22
Free CoA, mesaconyl-C1-CoA, and
mesaconyl-C4-CoA were separated by HPLC (Agilent 1260
Infinity HPLC) with a Gemini 10 μm NX-C18 110 Å column
(Phenomenex) in a gradient from 14 to 50% methanol in
buffer (25 mM NH
4
COOH/HCOOH, pH 4.2) over 10 min at
a flow rate of 25 mL/min. Mesaconyl-C1- and C4-CoA could
be differentiated by their UV spectra (Figure 2) and retention
times. The retention times for CoA, mesaconyl-C1-CoA, and
mesaconyl-C4-CoA were 1.9, 3.9, and 4.8 min, respectively.
Peak fractions were pooled, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and
subsequently lyophilized. The resulting powder was stored at
−20 °C and solved in ddH
2
O before use. Purity was confirmed
by HPLC−MS. Both CoA thioesters were >99% pure. They
did not show any cross-contamination with the respective
other mesaconyl-CoA derivative (Figure S1) or with free CoA,
as judged by Ellman’s reagent.
Synthesis of Other CoA Esters. All other CoA thioesters
were synthesized and purified according to previously
established protocols.

Gene Expression and Protein Purification. The
expression plasmid pMCTCa_JZ05 encoding a His-tagged
Mct from C. aurantiacus
1
was used for protein production. The
plasmid was transformed into Escherichia coli BL21 DE3,
grown in 2 L Terrific Broth
25
for 24 h at 25 °C without
induction. The cells were harvested at 4 °C and 8000g and re-
suspended in a threefold volume (3 mL per 1 g of cells) of
loading buffer (50 mM MOPS/KOH pH 7.8, 150 mM NaCl,
75 mM imidazole). The cells were lysed using an LM10
microfluidizer (H10Z chamber, Microfluidics, Westwood, MA)
at 18 000 psi. The lysate was heat-precipitated at 70 °C for 20
min and kept on ice for downstream purification. The
unwanted denatured proteins were removed by centrifugation
at 4 °C and 100 000g for 1 h. The cell extract was filtered (0.4
μm syringe filter), and Mct was purified by nickel affinity
chromatography (elution buffer 50 mM MOPS/KOH, pH 7.8,
150 mM NaCl, 500 mM imidazole) using a 1 mL HisTrap FF
column (Cytiva, Freiburg, Germany). Afterward, the eluate
was desalted in low-salt buffer (50 mM MOPS/KOH, pH 7.8,
50 mM NaCl) and further purified by anion exchange (Q-HP
16/10 column, Cytiva, Freiburg, Germany) using a gradient
with high-salt buffer (50 mM MOPS/KOH, pH 7.8, 300 mM
NaCl) over 20 min. The enzyme eluted between NaCl
concentrations of 100 and 150 mM. The purity of the enzyme
was checked by SDS-PAGE at each purification step, and Mct
was concentrated by centrifugal filters (Amicon by Merck,
Darmstadt, Germany) with a 30 kDa cutoff. Protein
concentrations were determined using a NanoDrop (Thermo-
Fisher Scientific) and applying a calculated molar extinction

Determination of the Extinction Coefficient of
Mesaconyl-CoA Derivatives. UV spectra (220−350 nm)
of both HPLC-purified mesaconyl-CoA forms were recorded
via spectrophotometer (Cary 60, Agilent). CoA thioester
concentrations were measured by depletion in a coupled
NADPH-dependent assay
26
by reduction via succinate-semi-
aldehyde dehydrogenase (SucD, EC:1.2.1.76) spectrophoto-
metrically
27
(Cary 60, Agilent) in a 1 cm quartz cuvette (300
μL assay volume; 200 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 70 nM SucD, 0.7
mM NADPH and about 0.25 mM mesaconyl-CoA) at 365 nm
and 37 °C.
Determination of Enzymatic Activity. Spectrophoto-
metric Assay. To examine the activity of the intra-molecular
CoA transfer of Mct, a spectrophotometric assay was used.
Mesaconyl-C4-CoA has a higher extinction coefficient at 290
nm (ε

) than mesaconyl-C1-CoA
(ε

). To
conduct the measurements, 150 μL assay volume (200 mM
HEPES/KOH, pH
25 °C
8.0, 22 nM Mct, and varying
concentrations of mesaconyl-CoA) was incubated at 55 °C,
and change in absorbance at 290 nm was monitored over time
in a 3 mm quartz cuvette. The reaction was started with the
substrate (ranging from 50 to 1600 μM for mesaconyl-C1-CoA
and 40 to 1300 μM for mesaconyl-C4-CoA).
HPLC−MS-Based Assay. To test for alternative CoA
acceptors, Mct was preincubated in reaction buffer (200 mM
HEPES, pH 7.5) and supplemented with 20 mM of the
corresponding carboxylic acid. After 5 min of preincubation,
the reaction was started by the addition of 1 mM mesaconyl-
C1-CoA. Samples were taken after 0 and 20 min and stopped
on ice by the addition of HCl to a final concentration of 100
mM. The precipitated enzyme was removed by centrifugation
(4 °C and 17 000g), and the supernatants were analyzed by
HPLC-MS and for the presence of alternative CoA thioesters.
To evaluate and quantify the kinetics of succinate as
acceptor acids, an enzyme assay was performed (55 μL; 200
mM HEPES/KOH, pH
25 °C
8.0, 6 μM Mct, 1 mM mesaconyl-
C4-CoA, and varying concentrations of succinate). The
reaction was started with the addition of succinate and
incubated for 20 min at 55 °C. At 0, 1, and 20 min, a sample of
5 μL was taken and quenched in 45 μL of formic acid. The
precipitated enzyme was removed by centrifugation (4 °C and
17 000g), and the supernatants were analyzed by HPLC-MS
for the presence of succinyl-CoA.
Determination of CoA thioesters was performed using a
HiRes-LC-MS. The chromatographic separation was per-
formed on a Thermo Scientific Vanquish HPLC system
using a Kinetex Evo C18 column (150 × 2.1 mm
2
, 100 A, 1.7
μm, Phenomenex) equipped with a 20 × 2.1 mm
2
guard
column of similar specificity at a constant eluent flow rate of
0.25 mL/min and a column temperature of 25 °C with eluent
A being 50 mM ammonium formate at a pH of 8.1 water and
eluent B being MeOH (Honeywell). The injection volume was
1 μL. The elution profile consisted of the following steps and
linear gradients: 0−2 min constant at 0% B; 2−10 min from 0
to 80% B; 10−12 min constant at 80% B; 12−12.1 min from
80 to 0% B; and 12.1−15 min constant at 0% B. A Thermo
Scientific ID-X Orbitrap mass spectrometer was used in
positive mode with an electrospray ionization source and the
following conditions: ESI spray voltage 3500 V, sheath gas at
50 arbitrary units, auxiliary gas at 10 arbitrary units, sweep gas
at 1 arbitrary unit, ion transfer tube temperature at 300 °C, and
vaporizer temperature at 350 °C. Detection was performed in
full-scan mode using the orbitrap mass analyzer at a mass
resolution of 240 000 in the mass range 800−900 (m/z).
Extracted ion chromatograms of the [M + H]
+
forms were
integrated using Tracefinder software (Thermo Scientific).
Absolute concentrations for succinyl-CoA were calculated
based on an external calibration curve.
Crystallization of Mct X-ray Structure Determination.
The purified protein solution was spotted in different
concentrations (3, 6, and 8 mg/mL) on sitting-drop vapor-
diffusion crystallization plates. First, 0.2 μL of each protein
solution was mixed with 0.2 μL of crystallization condition.
The drops were equilibrated against 30 μL of protein-free
crystallization condition at 288 K. The resulting crystals of
condition A (200 mM sodium chloride, 100 mM sodium
potassium phosphate, pH 6.2, and 50% v/v poly(ethylene
glycol) 200) appeared after 5 days. In wells containing
condition B (35% 2-methyl-2,4-pentanediol and 100 mM
sodium/potassium phosphate, pH 6.2) crystals appeared after
2 days and grew until the 5th day of incubation. The crystals in
condition A were directly snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen,
whereas the crystals of condition B were transferred into a
drop containing higher concentrations of cryoprotectant and a
mixture of both forms of mesaconyl-CoA (40% MPD, sodium/
potassium phosphate, pH 6.2, 5 mM mesaconyl-CoA) for 2
min and were then frozen in liquid nitrogen. X-ray diffraction
data were collected at the beamline ID29 of the European
Synchrotron Radiation Facility (ESRF) and the beamline P14
of the Deutsches Elektronen-Synchrotron (DESY). The data
sets were processed with the XDS software package.
28
The
structures were solved by molecular replacement using a
polyalanine search model of the formyl-CoA:oxalate CoA
transferase from Acetobacter aceti (PDB ID 3UBM).

RESULTS
Mct Is a Highly Efficient Intra-Molecular Mesaconyl-
CoA Transferase. For the spectrophotometric kinetic
characterization of Mct, we first synthesized and purified
mesaconyl-C1-CoA and mesaconyl-C4-CoA. We revisited the
UV spectra of both CoA thioesters to determine their exact
extinction coefficients at 230, 260, and 290 nm. While the
overall spectra of both compounds were similar, the C1 and C4
species showed distinct differences. Compared to mesaconyl-
C1-CoA, the spectrum of mesaconyl-C4-CoA resembled more
those of other α,β-unsaturated CoA esters like crotonyl- or
acrylyl-CoA, exhibiting a higher overall extinction coefficient at
260 nm and a more pronounced shoulder in the region
between 280 and 340 nm (Figure 2A).
We then used the difference in the extinction coefficients at
290 nm (Δε
290 nm
= 2900 M
−1
cm
−1
) to determine the catalytic
properties of Mct from C. aurantiacus at the organism’s
optimum growth temperature of 55 °C with mesaconyl-C1-
CoA and mesaconyl-C4-CoA in a continuous photometric
assay. Starting with either of the substrates, the enzyme showed
remarkably high V

values of 495 and 430 μmol min

mg

for mesaconyl-C1- and C4-CoA, corresponding to k
cat
values of
370 and 320, respectively (Figure 2B). The K
M
values for both
CoA esters were 0.16 and 0.2 mM, resulting in catalytic
efficiencies (k

and 1.6 × 10

for
mesaconyl-C1-CoA and mesaconyl-C4-CoA, respectively
(Figure 2B). These kinetic parameters are in line with
previously published values

while also considering the revised
extinction coefficients.
Mct Strongly Discriminates against Other Substrates.
Next, we wanted to assess Mct’s ability to use succinate as an
alternative dicarboxylic acid-CoA acceptor when externally
provided during catalysis with mesaconyl-CoA. We detected
only a negligible side activity (i.e., formation of succinyl-CoA)
with an extremely low catalytic efficiency for the CoA transfer
onto succinate (k
cat
/K
M
= 0.49 M
−1
s
−1
), which is more than 6
orders of magnitude lower compared to the interconversion of
the two different mesaconyl-CoA thioesters (see Figure 3A).
This strong selectivity against free succinate was accompanied
by a very high apparent K
M
for this alternative substrate (>25
mM).
Having identified a very low, but detectable activity with
succinate, we sought to test other central carbon metabolites as
potential acceptor acids and several alternative acyl-CoA
thioesters as potential CoA donors. To that end, we
preincubated different carboxylic acids (mesaconate, succinate,
malate, crotonate, and acetate) individually at concentrations
of 20 mM for 5 min with Mct, before the reaction was started
with 1 mM of either mesaconyl-, succinyl-, crotonyl-, or acetyl-
CoA. In these assays, Mct also accepted crotonate as an
alternative acceptor acid, when succinyl-CoA was provided as a
CoA donor (Figure 3B). However, activity with crotonate as a
CoA acceptor was comparable to or even lower than for
succinate and several orders of magnitude lower than the intra-
molecular reaction with mesaconyl-CoA alone. This demon-
strated that Mct is able to efficiently discriminate against other
carboxylic acids during catalysis.
When testing mesaconate as a CoA acceptor with different
alternative CoA donors, we found that all of the tested CoA
esters could in general serve as substrates (Figure 3B).
However, mesaconyl-CoA formation only occurred when
mesaconate was provided in nonphysiologically high concen-
trations (20 mM). These results are in line with previous data
that reported a lack of detectable radioactive products when
either

We,
therefore, reason that these (side) reactions are likely irrelevant
under physiological conditions. Taken together, our data show
that Mct can neither serve as a mesaconyl-CoA:carboxylic acid-
CoA transferase nor possess a significant activity as acyl-
CoA:mesaconate CoA transferase and therefore is a bona fide
intra-molecular CoA transferase.
Crystal Structure Reveals Snapshots of the Catalytic
Cycle. Next, we became interested in understanding the
structural determinants underlying substrate discrimination in
Mct. We first solved the crystal structure of Mct from C.
aurantiacus in its apo form without substrates at 2.1 Å
resolution. Similar to the recently solved crystal structure of
the homologue from Roseif lexus

and the other family III/Frc

transfer show very poor catalytic efficiency for succinate as an alternative CoA acceptor. The SD is indicated. (B) Testing different potential CoA
donors and CoA acceptors shows that only succinate and mesaconate serve as CoA acceptors, whereas all tested CoA esters serve a as CoA donor
for succinate and mesaconate. “+” indicates that CoA was transferred onto the respective acid, as confirmed by HPLC−MS. “−” indicates that the
formation of a corresponding CoA thioester could not be detected by HPLC−MS.

Mct of C. aurantiacus is an
intertwined homodimer (Figure 4),
17
where the polypeptide
chains are threaded through a hole in the neighboring subunit
(Figure 4B), respectively. A Rossman fold is formed between
the C- and the N-termini of the enzyme. Residues Leu8 to
Ala195 of the N-terminus form the essential part of the
Rossman fold motif, followed by a loop that completely wraps
around the adjacent subunit of the Mct dimer. This loop ends
in a structure on the opposite side of the Rossman fold
harboring three antiparallel β-strands and five short α-helices.
Another loop reaches back to the described N-terminal
structure, in which residues following Thr398 complete the
Rossman fold.
We also solved another structure of Mct under different
crystallization conditions and with substrate soaking at 2.5 Å
resolution. Under these conditions, we detected three dimers
of Mct in the asymmetric unit (ASU). The structure of the
soaked crystal showed additional electron densities at the six
active sites representing different states of bound substrates
and/or reaction intermediates. The active sites are located in
cavities that are formed directly at the dimerization interfaces
between the two subunits. They are located adjacent to the
Rossman fold of each monomer and harbor the catalytically
active Asp165 residue, which itself is part of the last helix of the
Rossman fold. Although the electron densities at the active
sites were slightly ambiguous, representing somewhat mixed
states, we were able to model mesaconyl-C1-CoA (Figure 5),
as well as Asp165−mesaconate anhydride intermediates with
free CoA, and a β-aspartyl-CoA intermediate with free
mesaconate into the different active sites present in the ASU,
respectively (Figure 6).
In the active site with bound mesaconyl-C1-CoA, the
mesaconyl moiety rests in close proximity to the catalytic
Asp165. The terminal carboxy group of mesaconyl-CoA is
coordinated by Arg47 and Tyr136 (see Figure 5B). Notably,
Arg47 also occupies the corresponding space of the flexible
glycine-rich loop that is found in some inter-molecular CoA
transferases,
10,17
preventing conformational changes, such as
active-site opening or closing in Mct.
The phosphopantetheine arm of CoA is well coordinated
along the active site tunnel of Mct, and the carbonyl−oxygen
of the thioester bond engages in a hydrogen bridge with the
peptide nitrogen of Asp135. The amide nitrogen, the amide
oxygen of the β-alanine, and the cysteamine moiety of CoA are
coordinated by the backbone oxygen of Glu133 and the side
chain of Asn100, respectively. Arg75 and Arg104 coordinate
with the phosphate of the adenosyl group. The adenine ring
itself is wedged in between Phe101 and Ile74, engaging in a
staggered π-stack with the phenylalanine (Figure 5B). Notably,
the adenosyl group of CoA adopts a different, perpendicular
(“kinked”) orientation to what is found in the other family III/
Frc family enzymes (Figure 5D,E).
10,16−18
In addition to this
difference in adenine binding, Mct also harbors Leu43, which
narrows the entrance to the active site of Mct substantially
compared to inter-molecular CoA transferases (Figure 5D,E).
A leucine or isoleucine residue in this position is conserved in
all CoA transferases that catalyze intra-molecular CoA transfer,
i.e., Mct from C. aurantiacus, R. castenholzii,
21
Candidatus
Accumulibacter phosphatis,
32
and the γ1-endosymbiont of the
gutless worm Olavius algarvensis.
33
Overall, the tight binding of
CoA along the substrate tunnel together with kinking of the
adenine prevents trapped molecules from escaping and other
molecules from entering the active site (Figure 5B−E),
effectively sealing the catalytic site in a “cork-like” fashion.
Importantly, the CoA moiety also plugs those active sites, in
which mesaconate is covalently bound to Asp165, indicating
that the CoA moiety does not exchange during catalysis, which

blue form an intertwined dimer depicted in cartoon and surface
representations. (B) Family III CoA transferases form an interlocked
dimer. Shown in surface representation are Mct subunit A in orange
and subunit B in transparent blue. The polypeptide chains are
interlocked and each is threaded through a hole in the neighboring
subunit, as represented by the pictogram in the lower right corner.

is consistent with our biochemical observations. This is also
supported by previous experiments that concluded through
radioactive labeling that no external mesaconate was involved
in the reaction mechanism of Mct.
1
Notably, electron densities
in different active sites in the ASU allowed us to place the
Asp165−mesaconate anhydride in the C1- as well as the C4-
bound orientation (Figure 6). We did not observe any electron
density that would accommodate an additional mesaconate
molecule in any of the active sites. Altogether, these structures
suggest that the intra-molecular transfer follows a similar
mechanism as canonical inter-molecular, family III transferases
that work with two distinct substrates�except that the
substrate is not exchanged and may passively re-orient itself
during catalysis. A small pocket around Arg47 appears large
enough for mesaconate to change orientation randomly.
Supporting this hypothesis, in one active site, we actually
observed clear electron density for a β-aspartyl-CoA
intermediate at Asp165 and a free mesaconate molecule in
the aforementioned pocket (Figure 6D).
In summary, our structure with bound reaction intermediate
states provides additional evidence and an explanation of how
Mct catalyzes the intra-molecular CoA transfer favoring it over
an inter-molecular transfer. Note that we did not observe any
significant conformational changes between the apo form and
the substrate-bound form of Mct (Figure 5A). This steric
constraint of the apoenzyme together with the tight binding of
CoA may effectively prevent access to the active site (Figure
5B−E), explaining how Mct is able to exclude other CoA
acceptor carboxylic acids during the interconversion of the two
forms of mesaconyl-CoA. Based on our crystal structures with
different substrate-bound states (Figure 6B−E), Mct follows
the canonical reaction mechanism proposed for the other
family III CoA transferases (Figure 6A) with neither
conformational changes nor exchanges of substrates taking
place during the reaction.
■
DISCUSSION
Here, we biochemically and structurally characterized Mct, an
unusual family III/Frc family CoA transferase that catalyzes an

intra-molecular CoA transfer. Our structure with covalently
enzyme-bound intermediates provides evidence that the
enzyme follows the mechanism for inter-molecular family
III/Frc family CoA transferases as proposed by Berthold et
al.
10
Based on our data, we suggest that upon mesaconyl-CoA
entering the active site, Asp165 attacks the thioester bond,
forming a mesaconyl-C1-aspartate anhydride and free CoA.
The Asp165-bound mesaconate is displaced by an attack of the
free CoA, resulting in a β-aspartyl-CoA, and releasing
mesaconate into the active site cavity, where it can freely
rotate within an extended pocket close to the catalytically
active aspartate residue. At this step, any of the two carboxyl
groups of mesaconate can attack the aspartyl-CoA, yielding
either mesaconyl-C1-CoA or mesaconyl-C4-CoA.
The proposed reaction mechanism alone, however, does not
explain why the reaction is specific for an intra-molecular
transfer and how CoA transfer to other acceptor acids is
prevented. The tight coordination of the CoA moiety
effectively closes the active site and leads to an enclosed,
“corked-up” reaction chamber, excluding diffusion of molecules
in or out of the active site. Additionally, we did not observe any
significant conformational changes in our two crystal
structures, which could allow mesaconate to leave the active
site or other acceptor acids to enter. While it could be in
principle possible that an alternative acceptor acid may become
trapped in the active site before mesaconyl-CoA or another
CoA donor threads into the active site tunnel, this seems to be
an unlikely event, as our assays with alternative acceptor acids
showed that inter-molecular transfer is extremely rare and only
takes place at very high, nonphysiologically relevant concen-
trations of these acids. Such a trapped acceptor molecule could
interfere with the re-orientation of the mesaconate released
from mesaconyl-CoA, rather resulting in the re-formation of
the mesaconyl-CoA than of an alternative CoA thioester.
Interestingly, not all tested potential acceptor acids could serve
as a substrate. In particular, acetate that should be small
enough to occupy the active site cavity was not used by Mct.
On the other hand, succinate was accepted in the presence of
varying CoA donors. Yet, Mct showed only poor catalytic
efficiency (at least 6 orders of magnitude lower than for the
intra-molecular CoA transfer) with succinate as the CoA
acceptor. Preventing the diffusion of substrates in and out of
the active site is likely the reason why the Mct reaction
proceeds so fast in comparison to the inter-molecular transfers
catalyzed by the other family III CoA transferases.
10,20,34−38
In conclusion, our data provide detailed molecular insights
into the structural and mechanistic differences between intra-
and inter-molecular family III CoA transferases, explaining how
“corking up” the active site with the CoA substrate allows Mct
to achieve excellent selectivity toward its native substrates,
efficiently preventing unwanted side reactions.
