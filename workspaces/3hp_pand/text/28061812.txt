Abstract
Background: Acetyl-CoA-derived chemicals are suitable for multiple applications in many industries. The bio-production
of these chemicals has become imperative owing to the economic and environmental problems. However, acetate
overflow is the major drawback for acetyl-CoA-derived chemicals production. Approaches for overcoming acetate
overflow may be beneficial for the production of acetyl-CoA-derived chemicals.
Results: In this study, a transcriptional regulator iclR was knocked out in E.coli BL21(DE3) to overcome acetate overflow
and improve the chemicals production. Two important acet yl-CoA-derived chemicals, phloroglucinol (PG) and
3-hydroxypropionate (3HP) were used to evaluate it. It is revealed that knockout of iclR significantly increased
expressions of aceBAK operon. The cell yields and glucose utilization efficiencies were higher than those of control
strains. The acetate concentrations were decreased by more than 50% and the productions of PG and 3HP were
increased more than twice in iclR mutants. The effects of iclR knockout on cell physiology, cell metabolism and
production of acetyl-CoA-derived chemicals were similar to those of arcA knockout in our previous study. However, the
arcA-iclR double mutants couldn ’t gain higher productions of PG and 3HP. The mechanisms are unclear and needed to
be resolved in future.
Conclusions: Knockout of iclR significantly increased gene expression of aceBAK operon and concomitantly activated
glyoxylate pathway. This genetic modification may be a good way to overcome acetate overflow, and improve the
production of a wide range of acetyl-CoA-derived chemicals.

Background
Acetyl-CoA-derived chemicals, including polyhydrox-
yalkanoates, isoprenoids, polyketides, lipids and butyr-
ate, are suitable for multiple applications in food
additive, medicine, agriculture, cosmetic, and chemical
industries [1 – 3]. The bio-production of acetyl-CoA-
derived chemicals has becom ei m p e r a t i v eo w i n gt ot h e
diminishing petroleum reserves and growing environ-
mental concerns [4]. To date, Escherichia coli remains
one of the most widely used hosts in recombinant bio-
processes because of its low manufacturing cost and
easy manipulation [5, 6]. The bio-production of acetyl-
CoA-derived chemicals through engineering Escherichia
coli has made significant progresses in recent years. How-
ever, it is worth mentioning that acetyl-CoA can be
converted to acetate through the acetate kinase/phos-
phate acetyl transferase (AckA-Pta) pathway when cells
grow rapidly on glucose abundant conditions, also
known as ‘acetate overflow ’ [7– 9] (Fig. 1). Acetate ex-
cretion affects the cell density, biomass accumulation
and macromolecule biosynthesis even at concentrations
as low as 0.5 g/l [10, 11]. Mutations in both ackA and
pta have been reported a strong reduction of acetate
production. However, this is at the expense of the cell
growth rate and is accompanied by an increase in the
production of other by-products such as formate and
lactate [12]. So, decreasing the undesirable conversion
from acetyl-CoA to acetate may be beneficial for acetyl-
CoA-derived chemicals production. As predicted, our

previous study has revealed that knockout of arcA in
E.coli BL21(DE3) exhibited surprising efficacy of over-
coming acetate formation, and the productions of
acetyl-CoA-derived chemicals PG and 3HP were im-
proved by 2.25-fold and 2.08-fold, respectively [13].
Acetate overflow is observed in all Escherichia coli
strains but the extent can differ greatly between the
various strains [7, 14]. E.coli BL21 strains showed lower
acetate yields as compared to K12 strains [15, 16]. C 13-
Constrained metabolic flux analysis revealed that the
lower acetate yields in BL21 were caused by the higher
activation of glyoxylate pathway and acetate assimila-
tion pathway [15, 17]. IclR (isocitrate lyase regulator) is
a local regulator, repressing the gene expression of aceBAK
operon, which codes for the glyoxylate pathway enzymes
malate synthase (AceB), isocitrate lyase (AceA) and iso-
citrate dehydrogenase kinase/phosphatase(AceK) [18 – 20]
(Fig. 1). Decreasing the gene expression of iclR may ac-
tivate glyoxylate pathway and decrease acetate forma-
tion. If not, lots of acetyl-CoA would be transformed to
acetate through AckA-Pta pathway, which in turn
starve the precursor for the acetyl-CoA-derived chemi-
cals production and hurt the yields.
In this study, the iclR gene of E.coli BL21(DE3) was
knocked out, and the resultant strain was used to pro-
duce two acetyl-CoA-derived chemicals, phloroglucinol
(PG) and 3-hydroxypropionate (3HP) which are both
important bulk chemicals [21, 22]. The effects of iclR
deletion on gene expression of aceBAK operon, the cell
physiology and metabolism were also determined and
discussed. As arcA deletion also had positive effects on
PG and 3HP production, the cell physiology and me-
tabolism and production of acetyl-CoA-derived chemi-
cals in E.coli BL21(DE3) arcA-iclR double mutant were
also investigated in this study.
Methods
Strains construction
The oligonucleotide primers used in this study were
listed in Table 1, and the recombinant plasmids and
strains used in this study were listed in Table 2. The iclR
mutants were constructed using P1 phage transduction
from BL21(DE3) and arcA single mutant Q1949 as pre-
viously described [23]. The donor strain of E.coli
BW25113 iclR::kan (JW3978) was purchased from the
Keio collection [24]. The kanamycin genes were re-
moved by a temperature-sensitive plasmid of pCP20,
and the resultant strains were named as Q2280 and
Q2138, respectively . The four subunits of accA, accD
and accBC from E.coli were cloned into pACYCDuet-1,
resulting in plasmid pA- accADBC. The phlD gene from
P. fluorescens Pf5 (ATCC BAA -477) and mar gene from
E.coli were cloned into pET30a, resulting in plasmid
pET-phlDmar. [13, 22] The plasmids pA- accADBC and
pET-phlDmar were transformed into E.coli BL21(DE3),
arcA mutant Q1949, iclR mutant Q2280 and arcA-iclR

double mutant Q2138 to generate PG-producing strains
Q1944, Q1963, Q2283 and Q2176. The mcr-N and mcr-C
(N940V/ K 1106W/ S 1114R) from Chloroflexus aurantiacus
were cloned into pETDuet-1, resulting in plasmid
pMCR-N-C [25]. The plasmids pA- accADBC and
pMCR-N-C were also transformed into E.coli
BL21(DE3), Q1949, Q2280 and Q2138 to generate 3HP
-producing strains Q2204, Q2284, Q2285 and Q2286.
Gene expression by RT-PCR
Total RNAs from BL21(DE3) and Q2280 were isolated
using Bacteria RNA Kit (omega) according to the manu-
facturer’s recommendations. The quantity and purity of
RNAs were determined by optical density measurements
at 260nm and 280nm by 1% agarose gel electrophoresis.
Reverse-transcription (RT)-PCR reactions were carried
out in a PCR thermocycler using TransScrip® One-step
gDNA removal and cDNA synthesis kit. The reaction
mix was first incubated 10min at 25°C and then incu-
bated 30 min at 42°C for reverse transcription. Inacti-
vated gDNA remover by heating 5 s at 85°C. Gene
expression levels of aceBAK operon in BL21(DE3) and
iclR mutant Q2280 were analyzed by PCR amplification
with primers in Table 1. The gene transcription levels of
16S rRNA were used as inner reference for
normalization.

Shake-flask cultivation of the recombinant E.coli strains
Shake-flask experiments were carried out in triplicate in
250 ml flask containing 50 ml fermentation medium.
The strains were grown overnight at 37°C with shaking
in LB broth, and then 1:50 diluted into 50 ml fermenta-
tion medium. When OD 600 of the culture reached about
0.6, IPTG was added to a final concentration of 0.1 mM/l
and further incubated at 30°C. 10 mg/l Biotin and 20mM/l
NaHCO3 were needed for 3HP production. The fermenta-
tion medium for PG production contains 9.8 g/l
K2HPO43H2O, 2.1 g/l citric acid H2O, 0.3 g/l ferric am-
monium citrate, 3.0 g/l (NH 4)2SO4, 0.2 g/l MgSO 47H2O,
20 g/l glucose and 1000 × trace mental (3.7 g/l
(NH4)6Mo7O244H2O, 2.9 g/l ZnSO 47H2O, 24.7 g/l
H3BO3, 2.5 g/l CuSO 45H2O, 15.8 g/l MnCl 24H2O). The
fermentation medium for 3HP production contains 14 g/l
K2HPO43H2O, 5.2 g/l KH 2PO4, 1 g/l NaCl, 1 g/l NH 4Cl,
0.25 g/l MgSO 47H2O, 0.2 g/l yeast extract, 20 g/l glucose.
The OD 600 of the culture and the concentrations of
residual glucose were measured during the whole fermen-
tation course.
Analytical methods
The cell concentration was measured by the optical
density of the culture at 600 nm, and the value of density
was converted to cell dry weight (CDW) based on that
one unit of OD 600 was equivalent to 0.36 g/l CDW. The
concentration of residual glucose was quantified by using
an SBA-40D Biological Sensing Analyzer. The concentra-
tion of PG in the fermentation supernatant was quantified
using the colorimetric reaction at OD 446 between cinna-
maldehyde and PG. [26] The concentrations of 3HP and
acetate in medium were determined by HPLC as de-
scribed previously [13, 27].
Results
Knockout of iclR increased gene expression of aceBAK
operon
IclR is a transcriptional re gulator that regulates gene
expression of aceBAK operon [18, 20]. In order to in-
vestigate the effect of iclR deletion on gene expression
of aceBAK operon, the total RNAs of wild strain
BL21(DE3) and iclR mutant strain Q2280 were ex-
tracted to carry out the RT-PCR reaction. The gene
transcription levels of 16S rRNA were used as inner
reference for normalization. As shown in Fig. 2, the
mRNA levels of aceB, aceA and aceK in iclR mutant
Q2280 were much higher than those of the wild-type
strain BL21(DE3), while the mRNA levels of 16S rRNA
were very similar in these two strains, suggesting that
iclR deletion could up-regulate the gene expression of
aceBAK operon.
Effects of iclR knockout on cell physiology and metabolism
The iclR mutants were constructed using P1 phage
transduction and the recombinant plasmids were trans-
formed for PG and 3HP production. During the cultiva-
tion process, the OD 600 and residual glucose
concentrations of the control strains (Q1944 and
Q2204) and iclR mutants (Q2283 and Q2285) were mea-
sured to investigate the effects of iclR deletion on cell
growth and glucose utilization. As shown in Fig. 3 and
Fig. 4, the iclR mutants showed similar cell dry weight
(CDW) as compared to their corresponding control
strains. After fermentation, the cell dry weight of PG-
producing strains Q1944 and Q2283 were 2.05 ± 0.06 g/l
and 2.08 ± 0.09 g/l, while 3HP-producing strains Q2204
and Q2285 accumulated 2.64 ± 0.13 g/l and 2.76 ±
0.22 g/l CDW, respectively. These results drew a con-
clusion that deletion of iclR had no obvious effect on cell
growth during the bio-production of PG and 3HP. Mean-
while, the glucose consumptions and cell yields were also
compared. The glucose consumptions of iclR mutants
obviously decreased since IPTG induction. Finally, the
residual glucose concentrations of iclR mutants Q2283
and Q2285 were significantl y higher than their corre-
sponding control strains (Fig. 3). Knockout of iclR
decreased the glucose consumptions without impairing
the cell dry weight, therefore, iclR mutants possessed
higher cell yields. It is speculated that the genetic

modification of iclR knockout could improve the glucose
utilization efficiency and reduce the manufacturing cost
in industrial applications.
Acetate is the major undesirable metabolite in the pro-
duction of acetyl-CoA-derived chemicals. After cultiva-
tion, the control strain Q1944 and Q2204 produced
3.14 ± 0.13 g/l and 5.86 ± 0.05 g/l acetate, while the iclR
mutants Q2283 and Q2285 produced 1.41 ± 0.01 g/l and
2.12 ± 0.13 g/l acetate, decreased by 55% and 64%, re-
spectively. In conclusion, iclR deletion showed dramatic
effects on glucose utilization efficiency and acetate for-
mation during the process of PG and 3HP production.
However, the cell growth was very similar between the
control strains and iclR mutants.
Knockout of iclR improved PG and 3HP production
The effects of iclR deletion on PG and 3HP production
were also investigated (Fig. 4). The PG production of
iclR mutant Q2283 was 0.71 ± 0.06 g/l, showing 1.7-time
higher than that of the control strain Q1944. The

glucose conversion efficiency to PG was increased by
2.1-fold, from 2.47% to 5.19%. In 3HP production, the
iclR mutant Q2285 produced 1.41 ± 0.22 g/l 3HP , showing
1.9-time higher than that of the control strain Q2204. The
glucose conversion efficiency to 3HP was increased by
2.0-fold, from 3.65% to 7.58%. Knockout of iclR signifi-
cantly improved the production of acetyl-CoA-derived
chemicals and the glucose conversion efficiency.
Effects of arcA and iclR knockouts on cell physiology and
metabolism
Summarizing the above results, deletion of arcA or iclR
can improve the cell yield and glucose utilization effi-
ciency and repress the acetate formation, so we are curi-
ous whether the double knockout of arcA and iclR
should further affect the cell physiology and metabolism.
The detailed comparison of the cell growth, glucose
consumption, cell yield and acetate production in arcA
mutants, iclR mutants and arcA-iclR double mutants
were also made. As shown in Fig. 3 and Fig. 4, the cell
growth was seriously impaired through arcA deletion.
While, it was not affected in iclR mutants and arcA-iclR
double mutants. The double mutants Q2176 and
Q2286 produced 2.03 ± 0.22 g/l and 2.66 ± 0.31 g/l
CDW, the same as the control strains of 2.05 ± 0.06 g/l
and 2.64 ± 0.12 g/l CDW. In addition, the cell yields of
arcA-iclR double mutants were slightly higher than
those of the control strains, the arcA single mutants
and the iclR single mutants. It was assumed that the
combined deletion of arcA and iclR was beneficial for
the conversion from glucose to the biomass.
All the mutant strains showed reduced acetate produc-
tions as compared to the control strains (Fig. 4). How-
ever, the ability to overcome acetate formation of arcA-
iclR double mutants was less than that of the arcA single
mutants. The regulatory mechanisms remained unclear
and needed to be resolved.
Effects of arcA and iclR knockouts on PG and 3HP
production
The arcA-iclR double mutants showed lower produc-
tions of PG and 3HP than the arcA single mutants. The
productions of PG and 3HP in arcA single mutants were
increased by 2.25-fold and 2.83-fold than those in the
control strains Q1944 and Q2204, while they were only
increased by 1.58-fold and 2.15-fold in arcA-iclR double
mutants. Consistent with that effects, the arcA-iclR
double mutants also showed lower glucose conversion
efficiencies than the arcA single mutants. The glucose
conversions efficiencies to PG and 3HP in arcA single
mutants were 6.76% and 11.7% respectively, while they
were only 5.35% and 8.89% in arcA-iclR double mutants.
Taken together, both mutants of arcA and iclR
showed positive effects on the productions and glucose
conversion efficiencies to PG and 3HP. However the
arcA single mutants had the most prominent results,
and the iclR single mutants, the arcA-iclR double mu-
tants showed the similar effects on these aspects.
Discussion
The excretion and assimilation of acetate usually undergo
a metabolic switch when cells growing on glucose. Acetate
is produced by the Pta-AckA pathway in exponential
growth phase, and it is converted to acetyl-CoA by the ca-
talysis of acetyl-CoA synthetase (Acs) with the cells con-
vert to stationary phase [28]. As the intracellular enzyme
pyroposphatase removes the intermediate pyrophosphate,
the reaction from acetate to acetyl-CoA is irreversible.
Acetyl-CoA was utilized to generate ATP and metabolic
intermediates for the cellular activities and exogenous
genes expression via TCA cycle and glyoxylate shunt. So,
acetate overflow is not only detrimental to cell growth and
macromolecular biosynthesis, it is also a loss of carbon
and therefore an economic sink [12]. To date, numerous
approaches have been reported to overcome acetate excre-
tion. If some of these approaches could also be used to
improve the production of target compounds and de-
crease the production cost, these studies will have im-
portant significance and market value. In this study, the
effects of arcA and/or iclR deletion on the production
of acetyl-CoA-derived chemicals were determined and
discussed. The results revealed that the arcA and/or
iclR deletion significantly decreased the acetate concen-
trations. All the mutants sh owed higher cell yields and
higher glucose utilization efficiencies. More import-
antly, the productions of PG and 3HP were increased
than those of the control strains (Fig. 3 and Fig. 4). So,
overcoming acetate overflow through arcA and/or iclR
deletion could improve the production of acetyl-CoA-
derived chemicals. Acetate overflow is observed in all
Escherichia coli strains, however, the extent is very dif-
ferent between the K-12 and B strains, which are the
most common E.coli strains for laboratorial and bio-
technological applications [6]. BL21 strains showed less
acetate accumulations than K-12 strains during the
process of high cell-density fermentation with glucose
as the sole carbon. A comparison of the genome se-
quences between BL21 and K12 strains showed that BL21
strains possessed rare codons in arcA and two mutations
in the promoter region of iclR [29]. These variations of
BL21 resulted in the reduced expressions of arcA and iclR,
presumably contributing to the lower acetate accumula-
tion. A previous research revealed that the central
metabolic fluxes of BL21(DE3), especially with respect
to the TCA fluxes, the glyoxylate pathway and the pen-
tose pathway were similar to that of the K12 strains
with arcA and iclR deletion [29]. Meanwhile, the acetate
concentration of E. coli MG1655 Δ arcA Δ iclR was
Liu et al. BMC Microbiology  (2017) 17:10 Page 6 of 9
decreased to the value of BL21(DE3) [30]. Considering all
that, the expression levels of arcA and iclR in BL21 strains
were lower than K12 strains due to the variations in rare
codons and promoter region, respectively. A previous
study considered that the levels of iclR gene and its gene
products in E. coli BL21 strains were much lower com-
pared to in K12 strains, probably, the iclR levels were so
low that a complete deletion of iclR [14]. However, our re-
sults revealed that knockout of iclR in BL21(DE3) could
also significantly decrease acetate producitons by more
than 50% and improve the PG and 3HP productions by
more than twice. Thus, genetic modifications of iclR in
K12 and BL21 strains both had obvious effect on over-
coming acetate overflow, though the iclR levels were
already very low in BL21 strains.
ArcA (anaerobic redox control) is the cytosolic re-
sponse regulator of the dual-component regulator sys-
tem ArcAB [31, 32]. It is reported that phosphorylated
ArcA can repress genes expression of TCA cycle and
glyoxylate shunt, such as gltA, acnAB, icdA, sucABCD,
sdhCDAB, fumA, mdh, and aceB [33– 35]. Our previous
results demonstrated that the acetate concentrations of
arcA mutants in BL21(DE3) were decreased by more
than 70% and the productions of PG and 3HP were in-
creased by more than twice. The decreased acetate con-
centrations and increased PG and 3HP productions of
arcA mutants could be caused by the following reasons:
the higher activity of TCA cycle and glyoxylate pathway;
the more metabolic flux through pyruvate dehydrogen-
ase (PDH) complex, which catalyzes pyruvate to acetyl-
CoA [13, 32, 36]. IclR (isocitrate lyase regulator) is a
local regulator, inhibiting genes expression of aceBAK
operon in glyoxylate pathway. Knockout of iclR signifi-
cantly increased gene expression of aceBAK operon ac-
cording to the results of RT-PCR (Fig. 2). In glyoxylate
pathway, isocitrate is directly split into succinate and
glyoxylate without CO 2 loss, it may be used to explain
the fact that iclR mutants showed higher cell yields than
their corresponding control strains. Glyoxylate pathway
is the main pathway for acetate assimilation, knockout
of iclR can activate the glyoxylate pathway and promote
the conversion from acetate to acetyl-CoA [17, 37]. In
addtion, the metabolic flux from phosphoenolpyruvic
acid (PEP) to acetyl-CoA is obviously increased in iclR
mutant strains [29]. So, knockout of iclR can elevate the
metabolic flux from acetate to acetyl-CoA and from PEP
to acetyl-CoA. On the one hand, acetyl-CoA is metabo-
lized to provide the energy and precursors for exogenous
genes expression in recombinant pathways. And on the
other hand, acetyl-CoA is the direct substrate for the
production of acetyl-CoA-derived chemicals. Therefore,
the iclR knockout can decrease the acetate formation
and increase the production of acetyl-CoA-derived
chemicals.
To summarize, the arcA deletion and iclR deletion
were observed to behave similar effects on the cell
physiology and metabolism, except the cell growth. The
cell growth of arcA mutants was much lower than their
corresponding control strains, however it was not im-
paired in iclR mutants. It still remains unclear what
causes this phenomenon. Then, the arcA and iclR
double mutants were also constructed to study the effects
on the cell physiology, the metabolism and the production
of acetyl-CoA-derived chemicals. Surprisingly, the double
mutants had no better results for PG and 3HP produc-
tions than those of arcA and iclR single mutants. Mean-
while, the glucose conversion efficiencies and the abilities
for overcoming acetate formation were also lower than
those of the arcA single mutants. These results proved
that the effects of polygenic modification on the produ-
citon of target compounds may not be better than the
single genic modification, especially by the global regu-
lators. A global regulator usually controls several op-
erons that belong to different groups [36]. Engineering
of a global regulator could show pleiotropic phenotypes
and variations in metabolic pathways and carbon fluxes.
It is hard to determine the certain gene or the single
pathway with a global regulator was modified. Furth-
more, the results will be more unpredictable and com-
plex when the several regulators are combined
modified. In this study, why the effects of arcA-iclR
double mutant on overcoming acetate overflow and im-
proving the acetyl-CoA-derived chemicals production
were less than the arcA single mutants? A previous
study reported that arcA-iclR deletion of E. coli K12
MG1655 had dramatic effects on the cell physiology
and metabolism. However, no significant differences of
metabolic flux were observed between the wild type
BL21(DE3) and the arcA-iclR double mutant [14]. The
tiny variations of metabolic flux in BL21(DE3) arcA-iclR
double mutant may lead to the less effects on the cell
physiology and metabolism. However, the exact mecha-
nisms would be unravelled by determining the distribu-
tion of metabolic fluxes in arcA single mutant, iclR
single mutant and arcA-iclR double mutant in future.
Conclusions
Acetate overflow is the major drawback for acetyl-CoA-
derived chemicals production. Approaches for overcom-
ing acetate overflow may be beneficial for the production
of acetyl-CoA-derived chemicals. IclR is a transcriptional
regulator that regulates gene expression of aceBAK op-
eron in glyoxylate pathway. In this work, iclR was knocked
out in E. coli BL21(DE3) to construct a mutant strain, and
the productions of two important acetyl-CoA-derived che-
micals, phloroglucinol and 3-hydroxypropionate were
used to evaluate it. The results revealed that knockout of
iclR significantly improved gene expression of aceBAK

operon. The iclR mutants showed higher cell yields and
higher glucose utilization efficiencies without sacrificing
cell growth. The acetate concentrations were decreased by
more than 50%. More importantly, the productions of PG
and 3HP were 2-times higher than those of control
strains. These phenomena of iclR knockout were similar
to those of the global regulator arcA knockout in our
previous study. However, the arcA-iclR double mutants
could not produce higher productions of PG and 3HP.
Considering all that, the genetic modification of iclR
would be a good choice to improve the production of a
wide range of acetyl-CoA-derived chemicals in industry.
