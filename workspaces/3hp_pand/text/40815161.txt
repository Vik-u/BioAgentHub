ABSTRACT: 3-Hydroxypropionic acid (3-HP) serves as a crucial
platform chemical with diverse applications across various industries. In
this study, the oxaloacetate pathway was utilized for 3-HP production.
This pathway involves the decarboxylation of oxaloacetate into malonic
semialdehyde, catalyzed by branched-chain α-keto acid decarboxylase
(KdcA), which is subsequently reduced to 3-HP by dehydrogenases.
Directed evolution of KdcA was carried out to enhance its catalytic
efficiency toward oxaloacetate, resulting in a KdcA
M8
mutant with the
following substitutions: S286R, S287T, F381H, F382P, L534S, L535F,
M538T, and G539F. Compared to wild-type (WT) KdcA, KdcA
M8
exhibits a lower K
M
value toward oxaloacetate (K
M
= 1.15 mM vs K
M
>
25 mM). Among these mutations, the single mutants S286R and S287T
exhibited 5.5-fold and 1.3-fold increased activities, respectively. Instead
of WT KdcA, the KdcA
M8
mutant was integrated into Escherichia coli (E. coli) BL21 strain, resulting in the production of 3-HP at a
concentration of 0.11 mM. To further improve 3-HP production, two dehydrogenases were compared for the downstream
conversion of malonic semialdehyde into 3-HP, and two carboxylases were explored to enhance the upstream precursor supply of
oxaloacetate. Additionally, the growth conditions were optimized. Finally, a nonnatural oxaloacetate pathway was successfully
engineered in the E. coli BL21 strain, achieving a 3-HP titer of approximately 0.71 mM from glucose. This work illustrates that
protein engineering is a powerful tool for modulating flux in the target pathway and holds promise for the future development of the
oxaloacetate pathway to improve the 3-HP yield.

INTRODUCTION
In recent years, there has been a significant focus on producing
chemicals, fuels, and materials from renewable resources to
achieve economic and social benefits. This shift toward
sustainable biomanufacturing is driven by global environmental
concerns and an anticipated shortage of fossil resources.
1
To
achieve this, it will be essential to develop efficient biosynthesis
methods to enable large-scale production of chemicals.
2
3-Hydroxypropionic acid (3-HP) is considered a valuable
chemical derived from biomass for various industrial
applications. It is used as a precursor for the synthesis of
several important compounds such as 1,3-propanediol, acrylic
acid, malonate, biodegradable polymers, and others.
3,4
Tradi-
tionally, 3-HP has been synthesized through various chemical
routes; however, these methods are not commercially feasible
due to high costs, the toxicity of raw materials, and
environmental concerns.
5,6
In contrast, biological synthesis of
3-HP using renewable feedstock has attracted significant
attention.
4
Recently, a novel oxaloacetate pathway for 3-HP
production was proposed, wherein oxaloacetate is converted to
malonic semialdehyde by an α-ketoacid decarboxylase,
followed by its reduction to 3-HP.
7
Two α-ketoacid
decarboxylases, benzoylformate decarboxylase (MdlC) from
Pseudomonas putida (P. putida) E23 and branched-chain α-
ketoacid decarboxylase (KdcA) from Lactococcus lactis (L.
lactis), have been identified as having activity toward
oxaloacetate, with reported activities of 3.420 and 1.825 U/
mg, respectively.
7
MdlC has been successfully applied in the
oxaloacetate pathway, achieving the highest reported 3-HP
production level of 0.2 M in Saccharomyces cerevisiae (S.
cerevisiae).
7
However, the potential of KdcA in 3-HP
biosynthesis via this pathway has not yet been explored. In
the oxaloacetate pathway, α-ketoacid decarboxylase is critical
for directing the metabolic flux from oxaloacetate to 3-HP.

Both MdlC and KdcA are rate-limiting enzymes in this
pathway due to their low activities toward the nonnative
substrate, oxaloacetate. Therefore, enhancing the activity and
selectivity of either MdlC or KdcA through protein engineering
would be beneficial for improving 3-HP production via the
oxaloacetate pathway.
Directed evolution, a widely used method for protein
engineering, has been very effective in modifying natural
enzymes to obtain desired properties.
8,9
The success of a
directed evolution experiment depends on two key factors: the
creation of high-quality mutant libraries and the use of efficient
high-throughput screening or selection methods. Advances in
molecular biology have led to the development of techniques
such as random mutagenesis, focused mutagenesis, and gene
recombination, enabling the generation of diverse and high-
quality mutant libraries.
10
In parallel, the outcome of directed
evolution experiments is critically dependent on the screening
or selection methods used to identify the desired mutants.
11
Therefore, developing effective screening or selection methods
is essential.
In a previous study, Liu et al. demonstrated a growth
selection system for the directed evolution of the C-terminal
domain of malonyl-CoA reductase (MCR-C).
12
Specifically, a
β-alanine auxotrophic strain, BL21(DE3) ΔpanD, was
generated by deleting the essential gene L -aspartate-α-
decarboxylase (panD). To restore β-alanine biosynthesis, a
synthetic pathway involving MCR-C and β-alanine-pyruvate
aminotransferase (BAPAT) as key enzymes was introduced
into the host, thereby creating a strong in vivo correlation
between the host phenotype and MCR-C activity. The results

showed that after one round of selection, several active MCR-
C variants were isolated, with activity increases ranging from
56 to 92%.
12
Furthermore, it was suggested that this selection
system can automatically eliminate undesired variants, isolating
only active variants from the library by monitoring cell growth
via cell density in a liquid medium and colony formation or
size on a solid medium. Given the efficiency of this selection
system, it was proposed that a similar approach could be
adopted for the directed evolution of KdcA.
In this study, we explored the biosynthesis of 3-HP via the
oxaloacetate pathway in Escherichia coli (E. coli) (Figure 1A).
The KdcA was chosen as the key enzyme in the
decarboxylation of oxaloacetate. To improve its catalytic
efficiency toward oxaloacetate, the directed evolution of
KdcA was employed based on a growth selection system.
Initially, both wild-type (WT) KdcA and engineered KdcA
were compared in the biosynthesis of 3-HP. To further
improve 3-HP production, optimization strategies were
implemented. These included comparing the in vivo perform-
ance of dehydrogenases from E. coli and P. putida for
downstream conversion, overexpressing phosphoenolpyruvate
carboxylase and pyruvate carboxylase to increase the supply of
the oxaloacetate precursor, and fine-tuning growth conditions.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Growth Selection-Based Evolution of KdcA. To
achieve the desired catalytic efficiency of KdcA for 3-HP
production via the oxaloacetate pathway, a growth selection
system was adopted for the directed evolution of KdcA. In this
system, the BL21(DE3) ΔpanD strain was generated by
CRISPR-Cas9-mediated deletion of the panD gene, resulting in
a strain that is unable to grow in an M9 medium without the
addition of β-alanine or pantothenate. Subsequently, an
alternative β-alanine biosynthetic pathway was constructed
by introducing the genes encoding KdcA and β-alanine-
pyruvate aminotransferase (BAPAT) into BL21(DE3) ΔpanD.
In the engineered BL21(DE3) ΔpanD strain, oxaloacetate
derived from glucose is converted to malonic semialdehyde by
KdcA, which is subsequently converted into alanine by BAPAT
(Figure 1B). Under these conditions, cell growth is
significantly linked to KdcA, which drives the flux of
oxaloacetate into β-alanine. As shown in Supplementary Figure
2, BL21(DE3) ΔpanD/pKdcA and BL21(DE3) ΔpanD/
pBAPAT strains were unable to grow in an M9 medium.
Also, the BL21(DE3) ΔpanD/pKdcA-BAPAT strain, which
coexpresses KdcA and BAPAT, exhibited very limited cell
growth in an M9 medium. In contrast, when supplied with 50
μM β-alanine, these strains were able to recover growth in 24 h
of incubation. These results suggest that the BL21(DE3)
ΔpanD strain is potentially a suitable host for the evolution of
enzymes (e.g., KdcA) related to the biosynthesis of β-alanine.
Furthermore, the inability of the BL21(DE3) ΔpanD strain
coexpressing KdcA and BAPAT to restore growth indicates
that KdcA exhibits low catalytic efficiency toward oxaloacetate.
To increase the chance of success in the directed evolution
rounds, we first analyzed the structure of KdcA (PDB: 2VBG)
and selected eight residues in the binding pocket (Figure 2A).
Among them, residues S286, F381, and M538 reside in the
enzyme’s active site and influence catalytic activity.
13
The
neighboring residues S287, F382, and G539 may play similar
roles. Additionally, two other residues, L534 and L535, are
positioned near the active site and may contribute to substrate
recognition and docking. Therefore, mutations at these eight
residues were likely to enhance the enzyme’s activity and
affinity toward oxaloacetate. These residues were grouped into
S286−S287, F381−F382, L534−L535, and M538−G539 for
simultaneous saturation mutagenesis, as this pairing strategy
facilitated the efficient construction of the mutation library via
PCR. Each group was mutated using two NNK codons. The
selection process, as outlined in Figure 1C, consisted of four
rounds of evolution in BL21(DE3) ΔpanD/pKdcA-BAPAT
strain, during which positive KdcA variants were identified
based on colony formation and size on the solid medium. The
first round involved the selection of a mutant library at codons
286−287, with the positive variant selected for the second
round of evolution. In the second round, saturation muta-
genesis was introduced in the F381−F382 groups. Subsequent
rounds of evolution, the third and fourth, focused on
introducing mutant libraries at codons 534−535 and 538−
539, respectively. Although the mutant libraries were smaller
than those created by random mutation or combining different
groups, this strategy has been successfully used in directed
evolution of amine-forming or converting enzymes.
14
During
the four rounds of evolution, one colony was selected for
sequencing after 6 days of incubation in the first round, which
revealed the mutations S286R/S287T occurred in KdcA. In
the second and third rounds, three colonies were sequenced
after 5 days of incubation, yielding KdcA variants carrying the
mutations S286R/S287T/F381H/F382P and S286R/S287T/
F381H/F382P/M538T/G539F, respectively. In the fourth

round, five colonies were ultimately grown on M9 agar plates
after 4 days of incubation (Supplementary Figure 3C). Two
large colonies were selected for sequencing, which showed that
both harbored a KdcA variant with the following amino acid
changes: S286R/S287T/F381H/F382P/L534S/L535F/
M538T/G539F (referred to as KdcA
M8
). To further validate
these findings, a confirmatory screen was performed by mixing
the identified colonies from each round of selection with the
BL21(DE3) ΔpanD/pKdcA-BAPAT strain, followed by
dilution and plating on M9 agar plates for 5 days of cultivation
(Supplementary Figure 3D). Five large colonies were selected
for sequencing, and all carried the KdcA
M8
variant.
Subsequently, BL21(DE3) ΔpanD strains harboring KdcA
variants identified from the four rounds of evolution, along
with BAPAT, were cultivated in the M9 liquid medium for 5
days. Apparently, the growth of BL21(DE3) ΔpanD strains in
rounds of evolution roughly correlates with the accumulation
of mutations. The most pronounced growth was observed for
the strain harboring the octuple KdcA variant (KdcA
M8
),
compared to strains containing the double, quadruple, and
sextuple KdcA variants (Supplementary Table 4 and Figure
3E). In addition, the protein expression of KdcA
M8
was
analyzed by SDS-PAGE, which demonstrates that, even though
the KdcA
M8
mutant exhibits a visible target band in protein
expression, its insoluble fraction is highly dominant (Supple-
mentary Figure 4). Thus, the reduced soluble expression of
KdcA
M8
compared to the WT KdcA could be one of the issues
that impairs its in vivo activity, resulting in the slow growth of
the variant in the minimal medium.
Expression and Characterization of KdcA Variants.
Protein engineering of KdcA through directed evolution
resulted in the obtainment of the KdcA
M8
variant. The K
M
values of both WT KdcA and KdcA
M8
were subsequently
measured. Using a whole-cell catalyst, KdcA
M8
exhibited a K
M
of 1.15 mM (Supplementary Figure 7), whereas the K
M
of WT
KdcA exceeded 25 mM, as the enzyme remained unsaturated
even at oxaloacetate concentrations as high as 50 mM
(Supplementary Table 5). Previous studies have shown that
K
M
values determined using whole-cell catalysts are often
higher than those obtained from lysates or purified enzymes,
due to the diffusion barrier imposed by the cell membrane.
15,16
Although the K
M
value of KdcA
M8
was measured under the less
favorable conditions in whole cells, KdcA
M8
still showed a
lower K
M
compared to that of WT KdcA as measured under
more favorable conditions in lysate. This strongly suggests that
KdcA
M8
has a higher affinity for oxaloacetate than WT KdcA.
To explore the molecular basis for this enhanced substrate
affinity, a homology model of KdcA
M8
was constructed using
AlphaFold2 based on the X-ray structure of KdcA.
Oxaloacetate was then docked into this model. Upon structural
alignment of WT KdcA and KdcA
M8
(Supplementary Figure
8), the mutations S286R and S287T apparently reduce the size
of the binding pocket as the side chains are enlarged and orient
inward toward the center of the pocket. In contrast, the
mutations F381H and F382P are positioned away from the
pocket center and appear to create additional space within the
binding pocket to accommodate the α/β-carbonyl groups of
oxaloacetate. Mutations at the C-terminal helix, including
L534S, L535F, M538T, and G539F, shift the C-terminal helix
away from the binding pocket due to steric hindrance
(Supplementary Figure 9), particularly from the introduction
of bulkier phenylalanine residues at positions 535 and 539.
This shift results in the displacement of F542 from the binding
pocket, thereby opening the substrate channel. In WT KdcA, it
was noted that F542 blocks the entrance to the active site,
restricting substrate access.
17
Furthermore, among these
mutations, S286R provides a positively charged side chain
that forms a salt bridge and a hydrogen bond with the α-
carbonyl and α-keto groups of oxaloacetate, respectively.
F381H provides a salt bridge between the imidazole ring and
the α-carbonyl group of oxaloacetate, while M538T forms a
hydrogen bond with the β-carbonyl group of oxaloacetate
(Figure 2B). Overall, these potential new interactions between
the substrate and mutated residues can contribute to the
improved affinity of KdcA
M8
toward oxaloacetate.
To evaluate the impact of each mutation on KdcA
M8
, several
KdcA variants were created through site-directed mutagenesis,
including S286R, S287T, F381H, F382P, L534S, L535F,
M538T, and G539F. The decarboxylation activity of these
variants was subsequently measured in vitro. According to the
results shown in Figure 3, the S286R variant exhibited a
catalytic activity of 0.011 μmol min
−1
mg
−1
lysate protein
toward oxaloacetate, which is approximately 5 times higher
than the activity of WT KdcA (0.002 μmol min
−1
mg
−1
lysate
protein), without a significant change in protein expression
levels (Supplementary Figure 5). According to the docking
results shown in Supplementary Figure 10, S286 forms a
hydrogen bond with the ketone group of oxaloacetate in WT
KdcA. In contrast, substituting S286 with arginine, a positively
charged residue with a large side chain, resulted in the
formation of a salt bridge with the carboxyl group of
oxaloacetate in the S286R variant. This salt bridge represents
a significantly stronger interaction than a hydrogen bond.
Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that this substitution
might facilitate the anchoring of the substrate oxaloacetate in
the binding pocket in a favorable orientation for catalysis,
enhancing the enzymatic activity. Substituting S287 with
threonine led to a 30% enhancement in activity compared to
WT KdcA. Previous studies have suggested that shaping the
binding pocket of KdcA and its homologue KivD can influence
both catalytic activity and substrate preference.
18,19
For
example, replacing S286 with leucine in KdcA enhanced its
catalytic activity toward 2-keto-3-deoxy--xylonic acid by
reducing the size of the substrate-binding pocket.
18
Similarly,

protein as the biocatalyst.

3490
replacing S286 with threonine in KivD decreased the pocket
size, leading to improved catalytic activity and an increased
isobutanol-to-isopentanol molar ratio in Synechocystis PCC
6803.
19
Since S287 was next to S286, the improved activity of
the S287T variant toward oxaloacetate could also be attributed
to the reduced size of the binding pocket. For the F381H,
L534S, M538T, and G539F variants, catalytic activity was
slightly lower compared to that of WT KdcA. In contrast, the
F382P and L535F variants exhibited markedly reduced activity,
with levels falling below 0.001 μmol min
−1
mg
−1
lysate protein
(Supplementary Figure 11). Previous studies have indicated
that residues such as S286, F381, and M538 play crucial roles
in shaping the substrate-binding pocket, thereby influencing
both enzyme activity and substrate selectivity.
13
Herein, the
functional impacts of mutations at positions S287, F382, L534,
L535, and G539 suggest that these residues may also play
important functional roles within the binding pocket. Notably,
although the F382P and L535F variants were expressed at
considerable levels (Supplementary Figure 5), both exhibited
substantial loss of activity. This loss may be due to incomplete
folding, where the proteins remain soluble but adopt
conformations in which the active site is too perturbed to
support enzymatic function.
20
Interestingly, the S286R/
F382P/G539F triple mutant exhibited enhanced activity
(0.003 μmol min
−1
mg
−1
lysate protein; Supplementary Figure
11), exceeding that of WT KdcA as well as the individual
F382P and G539F variants. These findings suggest that specific
combinations of mutations can compensate for individual
deleterious effects and lead to enhanced enzymatic activity. In
the case of the S286R/F382P/G539F triple mutant, this
compensatory effect may result from the stabilizing or
reconfiguring influence of the S286R and G539F mutations
on the active site architecture, which could alleviate the
detrimental structural impact of the F382P mutation.
Construction of the Oxaloacetate Pathway for
Biosynthesis of 3-HP in E. coli. To construct and explore
the oxaloacetate pathway for the biosynthesis 3-HP in E. coli,
the strain BP1 was developed, containing KdcA and 3-
hydroxyisobutyrate dehydrogenase (HIBADH) from P. putida
under the control of the T7 promotor, respectively. Expression
of both proteins was successful (Supplementary Figure 6),
while, during 48 h of cultivation, the 3-HP production level
was disappointing (Figure 4B).
Through protein engineering of KdcA, the KdcA
M8
variant
was developed and subsequently tested in the oxaloacetate
pathway in place of WT KdcA that was used in BP1. To
evaluate its performance, strains BP2, BP3, BP4, and BP5 were
constructed, incorporating KdcA
M8
under the control of
promoters T7, J23100, J23101, and J23106, respectively.
These constitutive promoters, obtained from the iGEM Parts
Registry (http://parts.igem.org), were chosen for their distinct
transcription rates,
21
which allows to regulate KdcA
M8
expression over the time of culture growth. Detailed promoter
sequences are provided in Supplementary Table 3. The
enzyme expression was monitored with SDS-PAGE, including
the formation of inclusion bodies that can impair 3-HP
production (Supplementary Figure 6). After 48 h of
cultivation, strain BP3, which utilized the J23100 promoter
to regulate KdcA
M8
expression, achieved a production level of
approximately 0.11 mM 3-HP (Figure 4B and Supplementary
Figure 12), in contrast to BP2, BP4, and BP5. In particular, for
strain BP2, where KdcA
M8
expression is under the control of
the T7 promoter, pronounced formation of inclusion bodies
was observed, which matches the weak SDS-PAGE signal for
the soluble target (Supplementary Figure 6). Since J23101 and
J23106 are weaker promoters compared to J23100, overall
expression levels for BP4 and BP5 were lower than those for
BP3 (Supplementary Figure 6). These fermentation results
indicate that the use of the J23100 promoter to regulate
KdcA
M8
expression effectively ensured protein expression and
catalytic activity from the soluble fraction, alleviating inclusion
body formation and enabling 3-HP production in BP3. The
enhanced soluble expression of KdcA
M8
driven by the J23100
promoter can be attributed to its relatively weak strength,
which slows the protein synthesis rate, allowing more time for
proper protein folding and increasing the amount of soluble,
functional protein. The modulation of expression is commonly
used to overcome solubility limitations.
22,23
Since optimizing
the soluble expression of KdcA
M8
is critical for its application
in 3-HP biosynthesis, future efforts to enhance 3-HP
production should focus on improving KdcA
M8
solubility.
Potential strategies include coexpressing molecular chaperones,
lowering the induction temperature, or fusing solubility-
enhancing tags.
24
In addition, replacing the T7 promoter with J23100 in strain
BL21(DE3) ΔpanD significantly improved cell growth during
5 days of cultivation, as indicated by the increased cell density
(OD600) (OD600 = 1.13 vs OD600 = 0.34; Supplementary
Figure 3E). This further supported the critical role of J23100 in
regulating the protein expression for enzymatic function.
Moreover, the successful production of 3-HP using KdcA
M8
instead of WT KdcA provides evidence that WT KdcA is a
rate-limiting enzyme in the oxaloacetate pathway. Compared
to WT KdcA, KdcA
M8
demonstrated significantly improved
affinity toward oxaloacetate, with a more than 25-fold decrease
in the K
M
value. This enhanced affinity may play a crucial role
in enabling its application in 3-HP biosynthesis via the
oxaloacetate pathway.

Besides HIBADH, 3-hydroxy acid dehydrogenase (YdfG)
from E. coli is another candidate enzyme that catalyzes the
dehydrogenation of malonic semialdehyde and is widely used
in 3-HP production.
25
Strain BP6 was engineered from BP3 by
replacing HIBADH with YdfG to enhance 3-HP production.
Upon cultivation, strain BP6 produced 0.16 mM 3-HP,
representing a 45.4% increase compared to BP3 (Figure 4B
and Supplementary Figure 12). These results demonstrate that
combining KdcA
M8
with YdfG provides an effective approach
to 3-HP production. Furthermore, strain BPX was derived
from BP6 by replacing KdcA
M8
with the WT KdcA. In contrast
to BP6, 3-HP production was undetectable in BPX
(Supplementary Figure 12), confirming that the directed
evolution of KdcA enhanced the biosynthetic efficiency of 3-
HP production.
Improving 3-HP Production through Enhancing the
Precursor Supply and Culture Optimization. For 3-HP
production via the oxaloacetate pathway, enhancing the
metabolic flux toward oxaloacetate can represent a promising
strategy to improve 3-HP synthesis. Previous studies have
shown that overexpression of phosphoenolpyruvate carbox-
ylase gene (ppc) and pyruvate carboxylase gene (pyc) can
effectively increase oxaloacetate supply in E. coli.
26−29
Based on
this insight, strains BP7 and BP8 were engineered to increase
3-HP production by enhancing oxaloacetate levels through the
overexpression of the pyc gene from L. lactis in BP7 and the ppc
gene from E. coli in BP8. Strain BP8 accumulated 0.35 mM 3-
HP, representing an 118% increase compared to the parental
strain BP6 (Figure 4B and Supplementary Figure 12). This
improvement indicates that the introduction and over-
expression of the ppc gene effectively enhanced the
oxaloacetate supply, leading to a significant increase in the
level of 3-HP production. In contrast, strain BP7 exhibited
impaired growth during 48 h of cultivation with a significantly
lower optical density (5.4) compared to BP8 (9.5) (Figure
4C). This observation suggests that overexpression of the pyc
gene can disrupt cellular metabolism, thereby affecting cell
growth and interfering with 3-HP biosynthesis in BP7. Since
enhancing the supply of oxaloacetate proved to be highly
beneficial for 3-HP production in BP8, it is meaningful to
explore additional strategies in future work to further increase
oxaloacetate availability. These strategies may include promot-
ing the glyoxylate shunt by deleting the iclR gene, weakening
the TCA cycle by disrupting the gltA gene, or reducing PEP
consumption by deleting the pykF gene.
30−32
To further enhance 3-HP production in BP8, medium
composition and induction conditions were optimized,
including adjustments to glucose and yeast extract concen-
trations, the inducer isopropyl-β--1-thiogalactopyranoside
(IPTG) concentration, and the addition of sodium bicarbonate
(NaHCO
3
). As shown in Figure 5A,B, the optimal conditions
involved 20 g/L glucose and 0.1 mM IPTG. Increasing the
yeast extract concentration to 10 g/L further improved the 3-
HP titer to 0.48 mM (Figure 5C). Moreover, the addition of
20 mM sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO
3
) to the culture medium
resulted in a final 3-HP production of 0.71 mM (Figure 5D
and Supplementary Figure 13). Previous studies have shown
that the addition of carbonate compounds, such as MgCO
3
or

NaHCO
3
, can enhance succinate production in E. coli. This
enhancement was attributed to the increased availability of
CO
2
derived from these compounds, which can stimulate the
activity of PPC and consequently enhance carbon flux toward
succinate biosynthesis.
33,34
In this study, the observed increase
in the 3-HP titer in BP8 following NaHCO
3
supplementation
may be explained by a similar mechanism. As HCO
3
−
is the
direct substrate of PPC, its elevated intracellular availability is
believed to enhance CO
2
fixation by PPC.
35−37
This, in turn,
promotes carbon flux toward oxaloacetate biosynthesis,
ultimately contributing to the increased production of 3-HP.
As shown in Table 1, the 3-HP yield (0.006 mol/mol)
achieved via the oxaloacetate pathway in E. coli was
significantly lower than that obtained using the malonyl-CoA
pathway (0.031 mol/mol) and the β-alanine pathway (0.846
mol/mol) in E. coli,
38,39
as well as the oxaloacetate pathway in
S. cerevisiae (0.25 mol/mol).
7
In the malonyl-CoA and β-
alanine pathways, native or well-characterized enzymes were
employed, facilitating efficient pathway construction for the 3-
HP biosynthesis. In contrast, the oxaloacetate pathway
depends on the engineered enzyme KdcA
M8
to catalyze the
rate-limiting step of converting oxaloacetate into malonic
semialdehyde. However, the low soluble expression of KdcA
M8
in E. coli impaired its catalytic activity toward oxaloacetate,
thereby reducing the overall efficiency of the pathway and
contributing to the observed low 3-HP yield.
Additionally, in the application of the oxaloacetate pathway
for 3-HP biosynthesis in S. cerevisiae, the host strain was
specifically engineered to accumulate pyruvate, thereby
enhancing oxaloacetate availability via pyruvate carboxylation.
7
In contrast, this study relied solely on the overexpression of
PPC to increase the oxaloacetate supply, without further
engineering the E. coli host to redirect central carbon
metabolism toward oxaloacetate biosynthesis. The inherent
differences in metabolic flux between the two host strains likely
also contributed to the disparity in 3-HP yields observed
between E. coli and S. cerevisiae.
Despite the relatively low final titer and yield of 3-HP
achieved in this study compared to other biosynthetic
approaches, the oxaloacetate pathway offers distinct advan-
tages. In this pathway, the oxaloacetate precursor is directly
derived from PEP, whereas in the malonyl-CoA and β-alanine
pathways, the biosynthesis of their respective precursors
involves multiple enzymatic steps originating from PEP,
leading to carbon flux loss. Furthermore, in the malonyl-CoA
pathway, pyruvate serves as a core intermediate and is diverted
not only toward malonyl-CoA formation but also into
competing metabolic pathways such as acetate metabolism,
fatty acid biosynthesis, and the glyoxylate cycle.
40,41
This
metabolic competition is believed to limit the carbon flux
toward 3-HP production.
41−44
In contrast, the oxaloacetate
pathway could circumvent this issue by avoiding direct reliance
on pyruvate, thereby offering a potentially efficient route for
redirecting the carbon flux toward 3-HP biosynthesis.
■
CONCLUSIONS
In this study, we demonstrated the biosynthesis of 3-HP via
the oxaloacetate pathway in E. coli. To enhance the catalytic
efficiency of KdcA toward oxaloacetate, protein engineering
was performed and a growth selection system was adopted to
isolate and identify positive KdcA variants from mutation
libraries. After four rounds of selection, the variant KdcA
M8
,
with mutations S286R/S287T/F381H/F382P/L534S/L535F/
M538T/G539F in KdcA, was isolated. SDS-PAGE analysis
revealed that KdcA
M8
exhibits a decreased soluble expression.
Using a whole-cell catalyst, KdcA
M8
exhibited a significant
improvement in affinity toward oxaloacetate compared to WT
KdcA when measured in lysate (K
M
= 1.15 mM vs K
M
> 25
mM). To evaluate the contribution of each individual mutation
in KdcA
M8
, we performed site-directed mutagenesis and in vitro
activity assays were performed. The S286R and S287T variants
showed 5.5-fold and 1.3-fold increases in activity, respectively,
whereas the F381H, F382P, L534S, L535F, M538T, and
G539F variants exhibited reduced activity compared to WT
KdcA. These results suggest that, in addition to the previously
identified key residues Ser286, Phe381, and Met538,
13
other
residues such as Ser287, Phe382, Leu534, Leu535, and Gly539
may also be functionally important within the substrate-
binding pocket. Furthermore, combinatorial mutagenesis
revealed that certain combinations of mutations can
compensate for individual deleterious effects and lead to
enhanced activity. Notably, the S286R/F382P/G539F triple
mutant exhibited higher activity than that of WT KdcA, as well
as the individual F382P and G539F variants.
In the biosynthesis of 3-HP, the low affinity of KdcA for
oxaloacetate makes it a rate-limiting enzyme in the
oxaloacetate pathway, effectively prohibiting the production
of 3-HP production. In contrast, replacing WT KdcA with
KdcA
M8
, which has improved affinity for oxaloacetate, enabled
3-HP biosynthesis via the oxaloacetate pathway in E. coli.
Indicating that enhancing KdcA’s binding affinity for
oxaloacetate is crucial for its application in 3-HP biosynthesis.
By regulating KdcA
M8
expression, optimizing dehydrogenase
selection, increasing oxaloacetate supply, and improving
culture conditions, 0.71 mM of 3-HP was successfully
produced. Although the oxaloacetate pathway for 3-HP
biosynthesis in E. coli was successfully established, the final
3-HP titer remains low. To further increase 3-HP production,
strategies could be adopted, such as enhancing the activity and
soluble expression of KdcA
M8
, as well as increasing
oxaloacetate flux.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Strains and Plasmids. All strains and plasmids utilized in
this research are detailed in Supplementary Table 1. E. coli
DH5α was employed for gene cloning, while BL21(DE3)
served as the host strain for protein expression and 3-HP
production. The plasmid pET28a was utilized for the
overexpression of genes associated with the 3-HP synthesis
module. Strain BL21(DE3) ΔpanD was used as the host in the
directed evolution experiments.
Plasmid Construction. DNA fragments were amplified
using a Phusion Plus DNA Polymerase. Gel purifications of all
DNA products were performed using the GeneJET Gel
Extraction Kit. Plasmid extractions were conducted by using
the GeneJET Plasmid Miniprep Kit. These items were
purchased from Thermo Fisher Scientific.
The primers were used for constructing plasmids, as detailed
in Supplementary Table 2. All fragments were inserted into the
plasmid pET28a using the Gibson assembly. To construct pK,
the KdcA gene from L. lactis was amplified from the genome
and inserted into pET28a under the control of a T7 promoter.
For plasmid pH, the HIBADH gene from P. putida KT2400
was amplified from the genome and inserted into pET28a
under the control of a T7 promoter. To construct pKB, the
BAPAT gene from P. putida KT2400 and the KdcA gene from
pK were amplified. Subsequently, the KdcA and BAPAT
fragments were inserted into the pET28a plasmid under the
control of T7 promoters, respectively. Plasmid pKH was
constructed by inserting the KdcA and HIBADH fragments
into the pET28a plasmid under the control of the T7
promoters. pK
M8
H was constructed by replacing the KdcA
gene of pKH with KdcA
M8
. Plasmids p100 K
M8
H, p101 K
M8
H,
and p106 K
M8
H were constructed by replacing the T7
promoter of pK
M8
H with J23100, J23101, and J23106
promoters, respectively. These synthetic promoters are listed
in Supplementary Table 3. Plasmid p100 K
M8
Y was
constructed by replacing the HIBADH gene of p100 K
M8
H
with the ydf G gene from E. coli. To construct p100 K
M8
YY and
p100 K
M8
YP, the pyc gene and the ppc gene were amplified
from the genomes of L. lactis and E. coli, respectively. These
genes were then inserted after the ydf G gene in p100 K
M8
Y.
Knockout of the panD Gene. The BL21(DE3) ΔpanD
strain was engineered by knocking out the panD gene from the
genome using CRISPR-Cas9 technology.
45,46
Plasmid pEcCas
integrates the arabinose-inducible λ-Red recombineering
system, a Cas9 expression system, and a plasmid curing system
into a single vector. The sgRNA donor plasmid, pEcgRNA-
panD, was constructed by PCR amplifying the pEcgRNA
backbone using primers N20-panD-F and N20-panD-R,
followed by self-ligation of the PCR product. The donor
double-stranded DNA (dsDNA), containing 500 bp homology
arms upstream and downstream of the target gene, was
generated via fusion PCR using primers listed in Supple-
mentary Table 2.
To construct E. coli BL21 strains harboring pEcCas, 50 μL of
competent cells was electroporated with 10 ng of pEcCas using
a 1 mm Gene Pulser cuvette (Bio-Rad) at 1.8 kV, 25 μF, and
200 Ω. The cells immediately recovered in 300 μL of fresh LB
medium and incubated at 37 °C with shaking at 220 rpm for 1
h. The culture was then plated on LB agar containing
kanamycin (50 μg/mL) and incubated overnight at 37 °C. A
single colony was picked and cultured overnight in 4 mL of LB
with kanamycin (50 μg/mL) to prepare electrocompetent
cells, following the procedure described in a previous study.
46
For genome editing, 50 μL of the prepared electrocompetent
cells was electroporated with 50 ng of pEcgRNA-panD and 100
ng of donor dsDNA using the same conditions as above. Cells
were recovered in 300 μL of LB at 30 °C for 1 h and then
plated on LB agar containing kanamycin (50 μg/mL) and
spectinomycin (50 μg/mL), followed by overnight incubation
at 30 °C. Colony PCR was performed to screen and verify
positive colonies, using wild-type strains as controls (Supple-
mentary Figure 1).
To eliminate the pEcgRNA-panD plasmid, positive colonies
were inoculated into 2 mL of LB medium containing 10 mM
rhamnose and kanamycin and incubated overnight at 37 °C,
220 rpm. The culture was then plated on LB agar with
kanamycin, and colonies sensitive to spectinomycin were
considered to be cured of pEcgRNA-panD. For curing the
pEcCas plasmid, the spectinomycin-sensitive colonies were
inoculated into the LB medium containing glucose (5 g/L)
and grown overnight at 37 °C, 220 rpm. Cultures were then
plated on LB agar supplemented with glucose (5 g/L) and
sucrose (10 g/L) and incubated overnight at 37 °C. Colonies
that became sensitive to kanamycin were confirmed to be
cured of pEcCas.
Directed Evolution. For the evolution of KdcA, mutation
libraries were created through multiple site-saturation muta-
genesis with the Q5 Site-Directed Mutagenesis Kit (New
England Biolabs), using pKB as the template. The specific
primers used are detailed in Supplementary Table 2.
The BL21(DE3) ΔpanD cells were transformed with the
mutation library by electroporation using the same conditions
as above. Immediately after the electroporation pulse, 1 mL of
prewarmed LB medium (37 °C) was added to the cuvette, and
the cells were incubated at 30 °C and 200 rpm for 2 h. A 30 μL
aliquot of the culture was taken to assess electroporation
efficiency, while the remaining cells were centrifuged, washed
twice with water, and plated on M9 agar (lacking yeast extract)
supplemented with 4 mg/L ThDP, 2 mg/L pyridoxal 5′-
phosphate, and 25 μg/mL kanamycin. After 4−6 days of
incubation at 30 °C, large colonies were selected and streaked
onto fresh plates.
Kinetic Parameters and Enzyme Activities of KdcA
Variants. The enzymatic activities of KdcA variants were
measured using a coupled assay with an excess of HIBADH.
The assay mixture, prepared in a 100 μL volume, contained 20
mM oxaloacetate, 5 mM NADH, 2 mM MgSO
4
, 0.5 mM
ThDP, 1 mg/mL purified HIBADH, and 40 μL of lysate
protein in a 50 mM potassium phosphate buffer (pH 6.5). The
reaction was initiated by adding the lysate protein and
incubated at 30 °C for 1 h, followed by analysis via HPLC.
To obtain the lysate protein, KdcA variants were expressed in
E. coli BL21(DE3) using 0.1 mM IPTG at 30 °C for 3 h. Cells
were then harvested by centrifugation at 4 °C, washed twice,
resuspended in a 50 mM PBS solution (pH 6.5) to adjust
OD600 to 4.0, and disrupted by ultrasonication. The lysate
protein was obtained as the supernatant after centrifugation.
The K
M
of WT KdcA was determined by measuring reaction
rates using oxaloacetate concentrations ranging from 1 to 50
mM, with 5 mM NADH under the same assay conditions
described above, using the lysate protein as the biocatalyst. For
the KdcA
M8
variant, the K
M
was similarly determined using
oxaloacetate concentrations ranging from 0 to 20 mM and 5
mM NADH, but using 80 μL of whole-cell biocatalyst in place

of lysate protein and purified HIBADH. To obtain the whole-
cell biocatalyst, strain BP3, coexpressing KdcA
M8
and
HIBADH, was cultivated in a modified M9 medium and
induced with 0.1 mM IPTG at 30 °C for 12 h. Cells were then
harvested, washed twice, and resuspended in a 50 mM PBS
solution (pH 6.5) to adjust the OD600 to 10.0.
3-HP Production in Shaking Flasks. For the 3-HP
production experiments, a single colony was inoculated into 4
mL of LB medium (containing 10 g/L tryptone, 5 g/L yeast
extract, and 10 g/L NaCl) and incubated overnight at 37 °C.
The cells grown in LB were then transferred to 250 mL flasks
with 20 mL of modified M9 medium. The cultivation was
performed in a shaking incubator at 220 rpm and 37 °C. When
the OD600 reached 0.8, 0.1 mM isopropyl β--1-thiogalacto-
pyranoside (IPTG) was added, and the temperature was
adjusted to 30 °C. All flask cultivations were performed in
duplicate.

Analytical Procedures. The yield of 3-HP was determined
with an analytical UltiMate 3000 HPLC system (Thermo
Fisher Scientific). The analysis was conducted by using a Bio-
Rad Aminex HPX-87H column (Bio-Rad Laboratories) with
RID and UV detectors. The column was maintained at a
temperature of 14 °C, and 5 mM sulfuric acid flowing at a rate
of 0.4 mL/min was used as the mobile phase. The biomass was
quantified by measuring the turbidity of the culture medium at
600 nm by using a spectrophotometer.
