Objective: Meldonium, a well-known cardioprotective drug, has been reported to
be protective against pulmonary injury at high altitudes; however, the
pharmacodynamics of meldonium in other vital organs under acute high-
altitude injury are less investigated and the related pharmacokinetics have not
been fully elucidated.
Methods and Results:The present study examined the basic pharmacodynamics
and pharmacokinetics (PK) in rat exposure to acute high-altitude hypoxia after
intragastrical and intravenous pre-administration of meldonium. The results
indicate that meldonium can improve acute hypoxia-induced pathological
damage in brain and lung tissues, and restore blood biochemistry and routine
blood index of heart, liver and kidney tissues under a simulated acute high-altitude
environment. Furthermore, compared to the normoxia group, rats exposed to
simulated high-altitude hypoxia and premedicated with intragastrical meldonium
showed linear kinetics in the dose range of 25– 100 mg/kg, with a signiﬁcantly
increase in the area under curve (AUC) and reduced clearance rate. No signiﬁcant
differences in these meldonium of PK parameters were observed with intravenous
administration. Additionally, meldonium was involved in the regulation of succinic
acid and 3-hydroxypropionic acid.
Conclusion: These results will contribute to our understanding of the preclinical
PK properties of meldonium and its acute high-altitude protective effects.

Introduction
Over 140 million people worldwide travel to high-altitude regions for tourism, military,
sport, or work, and acute hypoxia-induced injury has become a health hazard for lowland
people who move rapidly to high altitudes (Basnyat & Murdoch, 2003). Sufﬁcient evidence
has shown that acute hypoxia induced by multiple environmental factors (temperature and
humidity, oxygen concentration <18%) and pathological changes (impaired respiratory

exchange) can lead to tissue and organ damage and even death
(Schoene, 2008; Luks et al., 2017). Furthermore, the inﬂuence of
high-altitude hypoxia on the respiratory system, cardiovascular
system, and nervous system further lead to related sickness
including high-altitude headache, acute mountain sickness
(AMS), central sleep apnea syndrome, high-altitude cerebral
edema (HACE), and high-altitude pulmonary edema (HAPE)
(Baumgartner, 1999; Sanchez del Rio & Moskowitz, 1999; Woods
& Alcock, 2021). Therefore, further investigation into the prevention
and treatment of high-altitude-related illnesses requires urgent
attention.
Blood rheology, blood biochemistry, and organ functions
changes caused by acute hypoxia at high altitude may alter the
pharmacokinetic of certain drugs. For example, changes in the
number and composition of intestinal microorganisms in an
alpine environment may lead to slower metabolic activity of
nifedipine in vivo , thereby improving the bioavailability and
therapeutic ef ﬁcacy of nifedipine ( Zhang et al., 2018 ).
Acetaminophen, an antipyretic and analgesic drug, increased the
elimination of time and area under the curve (AUC) and
signiﬁcantly reduced clearance rate (CL/F) in rats after exposure
to a high-altitude environment ( Zhu et al., 2021 ). Likewise,
phenytoin plasma concentration and cerebrospinal ﬂuid
concentration were signiﬁcantly increased under acute hypoxia
(Zhang et al., 2020). At present, more attention focuses on the
treatment of high-altitude illnesses and related mechanistic studies
while there are few reports on the drug pharmacokinetics under
acute hypoxia conditions.
Meldonium, as an energy regulator, blocks myocardial
hypoxia by competitively inhibi ting carnitine-dependent fatty
acid oxidation and promoting anaerobic oxidation of the
glycolytic pathway ( Dambrova et al., 2016 ). In addition, it
improves the utilization of acetyl-CoA by various
mitochondrial metabolic pathways by inhibiting carnitine
acetyltransferase, preventing a decrease of ATP and ADP
concentrations, thereby exert ing an energy optimization
(Dambrova et al., 2002 ). Our previous studies have reported
the protective effect of meldonium in high-altitude lung injury
and relevant mechanisms (Wang et al., 2022). However, the basic
efﬁcacy and pharmacokinetics of prophylactic administration of
meldonium for acute high-altitude injury has yet to be evaluated.
We thus established a simulated acute high-altitude rat injury
model to evaluate basic pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic
indicators and to provide a reference for preventive medication
and clinical studies of high-altitude illness.
Materials and methods
Chemicals, reagents and instruments
Meldonium (purity > 99.9%) was purchased from Yuanye
Pharmaceutical Co. (Shanghai, China). L-carnitine (purity >
99.9%) was purchased from the National Institute for the Control
of Pharmaceutical and Biological Products (Beijing, China). A stable
isotope labeled internal standard compound, acetonitrile and
methanol, were obtained from Merck Chemical Co., (Darmstadt,
Germany). Formic acid and ammonium acetate were purchased
from Thermo Scientiﬁc (Waltham, United States). All the other
chemicals were of analytical grade or better.
The Liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-
MS/MS) system consisted of a liquid chromatograph (Waters
Technologies, Massachusetts, United States) and coupled with an
AB SCIEX 6500 triple quadrupole mass spectrometer (Sciex
Corp., Framingham, United Sta tes). A FLYDWC50-1A animal
simulated hypobaric hypoxia chamber was purchased from
Guizhou Fenglei Oxygen Chamber Co., Ltd. (Anshun, China).
An FLPI-2 laser doppler bloodﬂow monitor (Moor Instruments,
Axminster, UK), a high-content imaging analysis microscope
(Molecular Devices, California, United States), an ABL90 Flex
blood gas analyzer (Radiometer Medical, Copenhagen,
Denmark), and an IX51 light microscope (Olympus, Japan)
were also applied in this study.
Animals
Speciﬁc pathogen-free (SPF) Sprague – Dawley (SD) rats
weighing 200 ± 20 g were purchased from SIBEIFU
Biotechnology Co., Ltd. (Beijing, China). SD rats were housed
with an environmental temperature of 22
°C±2 °C and 40%– 70%
relative humidity. All the experimental animals were acclimated
under the above conditions for 3 days and fasted overnight before
the experiments. Operations for animal experiments were carried
out the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals
(NBCDSER-IACUC-2018-096, Institutional Animal Care and Use
Committee of Laboratory Animal Center, Beijing, China).
Acute hypoxia injury model
To evaluate the effect of pre-administrated with meldonium
under acute high-altitude hypoxia, SD rats (6 in each group) were
administered by gavage and randomly divided into normoxia group,
hypoxia group (model group), hypoxia groups with differential dose
meldonium (25, 50, 100, 200, and 400 mg/kg), and hypoxia with
acetazolamide group (positive control). In addition, the
pharmacokinetics of meldonium (25, 50, 100 mg/kg) was
investigated under acute high-altitude hypoxia in SD rats
administered by gavage and/or intravenously. Normoxia group
rats given saline lived at an average altitude of 43.5 m, and the
acute hypoxia groups were placed in a simulated hypobaric hypoxia
chamber with an altitude of 7,000 m for 24 h after 3 days of
continuous administration with meldonium.
Blood gas measurements
Rats were anesthetized upon exit from the hypobaric hypoxia
chamber. Blood samples were drawn from the abdominal aorta into
polypropylene syringes containing heparin and immediately
transferred to a biochip to keep blood gases near physiological
values. Acid-base balance, metabolites, and electrolytes changes,
including blood bicarbonate (pHCO
3
−), pH, partial pressure of
carbon dioxide (pCO2), partial pressure of oxygen (pO2), glucose
(Glu), lactic acid (Lac), sodium (Na+), potassium (K+), and chloride

(Cl−) were assessed using a blood gas analyzer (ABL90, Radiometer,
Copenhagen, Denmark).
Laboratory parameters analysis
The screening included an evaluation of vital functions (systolic
and diastolic blood pressure, and mean arterial pressure),
biochemical blood analysis, and routine blood examination,
which were used for the initial assessment of hypoxia injury and
efﬁcacy of meldonium.
Initial assessment of liver injury included measuring levels of
serum alanine and aspartate aminotransferases (ALT and AST).
Serum creatinine acid (CREA) and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) were
used as indicators for kidney damage. Creatine kinase (CK) and
serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) were used as biochemical
markers of cardiac injury. Complement C3 and C4, involved in
the immune response, were also detected. In addition, red blood cells
(RBC), white blood cells (WBC), hemoglobin, and lymphocytes
(LYMPH) were evaluated.
Histopathological evaluations(H&E)
Twenty-four hours post simulated high-altitude hypoxia
exposure, rat brain tissue was perfused with 0.9% normal
saline and 4% paraformaldehyde solution. The brain tissue
was removed, ﬁxed, dehydrated by graded ethanol, embedded
in parafﬁn, and cut into 5μm thick sections. Sliced sections were
stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) and examined using
an optical microscope (XDS-113, Olympus Corporation,
Japan).
Doppler monitoring of bloodﬂow
Relative cortical cerebral bloodﬂow was measured with a laser
Doppler probe secured to the dura matter. Rats were euthanized,
and the skull was exposed by cutting the skin of the head and washed
with 150 µL saline. Bloodﬂow in cerebral vessels was captured
continuously by low-frequency pulsed ultrasound using laser
doppler ﬂowmeters (Moor, England). Results were recorded and
analyzed by Moor FLPI-2 Review V50 software.
LC-MS/MS conditions and
pharmacokinetics
High-performance liquid ch romatography (HPLC) and
mass spectrometer analyses of meldonium were performed
on a Thermo Hypercarb C18 column (3 mm × 100 mm,
5 μm, Thermo Fisher Scienti ﬁc, Germany). Autosampler
temperature was maintained at 15
°C and the injection
volume was 5 μL. The ﬂow rate was set at 500 μLm i n-1.T h e
mobile phase consisted of methanol and 5 mM ammonium
acetate buffer solution containing 0.1% formic acid. The
mass spectrometer was operated in the positive ESI mode
with a drying gas temperature of 350
°C, nebulizer pressure of
40 psi, capillary voltage of 4000 V, and multiple reaction
monitoring (MRM) for meldonium with scan time100 m/s
(m/z, 147.1 → 58.2).
To explore the pharmacokinetics of meldonium under acute
high-altitude hypoxia, 0.2 mL of venous blood was collected in an
anticoagulation tube (EDTA-K2) before (time 0) and at 0.08, 0.25,
0.5, 1, 2, 4, 8, 12, and 24 h post meldonium administration, and then
centrifuged at 2,500g for 15 min at 4
°C. The blood collection time
for i.v., administration was increased by 2 min.
Rat liver homogenate, as the incubation system, was taken and
added 100 μL of meldonium working solution concentrations
(400 μg/mL, 200 μg/mL, 100 μg/mL, 40 μg/mL, 20 μg/mL, 10 μg/
mL, and 4μg/mL) to vortex and mix, and placed in a 37°C water
bath for incubation. The samples supernatant was taken at 0 min,
15 min, 30 min, 1 h, 2 h and 4 h, respectively, for determination in
LC-MS/MS.
Statistical analysis
Pharmacokinetic parameters of meldonium including peak time
(Tmax) and peak concentration (Cmax), area under curve (AUCall)o f
plasma concentration-time, the apparent volume of distribution
(Vz/F), clearance rate (CL/F), and last mean residence time
(MRTlast) were calculated using Phoenix WinNonlin software 8.0
(Certara, Princeton, United States). Data are expressed as mean ±
SEM. Statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism 6
(GraphPad Software, La Jolla, US) and assessed by the one-way
ANOVA followed by Tukey ’s test. p < 0.05 were considered
statistically signiﬁcant.
Results
Behavioral investigation
SD rats were exposed to simulated high-altitude
environment for the hypoxia test, and the normoxia group
was used as parallel control ( Figure 1A ). Within the ﬁrst
15 ~ 20 min of increasing altitude by 30 m/s, compared with
the normoxia group, increased a ctivity frequency, faster
abdominal breathing, and head-up posture and neck
extension were observed in the hypoxia group. With
prolonged periods of hypoxia, activity frequency of rats
gradually decreased. When reaching the speci ﬁed altitude of
7,000 m, rat huddled together, and trembling continued until
the end of hypoxia treatment. This hypoxia model can induce
abnormal activities or affect rat behavior.
By comparison, we found that heart rate tended to increase
under acute hypoxia compared to the normoxia group, while heart
rate in the meldonium (50 mg/kg and 200 mg/kg) groups were
signiﬁcantly lower after prophylactic administration (p < 0.05).
We then compared changes in systolic blood pressure (SBP),
diastolic blood pressure (DBP), and mean arterial pressure
(MAP) in normoxia and hypoxia group as well as after
meldonium treatment and found a signiﬁcant increase in SBP,
DBP, and MAP in the hypoxia group (p < 0.05). Further, SBP,
DBP, and MAP values in the meldonium pretreatment group by

i.g., administeration (50 mg/kg) signiﬁcantly improved (p < 0.05) and
were superior to the positive control drug acetazolamide (Figure 1B).
Pathological, physiological and biochemical
examinations
Hematoxylin-eosin staining
High-altitude environments affect heart and lung function
(Mallet et al., 2021). As shown inFigure 2A,c o m p a r e dw i t ht h e
normoxia control group, alveolar dilatation, alveolar interstitial
fracture and thickening, and d isorganized cell arrangement
were observed in the acute hypoxia injury group. However,
compared with the hypoxia group, alveolar dilatation, alveolar
fracture and thickening, and cell arrangement were signiﬁcantly
reduced in the meldonium i.g., administration (25 mg/kg,
50 mg/kg, and 100 mg/kg) groups; other meldonium i.g.,
administration (200 mg/kg and 400 mg/kg) groups exhibited
only improved alveolar interstitial thickening. Similarly, the
positive control drug acetazol amide reduced the degree of
alveolar interstitial thicke ning under hypoxia without
signi ﬁcantly improving alveola r dilatation, alveolar
interstitial disruption and cellular disor ganization.
Cranial dopplerﬂow analysis
Brain injury is another issue associated with high altitude (Ma
et al., 2019). To examine the inﬂuence of acute hypoxia-induced
cerebral ischemia injury, laser doppler bloodﬂowmetry was used to
determine regional cerebral blood ﬂow in rats. As shown in
Figure 2B, the hypoxia group rats exhibited a 23.6% decrease in
rCBF, compared to the normoxia group (p < 0.01), while meldonium
i.g., administration groups (25 mg/kg and 100 mg/kg) signiﬁcantly
restored these brain blood changes and was superior to
acetazolamide group.
Blood gas, electrolytes, and metabolites
After exiting from the hypobaric hypoxia chamber and
descending to the plain, blood samples were collected
immediately from the abdominal aorta to examine the
changes in blood gas, electroly tes, and metabolic values.
Blood pH, pCO 2, and HCO 3
− in the hypoxia group was
signi ﬁcantly decreased compared with the normoxia group
after acute hypoxia ( Figure 3A ). Pretreatment with
meldonium (50 mg/kg) signi ﬁcantly upregulated the above
indicators. However, pO 2 levels were elevated in the hypoxia
group compared to the normoxia group, and there was no
signi ﬁcant difference in the pre- administered meldonium
groups. During acute hypoxia, the body is involved in a
defensive glycolytic process in which glucose is broken down
to lactate. As shown in Figure 3B , lactate content was
signi ﬁcantly elevated in the hypoxia group, while pre-
administered meldonium group (50 mg/kg) signi ﬁcantly
inhibited excessive lactate production. In addition, sodium
levels were signi ﬁcantly higher, potassium levels were
signi ﬁcantly lower, and chloride levels were not signi ﬁcantly
different after acute hypoxia. 25 mg/kg dose of meldoniumi.g.,
administration group signi ﬁcantly reduced sodium levels
(Figure 3C).

Routine blood examination and biochemical
analysis
To determine the effects of meldonium on cardiac, hepatic
and renal injury under acute high-altitude conditions, Routine
B l o o dE x a m i n a t i o na n dB i o c h e mical Analysis were assessed.
Visible hemolysis arterial bloo d samples were excluded. At the
cellular-level, compared to th e normoxia group, acute hypoxia
increased levels of WBC, RBC, LYMPH, and hemoglobin (p <
0.05), whereas pretreatment with meldonium group (200 mg/kg)
restored the changes in WB C, RBC, and LYMPH numbers.
25– 400 mg/kg dose group of meldonium showed signi ﬁcantly
higher hemoglobin levels under acute hypoxia ( Figure 4A). In
addition, acute hypoxia injury elevated levels of biochemical
parameters (CK, CREA, BUN, AST, and LDH) and decreased
levels of ALT, C3 and C4. The hypoxia pretreatment group
(400 mg/kg) reversed these alters in CK and ALT (p < 0.05),
and in 25 – 200 mg/kg meldonium dose group showed
signiﬁcantly increased levels of complement C3 and C4, but
meldonium did not signi ﬁcantly alter BUN and CREA
(Figure 4B).
Method validation
The methodological validation of meldonium in rat plasma is
shown inTable 1. High levels of meldonium linearity were achieved
within a range of 0.5– 50 μg/mL (r2 = 0.9960) with the lower limit of
quantiﬁcation at 0.5μg/mL. Inter-batch precision and accuracy were

determined by measuring six replicates of quality control (QC)
samples at three concentration levels in rat plasma. Results show
that the intra-batch precision of meldonium was less than 5.57%,
inter-batch precision was less than 8.06%, and accuracy was less than
15%. The recoveries of internal standard calibration in rat plasma at
three concentration levels of meldonium ranged from 99.07% to
105.28%. For ionization, the total relative standard deviations of the
internal standard normalized matrix effect factors corrected for
internal standard at low and high concentrations of meldonium
were 4.84% and 4.64%, respectively, suggesting that there was no
measurable matrix effect that interfered with meldonium
determination in rat plasma. The meldonium solution was stable
at room temperature.
Pharmacokinetics
Based on a preliminary pharmacodynamic examination, three
dose groups of meldonium (low dose, 25 mg/10 mL/kg; medium
dose, 50 mg/10 mL/kg; high dose, 100 mg/10 mL/kg) were selected
for pharmacokinetic studies. Figure 5A show mean plasma
concentration time proﬁles for meldonium. The normoxia dose
groups showed that the AUC of meldonium administered by gavage
exhibited non-linear clearance in the range of 25 – 50 mg/kg.
However, concentration-time curves after exposure at 7,000 m
high-altitude for 24 h showed an AUC of meldonium with a
dose-dependent increase within the range of 25 – 100 mg/kg by
intragastrical administration. Plasma C
max, AUCall, and MRTlast

in meldonium low dose group (25 mg/kg) by intragastric
administration under hypoxia showed signiﬁcantly higher than
those of the same dose normoxia group (Table 2).
In order to more visually examine the pharmacokinetic changes
of meldonium under normoxia and acute plateau hypoxia, we
selected a medium dose of meldonium by intragastric
administration for further investigation. As shown in Figure 5B
and Table 2, compared to the normoxia group, reduced C max
(24,904.97 ± 22,618.59 Vs. 11,118.71 ± 3,515.13 mL/h/kg, p <
0.05) and increased Vz/F (2,773.03 ± 756.42 Vs. 5,032.12 ±
1,679.6 mL/kg, p < 0.05) of meldonium in plasma under acute
high-altitude conditions were observed. In addition, the
pharmacokinetics of low-dose intravenous and i.g.,
administration under normoxia and acute high-altitude hypoxic
conditions were evaluated (Figure 5C; Table 3). Similar to clearance
of the medium dose of meldonium, plasma clearance for low-dose
meldonium (25 mg/kg) given by i.g., administration was
signiﬁcantly lower (1,400 ± 362 Vs. 230 ± 150 mL/h/kg, p <
0.05) and MRT
last was prolonged (4.34 ± 0.58 Vs. 8.40 ± 1.36 h,
p < 0.05) under acute high-altitude hypoxia, compared to the
normoxia group. However, no signiﬁcant changes in these PK
parameters were observed after low-dose intravenous
administration, with comparable MRT
last (3.14 ± 0.68 Vs. 3.43 ±
1.44 h) and clearance (487 ± 34 Vs. 743 ± 252 mL/h/kg,p < 0.05) for
normoxia and to high-altitude groups. Therefore, the
pharmacokinetics of the different meldonium administration
methods differ signiﬁcantly under acute high-altitude hypoxia.
To investigate thein vitro metabolite of meldonium, succinate
and 3-hydroxypropionic acid, rat liver homogenates with serial
concentrations of meldonium were incubated. The study results
showed that the metabolite 3-hydroxypropionic acid showed an
increasing trend with concentration and time in the high
concentration group (100– 400 μg/mL), while no increasing trend
was found with increasing content in the low concentration group
(4– 40 μg/mL), but an increasing trend was found after 4 h of
incubation. The metabolite succinic acid showed an insigniﬁcant

increasing incubation time (Figure 5D).
Discussion
Although insights into high-altitude sickness have made
progress, there remains a scarcity of drugs for clinical
application. Furthermore, the effects of acute high-altitude
hypoxia at the tissue and organismal levels need to further
investigation. Previous research has explored the protective effect
of meldonium in acute high-altitude lung injury; however, whether
pretreatment with meldonium has a protective effect on other
organs at high altitude remains elusive. In this study, a low-
pressure and low-oxygen simulation chamber was used to
establish an acute rat injury model, and acetazolamide was used
as a positive control drug. The study showed that meldonium
(50 mg/kg) could signi ﬁcantly reverse heart rate and blood
pressure changes, increase cerebral blood ﬂow, alleviate
symptoms of damaged lung tissues and improve the abnormal
blood biochemistry in cardiac, hepatic and renal tissues in rats.
In addition, we showed that acute hypoxia-induced altered blood
concentrations of meldonium, resulting in a signiﬁcantly longer
elimination time and decreased in clearance. Notedly, meldonium
regulates succinate, an important metabolic intermediate product of
the tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA). These data provide guidance for
the clinical use of meldonium in future.
High-altitude environments, accompanied by the typical
characteristics of hypobaric h ypoxia, strong ultraviolet
radiation, low temperature and high humidity, can easily
induce pathological damage to various tissues, and in severe
cases, can develop into brain or pulmonary edema. Clinical
symptoms include headache, li ght-headedness, insomnia,
fatigue and other neurological symptoms, as well as cough,
progressive dyspnea and other signs of lung injury ( Archer
et al., 2020 ;K ; Wang et al., 2018 ; Wu et al., 2018 ; Zafren
et al., 2017 ). Pathological results show that meldonium can
signiﬁcantly improve cerebral blood ﬂow reduction, alveolar
dilatation, alveolar interstit ial rupture and thickening induced
by acute hypoxia. Acute hypobaric hypoxia environments induce
metabolic acidosis, in which symptoms manifest as a result of a
decrease in the levels of bicarbonate and carbon dioxide in the
blood, while causing excessive production of lactic acid, and
thereby an acid-base imbalance in the body (Zouboules et al.,
2018; Caldwell et al., 2021) .T h e2 5m g / k gm e l d o n i u md o s eg r o u p
improved these changes. However, there was a signi ﬁcant
increase in pO
2 compared to the normoxia group, which
possibly due to excessive oxygen uptake and enhanced oxygen
permeability when removed fro m the simulation of hypobaric
hypoxia chamber. Electrolytes act as an important buffering
system to maintain acid-base balance in the body; meldonium
is not sensitive to electrolyte changes under acute hypoxia.
Routine blood examination and biochemical analysis are an
important part of high-altitude sickness diagnosis and treatment.
Red blood cells and hemoglobin, as key components of transport
and oxygen-carrying capacity, increase signiﬁcantly in response to
acute hypoxia; however, overproduction increases cardiac load and
triggers cerebro-pulmonary circulatory disorders. Meldonium can
improve changes in this index. In addition, the in ﬂammatory
response of the body under acute hypoxia results in a much
higher than normal number of leukocytes, which can be
suppressed by meldonium. Due to changes in tissue morphology
and inﬁltration of inﬂammatory cells, especially with the decrease in
energy levels, the immunity of the body is lower under acute hypoxia
exposure. From biochemical tests assessing the ef ﬁcacy of
meldonium in cardiac, hepatic, renal and immune functions, it
appears that meldonium is more effective in improving cardiac,
hepatic and immune functions.
Hypoxia environments affect the intestinal ﬂora and tissue
injury, which in turn affects drug absorption, distribution,
metabolism and excretion (Li et al., 2015; Pan et al., 2022). Both

concentrations and were generally well tolerated. We selected
appropriate doses and administration modes based on the results
of a preliminary pharmacodynamic study to further investigate the
changes in pharmacokinetic-related parameters of its exposure to
high altitude. The results of blood concentration measurements
showed that absorption of meldonium in low dose (25 mg/kg) by
intragastric administration increased signiﬁcantly and excretion rate
slowed with exposure to acute hypoxia, resulting in signiﬁcantly

higher plasma drug concentrationsin vivo than in the normoxia
group. Interestingly, there may be dose saturation with medium dose
50 mg/kg using intragastric administration of meldonium, resulting
in a signiﬁcantly lower C
max under acute hypoxia than in the
normoxia group. In addition, CL in low-dose meldonium
(25 mg/kg) group using intragastric administration at normoxia
group (1,400.32 ± 362.55 mL/h/kg) was much higher than
medium-dose meldonium (251.50 ± 56.98 mL/h/kg), suggesting a
non-linear clearance in the range of 25– 50 mg/kg dose in rats at
normoxia, which is different from other Chinese pharmacokinetic
data in healthy subjects (plasma AUC: 46 – 60 μg/mL·h; CL:
9.3– 10.8 L/h after intravenous administration of 500 mg
meldonium) (Peng et al., 2010; Zhao et al., 2016). This suggests
that there may be species-dependent differences in clearance rats
between rats and humans and appropriate adjustments should be
made in the future dose administration of meldonium for
human use.

and provides energy and counte racts hypoxia by increasing
glycolysis or promoting trica rboxylic acid cycle. Yoshisue
found that the possible metabolites of meldonium in plasma
are succinic acid and 3-hydroxypropionic acid, which was
consistent with present study results ( Yoshisue et al., 2000 ).
This further validates that meldonium exerts its protective
effect through energy metabolic pathways.
Considerable progress has been made in research on the
treatment and mechanisms of high-altitude sickness; however,
researches on rational use and preventive ef ﬁcacy at high
altitudes are scarce. In this study, the pharmacodynamics and
