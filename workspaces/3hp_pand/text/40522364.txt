Abstract
Designing reaction pathways that maximize the production of a target compound in a given metabolic network is a fun-
damental problem in systems biology. In this study, we systematically explore the non-oxidative glycolysis metabolic net-
work, guided by the principle that reactions with negative Gibbs free energy differences are thermodynamically favored. 
We enumerate alternative pathways that implement the net non-oxidative glycolysis reaction, categorized by their length. 
Our analysis reveals several alternative thermodynamically favorable pathways beyond the experimentally reported ones. 
Additionally, we identify molecules within the network, such as 3-hydroxypropionic acid, that may have significant potential 
for further investigation.

Introduction
Glycolysis is a catabolic pathway that converts carbo-
hydrates to acetylphosphate while releasing energy, 
catalyzed by enzymes. The pathway that occurs in most 
organisms does not achieve the theoretically optimal atom 
efficiency because two out of every six carbon atoms in 
the carbohydrate are released as carbon dioxide, which is 
lost to the atmosphere. Synthetically designed pathways, 
however, have reached the theoretical limit of 100% car -
bon efficiency, where no carbon atoms are lost as carbon 
dioxide molecules [1 ]. These pathways are called non-
oxidative glycolysis pathways because no carbon atoms 
are fully oxidized to carbon dioxide (where the carbon 
atom has an oxidation number of +4 as compared to +3 in 
acetylphosphate).
While elaborating on nonoxidative glycolysis pathways, 
the authors in [1] point out that the reaction catalyzed by the 
enzyme phosphoketolase is an irreversible step, providing 
the driving force for the nonoxidative glycolytic pathway. 
The enzyme phosphoketolase can catalyze three different 
reactions (all following the same template):
This promiscuous activity of the phosphoketolase enzyme 
allows for variations in the nonoxidative glycolytic path -
way. Three experimentally observed pathways are enumer-
ated in 1, 2, and 3. The fourth pathway, described in 4, 
uses the phosphoketolase enzyme to cleave three sugars-
xylulose 5-phosphate, fructose 6-phosphate, and sedohep -
tulose 7-phosphate-in a single reaction sequence. [1 ] notes 
that similar pathways can be derived using sedoheptulose 
biphosphate instead of fructose biphosphate, combinations 
of which can generate a large number of pathways for non-
oxidative glycolysis. An example of a pathway using sedo-
heptulose biphosphate was reported in [2 ].
We aim to evaluate the possible pathways in the non-
oxidative glycolysis metabolic network to develop a 
physical justification for why some pathways are easier to 
realize under laboratory conditions than others. Further -
more, we aim to explain why certain by-products, such

as 3-hydroxypropionate in [ 4], are observed alongside 
acetylphosphate in experiments attempting to optimize 
the nonoxidative glycolytic pathway. Finally, we seek to 
identify potential bottlenecks in these pathways and pro-
pose a few that may be the most feasible under practical 
conditions.
Methods
Traditionally, constraint-based models have been used to 
analyze metabolic networks under the steady-state assump-
tion. These constraint-based models can also incorporate 
kinetic parameters for each (enzymatic) reaction as a fur -
ther refinement [5 , 6]. However, these kinetic parameters

are often not available for all the reactions in the consid-
ered network [7 , 8]. Conservation laws, such as the con-
servation of mass, can be easily modeled to ensure that the 
rate of production of molecules by certain reactions equals 
the rate at which they are consumed in the system. In addi-
tion to this conservation law, thermodynamics is another 
governing principle for most physical processes in equi-
librium. An important thermodynamic variable in meta-
bolic networks, besides kinetic parameters, is the chemical 
potential of molecules in the network. For a reaction, ΔrG  
represents the difference in the chemical potentials of the 
product molecules and the reactant molecules involved in 
the reaction. Thermodynamics favors only those reactions 
with a negative ΔrG  value (often termed as reactions that 
proceed ‘downhill’).
A critical variable affecting the chemical potential of mol-
ecules in a system is their concentration. Modeling the con-
centrations of molecules in living organisms is challenging 
because they are actively manipulated by transport across 
membranes through pumps and channels via active trans-
port, which consumes energy in the form of small molecules 
such as ATP and NADPH. These driven processes are often 
difficult to assign free-energy differences to, and hence, 
challenging to encapsulate within a network. Additionally, 
different parts of a metabolic network might operate in dis-
tinct cellular compartments, with varying concentrations of 
the same molecule. To avoid these complexities, we assume 
that the reactions in the analyzed metabolic network occur 
in a well-stirred bioreactor with the required enzymes pre-
sent, as in an in vitro assessment of a hypothesized pathway 
before it is engineered into a living cells. It is admitted that 
under these assumption— not accounting for the free-energy 
differences of the transport processes and the differential 
concentration of the same molecule in different cellular 
compartments— would introduce errors into the modeling.
Constructing the reaction network
The metabolic reaction networks are generated using the 
graph grammar approach in MØD, as elaborated in [9 , 
10]. The generic expansion of the molecular space was 
achieved through the recursive application of reaction 
templates, represented as graph transformation rules, on 
molecules represented as graphs. The procedure is illus-
trated in Algorithm 1 and detailed in [11]. The vertices 
in these (molecular) graphs correspond to atoms, and the 
edges represent bonds. Hence, subraphs would correspond 
to molecular fragments. However, this approach omits ste-
reoinformation for the molecules, which is often critical 
for metabolic reactions. As a result, stereoisomeric car -
bohydrates with identical graph representations, such as 
erythrose and threose, ribose and xylose, or ribulose and 
xylulose, cannot be distinguished. The graph transforma-
tion rules modeling each enzymatic reaction are listed 
in Table  5 and elaborated in Appendix A . The molecu-
lar space was expanded from a set of starting molecules 
listed in Appendix Table  12 in Appendix A , until no new 
molecules with fewer than eight carbon atoms could be 
added. This restriction makes the molecular space finite 
and reasonable, as carbohydrates with eight or more car -
bons are typically unstable and rarely observed in meta-
bolic pathways. The expanded molecular space contains 81 
molecules, and the reaction networks generated consisted 
of 414 individual reactions.

phosphate subgraph, making the returned pathways more 
realistic. The formulated ILP to search for nonoxidative gly-
colysis pathways was:
For pathways to 3-hydroxypropionic acid, constraint (8) was 
replaced by outFlow[HPA]= 3 . The formulated ILP had 510 
variables, 184 constraints and was solved using a generic 
ILP solver; in this case, the open-source Coin-OR CBC 
solver [12] was used. It took the ILP solver ∼ 190 seconds to 
solve for the two pathways using seven reactions described 
in Section 4.1. The ILP enumerates pathways based on the 
number of distinct reactions utilized, not the total number 
of reactions in the pathway. Therefore, if a reaction is used 
twice (with a flow of two), it is counted only once when 
ordering the pathways returned by the ILP solver.
Assignment of chemical potentials to vertices
Representing molecules as graphs preserves the connectivity 
information of the atoms but does not include details about 
the relative placement of the atoms in three-dimensional 
space. To address this, we generate a three-dimensional

Enumerating the relevant pathways
Pathways in living organisms metabolize carbohydrates such 
that two carbon atoms from a six-carbon sugar (e.g., fruc-
tose) are lost as carbon dioxide molecules. Our goal is to 
identify pathways that do not produce carbon dioxide from 
starting carbohydrates but instead convert all six carbon 
atoms into three acetylphosphate molecules. Thus, we set a 
search query that restricts the inflow of fructose 6-phosphate 
to one and the outflow of acetylphosphate to three. If the 
number of acetylphosphate molecules produced by the path-
way is less than three, the carbon efficiency of the pathway 
would be suboptimal. The search query is formulated as an 
integer linear program (ILP) to assign integral flows to the 
reactions, representing the number of times each reaction 
must occur in the pathway to produce the target molecules 
from the given source molecule. The mass conservation law 
is represented as a flow conservation constraint for all ver -
tices v, where the flow fe on a hyperedge e  is the number 
of times the reaction represented by the hyperedge occurs 
in the pathway. For all vertices, the number of copies of 
the molecule used by the reactions e  where v  is a reactant 
( in(v) ) must be balanced by the number of copies of the mol-
ecule produced by reactions e  where v is a product ( out(v) ) 
in steady state. Mathematically,
Multiplying the flow fe by a positive integer also produces a 
valid flow that satisfies the mass conservation law. Therefore, 
the inflow is restricted to one fructose 6-phosphate molecule 
to eliminate superfluous solutions, which are base solutions 
scaled by a positive integer. An additional constraint ensures 
that all carbohydrate molecules in the pathway must have a

embedding for the atoms in the molecular graph and use 
that embedding to assign a chemical potential to the mol-
ecule under standard physical conditions. OpenBabel [13] 
was used to create an initial guess for the three-dimensional 
embedding of the molecule using a combination of elemen-
tary rules and frequently encountered molecular subgraphs. 
However, these initial guesses often contain substructures 
with steric clashes or high strain and, therefore, require 
optimization.
The torsional angles in the molecule are adjusted to locate 
a lower-energy conformer, where the energy of the result-
ing conformer is estimated using an elementary force field. 
In this work, the universal force field (UFF) [14] was used. 
The Cartesian coordinates of the optimized embedding of 
the molecule were written out as an .sdf file.
The structures generated by OpenBabel cannot be directly 
used to estimate the chemical potentials because they are 
based on empirical knowledge of a class of molecules. 
Semi-empirical methods, such as xTB [15], offer a fast yet 
accurate way to estimate thermodynamic parameters after 
optimizing the geometry of the molecule (given a reasonable 
initial guess). However, as a chemical tool, xTB requires 
the input file for the molecule to be in one of the standard 
chemical formats. OpenBabel serves as a bridge, convert-
ing graphs with only connectivity information into standard 
structure data files readable by xTB. xTB iteratively opti-
mizes the geometry of the molecule from the input .sdf  
file until the energy change between iterations falls below 
an acceptable tolerance. The optimized geometry is then 
used to assign the chemical potential to the molecule. xTB 
calculates the thermo-statistical translational, rotational, 
and vibrational contributions to the electronic energy to 
determine the chemical potentials, using the rigid-rotor and 
harmonic-oscillator approximations.
The workflow for assigning chemical potentials to mol-
ecules is depicted in Figure 1.
Thermodynamic analyses of pathways
Pathways enumerated by the ILP solver satisfy the con-
straints of mass conservation, but they must also be real-
izable under practical reactor-like settings. While practical 
realizability (encapsulated as whether a reaction is thermo-
dynamically favorable, i.e., has a negative Gibbs free energy 
difference under certain concentrations of the involved mol-
ecules) can be integrated into the ILP modeling as in [16, 
17], in this work, we perform a post-processing of the ILP 
solutions using the calculated chemical potentials. We bor -
row concepts from probability to understand how energy 
tends to distribute itself in the reaction network, making 
some reactions thermodynamically favorable. At first glance, 
this might seem contradictory, as physical laws are universal 
and deterministic, not probabilistic.
We consider the following statement for the second law 
of thermodynamics:
When a system is composed of a large number of mol-
ecules, it is exceedingly likely to spontaneously move 
to a thermodynamic macrostate that maximizes the 
number of possible microstates.
A caveat is that the system must consist of a large number 
of molecules, which might not always be the case in cellular 
compartments in living organisms. The statistics become 
overwhelming (so that they can be formulated as a statistical 
law of large numbers) only when the number of molecules 
in the system is large-hence the justification for using the 
phrase exceedingly likely.

Not all microstates available to the system are equally 
probable. The probability of a microstate depends on its 
energy E, through the Boltzmann factor ∼ exp(−E∕kBT) . 
Furthermore, there may be several microstates with the same 
energy, which is related to the entropy S  of the system by 
the Boltzmann–Planck equation: S = kB ln w , where w is the 
number of microstates in the system and kB is the Boltzmann 
constant. Therefore, the probability, P (E, T) that a system 
is in a macrostate with energy E  and w microstates at tem-
perature T is given by:
In the context of reactions, we are often concerned with 
the relative probabilities of two macrostates. The ratio of 
probabilities of two macrostates with energy E1 and E2 is 
given by:
Under conditions of constant pressure (commonly 
encountered in cellular and bioreactor environ-
ments), the energy E can be replaced by the enthalpy 
H. The numerator of the exponent then becomes 
(H1 − H2)− T(S1 − S2)=Δ H − TΔS =Δ rG  . The quantity 
ΔrG  is the Gibbs free energy difference for the reaction and 
indicates the relative likelihood of the reaction proceeding 
in a particular direction.
For a reaction r ∶ LHS ⟶RHS , if ΔrG < 0 , then the 
ratio PRHS ∕PLHS > 1 , meaning the system is more likely 
to be in the state represented by the RHS. Conversely, if 
ΔrG > 0 , the system prefers the state represented by the 
LHS.
For pathways, the Gibbs free energy is a state function 
and thus independent of the sequence of reactions. There-
fore, all pathways effecting the net reaction for non-oxidative 
glycolysis:

will have the same net Gibbs free energy difference, given 
by ΔrG = 3G(AcP)+ 2G(H 2O)− G(F 6P)−2G(P i) . How-
ever, different pathways use different intermediate reactions, 
resulting in varying intermediate compositions and thermo-
dynamic free energy profiles. Ideally, all constituent reac -
tions in a pathway should be spontaneous in the required 
direction. For consecutive reactions with negative Gibbs free 
energy differences, the molecules on the RHS of the first 
reaction are more likely to appear, forming a subset that 
serves as the LHS of the subsequent reaction. This estab-
lishes a cascade of reactions, where molecules are consecu-
tively transformed into ones with a high probability of being 
observed, provided all reactions in the pathway have nega-
tive Gibbs free energy differences.
Conversely, a reaction with a positive Gibbs free energy 
difference represents a bottleneck. A reaction i  with 
ΔrG i > 0 does not imply that it will not  occur. It simply 
means the reaction is less likely to proceed in the required 
direction compared to the reverse reaction. In cellular envi-
ronments, energy-driven processes and transport mecha -
nisms actively manipulating molecule concentrations can 
render such reactions thermodynamically favorable under 
those conditions, even if they are not under standard physi-
cal conditions. Furthermore, the chemical potentials of the 
molecules, from which the free energy differences are calcu-
lated, are estimated under certain approximations. Errors in 
these estimations could lead to incorrect conclusions.
Results
We enumerate pathways in the generated reaction network, 
and the distribution of the pathways by the number of reac-
tions used, the number of unique reactions utilized, and the 
biphosphate used is shown in Table 6. Intuitively, we hypoth-
esize that pathways utilizing a smaller number of reactions 
(‘shorter paths’ in the network) might be favored because 
it would be simpler to construct a corresponding bioreac-
tor if each reaction takes place in a separate compartment.

Moreover, pathways utilizing fewer reactions would be eas-
ier to study and monitor under laboratory conditions.
Pathways with seven reactions
Two non-oxidative glycolytic pathways with seven reac-
tions were found in the expanded reaction network and are 
shown in Figure 2a and b. The first one uses sedoheptulose-
1,7-biphosphate, while the second uses xylulose-1,5-bi-
phosphate. The first pathway has been studied in [2 ] under 
laboratory conditions and was reported to “overcome bottle-
necks from the previously reported non-oxidative glycolysis 
cycles.” Both pathways use only four of the seven templated 
enzymatic reactions used to expand the reaction network: 
aldolase, aldose-ketose isomerase, phosphohydrolase, and 
phosphoketolase.
We elaborate on the individual reactions in the pathways 
here. Both pathways have two reactions requiring one sub-
strate molecule, while the remaining five reactions require 
two substrate molecules. Only one reaction requires two car-
bohydrate molecules as a substrate, which has been high-
lighted in both pathways. All the other bimolecular reactions 
use either water or phosphate molecules, which are present 
in abundance. Steady-state simulations of the non-oxidative 
glycolytic pathways by [2] have shown that the intermediate 
sedoheptulose-7-phosphate starts accumulating over time, 
limiting the efficiency of the pathway. They addressed this 
problem by introducing a specific phosphoketolase into the 
system, which removed the kinetic bottleneck in the path-
way. The second pathway with seven reactions, depicted in 
Table  8 found in the reaction network, does not produce 
sedoheptulose-7-phosphate at all. However, a drawback 
of this pathway is that while phosphoketolase has been 
widely reported to be active on substrates such as fructose-
6-phosphate, xylulose-5-phosphate [18], and sedoheptulose-
7-phosphate [2], it has not been reported to act on erythru-
lose-4-phosphate, as required by the third reaction in the 
pathway shown in 8. However, if one observes the presence 
of erythrulose-4-phosphate, glycolaldehyde-2-phosphate, 
and xylulose-1,5-biphosphate in a reactor effecting the non-
oxidative glycolytic pathway with optimal carbon efficiency 
using only these four enzymes, it would act as evidence that 
the pathway shown in 8 is also practical.

1,5-biphosphate (bottom panel)

We determined the free energy differences for each reac-
tion used in the two pathways in 7  and 8 . The thermody -
namic free energy profiles for these two pathways are plotted 
in Figure 3a and b, respectively. The green bars represent the 
Gibbs free energy differences for thermodynamically favora-
ble reactions ( ΔrG < 0 ), while the blue bars represent the 
Gibbs free energy differences for reactions that are not ther-
modynamically favorable ( ΔrG > 0 ) under standard physical 
conditions. The bars are annotated with the numerical values 
of the Gibbs free energy differences for the respective reac-
tions. Since free energy is a state function, the net difference 
in Gibbs free energy for the overall pathway is the same for 
both pathways: −236.75 kJ mol−1.
In both pathways, the hydrolysis of the biphosphate by 
the phosphohydrolase is not a thermodynamically favorable 
reaction. While the hydrolysis of sedoheptulose-1,7-biphos-
phate has a positive Gibbs free energy difference of 0.58 
kJ mol−1 , the hydrolysis of xylulose-1,5-biphosphate has a 
higher value of 7.39 kJ mol −1 . The hydrolysis reaction has 
been observed to be sensitive to the pH of the environment 
and the activity of water molecules. The hydrolysis of the 
biphosphate would be expected to be a thermodynamic bot-
tleneck for both pathways. In reality, the cell might adjust 
the physical conditions in the region where the hydrolysis 
takes place to make the reaction favorable. Moreover, the 
free energy of the educts and the products is not simply the 
sum of those of individual molecules because of the complex 
intermolecular interactions (hydrogen bonding, polar inter -
actions, hydrophobic effects) that might take place between 
molecules, especially in solution.

Previously reported pathways
In this section, we analyze the four previously reported 
non-oxidative glycolysis pathways listed in Tables  1, 
2, 3, and 4  and compare them to the shortest pathways 
described in Section  4.1. Note that the count of reac-
tions in Table  9, listing the various characteristics of the 
pathways, is one less than those in the pathways listed in 
Tables 1, 2, 3, and 4  because we cannot represent stereo-
information in molecular graphs. Hence, the molecules 
ribulose-5-phosphate and xylulose-5-phosphate have 
the same representation as graphs. The two reactions 
R5P ⟶Ru5P ⟶X5P are counted as one. All the path-
ways use fructose-1,6-biphosphate.
The reactions involving two carbohydrate molecules as 
substrates (catalyzed by the transaldolase or the transke-
tolase enzymes) might be potential kinetic bottlenecks in 
the pathway. We generate the thermodynamic profiles for 
the four pathways to deduce which reactions might act 
as thermodynamic bottlenecks. The thermodynamic free 
energy profiles indicate that the first reaction catalyzed 
by the transaldolase in all four pathways is unfavorable. 
The hydrolysis of fructose-1,6-biphosphate catalyzed by 
phosphohydrolase has a marginally negative Gibbs free 
energy difference. This was expected from the free energy 
differences for the hydrolysis of the five-carbon and seven-
carbon biphosphates. Except for the first pathway 1  (which 
has three thermodynamically unfavorable reactions), all 
the pathways have only one thermodynamically unfavora-
ble reaction. Increasing the total number of reactions in the 
pathway did not have an adverse effect on the free energy 
differences of the individual reactions.
Two factors might account for the large number of pos-
sible pathways for a non-oxidative glycolytic pathway: the 
promiscuous activity of phosphoketolase and the biphos-
phate that might be hydrolyzed. The phosphoketolase act-
ing on different substrates, as shown in reactions 1 , 2, and 
3, have comparable free energy differences: −44.376 kJ 
mol−1 , −49.666  kJ mol −1 and −53.887 kJ mol −1 , respec-
tively. Regarding the hydrolysis of the biphosphates, the 
hydrolysis of fructose-1,6-biphosphate has a negative 
Gibbs free energy difference of 0.0322 kJ mol −1 , while

the hydrolysis of both xylulose-1,6-biphosphate and 
sedoheptulose-1,7-biphosphate have positive Gibbs free 
energy differences: 7.386 kJ mol −1 and 0.576 kJ mol −1 , 
respectively. The free energies for reactions can be altered 
by changing the concentrations of the molecules involved. 
The hydrolysis of sedoheptulose-1,7-biphosphate is quite 
close to equilibrium.
A ratio of the concentration of only 1.26 for [SBP]/[S7P] 
makes the reaction in thermal equilibrium at 300 K, consid-
ering unit activities of water and phosphate molecules. The 
corresponding value for the ratio of [XBP]/[X5P] so that 
the reaction is in equilibrium is 19.32. These concentration 
gradients can be maintained by the active transport of the 
molecules involved in the reactions (Fig. 4).
Alternative equivalent non‑oxidative glycolysis 
pathways
The results from the previous section indicate that the 
hydrolysis of fructose-1,6-biphosphate is thermodynami-
cally favored compared to the immediate higher or lower

sugars. An exhaustive search for pathways in the gener -
ated molecular space indicates that there is an alternative 
pathway, shown in Figure  5, using eight different reac-
tions (each used once) with the biphosphate of fructose to 
achieve the non-oxidative glycolytic pathway.
This pathway uses five enzymes: phosphoketolase, 
aldose-ketose isomerase, transaldolase, aldolase, and phos-
phohydrolase, as detailed in Table  10. The thermodynamic 
free energy profile for this pathway is plotted in Figure  6. 
Only one reaction, the bimolecular aldol addition reac-
tion involving two carbohydrate molecules catalyzed by a 
transaldolase enzyme, is thermodynamically unfavorable

( ΔrG =+ 4.27 kJ mol −1 ). The experimentally reported 
pathway with eight reactions using the same biphosphate 
also has a thermodynamically unfavorable reaction, albeit 
one with a smaller positive Gibbs free energy difference 
( ΔrG =+ 2.72 kJ mol −1 ). Based on this thermodynamic 
analysis, one might conjecture that both these reactions 
might proceed in parallel in a bioreactor if a phosphoke-
tolase acting on erythrulose is added to the system.
Formulating the search problem as an ILP query allows us 
to exhaustively search for non-oxidative glycolytic pathways 
in the expanded molecular network with the queried length. 
The results from this search are summarized in Table 6. The 
length of a pathway is the number of reactions in the path-
way. If a reaction is used twice in the pathway, it is counted 
twice. There are only two pathways of length seven: both of 
them are described in Section  4.1. There are twelve path-
ways that use eight reactions in total, but seven distinct reac-
tions, and none of them use fructose-1,6-biphosphate. The 
shortest pathways utilizing fructose-1,6-biphosphate are of 
length eight, using all different reactions. They are described 
in Sections 4.2 and 4.3. As one increases the allowed length 
of the pathway, the number of solutions returned by the 
ILP solver increases, as indicated in the last three rows of 
Table 6. The complete list of the pathways enumerated in 
the table can be found in the associated GitHub repository.
Other pathways
Expanding the molecular space using the eight rules led 
to 81 molecules in the reaction network, of which 39 were 
phosphates of carbohydrates, 14 were biphosphates of car -
bohydrates, 23 were carbohydrates, and 5 were other small 
molecules. These other small molecules included phos-
phoric acid, water, ethanoic acid (isomeric to glycolalde -
hyde), methanal, and 3-hydroxypropionic acid (isomeric to 
glyceraldehyde). 3-Hydroxypropionic acid was listed as a 
“proof of concept” product of biosynthesis. It is identified 
as a precursor to prop-2-enoic acid (acrylic acid) [19] and 
the biodegradable polymer poly(3-hydroxypropionic acid), 
or P(3-HPA) [20, 21]. Moreover, acrylic acid can be used 
to synthesize acrylates, which are monomers for versatile 
polymers: poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA-lightweight 
and shatter-resistant alternative to glass) and poly(ethyl 
cyanoacrylate) (PECA-super glues), to name a few. Both eth-
anoic acid (acetic acid) and methanal (formaldehyde) have 
numerous industrial applications apart from being precur -
sors to polymeric units. Therefore, it might be worthwhile to 
explore pathways leading to these molecules in the network. 
Pathways producing more than one formaldehyde molecule 
could not be enumerated in this network. Given that there are 
multiple alternative economical reaction sequences leading 
to the production of formaldehyde [22], producing it via this

biosynthetic method at such a low carbon efficiency might 
not be justified.
Pathways to 3‑hydroxypropioic acid
Since 3-hydroxypropionic acid is a molecule containing 
three carbon atoms, the optimal efficiency would be achieved 
when two molecules are produced from one molecule of 
fructose-6-phosphate, leading to the overall reaction:
In the generated reaction network, six such pathways were 
enumerated that carried out the overall reaction 10 in seven 
steps. Five of these pathways used six unique reactions (one 
reaction was used twice), while the last pathway used seven 
distinct reactions, as shown in Figure  7. All the pathways 
require four of the seven enzymes used to generate the net-
work: aldolase, aldose-ketose isomerase, phosphohydrolase, 
and phosphoketolase.
The pathway in Fig.  8buses only two reactions with a 
positive ΔrG  (it is, in fact, the same reaction implemented 
(10)
F6P + H 2O ⟶2HPA + Pi ΔrG =− 114.428 kJ mol−1
twice), while all other pathways have more thermodynami-
cally unfavorable reactions. This might be processed sepa -
rately, where the phosphate of 3-hydroxypropionic acid is 
collected as a product and the phosphate group removed 
separately. However, in a reactor where non-oxidative gly -
colysis is allowed to execute in parallel, the net reaction 10  
would be overshadowed by it, because it has a much lower 
change in free energy.
Pathways to acetic acid
Preserving the carbon efficiency would lead to the following 
overall reaction, with three molecules of acetic acid as the 
product for every molecule of fructose-3-phosphate:
Sixty-one pathways were enumerated effecting the overall 
reaction 11 in ten steps. Three of these pathways used six 
different reactions (one reaction was used thrice, and a sec-
ond reaction was used twice), six pathways used seven dif-
ferent reactions, while the remaining 52 used eight distinct

reactions. Additionally, acetylphosphate on hydrolysis also 
yields acetic acid. Therefore, in theory, any pathway pro-
ducing acetylphosphate can also be used to produce ace-
tic acid. Moreover, formaldehyde was also obtained in the 
expanded molecular space. However, there might be better 
and more efficient ways to produce formaldehyde than one 
using enzymes. Hence, such pathways are not being dis-
cussed here.
Conclusion
In this work, we attempted to generate the Gibbs free energy 
profiles for pathways implementing non-oxidative glycoly -
sis in the expanded molecular space. The expansion of the 
molecular space using reaction templates for the action of 
each enzyme, along with the ILP-based search for pathways, 
allows us to explore the molecular space without bias. While

the use of Gibbs free energy at standard physical conditions 
might not always mirror what happens inside a cell, it can 
assist in elucidating which pathways might be favored by 
thermodynamics and identifying the bottlenecks in each 
pathway.
A recurring reaction in the pathways with a positive 
change in Gibbs free energy was the hydrolysis of a phos-
phate group from a molecule, whether it involved a carbo -
hydrate biphosphate producing a monophosphate or a carbo-
hydrate monophosphate producing a carbohydrate molecule. 
Since this reaction involves a water molecule, performing it 
in an aqueous medium might shift the reaction energetics 
toward the dephosphorylated products and phosphoric acid.
Another interesting result from the search query for 
pathways implementing non-oxidative glycolysis was the 
involvement of phosphoketolase acting on the phosphate 
of an erythrose phosphate molecule. If one could develop 
a variant of the phosphoketolase enzyme that is active on 
this four-carbon ketose, it might be possible to achieve the 
pathways returned by the ILP solver, provided the required 
concentration gradients are maintained in the system. 
Expanding the molecular space with generic rules (irrespec-
tive of whether the resulting reactions have been previously 
reported) provides insights into numerous possibilities for 
pathways implementing non-oxidative glycolysis-a few of 
which have been studied in greater detail in this work.
While the existing work focuses on pathways ensuring opti-
mal carbon efficiency during non-oxidative glycolysis, there 
is a tendency to prioritize obtaining acetyl phosphate as the 
product because of its metabolic significance. However, other 
molecules in the generated network might also be of interest, 
one of them being 3-hydroxypropionic acid. Under labora-
tory conditions, the products from non-oxidative glycolysis 
are observed because they have lower Gibbs free energy. The

larger Gibbs free energy difference makes the product, acetyl 
phosphate, e
−236.75
−114.28 ∼ 8 times more likely to be observed than 
3-hydroxypropionic acid. However, pathways to 3-hydroxy-
propionic acid require only four of the seven enzymes needed 
for the originally proposed non-oxidative glycolysis. While 
non-oxidative glycolysis might still be achieved using six of 
these seven enzymes, the optimal carbon efficiency cannot 
be achieved with only the four enzymes needed to produce 
3-hydroxypropionic acid. Therefore, in a system with only four 
of these enzymes, the pathway producing 3-hydroxypropionic 
acid might be expected to dominate over some subset of non-
oxidative glycolysis.
The method of analyzing pathways satisfying the con-
straints of mass balance through thermodynamic free energies 
provides insights into pathways that might be promising under 
practical conditions. It identifies bottlenecks in the pathways 
that might require manipulation of the concentrations of the 
molecules involved in those reactions to make them favora-
ble. Lastly, it highlights potentially useful byproducts in the 
expanded network and offers directions for further laboratory 
exploration to synthesize the identified compounds. The results 
discussed in this work might be found in greater detail at [23].
Some interesting molecules and the graph 
transformation rules used
Appendix Table  12 lists the starting molecules used to 
expand the molecular space using the graph transformation 
rules depicted in Appendix Table 11. These rules represent 
templates for the reactions effected by the corresponding 
enzyme. In the rules R  represents a generic group satis-
fying the valencies for the formulae that can match any 
subgraph in the representation of the molecule as a graph. 
Appendix Table 13 lists some of the interesting molecules 
which have been used in the pathways studied in this work.
Of the 81 molecules in the expanded network, 6 
were small molecules, 22 were carbohydrates, 39 were 
monophosphates and 14 were biphosphates. There were 
more monophosphates than carbohydrates because a phos-
phate group might attach to different hydroxyl positions in 
the carbohydrate molecule leading to different monophos-
phate molecules.
