Summary
Polylactide (PLA) is a bio-based plastic commonly syn-
thesized by chemical catalytic reaction using lactic
acid (LA) as a substrate. Here, novel LA-containing ter-
polyesters, namely, P[LA-co-3-hydroxybutyrate (3HB)-
co-3-hydroxypropionate (3HP)], short as PLBP, were
successfully synthesized for theﬁrst time by a recom-
binant Escherichia coli harbouring polyhydroxyalka-
noate (PHA) synthase from Pseudomonas stutzeri
(PhaC1Ps) with 4-point mutations at E130D, S325T,
S477G and Q481K, and 3-hydroxypropionyl-CoA (3HP-
CoA) synthesis pathway from glycerol, 3-hydroxybu-
tyryl-CoA (3HB-CoA) as well as lactyl-CoA (LA-CoA)
pathways from glucose. Combining these pathways
with the PHA synthase mutant phaC1Ps (E130D S325T
S477G Q481K), the random terpolyester P(LA-co-3HB-
co-3HP), or PLBP, was structurally con ﬁrmed by
nuclear magnetic resonance to consist of 2 mol% LA,
90 mol% 3HB, and 8 mol% 3HP respectively.
Remarkably, the PLBP terpolyester was produced
from low-cost sustainable glycerol and glucose.
Monomer ratios of PLBP could be regulated by
ratios of glycerol to glucose. Other terpolyester ther-
mal and mechanical properties can be manipulated
by adjusting the monomer ratios. More PLBP appli-
cations are to be expected.
Introduction
As increasing global warming and plastic pollution threaten
human sustainability, materials from renewable bio-
mass are attracting attention due to their biodegradability
and environmentally friendliness. Polylactide (PLA) is a
representative of bio-based biodegradable polyester syn-
thesized via combination of microbial lactic acid (LA)
fermentation and chemical polymerization of lactide
(Sudesh and Iwata, 2008; Nampoothiriet al., 2010; Park
et al., 2012a,b). PLA has been used in areas of biomedi-
cal implants, food packaging and drug delivery. How-
ever, the complicated synthetic process including
fermentation for LA production, LA puri ﬁcation, lactide
esteriﬁcation and lactide ring-opening polymerization
increases the cost, meanwhile the heavy metal residues
in the ﬁnal polymer products could limit its food or medi-
cal applications. In addition, PLA poor thermal and
mechanical properties are also adverse to its large-scale
applications.
Polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHA) are a family of diverse
polyesters synthesized by a variety of bacteria as intra-
cellular carbon and energy storage compounds (Liet al.,
2007; Chen and Hajnal, 2015; Koller and Rodr /C19ıguez-
Contreras, 2015). As biorenewable and biodegradable
materials, the diversity of PHA provides different physical
properties to suit various applications (Chen, 2009; Brig-
ham and Sinskey, 2012; Koller, 2014). Copolymerization
of LA with other hydroxyalkanoate (HA) monomers via
microbial synthesis is one of the effective methods to
improve the physical properties of PLA or PHA (Liet al.,
2010).
Recently, several engineered PHA synthases able to
utilize lactyl-CoA (LA-CoA) and 3-hydroxybutyric-CoA
(3HB-CoA) as substrates were reported (Taguchiet al.,
2008; Yang et al., 2011; Ochi et al., 2013). To deliver
LA-CoA in recombinant Escherichia coli, propionyl-CoA

several organisms includingClostridium propionicum and
Megasphaera elsdenii were expressed in host strains
respectively. A 6 mol% LA fraction in the copolyester
was achieved.
15 Subsequently, efforts were made on
increasing the LA ratio in the copolyester by regulating
the metabolic ﬂux or evolving the PHA synthase (Jung
et al., 2010; Yamada et al., 2010; Shozui et al., 2011),
and also by the uses of different organisms in addition to
commonly used E. coli, including Corynebacterium glu-
tamicum, Ralstonia eutropha and Sinorhizobium meliloti
(Song et al., 2012; Park et al., 2013; Tran and Charles,
2015). In addition, low-cost carbon substrates, such as
glucose and xylose, were applied to synthesize
LA-based copolyesters (Park et al., 2012a,b; Nduko
et al., 2014; Salamanca-Cardona et al., 2014), which
could reduce production cost and facilitate its industrial-
ization.
As mentioned, PLA has the major de ﬁciencies of
poor ﬂexibility, ductility and thermal resistance, and
copolymerization is possibly effective to improve the
PLA properties. Therefore, LA copolyesters were inves-
tigated with P(LA-co-3HB) as a representative (Taguchi
et al., 2008; Jung et al., 2010; Yamada et al., 2010;
Shozui et al., 2011; Yang et al., 2011; Ochi et al.,
2013). However, mechanical properties of PHB are
similar to PLA, therefore, other monomers such as
3-hydroxyvalerates (3HV), 3-hydroxyhexanoate (3HHx)
and glycolate (GA) were introduced into the LA copo-
lyesters for property improvements (Shozui et al.,
2010a,b; Choi et al., 2016; Li et al., 2016). Remarkably,
poly(3-hydroxypropionate) (P3HP), a relatively new PHA
family member, has become very interesting due to its
strong mechanical properties including an elongation at
break of more than 600% and Young’s modulus of 3
GPa (Andreeßen and Steinb €uchel, 2010; Zhou et al.,
2011a,b; Meng et al., 2012). Thus, 3HP monomers in
LA copolyesters could very likely compensate for the
shortcomings of PLA. This study attempted to biosyn-
thesize a LA-containing terpolyester consisting of LA,
3HP and 3HB with improved properties over PLA
homopolyester.
Results and discussion
Engineering a pathway for biosynthesis of P(LA-co-3HB-
co-3HP) from unrelated carbon source
For the above-mentioned purpose, the substrate speci-
ﬁcity of PHA synthase is the most important factor deter-
mining the monomer constituents incorporated into PHA.
A mutant PHA synthase from Pseudomonas stutzeri
strain 1317 (PhaC1
Ps) with 4-point mutations at E130D,
S325T, S477G and Q481K was prepared as stated
below, which could incorporate LA and other 3-HAs into
PLBP terpolyester. In addition, a 3HP synthetic pathway
combined with LA and 3HB pathways were constructed
to supply the monomers for the terpolyester synthesis
(Fig. 1).
The engineering pathway allows adjustments of 3HB,
LA and 3HP monomer ratios in the terpolyesters by
feeding various ratios of glucose to glycerol. When a
higher LA ratio is needed, LA can be added to the cul-
ture to supply additional LA precursor.
Engineering a PHA synthase able to polymerize LA
The substrate speciﬁcity into PHA synthase is the most
important factor determining the monomer constituents
incorporated into PHA. Common PHA synthases are
capable of polymerizing the 3-hydroxyalkanoates (3HAs)
CoA with variable carbon chain lengths (Bernd, 2003).
LA, which is the monomer of PLA, is a 2HA, which is
not accepted by natural PHA synthases. To synthesize
PLBP terpolyesters, a mutant of PHA synthase, able to
incorporate LA and other 3-HAs at the same time was
obtained via site-directed mutagenesis on type II PHA
synthase PhaC1
Ps of P. stutzeri 1317 which has already
a versatile substrate speciﬁcity (Park et al., 2015). Five
mutation sites on phaC1ps (phaC2ps), including E130D,

et al., 2008; Jung et al., 2010; Yamada et al., 2010;
Yang et al., 2011; Chuahet al., 2013; Ochiet al., 2013).
With various combinations of these site mutations, up to
20 phaC1
Ps and phaC2Ps variants were constructed
(Table S1). To compare their activities towards LA poly-
merization, the 3HB-CoA synthetic pathway including
genes of b-ketothiolase (phaA), NADPH-dependent ace-
toacetyl-CoA reductase (phaB)o f R. eutropha, LA-CoA
synthetic pathway including lactate dehydrogenase
(ldhA)o f E. coli and propionyl-CoA transferase (pct)o f
Clostridium propionicum were constructed into a series
of plasmids termed pBLPCAB-X (X represents the speci-
ﬁc phaC variant in the plasmid). pBLPCAB-Xs were
derived from pBHR68 (kindly donated by Prof Steinb}u-
chel of M}unster Univ/Germany), with the three genes of
ldhA, pct and phaC variant inserted downstream the P
re
promoter. The LA polymerization activities of typical
phaC variants were determined by expressing the corre-
sponding plasmids inE. coli S17-1 (Table 1).
When analysing the PHA accumulation capacity, sin-
gle-point mutation on phaCPs was found insufﬁcient for
LA polymerizations (data not shown). By combining
Q481K and S325T mutations in phaC1Ps, the recombi-
nant started to synthesize P(2.81% LA-co-3HB) copolye-
ster, con ﬁrming two-point mutant phaC1Ps (Q481K
S325T) capable of polymerizing LA into PHA. Additional
mutations on E130D and S477G to the above two points
mutant increased the LA speciﬁcity as the LA ratio in the
PHA copolyester produced by the recombinant express-
ing phaC1
Ps (Q481K S325T E130D S477G) increased
to over 5% (Table 1). However, mutation F392S had a
negative effect on LA incorporation, as F392S added to
phaC1
Ps (Q481K S325T E130D S477G) reduced LA
ratio in the copolyester to 3% (Table 1). Interestingly,
phaC2
Ps showed no activity towards LA-CoA no matter
what point mutations were introduced. As a result, the

Construction of an effective PLBP synthetic system
Aimed to produce a novel terpolyester PLBP, three syn-
thetic pathways for each constituent were constructed
(Fig. 1), including PHB and PLA synthetic routes that
were reported. The P3HP synthetic pathway was
focused on as it would improve the mechanical proper-
ties of the terpolyesters.
P3HP could be synthesized from 1, 3-propanediol,
glycerol and glucose (Andreeßen and Steinb€uchel, 2010;
Zhou et al., 2011a,b; Meng et al., 2015). Glycerol was
chosen in this study to regulate 3HP ratio in the copolye-
sters, whereas glucose was the substrate for PLA and
3HB synthesis. The 3HP synthetic pathway from glycerol
consisted of genes encoding glycerol dehydratase
(dhaB)o f Klebsiella pneumoniae, 1,3-propanediol dehy-
drogenase (dhaT) and aldehyde dehydrogenase (aldD)
of Pseudomonas putida KT2442 and ACS domain of tri-
functional propionyl-CoA synthetase (pcs’) functioning as
a CoA ligase of Chloroﬂexus aurantiacus (Andreeßen
and Steinb €uchel, 2010; Zhou et al., 2011a,b; Meng
et al., 2012). The p3HP1p plasmid was constructed
based on the pSEVA351 for P3HP production and con-
tained genes ofdhaT, aldD, dhaB and pcs’ (Silva-Rocha
et al., 2013). Gene fragmentsdhaT-aldD, pcs and dhaB
were ampliﬁed from plasmid pZQ03, pDC02 and pZQ01
respectively. Subsequently, the pSEVA351 backbone
was ligated with these three fragments by Gibson
assembly. When strengthen the expression of dominant
gene dhaB controlling glycerol utilization, the optimized
plasmid p3HP2p exhibited enhanced efﬁciency in P3HP
synthesis when it was co-expressed with pBHR68 in
recombinant E. coli S17-1 (Table S3).
Finally, recombinantE. coli S-LA-3HP harbouring plas-
mids pLA and p3HP2p was obtained. When cultivated in
LB medium supplemented with 20 g L
/C01 glucose and
10 g L/C01 glycerol, a new terpolyester P(90.41 mol%
3HB-co-7.78 mol% 3HP-co-1.81 mol% LA) was success-
fully synthesized for theﬁrst time from unrelated carbon
sources glucose and glycerol.
Nuclear magnetic resonance analyses of the PLBP
terpolyester
The composition and monomer sequence distribution of
P(3HB-co-3HP-co-LA) was conﬁrmed by nuclear mag-
netic resonance (NMR) (Fig. 3). From the1H NMR spec-
tra (Fig. 3A), there were not only well-characterized
proton resonances of B(2), B(3) and B(4) in 3HB units
(3HB abbreviated as B, 3HP monomer abbreviated as P
and LA abbreviated as A) but also additional four proton
resonances assigned to the 3HP units such as P(2), P
(3) and LA units including A(2) and A(3) with identical
intensities based on the previous studies (Park et al.,
2013, 2015; Menget al., 2015). The molar ratio of 3HB,
3HP and LA in the PHA copolyester was 90.41%, 7.78%
and 1.81%, respectively, as calculated using the inten-
sity of B(3), P(3) and A(2). The individual carbon species
in 3HB, 3HP and LA monomer were also identiﬁed by
speciﬁc
13C NMR (Fig. 3B). The expanded spectra of
individual splitting resonance of carboxyl carbon B(1), P
(1) and A(1) in the copolyester were split into multiple
peaks (Fig. 3C), which were assigned to the 3HB-
centred (B(1)*B), 3HP-centred (P(1)*P), LA-centred (A
(1)*A) and the three units comonomer sequences [B(1)
*P(1)*A(1)] (N*M represents the interaction of monomer
N and M) (Meng et al., 2015; Park et al., 2015). This
phenomenon was due to different sequence arrange-
ments of 3HB, 3HP and LA monomers in the polymer
chains, which is common in random PHA copolyesters
(Hu et al., 2011; Tripathiet al., 2012).
The tacticity distribution of tri-block copolyester was
studied via
13C NMR based on various stereo-
sequences. The good resolution of methylene regions B
(2) was chosen as an example for analysis. Two sharp
peaks corresponding to B(2) *B and B(2) *P*A were
observed (Fig. 3D). No split in each peak was visible,
indicating that the stereo-sequence was isotactic. If the

polymer is syndiotactic or atactic, some diad or quadru-
ple peaks should be observed in 13C NMR (Kemnitzer
et al., 1993; Hocking and Marchessault, 1995). The
above detailed analysis of1H NMR and13C NMR spec-
tra clearly indicated that PHA was a random copolyester
P(3HB-co-3HP-co-LA) with an isotactic microstructure.
Regulation of the monomer ratios in PLBP terpolyesters
Recombinant E. coli S17-1 harbouring genes described
in Fig. 1 could produce terpolyesters PLBP consisting of
LA, 3HB and 3HP when grown in a mixture of glucose
and glycerol as substrates (Table 2). The terpolyesters
PLBP were fully synthesized from unrelated carbon
sources, which was more economic for PHA synthesis
(Hermann-Krauss et al., 2013; Povolo et al., 2013).
Compositions of monomers LA, 3HB and 3HP in PLBP
could be adjusted by changing the glucose-to-glycerol
ratios.
Lactic acid ratio was as low as 1.81% in the ter-
polyester when PLBP was produced by the wild-type
E. coli S17-1 harbouring genes described in Fig. 1. To
increase the LA ratio in PLBP, the synthetic pathway
was optimized and the competitive pathways of LA were
deleted. Gene ldhA was inserted in pLA plasmid and
was overexpressed to produce more LA as ldhA func-
tions in converting pyruvate into LA (Junget al., 2010).
However, it was found that overexpression ofldhA alone
could not enhance the LA content in the terpolyester
(Table S4) as a gene dld could convert LA back into
pyruvate (Dymet al., 2000; Choiet al., 2016). Unexpect-
edly, the recombinant strain-containing plasmid pLA ’
without ldhA, replacing pLA plasmid of the PLBP syn-
thetic system, synthesized a PLBP terpolyester with an
increased LA ratio under the same culture conditions
(Fig. S1.2). The deletion ofldhA in pLA plasmid resulted
in a transcriptional change in those genes downstream
the same promoter for the ones that were closer to the
promoter (Fig. S1.1). It was proven that the transcrip-
tional level of pct was correlated with the LA ratio in
PLBP terpolyesters from the RT-PCR results (Fig. S1.2).
It suggested that PCT-mediated CoA transfer reaction
that transformed LA into LA-CoA was the time-limiting
step of LA polymerization. Meanwhile, to improve LA
production, a competitive pathway, pyruvate – formate
pathway, was weakened. Gene pﬂA, the activator of
pyruvate– formate lyase, was knocked out inE. coli S17-
1 (Zhu and Shimizu, 2004; Shozui et al., 2010b; Zhou
et al., 2011a,b). The genepﬂA knockout lead to an obvi-
ous decrease in formate production of the strain,
whereas the lactate concentration in the culture medium
increased oppositely (Fig. S2).
Escherichia coli S17-1 DpﬂA harbouring two plasmids
of pLA’ and p3HP2p was constructed and studied in
shake ﬂasks using different substrates combinations
(Table 2 and Fig. 4). Obviously, the LA ratio in PLBP
terpolyester produced by this recombinant was increased
compared with the wild-type E. coli S17-1. The sub-
strates added to the culture were utilized simultaneously
indicating the synthesis of random copolyesters (Fig. 4).
In general, several tendencies could be summarized
from the data: there was a positive correlation between
LA ratio and glucose concentration. Especially when glu-
cose concentration was decreased to 10 g L
/C01, the LA
ratio was down to 0.79% because most of the glucose

Microbial synthesis of a novel terpolyester375
was utilized for cell growth; when extra D, L-LA was
added into the medium, LA ratio increased sharply to
more than 27%, whereas the cell dry mass (CDM) was
deceased oppositely due to the toxicity of LA; as the
substrate of P3HP, glycerol affected 3HP ratio in PLBP
terpolyester in a similar relationship as that between glu-
cose and LA ratio. Interestingly, 3HP ratio reached its
peak value of 12.03% when glucose was reduced to
10 g L
/C01. Synthesis of PLBP terpolyester with variable
compositions was achieved.
At a high glucose concentration of 30 g L /C01, cells
grew to over 5.2 g L/C01 containing close to 60% PHA,
this was both the highest cell growth and the highest
PHA accumulation compared with other low glucose
concentration (Table 2). The terpolyester consisted of
9% 3HP, 12% LA and 79% 3HB. The result indicated
that high concentration of glucose favoured formation of
cell mass and PHA, especially PHB. At the lowest glyc-
erol concentration of 2 g L
/C01, 3HP had the lowest con-
tent of 5% in the terpolyester. LA addition improved LA
ratios in the terpolyester, but it had negative effect on
cell growth (Table 2). Hence, several strategies exist to
change the composition of the monomer level by adjust-
ing the ratio of fed carbon sources.
Physical characterization of PLBP with different
monomer compositions
Two types of PLBPs were extracted and the composi-
tions of them were determined by GC. The physical
properties of PLBPs including molecular mass, thermal
properties and mechanical properties were studied
(Table 3). The weight average molecular mass of PLBP
was less than 29 10
5, which was lower compared with
its homopolyester and P(LA- co-3HB) copolyester, yet
approximated the same as weight average molecular
mass of PLBV terpolyesters (Shozui et al., 2010b). In
addition, PLBPs inherited the ductility of P3HP as it
had an improved elongation at break of over 100%
when the 3HP ratio reached 15%. The thermal parame-
ters including T
m, Tg and DHm of PLBP were in
between of those of individual homopolyesters (PLA,
P3HB and P3HP) as blocks. Interestingly, PLBPs had
two T
m and the lower one was close to theTm of PHB.
Possibly, the presence of 3HB-rich segments in the ter-
polyester led to this phenomenon. The incorporation of
3HP into P(LA-co-3HB) signiﬁcantly improved the ten-
sile strength and elongation at break compared with its
copolyester P(LA-co-3HB).
Conclusions
Recombinant E. coli S17-1 DpﬂA consisting of three
synthetic pathways of lactyl-CoA, 3-hydroxypropionyl-
CoA and 3-hydroxybutyryl-CoA was able to polymerize
the three monomers to form random terpolyester P(LA-

Microbial synthesis of a novel terpolyester377
When an antibiotic selection pressure was required, the
medium was supplemented with ampicillin
(100 lgm L
/C01), kanamycin (50 lgm L/C01) or chloram-
phenicol (34 lgm L/C01). To increase the LA ratio in the
terpolyester, various amounts of D, L-LA (1, 2 or
5gL /C01) were added into the LB medium along with
NaOH-modulating pH to neutral. When P3HP was the
constituent of the polymer, 5lM vitaminB
12 (VB12) was
added into the medium to maintain the activity of glycerol
dehydratase (dhaB).
PHA analysis, extraction and puriﬁcation
Cells were harvested by centrifugation (CR21 GIII; Hita-
chi, Tokyo, Japan) at 10 000 rpm/min for 8 min, then
washed with distilled water and centrifuged again. CDM
were measured after the concentrated cells were lyophi-
lized at /C065°C with ﬁve times air pressure (LGJ-10C;
SiHuanKeXue, Beijing, China). Thirty to fourty milligrams
of lyophilized cells was used for the transesteriﬁcation
reaction in which 2 mL of transesteriﬁcation mixture and
2 mL of chloroform were added in each transesteriﬁca-
tion test tube (Katoet al., 1996). After a 4 h transesteriﬁ-
cation at 100 °C, the PHA content and monomer
compositions of the cells were assayed by gas chro-
matograph (GC-2014; Shimadzu, Suzhou, China)
(Ouyang et al., 2007). The intracellular polymers were
extracted using a Soxhlet extractor (Soxtec 2050; Foss,
Hilleroed, Denmark). The extracted PHA was puriﬁed via
precipitation when mixed with the 10-folds volume of ice-
cold ethanol and dissolved in chloroform forﬁlm casting.
Metabolic ﬂux analysis
Concentrations of LA, glycerol and glucose were deter-
mined using a high-performance liquid chromatography
(HPLC) (LC-20A; Shimadzu) equipped with an ion
exchange column (Aminexs HPX-87H; Bio-Rad,
7.8 9 300 mm
2, Hercules, California, USA) and a refrac-
tive index detector (RID-10A; Shimadzu). Genepct tran-
scriptional level was assayed using RT-PCR. Total RNA
was extracted from recombinantE. colistrains using RNA
prep pure Cell/Bacteria Kit (Tiangen, Beijing, China).
cDNA was synthesized using Fastquant RT Kit (Tiangen)
and then real-time PCR (RT-PCR) was carried out for
mRNA analysis with SuperReal PreMix (SYBR Green;
Tiangen). 16S rRNA was used as the inner standard. The
experimental procedures were described (Lvet al., 2015).
NMR analysis on PHA
The
1H and 13C spectra were obtained using a JEOL
JNM-ECA 600 NMR spectrometer to measure the poly-
mer compositions, the chemical microstructures and the
monomer sequences. Tetramethylsilane was used as
the internal standard.
Molecular mass and other properties of PHA
Molecular mass was determined via gel permeation chro-
matography (GPC Spectra System P2000; Shimadzu)
equipped with a Shimadzu HSG60 column at 40°C. The
melting temperature (T
m), enthalpy of fusion (DHm) and
glass-transition temperature (Tg) were measured via differ-
ential scanning calorimetry (DSC-60; Shimadzu) in a tem-
perature ranging from/C080°C to 200°C under a nitrogen
atmosphere of 50 mL min/C01. Thermal stabilities of the
materials were studied by a thermogravimetric analyser
(TA-Q50; TA Instrument, New Castle, Delaware, USA).
Three to ﬁve milligrams of each sample was loaded at
temperature ranging from 10 to 400°C in a nitrogen atmo-
sphere of 50 mL min
/C01 (Shen et al., 2009). Mechanical
properties were studied using a materials testing machine
(INSTRON 3365; Instron, Grove City, Ohio, USA) at room
temperature at a speed of 5 mm min
/C01.
