CO2 ﬁxation plays a key role to make biobased production cost competitive.
Here, we use 3-hydroxypropionic acid (3-HP) to showcase how CO2 ﬁxation
enables approaching theoretical-yieldproduction. Usinggenome-scale meta-
bolic models to calculate the production envelope, we demonstrate that the
p r o v i s i o no fb i c a r b o nate, formed from CO2, restricts previous attempts for
high yield production of 3-HP. We thus develop multiple strategies for bicar-
bonate uptake, including the identiﬁcation of Sul1 as a potential bicarbonate
transporter, domain swapping of malonyl-CoA reductase, identiﬁcation of
Esbp6 as a potential 3-HP exporter, and deletion of Uga1 to prevent 3-HP
degradation. The combined rational engineering increases 3-HP production

neered yeast forms the basis for commercialization of bio-acrylic acid, while
our CO
2 ﬁxation strategies pave the way for CO2 being used as the sole carbon
source.
Biobased chemical1 and biofuel2 production as replacement of
petroleum-based production could assist in mitigating green-house
gas emissions while establishing sustainable economic activities
3.
However, these biobased productions also result in emissions of the
greenhouse gas CO2,a n dﬁxing emitted CO2 into products is therefore
of great interest4, in particular as this may also result in higher carbon-
yields and therefore improves process economics.
Intracellular inorganic carbon exists in four forms: dissolved
CO2, carbonic acid, bicarbonate, and carbonate5, that could be
interconverted based on the pH and salinity. It has been reported
that compared with 5% CO2 supply, 10% CO2 could increase itaconic
acid production by two-fold in yeast6. At pH 7.4 and 20 °C, the con-
centration of CO2 in equilibrium with the gaseous state is only
0.012 mM, whereas the concentration of bicarbonate in equilibrium
with air is 0.26 mM7. Since the pH in the cytoplasm is approximately
neutral8, inorganic carbon mainly exists in the form of bicarbonate9,
which means increasing intracellular bicarbonate concentrations
could be more appealing than enhancing the higher CO
2 partial
pressure. Bicarbonate can be captured by native carboxylation
reactions, of which the acetyl-CoA carboxylation catalysed by acetyl-

CoA carboxylase Acc1 is known to carry a highﬂux in yeast. The
generated malonyl-CoA can be transformed into 3-hydroxypropionic
acid (3-HP), which represents a valuable chemical intermediate.
Efﬁcient capture of CO
2 into 3-HP can improve the carbon yield in its
production, and this step is also crucial in the native CO2 ﬁxation
pathway 3-hydroxypropionate/4-hydroxybutyrate (HP/HB) cycle10
and 3-hydroxypropionate bi-cycle11.
3-HP holds a signiﬁcant position as the potentially third-largest
biobased platform compound, with an estimated potential annual
m a r k e ts i z eo fU S D1 0b i l l i o n
12,13. One of the key reasons behind its
prominence is its ease of dehydration into acrylate, a crucial compo-
nent used in the production of synthetic polymers like super-
absorbents applied in disposable diapers
14. The production of 3-HP
has thus garnered considerable attention, but the major hurdle
remains the low yield of 3-HP on the substrate, posing a signiﬁcant
challenge to establish an industrial scale process
15. A comprehensive
analysis of 3-HP production in yeast reveals that the best yield achieved
thus far in terms of the 3-HP to substrate (glucose) ratio is approxi-
mately 0.31 g/g
16, which corresponds to only 39.7% of the maximum
theoretical yield15. This falls short of the commercial requirement for
3-HP to acrylate production, which highlights the current limitations in
3-HP production and underscores the need for signiﬁcant improve-
ments in yield to meet the demands of the industry.
In this study, we conduct production envelope analysis by Yeast8
model andﬁnd that previous attempts to produce 3-HP is restricted by
the availability of bicarbonate. We therefore engineer yeast to break
this restriction and hereby achieve high carbon yield production of
3-HP. This is achieved through employing multiple strategies to
increase the accessible bicarbonate, minimize native CO
2 release, as
well as by avoiding carbon waste. Hereby we achieve a 0.5625 g 3-HP/g
glucose yield (89.3% of the theoretical yield of 3-HP with biomass
generation). Furthermore, the high titre of 3-HP obtained through a
microbial fermentation can easily be transformed to acrylate with a
yield of 100%.
Results
Limited provision of bicarbonate restricts 3-HP production
The production envelope analysis of 3-HP via the malonyl-CoA
reductase pathway was calculated using the Yeast8 model
17,a n dt h i s
was used to analyse the carbonﬂux and identify limiting factors for
3-HP production. Contrary to the general belief that the precursors of
acetyl-CoA and malonyl-CoA, as well as the redox cofactors and ATP
are the key requirements for 3-HP production, our analysis suggested
that a highﬂux of bicarbonate (Fig.1a) could be crucial for efﬁcient
3-HP production, i.e., theﬂux of bicarbonate should be 1.562 times
higher than that of the substrate (glucose) to achieve the maximum
3-HP production (Fig.1a). Unfortunately, such aﬂux of bicarbonate is
unattainable within the native metabolism, even if we assume that
bicarbonate can be freely converted from CO
2. The cellular metabo-
lism is simply incapable of providing enough CO2 to generate the
required bicarbonate for 3-HP production18, regardless of the meta-
bolic state being respiration (efﬁcient CO2 generation state) or fer-
mentation (non-efﬁcient CO2 generation state) (Fig.1a). Moreover, if
we consider that the CO2 generated is in a gaseous state intracellularly,
it would promptly leave the liquid phase, and the carboxylation pro-
cess by Acc1 necessitates the presence of bicarbonate dissolved in
water (Fig. 1b). These factors further exacerbate the deﬁciency of
bicarbonate. Speciﬁcally, in the native metabolic context, the limited
ﬂux of bicarbonate signiﬁcantly reduced the theoretical maximum
yield of 3-HP from 0.781 g/g glucose to approximately 0.440 g/g (fer-
mentation state)−0.490 g/g (respiration state) (Fig.1a). This result
indicated that the availability of bicarbonate is the primary bottleneck
for 3-HP production, effectively restricted all previous attempts at
metabolic ﬂux rewiring in this production envelope boundary. To
address this issue, it is imperative to ensure an ample supply of
bicarbonate for Acc1 carboxylation while minimizing CO
2 loss during
acetyl-CoA and energy generation.
The carbon conserved loop from glucose to 3-HP
We started by establishing a carbon conserved loop that effectively
recycled the lost carbon to increase the theoretical carbon-yield for
3-HP production (Fig.1b). The split mutant of the bi-functional enzyme
MCR fromChloroﬂexus aurantiacus
19 was used for 3-HP production, as
it exhibited efﬁcient conversion of malonyl-CoA to malonic semi-
aldehyde (MSA) via the mutated MCR-CN941V K1107W S1115Rdomain and then
to 3-HP via the MCR-N domain20 (Fig. 1b). Integration of the split MCR
into the chromosome together withACC1 overexpression resulted in a
3-HP titre of 0.136 g/L in the QLW1 strain (Fig.1c). Then, to test our
hypothesis we added 10 mM sodium bicarbonate to the medium, and
indeed increased the 3-HP titre to 0.15 g/L (P value = 0.012813). Thus,
for the following fermentation processes, 10 mM sodium bicarbonate
was consistently added unless described otherwise.
Next, to reduce the CO
2 release while producing acetyl-CoA, we
integrated the phosphoketolase (PK) pathway reported in our previous
study
21, including a xylulose-5-phosphate-prefered phosphoketolase
(xPK) fromLeuconostoc mesenteroidesand a phosphotransacetylase
(PTA), fromClostridium kluyveri, and enhanced 3-HP production to
0.39 g/L (Fig. 1c, QLW2). Further, to release Acc1 from post-
translational regulation, we introduced two site mutations, S659A
and S1157A, which prevent phosphorylation of Acc1 by Snf1, thereby
activating Acc1’s activity
22. It then resulted in an increased 3-HP titre to
0.65 g/L in the QLW3 strain (Fig.1c).
To achieve a higherﬂux through the PK pathway, extensive gen-
otype modiﬁcations were reported to redirect carbonﬂux from gly-
colysis to the oxidative pentose phosphate (oxPP) pathway21.W e
instead turned to transcription factors (TFs) to investigate whether a
single gene modiﬁcation could achieve the overall carbonﬂux rewir-
ing. Stb5 is a TF and an NADPH regulator
23 that represses the expres-
sion ofPGI1, coding the rate-limiting reaction of glycolysis at glucose-
6 - p h o s p h a t et or e w i r et h eﬂux from glycolysis to the oxPP pathway24.
Stb5 has been used to redirect the carbonﬂux for the production of
protopanaxadiol in yeast25. We thus overexpressedSTB5 with theTEF1
promoter. However, the growth of the strain was signiﬁcantly inhibited
(Supplementary Fig. 1). qPCR results indicated that the strength of the
TEF1 promoter was around 12-fold higher than that of the nativeSTB5
promoter (Fig.1d, QLW4), that may have been too strong for reg-
ulating the TF expression in the cell. Thus, we placed the TATA box
adjacent to the core promoter ofTEF1
26 (Fig. 1d) and constructed an
artiﬁcial promoter to replace the native promoter ofSTB5,a n dq P C R
results showed that its strength was around 2.5-fold greater than that
of the nativeSTB5promoter (Fig.1d, QLW5). Indeed, the strain with this
artiﬁcial promoter-controlled STB5 enhanced 3-HP production to
0.74 g/L (Fig.1c, QLW5).
Meanwhile, we tried to employ carbonic anhydrase and a bicar-
bonate transporter to enhance the intracellular bicarbonate content
for the production of 3-HP (Fig.1e). This CO
2 concentrating system has
successfully increased the production of succinate inE. coli27,28.S i m i -
larly, overexpression ofNCE103, the native carbonic anhydrase in
yeast29, could also improve 3-HP production to 0.7 g/L in QLW6
(Fig.1f). Furthermore, we tried toﬁnd a native bicarbonate transporter
in yeast. Bicarbonate diffuses poorly into the cell27,a n dt h e r e f o r e
requires SLC4 and SLC26 as two kinds of anion transporters to assist
the active transport process
30. Bor1, a boron efﬂux transporter of the
plasma membrane belonging to the SLC4 family, can also bind bicar-
bonate (Fig.1g)
31, whereas no bicarbonate transporter from the SLC26
family has been reported in yeast32. To identify potential bicarbonate
transporters, we performed a phylogenetic analysis of key species of
the SLC4 and SLC26 families (Fig.1g). We identiﬁed Sul1/2, which were
previously regarded as sulphate permeases

close phylogenetic relationship with human SLC26A11, a Cl-/HCO3
−
exchanger in the kidney34. While both Sul1 and Sul2 structures exhibit
signiﬁcant similarity to SLC26A11, Sul1 displays a higher number of
equivalent positions (545 equivalent positions), suggesting a higher
possibility for the potential bicarbonate import function of yeast Sul1
(Supplementary Fig. 2). To verify this, we overexpressedSUL1, SUL2,
and deleted BOR1, respectively. Hereby the 3-HP titre increased to
0.83 g/L inSUL1overexpressing yeast, which was a 27.7% improvement
over the control strain (Fig.1f, QLW8). Meanwhile, theﬁnal OD
600 of
this strain also increased from 6.97 to 7.65, which was 9.8% higher than
that of the control strain (Supplementary Fig. 3). These results
demonstrated the potential of Sul1 as the bicarbonate importer and

the importance of intracellular bicarbonate availability for 3-HP
production.
Next, we intended to combine the above strategies ofSTB5 and
SUL1overexpression to close this carbonconservation loop, yet the 3-HP
production in the resulted QLW10 strain dropped to 0.31 g/L, which was
even lower than that of the reference strains QLW5 and QLW8 (Fig.1h).
Analysis of extracellular metabolites revealed the presence of 0.37 g/L of
oxaloacetate (OAA) in the QLW10 strain but not the QLW8 strain (Sup-
plementary Fig. 4). We speculated that the increased intracellular
bicarbonate content also improved other bicarbonate utilizing reac-
tions, such as the carboxylation of pyruvate to OAA catalysed by Pyc1
and Pyc2, and therefore tried various strategies to decrease the accu-
mulation of OAA (Fig.1i). Yet, the deletion ofCIT2 that encoded the key
gene of the glyoxylate cycle didn’t recover 3-HP titre (Fig.1h, QLW11),
with acetate accumulated instead (Supplementary Fig. 5). We next
focused on enhancing the utilization of OAA. Firstly, we overexpressed
CIT1encoding the mitochondrial citrate synthase that converts OAA and
acetyl-CoA to citrate, and improved 3-HP production to 0.44 g/L (Fig.1h,
QLW12). Similarly, we tested Cit1
S462A enabling the enzyme to defer
phosphorylation regulation35, and increased 3-HP production to 0.45 g/L
(Fig. 1h, QLW13). We also overexpressed Ptc6 and Ptc7, which could
selectively dephosphorylate mitochondrial proteins, especially the Ptc7
that could dephosphorylate Cit1 and enhance yeast respiration36.
Indeed, overexpression ofPTC7 in the QLW15 strain could not only
recover but further increase the production of 3-HP to 1.18 g/L (Fig.1h).
Next, we overexpressed Yhm2, an OAAtransporter in themitochondrial
membrane37, and the cytosolic NADP-speciﬁci s o c i t r a t ed e h y d r o g e n a s e
Idp2 that could provide more cytosolic NADPH37, further increased 3-HP
production to 1.34 g/L (Fig.1h, QLW19), that were 81.1% and 60.9%
improvement over the control strain QLW5 and QLW8, respectively.
Improved conversion of malonyl-CoA to 3-HP
To provide enough malonyl-CoA for 3-HP production, another copy of
ACC1
S659A S1157A with TEF1 promoter was integrated into the chromo-
some, yet the growth of the strain was strongly disturbed. It has been
reported that the intracellular malonyl-CoA level is strictly regulated
by the AMP-activated kinase (AMPK)
38 signalling pathway and a high
concentration of malonyl-CoA could be toxic to the cell39.T h i sr e s u l t
suggested that the elevated malonyl-CoA concentration being beyond
the range the cell could handle
40. Therefore, we focused on more
efﬁcient conversion of malonyl-CoA into 3-HP.
We started by expressing MCR-N and MCR-C in different combi-
nations, and expressing the MCR-N domain and MCR-CN941V K1107W S1115R
domain16,20 using a higher copy number plasmid increased 3-HP pro-
duction to 4.12 g/L in QLW23 (Fig.2a, b). Currently, there is no crystal
structure of MCR fromC. aurantiacus, and only crystal structures of the
MCR-N domain and the MCR-C domain fromPorphyrobacter dokdo-
nensis have been published41. Using SWISS-MODEL, we generated a
homologous model of MCR fromC. aurantiacususing known structures
of the MCR-N domain (PDB: 6k8v) andM C R - Cd o m a i n( P D B :6 k 8 s )f r o m
P. dokdonensis(Fig. 2c) as the template. We noticed that the MCR-N
domain could be separated into two short-chain dehydrogenase/
reductase
41 domains: SDR domain 1 (MCR-N domain/SDR1, M1– L284)
and SDR domain 2 (MCR-N domain/SDR2, P285– I550). The MCR struc-
ture revealed that the cofactor and substrate only bind to the SDR1
domain, indicating that enzyme catalysis may not occur at the SDR2 of
the MCR-N domain
41. Yet, when we deleted the MCR-N-SDR2 domain,
the production of 3-HP had a strong decrease (Fig.2d, QLW24). This
result suggested that even though the MCR-N-SDR2 domain has no
catalytic function, it may help the MCR-N-SDR1 domain to maintain its
proper structure. Toﬁnd a more efﬁcient domain converting MSA to 3-
HP, we performed domain swapping using SDRs from different species
and obtained the improved malonyl-CoA reductase. Specially, we iden-
tiﬁed potential MCR-N-SDR1 domains through the substrate structural
similarity, such as Ora1 (reported as the serine dehydrogenase)
42 fromS.
cerevisiae, and YdfG (reported as the NADP+-dependent dehydrogenase
with broad substrate speciﬁcity on 3-hydroxy acids)42 from E. coli
(Fig.2c). Serine can be seen as 2-amino-3-hydroxypropionic acid, which
could be regarded as the amino group substituted at the second carbon
atom site of 3-HP. The substrate structural similarity together with the
broad substrate speciﬁcity to 3-hydroxy acids of Ora1 and YdfG indicated
the potential of these enzymes for 3-HP production. Indeed, the use of
Ora1 and YdfG as MCR-N-SDR1 exhibited 26.1% and 28.5% improvements,
producing 5.2 g/L and 5.3 g/L 3-HP, respectively (Fig.2d, QLW25,
QLW26). Neither codon optimization nor the application of a protein
linker
43 could further improve the production of 3-HP (Fig.2d). The
ﬁnding that common cell factories such asS. cerevisiaeand E. colipos-
sess native enzymes catalysing malonic semialdehyde to 3-HP could
potentially explain why adjusting the expression the of MCR-N domain
and MCR-C domain was always irregular and been impute into ambiguity
explainations
20,44.
Meanwhile, since malonyl-CoA was also utilized for fatty acid
synthesis in the cell45, we tried to reduce the generation of fatty acids
to increase the production of 3-HP (Fig.2e). Specially, we used the
COX9 promoter, which is a weaker promoter than the nativeFAS1
promoter, and HXT1 promoter, which is repressed by glucose, to
control the expression ofFAS1, respectively46 (Fig. 2f). Using this
a p p r o a c h ,w ew e r ea b l et oi n c r e a s et h et i t r eo f3 - H Pt o5 . 8 7g / L( F i g .2f,
QLW30). Meanwhile, we also up-regulated theβ-oxidation pathway to
decompose fatty acids back to NADPH and acetyl-CoA for 3-HP pro-
duction (Fig.2e). The resulting the QLW33 strain overexpressingPOX1
that encodes fatty-acyl coenzyme A oxidase
47 improved 3-HP pro-
duction to 5.8 g/L. Similarly, the QLW34 strain overexpressingPOX2
that encodes 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase and enoyl-CoA
hydratase47, improved 3-HP production to 5.92 g/L (Fig.2f). We thus
combined these strategies, yet did not observe a superimposed effect,
with the 3-HP production in QLW36ﬂuctuated around 6 g/L (Fig.2f).
To verify the repression of lipid synthesis, we used Nile red that

compared with that of the control strain QLW26 (Fig.2g, h), indicated a
successful rewiring of the carbonﬂux away from fatty acids. That the
titre of 3-HP could not be signiﬁcantly increased may be because of
other bottlenecks in the metabolism.
Increasing 3-HP tolerance and the identiﬁcation of a permease

The 3-HP transport and toxicity represent a bottleneck for further
improving 3-HP production in the QLW36 strain. Our experiments
showed that after 72 h of fermentation with 5.5– 6 g/L of 3-HP gen-
erated (strains QLW30 to QLW36), the pH of the medium dropped

below 4. The pKa value of 3-HP is 4.51, and under this pH value, 3-HP
remains predominantly undissociated in the medium (Fig.3a). Free
undissociated 3-HP can easily penetrate the cell membrane through
diffusion and then release protons to become anions in the cyto-
plasm where the pH is around neutral
8. The charged nature of the
anion cannot diffuse back out of the cell, resulting in its accumula-
tion in the cytosol that could cause intracellular acidiﬁcation, which
is toxic for the cell48. The proton and anion must be pumped out of
the cell, and this process is ATP-dependent through the H+-ATPase
and ATP-binding cassette (ABC) pumps48. This process consumes a

large amount of ATP and can result in ATP depletion, leading to a
decrease in the overall 3-HP yield.
We started by testing mutations to improve yeast tolerance of
3-HP (Fig. 3b). For example, the Sfa1 bifunctional alcohol dehy-
d r o g e n a s ea n dt h eS f a 1C276S mutant have been reported to improve
3-HP tolerance inS. cerevisiae49. Trk1, a component of the Trk1-Trk2
potassium transport system, was reported to improve yeast tolerance
to propionate by increasing potassium inﬂux through the Trk1
A1169E
mutation50. Yet, these two mutations could not increase the produc-
tion of 3-HP (Fig.3b, QLW37 and QLW38). Moreover, lactate (pKa 3.86)
and 3-HP (pKa 4.51) are structural isomers that have been found to
exhibit the same degree of growth inhibition at the same undissociated
free acid concentration
51,52, indicating that the mutation involved in the
tolerance of lactate may have the potential to improve 3-HP tolerance.
The deletion of the ribosome-associated chaperone Ssb1 was reported
to improve yeast tolerance to lactate
53. The deletion ofGSF2 could
increase lactate production54 by releasing the Crabtree effect of
yeast55, leading to upregulation of gene expression involved in
respiration, which has a higher ATP yield than fermentation and is
crucial to organic acid production
56. Deletion ofERF2,as u b u n i to fa
palmitoyl transferase, could increase lactate production but not lac-
tate tolerance in yeast
57. Deletion ofSAM2, which catalyses the synth-
esis of the cellular cofactor S-adenosylmethionine involved in
phospholipid biosynthesis and membrane remodelling during acid
stress, was also reported to increase lactate production in yeast
58.
Furthermore, the Sur1I245S mutation and the overexpression could
increase lactate tolerance and production57. Indeed, we demonstrated
that the deletion of eitherGSF2 (QLW40), ERF2 (QLW41), or SAM2
(QLW42) signiﬁcantly improved the production of 3-HP, to the levels of
6.45, 6.32, and 6.35 g/L, respectively (Fig.3b).
So far, no 3-HP exporter has been reported. Based on the fact that
lactate and 3-HP are structural isomers, we next turned to the identi-
ﬁcation of potential 3-HP exporters based on previous lactate reports.
Plasma membrane ABC transporter Pdr12, which could transport car-
boxylic acids with an aliphatic chain ranging from one to seven
59 at the
plasma membrane. P2-type H+-ATPase Pma160,w h i c hc o n t r o l st h e
intracellular pH, have been reported to improve lactate tolerance in
yeast61. The overexpression of ESBP6, a protein with similarity to
monocarboxylate permeases, was reported to improved lactate resis-
tance and production inS. cerevisiae
62. Meanwhile, the deletion of Jen1,
the monocarboxylate/proton symporter in the plasma membrane63,
could increase the production of lactate in yeast54,64,65.I n d e e d ,c o m -
pared with that of the control strain QLW36, the overexpression of
ESBP6 improved the production of 3-HP to 6.39 g/L (Fig.3b, QLW46).
To verify the potential mechanism by which Esbp6 improved 3-HP
production,ESBP6was overexpressed in the wild type (WT) strain, and
could signiﬁcantly increase cell tolerance compared with WT in a
medium containing 50 g/L 3-HP at pH 3.5 (buffered with potassium
citrate), while the deletion ofESBP6 almost completely abolished
growth in this medium (Fig.3c). Moreover, the overexpression of
ESBP6 in the WT strain led to a notable reduction in intracellular 3-HP
content compared with that of the WT strain (Supplementary Fig. 6).
These results indicated that Esbp6 could help exporting 3-HP out of
the cell, thereby increasing the tolerance of yeast and improving 3-HP
production. To our knowledge, this could be the evidence for potential
3-HP exporters. Notably, combining the overexpression ofESBP6 with
the deletion ofGSF2 improved 3-HP production to 7.1 g/L in strain
QLW50 (Fig.3b).
Conserved bicarbonate pool for 3-HP production
There are mainly three enzymes utilizing bicarbonate in yeast (Fig.1i):
Acc1 ﬁxes bicarbonate with acetyl-CoA to form malonyl-CoA, Pyc1/2
ﬁxes bicarbonate to transform pyruvate into OAA, as well as Cpa1/2
ﬁxes bicarbonate to generate carbamoyl-phosphate66, and then to the
pyrimidine ring and arginine (Fig.4a). It has been demonstrated that
bicarbonate limitation in the cytoplasm could restricted de novo
nucleotide synthesis, which inhibits growth of cancer cells (the Wein-
berg effect)
67. This report enlightens that the potential competition for
bicarbonate between the de novo synthesis of the pyrimidine ring and
malonyl-CoA may reduce 3-HP production (Fig.4a). The plasmid used
to express MCR-C and YdfG had a high copy number with aURA3
marker. This means that the strain with this plasmid will have a
stronger expression ofURA3, a key step in pyrimidine ring synthesis,
leading to the potential competition with Acc1 for bicarbonate. To
conserve bicarbonate to 3-HP production, we replaced theURA3
marker with theHIS3 marker that is not involve in the bicarbonate
metabolism
68 (Fig. 4a). Indeed, theHIS3 marker plasmid signiﬁcantly
enhanced 3-HP production from 7.1 g/L to 8.22 g/L (Fig.4b, QLW53),
while the qPCR result even exhibited a moderate decrease in the
plasmid copy number upon the change in the marker gene (Supple-
mentary Fig. 7). To demonstrate the improvement of 3-HP production
by auxotrophic marker swapping was caused by the decrease in the
competition of bicarbonate for the de novo uracil synthesis, we added
isotope labelled NaH
13CO3 to the medium and tested the M + 1 pre-
sence of uracil in strains with different auxotrophic-marker plasmids.
Indeed, consistent with the signiﬁcantly increased 3-HP production,
the M + 1 presence of uracil was signiﬁcantly decreased in the QLW53
strain compared with that of the QLW50 strain (Fig.4b, c). These
results conﬁrmed that the auxotrophic marker swapping increased the
3-HP production by releasing the 3-HP generation from the bicarbo-
nate competition with the de novo uracil synthesis (Fig.4c). Different
auxotrophs have been shown to impact yeast metabolism
69,w h i c hc a n
affect the production of fatty acids70. Yet, mechanisms behind this
impact have not been fully understood70. Here, we demonstrated that
the distinct bicarbonate metabolic backgrounds of these auxotrophic
marker turbulent metabolic capacities of yeast
71, thereby increasing
the production of 3-HP.
The results of the enhanced 3-HP production with theHIS3
marker plasmid suggested that cytoplasmic bicarbonate generated
from dissolved CO
2 could be limited due to its low solubility. To
provide enough bicarbonate for malonyl-CoA generation, we sup-
plemented the medium with 75 mM (0.15 g/ﬂask) calcium carbonate,
which further enhanced 3-HP production from 8.22 to 9.12 g/L
(Fig. 4d and Supplementary Fig. 8). To test whether the increase in
3-HP production was due to the addition of bicarbonate rather than
pH buffering, we conducted a production of 3-HP experiment with 2-
(N-morpholino) ethane sulfonic acid (MES) that could buffer the pH
to the same level as calcium carbonate did. The results showed that
the titre of the fermentation with MES buffering was only 8.16 g/L,
which was not signiﬁcantly different from the control (Fig.4d). We
have also tested different concentrations of calcium hydroxide, and
only 40 mM (0.0592 g/ﬂask) calcium hydroxide could slightly
improve 3-HP production to 8.41 g/L (Supplementary Fig. 9),
whereas when further increased calcium hydroxide concentrations
the cells stopped growth. A similar strategy has been utilized to
increase succinate production in industry, yet the mechanism
underneath was not indicated
72,73. Here by model calculation and
experiment demonstration, we suggested that it was because the
limited intracellular CO
2 concentration as well as the thermo-
dynamic and kinetic favouring of the bicarbonateﬁxation reaction
that increased the production.
Inositol phosphate application provides more ATP for 3-HP
production
The positive effect on 3-HP production by deletingGSF2 indicated that
the energy was crucial for the 3-HP yield. If we consider the energy
demand for 3-HP transmembrane during production, this ATP deﬁ-
ciency would be more intense. We thus selected different strategies to
provide more ATP for 3-HP production.S. cerevisiaehas the Crabtree
effect, which produces an excess amount of ethanol in high

mole of glucose could only generate approximately 16 moles of ATP

rebalancing central metabolism and enhancing the ATP yield from
glucose could be important.
After glucose is transported inside the cell, it would be phos-
phorylated by Hxk2 or Glk1 and Hxk1, which restricted its transporta-
tion out of the cell
77 (Fig.5a). Deleting main functional carrierHXK2can
reduce the glucose consumption rate, which could release the Crab-
tree effect to get a higher ATP yield
78. Similarly, Mth1 is involved in the
glucose signalling pathway, and its mutant Mth1Δ231 acts as a tran-
scription factor to repress hexose transporters (Fig.5a), that ultimately
restricts the Crabtree effect and derepress respiration78.M e a n w h i l e ,
the mutation of Med2*432Y, which is the tail module of RNA polymerase
II mediator, can decrease the expression of genes involved in glycolysis
and increase the expression of genes involved in protein synthesis.
These mutations in principle may be able to release more ATP

not increase the production of 3-HP in strain QLW53 any further
(Fig. 5b). The glucose repression on the respiratory pathway may still
be too strong that glycolysis and respiration may not be well balanced
for high 3-HP production. We next turned to our recently identiﬁed
Oca5 that degrade 5-diphosphoinositol 1,2,3,4,6-pentakisphosphate
(5-InsP
7)78, which serves as an energy sensor to sense ATP concentra-
tions and balances gene expressions in glycolysis and respiration.
Indeed, OCA5 deletion signiﬁcantly increased 3-HP production from
9.12 g/L in QLW53 to 10.15 g/L in QLW58 (Fig.5b). To verify that the
production enhancement was because of the rebalance of glycolysis
and respiration rather than simply enhanced respiration, we tested the
cultivation in bafﬂed shakeﬂask that could provide more oxygen for
oxidative phosphorylation, and indeed the 3-HP production did not
improve for QLW53 (Fig.5b). We also tested the deletion ofOCA3
80 and
upregulation ofKCS181, respectively, that could also increase 5-InsP7
concentrations, yet they did not further improve 3-HP production
in QLW58.
The dual nature of Uga1 for 3-HP production
The structural similarity between 3-HP and serine allowed us to
identify the serine dehydrogenase Ora1 for 3-HP production
(Fig. 2d), while the isomerized relation of lactate and 3-HP allowed us
to identify the potential 3-HP permease Esbp6 in yeast (Fig.3b).
Thus, we hypothesized that these similarities may also allow native
enzymes to mediate the degradation of 3-HP or its intermediates
(Fig. 6a). We started by deleting lactate dehydrogenases Dld1, Dld2,
and Dld3, respectively, yet none of the deletions increased 3-HP
production (Fig.6b).
Moreover, it was demonstrated that the β-alanine-pyruvate
aminotransferase (BAPAT) and gamma-aminobutyrate
82 transami-
nase Uga1 exhibited substrate promiscuity and could convertβ-
alanine to MSA for 3-HP production82. The transamination reaction is
highly reversible83, while studies have also used BAPAT to convert
MSA toβ-alanine in theβ-alanine auxotrophE. coli20. These reports
indicated that the Uga1 catalysed reaction is reversible, and it may
also degrade MSA back toβ-alanine, leading to energy waste and
decreasing 3-HP yield (Fig.6a). We therefore deletedUGA1 in the
strain and observed a slight increase in 3-HP production to 10.37 g/L
in QLW65 (Fig.6b). We also deleted alanine transaminases Alt1 and
Alt2 that convert pyruvate to alanine, respectively, but it had no
impact on the production of 3-HP (Fig.6b, QLW66 and QLW67). The
deletion of UGA2 to prevent the potential degradation of MSA to
malonate did not improve the production of 3-HP, either (Fig.6b,
QLW68). We believe that theUGA1 deletion only slightly increased
3-HP production because the generation of MSA was restricted.
Therefore, we used the strong promoters CCW12 and TDH3 to
express the MCR-C domain protein (Fig.6b). The strain with a strong
CCW12 promoter could increase 3-HP production to 10.77 g/L
(Fig. 6b, QLW69), indicating that MSA production had been
improved. We further deletedUGA1 in this QLW69 strain and indeed
increased 3-HP production to 11.25 g/L (Fig.6b, QLW71). Meanwhile,
we have tested the intracellular concentration of the proposed
intermediate β-alanine, and indeed the deletion of UGA1 in the
Fig. 4 | Alleviating bicarbonate competitions from the de novo pyridine ring
synthesis enhanced 3-HP production. aCarbamoyl-P was synthesized by Cpa1/2

QLW71 strain almost abolished theβ-alanine generation (Supple-
mentary Fig. 10). This result indicated the reverse activity of Uga1
converting MSA back toβ-alanine. It demonstrated the potential
degradation of 3-HP intermediate MSA by the native enzyme in
yeast. Our results also underscored the importance that when
introducing exogenous metabolite production, the substrate pro-
miscuity and bidirectional crosstalk between the target product and
the native metabolic network needs to be taken into consideration.
Production of 3-HP by the engineered strain enabled efﬁcient
conversion to acrylate
By implementing carbon conservation and energy metabolism strate-
gies, we were able to continuously enhance the carbon yield of both
3-HP and biomass, exceeding yeast limit for 3-HP production in terms
of bicarbonate accessible under both respiration and fermentation
conditions, close to the theoretical yield with concurrent biomass
formation with extra bicarbonate providing by CaCO
3 (Figs.1aa n d7a).

Meanwhile, the production envelope analysis also revealed a carbon
ﬂux competition between the 3-HP production and the biomass gen-
eration. With the superposition of multiple strategies, the available
carbon resources were insufﬁcient to simultaneously accumulate high
levels of both 3-HP and biomass. For example, when further rewiring
the carbonﬂux towards 3-HP from QLW58 to QLW71, the strain could
only move to the top left along theproduction envelope curve and
result in less biomass generation (Fig.7a). Importantly, the yield of
QLW71 had reached the production envelope boundary of the bicar-
bonate supplementation equal to the glucose supplementation.
Through this signiﬁcant rewiring of carbonﬂux, we achieved a
high 3-HP yield. This high 3-HP titre signiﬁcantly facilitated the
downstream processing, that after simple centrifugation to remove
cell pellets, the medium could be directly utilized for acrylate gen-
eration. Indeed, the 3-HP present in the medium underwent facile
dehydration, facilitated by TiO
2 as a catalyst, ultimately yielding acry-
late with a remarkable transformation ratio of 100% (Fig.7b).
Discussion
Here we employed the production envelope analysis to demonstrate
the crucial role of a highﬂux of bicarbonate in the production of the
platform chemical 3-HP. We identiﬁed that the limited availability of
bicarbonate has been a major obstacle in previous attempts to pro-
duce 3-HP (Fig.1b), while our strategies of thorough analysis and
rewiring of the native bicarbonate metabolism combined with external
bicarbonate supply, enabled us to surpass this bicarbonate limitation
for 3-HP production. Furthermore, to meet the energy demand for
bicarbonate utilization, we employed the 5-InsP
7 mechanism to
enhance the ATP generation yield. In addition, we implemented
methods to reduce energy consumption, such as identifying an
exporter for 3-HP to minimize energy waste during the 3-HP fermen-
tation process. Moreover, we disrupted the degradation pathway of
the intermediate metabolite MSA to prevent the occurrence of energy
futile cycles. Collectively, we were able to achieve the in-ﬂux of bicar-
bonate for 3-HP equivalent to that of glucose. Ultimately, in the QLW71
strain, the yield of 3-HP to substrate reached 0.5625 g/g, which corre-
sponds to 89.3% of the theoretical yield with biomass generation. This
achievement surpassed the production envelope boundary of bicar-
bonate (Fig.7a).
The pursuit of a circular and sustainable carbon economy is a key
driver for development of biofuel and biobased chemical production
from sustainable carbon sources. However, the net impact of biofuel
use on global CO
2 emissions is still under debate84,85, leading to con-
tinued iterative development86. Carbon negativity strategies, such as
capturing CO2 or one-carbon feedstock into biomass or target mole-
cules directly, have been proposed but require large energy inputs and
may still result in CO2 emissions87– 89. Our research focused on the high
carbon yield production of 3-HP using a multi-strategy approach.
Biobased commodity bulk chemicals require high feedstock and car-
bon yields to achieve economic ef ﬁcacy and compete with
petrochemical-based industries
90. The pathway for the production of
these bulk chemicals must also decrease CO2 release during glucose
oxidation to have commercial potential. Our research provides a step
towards the development of sustainable and circular carbon econo-
mies for biofuel and biobased chemical productions.
Methods

vatives strains and their genotypes used in this study were listed in
Supplementary Data 1 and 2. For the production of 3-HP, the deﬁned
minimal medium
60 was used. In detail, the medium consisted of 7.5 g/L
(NH4)2SO4,1 4 . 4 g / LK H2PO4,a n d0 . 5 g / LM g S O4·7H2O( t h ep Ho ft h e
medium was adjusted to 6.5 with KOH). Trace metal and vitamin
solutions were supplemented after the medium was autoclaved at
121 °C for 20 min. Histidine (60 mg/L) and uracil (60 mg/L) were sup-
plemented based on the auxotroph of the plasmid. The calcium car-
bonate and the sodium bicarbonate were added if needed. To test the
dry cell weight (DCW) after the fermentation, the 14.4 g/L KH
2PO4 in
the medium with the calcium carbonate fermentation was changed to
3.0 g/L KH
2PO4 same as the medium reported for bioreactor

Details of strains, and DNA fragments were summarized in Supple-
mentary Data 3 and 4, respectively.
Growth analysis and shakeﬂask fermentation
The strain used for 3-HP production was precultured in the deﬁned
minimal medium, then inoculated into a 100 mL shakeﬂask containing
20 mL of the deﬁned minimal medium with aﬁnal optical density at
600 nm (OD600)o f0 . 1 .T h es h a k eﬂask fermentation was carried out at
30 °C and 220 rpm for 72 h for 3-HP production. The samples’ DCW
was measured as reported74. The biomass composition of CH1.8O0.5N0.2
was assumed65.
Analytical methods
Concentrations of 3-HP, glucose, and extracellular metabolites were
determined using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC,
Shimadzu, Japan) with an Aminex HPX-87H column (Bio-Rad, Hercules,
USA) at 65 °C, using 0.5 mM H
2SO4 as the mobile phase at 0.4 mL/min
ﬂow rate for 36 min17. Glucose, glycerol, and acrylic acid concentration
was detected using a RI-101 Refractive Index Detector, while 3-HP,
OAA, acetate, and other extracellular metabolites were detected using
a DAD-3000 Diode Array Detector at 210 nm.
3-HP tolerance test and intracellular 3-HP measurement
The minimal medium with 50 g/L 3-HP was used. 159 mL 0.5 M citrate
solution and 41 mL 1 M Na2HPO4 were used to buffer the medium pH to
3.5. The pH of 3-HP standard liquid was buffered to neutral by NaOH
and ﬁltered to sterilize before added into the medium. For the growth
test, the Growth Proﬁler 960 (EnzyScreen) was used. The initial
inoculation OD
600 was 0.01 and 200μL of cells were cultivated in 96-
well microplates at 30 °C and 220 rpm. The strain was cultured in a
shake ﬂask with the deﬁned minimal medium and sampled at the
exponential phase (OD
600 around 1). Totally 40 OD600 cells were col-
lected and resuspended into 2 mL test medium as an OD600 of 20. The
test medium was same as the high 3-HP concentration growth test
medium in Growth Proﬁler (pH = 3.5 and 50 g/L 3-HP was added). After
be incubated at 30 °C and 220 rpm for 24 h, the culture was cen-
trifuged for 2 min at 3000 ×g and washed three times using ultra-pure
water. The cells were then lysed by FastPrep-24 5 G for 20 s (6.0 m/s)
with glass beads. After centrifuging for 1 min at 12,000 ×g,t h es u p e r -
natants, containing the cellular contents released upon lysis, were
analysed by HPLC
92.
Determination ofβ-alaine
After 72 h of fermentation in the shakeﬂask with the deﬁned minimal
medium, 2 mL cell culture was centrifuged for 2 min at 3000 ×g to
collect the cells. The cell pellet was washed three times with sterile
water, re-suspended in 1 mL sterile water and measured the cell OD
600.
400 μL glass beads were added to this cell suspension to get the cell
wall lysed by FastPrep-24 5 G for 20 s (6.0 m/s). The cell lysis was then
centrifuged for 1 min at 12,000 ×g and 10μL supernatant was trans-
ferred into a glass HPLC vial for derivatization. Brieﬂy, the AccQFluor
Kit (Waters, USA) was used for derivatization. 1 mL of acetonitrile was
added to the AccQTag Ultra powder, mixed well, and heated to 55 °C to
help it dissolve (heating time should not exceed 15 min). Then, 70μLo f
borate buffer was add to the glass HPLC vial containing 10μLo ft h ec e l l
lysis solution, as well as 20μL of prepared AccQTag Ultra derivatiza-
tion solution, mix well, and heated at 55 °C for 10 min. Finally, the
heated sample was diluted with derivatization diluent at a ratio of
1:100. The diluted sample was then analyzed using UHPLC-MS/MS. The
analysis was performed using Acquity UPLC binary solvent manager,
autosampler manager, and column manager (Waters, Milford, MA,
USA) coupled with Xevo TQ-S tandem quadrupole mass spectrometer
(Waters, Wilmslow, U.K.). Reverse-phase gradient chromatography
was employed using an HSS T3 2.1 × 150 mm, 1.8μm column. The
mobile phase A was 0.1% formic acid in water (v/v), while mobile phase
B was 1% formic acid in acetonitrile (v/v). The column temperature was
maintained at 45 °C. The elution was performed at aﬂow rate of
0.6 mL/min with a linear gradient: started at 4% B for 0.5 min, increased
to 10% B at 2 min, then 28% B at 2.5 min,ﬁnally to 95% B for 1 min, and
then returned to 4% B for column re-equilibration
93.
Gene expression analysis
Samples for quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) analysis were taken
when the OD
600 of the cells reached around 1. The cell pellet was
collected by centrifugation at−20 °C, quenched by liquid nitrogen,
a n ds t o r e da t−80 °C before use. The RNeasy Mini Kit (QIAGEN, USA)
was used for the extraction of total RNA as recommended. The
QuantiTect Reverse Transcription Kit (QIAGEN, USA) was used for
reverse transcription. 2μL of produced cDNA was used as the template
of the qPCR reaction with the DyNAmo Flash SYBR Green qPCR Kit
(Thermo Scientiﬁc, USA). Quantitative RT-PCR was performed on
Stratagene Mx3005P (Agilent Technologies, USA). The housekeeping
gene ACT1 was selected as the reference gene. All the primers were
listed in Supplementary Data 4.
Catalytic dehydration of 3-HP to acrylic acid
Acrylic acid synthesis was carried out in aﬁxed-bed tubular reactor
(i.d. = 8 mm, o.d. = 12 mm, length = 30 cm). After culturing the strains
for 72 h in a deﬁned minimal medium, the fermentation broth was
sterilized byﬁltration and diluted 6 times with ultrapure water. And
then 3 g TiO
2 as the catalyst (20– 40 mesh) was loaded into the
reactor tube between two layers of quartz wool and preheated at
230 °C in the furnace. The diluted fermentation broth was delivered
using a metering pump with a rate of 100 mL/h for 5 min, and then
with a constant rate of 1.5 mL/h. The eluate containing acrylic acid
was condensed in a cold-water bath. Liquid samples of theﬁrst
30 min were discarded. In addition, 4 samples were collected for
each measurement.
Genome-scale metabolic modelling
The genome-scale metabolic model of S. cerevisiae Yeast817, was
expanded by adding two heterologous reactions, i.e., malonyl-CoA
reduction and MSA reduction, as well as the secretion of 3-HP. The
resulting model with the default constraints was used to estimate
the yield of 3-HP on glucose. To do so, the uptake rate of glucose was
ﬁxed at 1 mmol/gDCW/h, the growth rate was adjusted, and the
secretion of 3-HP was maximized for each growth rate. To simulate
the effect of native bicarbonate production on the yield, the upper
bound on the rate of the bicarbonate formation in the model, which
converts carbon dioxide to bicarbonate, was set at different values
normalized to the glucose uptake rate. Model simulations were
performed using the COBRA toolbox
94 in MATLAB with the CPLEX as
an optimization solver.

Phylogenetic and structure analysis
Amino acid sequences from the SLC4 family (InterPro ID:
IPR003020) and SLC26 family (InterPro ID: IPR001902) were aligned
and trimmed using NGPhylogeny.fr
95. Only key species (S. cerevisiae,
Arabidopsis thaliana,a n dHomo sapiensfor SLC4 andS. cerevisiae, E.
coli, A. thaliana,a n dH. sapiens for SLC26) were included. MEGA11
was used to construct a maximum likelihood phylogenetic tree and
tested with 500 bootstraps
96. iTOL v6 was used in the modiﬁcation of
the phylogenetic tree97. The structure of human SLC26A11 (Uniprot
ID Q86WA9), yeast Sul1 (Uniprot ID P38359), and yeast Sul2 (Uniprot
ID Q12325) were obtained from AlphaFoldDB (https://alphafold.ebi.
ac.uk/)
98. FATCAT 2.0 (https://fatcat.godziklab.org/)99 was used to
compare the structures of SLC26A11 with Sul1 and Sul2.
Isotope 13C labelling analysis
The minimal medium with 30 mM NaH13CO3 (Sigma-Aldrich) in a shake
ﬂask was used for the isotope labelling experiment. Strains were
inoculated with OD600 0.01 and sampled after 72 h. 2 mL medium was
transferred immediately into the 15 mL tube with 8 mL pure methanol
(precooling in−80 °C fridge) and vortexed around 1 s for quenching
samples. Then, the mix was centrifuged at 5000 ×g for 3 min at 4 °C.
Remove the supernatant and resuspend the precipitate with 3 mL of
precooling methanol, 5000 ×g centrifuged for 3 min, remove the
supernatant, keep on ice. For hydrolysis of cellular components, 6 mL
6 N hydrochloric acid was added to quenched cells and transferred to
10 mL glass digestion tube, cells were hydrolysed for 16– 2 0hi nm e t a l
bath at 115 °C and dried in a heating block at 85 °C, then 600μLo f
ultrapure water was added, and the sample was centrifuged at the
maximum speed for 1 min
100. Before the MS analysis, the sample was
ﬁltrated with a 0.22µmp o r es i z eﬁlter membrane. The isotopic labels
of metabolites were determined with UPLC-MS/MS (SCIEX
TRIPLETOF 6600).
Nile red staining
After 96 h of cultivation in the deﬁned minimal medium, 250μLc e l l
culture was transferred into a sterile 1.5 mL tube. Then 25μLf r e s h l y
prepared DMSO: PBS (1:1) buffer and 25μLN i l er e d( 6 0μg/mL in
acetone) were added. The working concentration of Nile red was 5μg/
mL. The sample was well mixed and then incubated away from the light
for 5 min at room temperature. The strain was washed twice with
300 μL PBS buffer and resuspended in 300μL PBS buffer. 5μLo ft h e
cell sample was pipetted onto a glass microscope slide, placed with the
cover slipﬁrmly, and observed using the greenﬂuorescence channel
with the excitation wavelength at 488 nm and emission wavelength at
509 nm. For quantitative analysis, the yeast culture in the deﬁned
minimal medium was harvested at 96 h, centrifuged and resuspended
twice with PBS buffer to achieve an OD
600 of 2.0. Transfer 250μLo f
each yeast sample to the corresponding wells of a 96-well plate,
ensuring proper mixing as yeast cells tend to settle. 12.5μL DMSO: PBS
(1:1) buffer for each well was added in advance. 25μL of the freshly
prepared 60μg/mL Nile red stock solution was added for each well to a
ﬁnal 5μg/mL concentration. The microplate reader with excitation and
emission wavelengths was set at 485 nm and 535 nm, respectively, and
a top 50% mirror was used. Optimal gain settings and an orbital shake
for 10 s before reading were employed and the plate was read imme-
diately after Nile red addition for the necessary number of cycles
101.
