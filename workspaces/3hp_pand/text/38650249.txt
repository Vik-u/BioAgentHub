system in Vibrio natriegens for the high

and 3-hydroxypropionate

Abstract 
Vibrio natriegens is a promising industrial chassis with a super-fast growth rate and high substrate uptake rates. V. 
natriegens was previously engineered to produce 1,3-propanediol (1,3-PDO) from glycerol by overexpressing the cor-
responding genes in a plasmid. However, antibiotic selection pressure for plasmid stability was not satisfactory and 
plasmid loss resulted in reduced productivity of the bioprocess. In this study, we developed an antibiotic-free plasmid 
stabilization system for V. natriegens. The system was achieved by shifting the glpD gene, one of the essential genes for 
glycerol degradation, from the chromosome to plasmid. With this system, engineered V. natriegens can stably main-
tain a large expression plasmid during the whole fed-batch fermentation and accumulated 69.5 g/L 1,3-PDO in 24 h, 
which was 23% higher than that based on antibiotic selection system. This system was also applied to engineering V. 
natriegens for the production of 3-hydroxypropionate (3-HP), enabling the engineered strain to accumulate 64.5 g/L 
3-HP in 24 h, which was 30% higher than that based on antibiotic system. Overall, the developed strategy could be 
useful for engineering V. natriegens as a platform for the production of value-added chemicals from glycerol.

Introduction
The development of economically competitive bio -
processes to produce fuels and chemicals from renewable 
bioresources is important to achieve the goal of carbon 
neutrality (Becker and Wittmann 2015; Clomburg et  al. 
2017). In the past twenty years, metabolic engineering 
strategies have been widely used to improve the titers and 
yields of bioproducts, which have significantly increased 
the economic viability of bioprocesses (Kim et  al. 2020; 
Ko et al. 2020). On the other hand, the productivity of a 
bioprocess is often limited by the maximum growth rate 
and/or substrate uptake rate of the employed microor -
ganism  (Zhang et al. 2017). Thus, developing fast-grow -
ing microorganisms as new industrial chassis could be 
important for improving the productivity of fermentation 
processes (Hoffart et al. 2017).
Vibrio natriegens is a promising next-generation chas -
sis for industrial biotechnology which has a remarkably 
short doubling time of less than 10 min in complex media 
(Weinstock et  al. 2016). It can utilize diverse substrates 
and has an exceptionally high glucose uptake rate under 
both aerobic and anaerobic conditions (Hoffart et  al. 
2017), making it an attractive candidate for industrial 
application. In recent years, different genetic tools and 
metabolic engineering strategies have been developed to 
engineer V. natriegens to produce value-added chemicals, 
including alanine, PHB, melanin, 2,3-butanediol, and 
1,3-propanediol (Dalia et al. 2017; Hoffart et al. 2017; Lim 
et al. 2019; Wang et al. 2020; Zhang et al. 2021). In a pre -
vious study, we have developed a recombinant V. natrie -
gens to efficiently produce 1,3-propanediol (1,3-PDO) 
from glycerol by introducing and balancing 1,3-PDO syn-
thesis module in a plasmid and systematically optimizing 
glycerol metabolism and cofactor balance (Zhang et  al. 
2021). The engineered strain can produce 56.2  g/L 1,3-
PDO with a high productivity of 2.36 g/L/h.
Plasmid-based expression systems have been widely 
used in industrial biotechnology for developing recom -
binant strains (Kang et al. 2018). Easy manipulation and 
high-level expression of targeted genes facilitate their 
wide application. However, the instability of plasmid-
based expression systems may hinder their large-scale 
application in industry. Although antibiotics can be used 
during fermentation to reduce plasmid loss, the addition 
of antibiotics to large-scale cultures is expensive and the 
release of antibiotics to the environment is strongly dis -
favored (Terrinoni et  al. 2018). Moreover, plasmid loss 
and strain heterogeneity are often observed in large-scale 
fermentation even with antibiotics addition due to fast 
cell growth and heterogeneous environments (Rugbjerg 
and Sommer 2019; Kang et al. 2018). Thus, the develop -
ment of stable plasmid expression and maintenance sys -
tems without using antibiotics is important for industrial 
application.
Several antibiotic-free plasmid systems have been 
previously developed to stably maintain plasmids in

Escherichia coli (Kang et al. 2018; Terrinoni et al. 2018). 
These systems are normally based on essential gene 
complementation systems or toxin–antitoxin systems. 
The implementation of these systems is often very com -
plicated and the application of these systems for the 
high-level production of chemicals has not been dem -
onstrated. In this study, we discovered that plasmid loss 
was a key factor affecting the production of 1,3-PDO 
from glycerol by previously designed V. natriegens. A 
plasmid maintenance system was developed by deleting 
the glpD gene encoding glycerol-3-phosphate dehydro -
genase which is essential for glycerol metabolism and 
by complementing the gene in the expression plasmid. 
The system was proved to be efficient to increase the 
plasmid stability and productivity of 1,3-PDO. The sys -
tem was also successfully applied to develop an efficient 
V. natriegens strain to produce 3-hydroxypropionate 
(3-HP) from glycerol. To the best of our knowledge, 
this is the first demonstration of 3-HP production by V. 
natriegens.
Materials and methods
Bacterial strains and plasmids
The bacterial strains and plasmids used in this study are 
listed in Table  1. Plasmids construction was based on 
the cloning host E. coli DH5α. V. natriegens VN09 was 
derived from the wild-type V. natriegens ATCC14048 by 
deleting ten genes related to byproducts formation and 
metabolic regulation (ΔadhEΔldhAΔpflΔpta-ackAΔarcA
ΔglpRΔsthAΔfrdABCDΔaldAΔaldB) (Zhang et al. 2021). 
High-copy plasmid pTrc99a was used for gene overex -
pression in V. natriegens.
Plasmids construction
To construct plasmid pTrc99a-J23106-doy-phaP-pntAB-
glpD1, the native promoter of dnaG gene and the glpD 
gene were amplified from V. natriegens ATCC14048. 
The T1 terminator was amplified from plasmid pTrc99a. 
The three fragments were inserted into the XbaI site of 
pTrc99a-J23106-doy-phaP-pntAB-glpD1 (Zhang et  al. 
2021) by the standard protocol of Gibson assembly. The

Plasmids pTrc99a-J23106-doy-phaP-pntAB-glpD2 
and pTrc99a-J23106-doy-phaP-pntAB-glpD3 were con -
structed by replacing the dnaG promoter of plasmid 
pTrc99a-J23106-doy-phaP-pntAB-glpD1 with the native 
promoter of patZ gene and ribC  gene of V. natriegens 
ATCC14048 by Gibson assembly.
To construct plasmid pTrc99a-dhaBCE-aldH, the 
backbone of plasmid pTrc99a-J23106-doy-phaP-pntAB 
was amplified using PT-F and PT-R primers. The aldH 
gene was amplified from E. coli MG1655 using aldH-F 
and aldH-R primers. The phaP gene was amplified from 
pTrc99a-J23106-doy-phaP-pntAB using phaP-F and 
phaP-R primers. The three fragments were assembled by 
using Gibson assembly kits. To obtain plasmid pTrc99a-
dhaBCE-aldH-glpD3, a fragment containing ribC  pro -
moter, glpD gene, and T1 promoter was amplified from 
plasmid pTrc99a-J23106-doy-phaP-pntAB-glpD3 and 
inserted into the XbaI site of pTrc99a-dhaBCE-aldH. All 
primers used in this study are listed in Additional file  1: 
Table S1.
Strains construction
To delete genes in V. natriegens genome, the standard 
protocol combining natural transformation and FLP/
FRT recombination system was used as described before 
(Zhang et  al. 2021). A DNA fragment containing the 
upstream fragment (~ 3000  bp) of the deleted gene, the 
resistance gene with two FRT loci, and the downstream 
fragment (~ 3000 bp) of the deleted gene was obtained by 
overlap extension PCR. The recombinants with selection 
marker were obtained using natural transformation by 
following the protocols described by Dalia et  al. (2014). 
To eliminate the selection marker, the selected strain was 
cultured in LBv2 medium with 1 mM rhamnose at 37  ℃, 
200 rpm for 12 h.
Medium and culture conditions
The LBv2 medium (LB broth supplemented with 200 mM 
NaCl, 23.14  mM  MgCl2, and 4.2  mM KCl) is gener -
ally used for the culture of V. natriegens. Modified VN 
medium is used for the fermentation of V. natriegens to 
produce 1,3-PDO and 3-HP , containing  KH2PO4 1.0 g/L, 
yeast extract 5 g/L,  (NH4)2SO4 5 g/L, NaCl 15 g/L, glyc -
erol 50 g/L,  MgSO4·7H2O 1 g/L,  CoCl2·6  H2O 0.01 g/L, 
 MnCl2·4H2O 0.01  g/L,  FeSO4·7H2O 0.01  g/L, and vita -
min  B12 0.005 g/L. The medium was supplemented with 
100 μg/mL ampicillin (Amp) to keep the plasmids for the 
strains without a plasmid stabilization system. For the 
strains with a plasmid stabilization system, no antibiotics 
were added.
Fed-batch fermentations were carried out in T&J 
MiniBox parallel bioreactors with modified VN medium 
at 37℃. The pH was controlled at 6.5 by automatically 
feeding 5  M NaOH. The dissolved oxygen was main -
tained at 10% of air saturation at an aeration rate of 1.0 
vvm by adjusting the agitation speed. The feeding solu -
tion contains 600  g/L glycerol, 10  g/L yeast extract, 
1  g/L  MgSO4·7H2O, 0.01  g/L  CoCl2·6  H2O, 0.01  g/L 
 MnCl2·4H2O, and 0.01 g/L  FeSO4·7H2O. Another 5 mg/L 
vitamin  B12 was added at 12 h.
Plasmid stability assay
To determine the stability of plasmids, the culture sam -
ples were taken at different intervals during the fed-batch 
fermentation. The samples were diluted with water and 
plated for single cells on LB plates without antibiotics 
and incubated overnight at 37 ◦C. Colonies were replica 
plated onto LB plates containing 100 mg/L ampicillin to 
check for the presence of the plasmid. The plasmid main-
tenance ratio was calculated by dividing the colony num -
bers of LB-ampicillin plates by the colony numbers of LB 
plates.
Quantification of biomass and products
Cell concentration was determined by measuring the 
optical density of 600 nm  (OD600). High-performance liq-
uid chromatography (HPLC) equipped with an Aminex 
HPX-87H Column (300 × 7.8 mm) and detection via UV 
absorption at 210  nm was used to determine the con -
centration of glycerol, 1,3-PDO, 3-HP , and other organic 
acids. 5 mM  H2SO4 was used as the mobile phase with a 
flow rate of 0.8 mL/min (Chen et al. 2014).
Enzyme assays
The activity of glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase 
was determined by the method as described by Weiner 
and Heppel (1972). The activity of alcohol dehydroge -
nase YqhD toward 3-hydroxypropionaldehyde (3-HPA) 
reduction was determined as described by Pérez et  al. 
(2008; Sulzenbacher et  al. 2004). The activity of alde -
hyde dehydrogenase AldH toward 3-HPA oxidation was 
determined as described by Zhao et al. (2019). All of the 
measures were repeated for three times.
Results and discussion
Plasmid stability assay of a recombinant V. natriegens 
during 1,3‑PDO production
In our previous work, a recombinant V. natriegens VN10 
was constructed to produce 1,3-PDO from glycerol 
(Zhang et al. 2021). The pathways leading to the forma -
tion of main byproducts were all blocked in this strain 
by deleting adhE (ethanol), ldhA (lactate), pfl (formate), 
pta-ackA (acetate), frdABCD (succinate), aldA, and aldB

genes (3-HP). Moreover, the arcA and glpR genes encod-
ing two key transcriptional regulators (Nizam et al. 2009) 
and the sthA gene encoding a soluble pyridine nucleotide 
transhydrogenase were also deleted to increase NADPH 
availability (Fig.  1). An optimized 1,3-PDO synthesis 
module was overexpressed in plasmid pTrc99a by placing 
dhaBCE and gdrAB genes encoding glycerol dehydratase 
and its activator under promoter J23106 and yqhD gene 
encoding NADPH-dependent alcohol dehydrogenase 
under promoter J23100 (Fig.  1). Moreover, the phaP 
gene from Azotobacter sp. encoding phasin PhaP and the 
transhydrogenase genes pntAB were also overexpressed 
in the plasmid to increase the robustness of cell and 
the intracellular concentration of NADPH, respectively 
(Fig.  1). PhaP is a polyhydroxyalkanoate granule-associ -
ated protein that has been used to protect cells against 
several kinds of stress, including toxic metabolites, such 
as ethanol, butanol, and 3-hydroxybutyrate (de Almeida 
et al. 2007; Mezzina et al. 2017; Zhang et al. 2021). It has 
also been successfully used to increase the production of 
1,3-PDO (Mezzina et al. 2017; Zhang et al. 2021). Strain 
VN10 can produce 56.4 g/L 1,3-PDO in 24 h with a yield 
of 0.61  mol/mol glycerol during fed-batch fermentation 
without the accumulation of other byproducts (Fig.  2A). 
However, a sharp reduction of the productivity of 1,3-
PDO was observed after 15  h (Fig.  2A). Since 1,3-PDO 
synthesis module was overexpressed in the plasmid and 
the plasmid was very large (~ 13.7 kb), we supposed that 
instability of the plasmid may be one important reason 
related to the reduced productivity. To test this hypoth -
esis, we took samples at different time intervals during 
fed-batch fermentation and measured the plasmid main -
tenance ratios. As shown in Fig.  2B, a high ratio of plas -
mid loss was observed during fed-batch fermentation. 
Although antibiotic (100  mg/L ampicillin) was added 
in the medium, 51.8% and 65.8% of cells lost plasmid at 
12 h and 24 h. We also measured the activity of NADPH-
dependent alcohol dehydrogenase (YqhD) during fed-
batch fermentation. As shown in Fig.  2C, the activity of 
YqhD was also significantly reduced after 12 h, suggesting 
that the reduced productivity of 1,3-PDO may be related 
to plasmid loss. To reduce plasmid loss, we tried to add 
ampicillin at different time intervals during fed-batch fer-
mentation, which, however, did not improve the plasmid 
maintenance ratios or the productivity of 1,3-PDO (data 
not shown).
Designing a plasmid maintenance system to improve 
1,3‑PDO production
To increase plasmid stability during fed-batch fermenta -
tion of V. natriegens, we attempted to design a plasmid 
maintenance system by coupling substrate consumption, 
Fig. 1 Metabolic engineering strategies for developing V. natriegens to produce 1,3-PDO. The deleted genes are shown with cross marks. A 
heterologous 1,3-PDO synthesis pathway is introduced by overexpressing genes encoding glycerol dehydratase (dhaBCE) and its activator (gdrAB) 
and a NADPH-dependent alcohol dehydrogenase (yqhD). A plasmid stabilization system is developed by deleting the chromosomal glpD gene 
encoding glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase and expressing the corresponding gene in the expression vector
Page 6 of 11Zhang et al. Bioresources and Bioprocessing           (2021) 8:125 
cell viability, and product formation in the expression 
plasmid. V. natriegens has only one glycerol consumption 
pathway which is composed of glycerol kinase (glpK) and 
glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (glpD) (Zhang et al. 
2021). Our previous study showed that the expression of 
glpK gene was subjected to complex genetic regulation 
(Zhang et al. 2021). To avoid significant perturbation of 
cellular metabolism, we select the glpD gene as a target 
for designing a gene complementation system. The chro -
mosomal glpD gene was deleted and expressed in the 
expression plasmid pTrc99a-J23106-doy-phaP-pntAB. 
Knockout of glpD gene abolishes the growth of V. natrie -
gens VN10 in M9 minimal medium with glycerol as the 
sole carbon source. V. natriegens VN10△glpD showed 
marginal growth in fermentation medium due to the 
presence of yeast extract but did not consume glycerol 
(Fig. 3A). To recover the activity of glycerol-3-phosphate 
dehydrogenase, the glpD gene was inserted into plasmid 
pTrc99a-J23106-doy-phaP-pntAB with different pro -
moters. With the consideration of plasmid number of 
pTrc99a, three constitutive promoters from V. natrie -
gens with varied strength (1% ~ 10% of the expression 
level of chromosomal glpD gene) were selected, includ -
ing the native promoters of dnaG gene, patZ gene, and 
ribC gene (Lee et al. 2019; Zhang et al. 2021). As shown 
in Fig.  3A and B, when the promoter of ribC  gene was 
used to express plasmid-bearing glpD gene, strain VN13 
recovered normal cell growth and showed similar activ -
ity of glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase compared to 
strain VN10.

The performance of strain VN13 was tested in fed-
batch fermentation without adding antibiotics. As shown 
in Fig.  4A, strain VN13 produced 69.5  g/L 1,3-PDO 
in 24 h, with a productivity of 2.90 g/L/h and a yield of 
0.62  mol/mol. The productivity of 1,3-PDO was 23% 
higher than that obtained by strain VN10 based on the 
antibiotic selection system. The expression plasmid in 
strain VN13 was almost completely maintained dur -
ing the whole fed-batch fermentation (Fig.  4B), indicat-
ing that the designed system was efficient to couple cell 
viability with plasmid maintenance. The activity of YqhD 
was also retained at a high level during the whole fed-
batch fermentation (Fig.  4C), suggesting that increased 
plasmid stability is helpful to enhance pathway efficiency 
and 1,3-PDO production. The yield and productivity 
of 1,3-PDO by strain VN13 are higher than most natu -
ral 1,3-PDO producers (Lee et  al. 2015, 2018; Sun et  al. 
2018;). Thus, the developed plasmid maintenance system 
was shown to be effective and robust for increasing 1,3-
PDO production under antibiotic-free cultivation, which 
is strongly important for large-scale fermentation in 
industry. Compared to strain VN10, the yield of 1,3-PDO 
by strain VN13 was not significantly increased probably 
due to that the flux distribution to glycerol oxidative 
and reductive pathways was partially altered due to the 
expression of glpD gene in the expression plasmid. It is 
possible to increase the yield of 1,3-PDO by further opti -
mizing the promoter strength of glpD gene in the plas -
mid. The final titer of 1,3-PDO could also be increased by 
extending the fermentation time. However, the produc -
tivity of 1,3-PDO was significantly reduced after 24 h due 
to severe cell death (data not shown) although the cells 
still had a high plasmid maintenance ratio (> 95%). The 
reasons for the severe cell death are unknown and should 
be elucidated in the future.
Application of the plasmid maintenance system 
for developing a 3‑HP hyperproducer
To test the general applicability of the designed plasmid 
maintenance system, we attempted to implement the sys-
tem for 3-HP production. 3-HP is an important platform 
chemical that can be used as a precursor for the synthesis 
of various chemicals, such as acrylic acid, acrylonitrile, 
and propiolactone (Chen et al. 2017; Dishisha et al. 2015; 
Kim et  al. 2020). Different microorganisms have been 
engineered to produce 3-HP , including E. coli, Klebsiella 
pneumoniae, and Corynebacterium glutamicum (Chen 
et al. 2017; Kim et al. 2020; Zhao et al. 2019). However, 
the productivities of 3-HP by all reported microorgan -
isms are lower than 2.5  g/L/h, which can be a limiting

of strain VN13; B Plasmid maintenance ratio during fed-batch cultivation; C Activity of YqhD during fed-batch cultivation. No antibiotics were added

factor for its industrial application. Considering its fast 
growth and high substrate consumption rate, V. natrie -
gens could be a potential chassis for 3-HP production. 
Since the conversion of glycerol to 3-HP is an oxidative 
process which generates NADH, we constructed a new 
V. natriegens starting strain VN05 by deleting the adhE, 
ldhA, pfl, pta-ackA, and frdABCD genes to prevent the 
accumulate of other byproducts (Fig.  5). The 3-HP syn -
thesis module was firstly established by constructing 
plasmid pTrc99a-dhaBCE-aldH which overexpressed 
dhaBCE and gdrAB genes under promoter J23106 and 
aldH gene encoding an efficient aldehyde dehydrogenase 
from E. coli under promoter J23100 (Jo et al. 2008). The 
phasin PhaP gene phaP was also introduced to increase 
the strain’s tolerance to 3-HP (de Almeida et  al. 2007; 
Mezzina et  al. 2017). By introducing plasmid pTrc99a-
dhaBCE-aldH into V. natriegens VN05, the generated 
strain VN14 was able to accumulate 49.5  g/L 3-HP by 
fed-batch fermentation with the addition of ampicillin, 
with a productivity of 2.06 g/L/h and a yield of 0.68 mol/
mol (Fig.  6A). No other byproducts were detected dur -
ing the fermentation. However, severe loss of plasmid 
was also observed during the fed-batch fermentation 
(Fig. 6B). At 24 h, the plasmid maintenance ratio was only 
32% and the activity of aldehyde dehydrogenase was also 
sharply reduced after 9 h (Fig.  6B and C). Thus, the plas -
mid maintenance system was also introduced by deleting 
the chromosomal glpD gene and expressing it in plasmid 
pTrc99a-dhaBCE-aldH-glpD3 under the control of ribC  
promoter. The resulting strain VN15 produced 64.5  g/L 
3-HP during the fed-batch fermentation without add -
ing antibiotics, with a productivity of 2.69  g/L/h and a 
yield of 0.67  mol/mol (Fig.  6D). The expression plas -
mid was almost completely maintained and the activity 
of aldehyde dehydrogenase was retained at a high level 
during the fermentation (Fig.  6E and F). Thus, the devel -
oped plasmid maintenance system was also effective for 
increasing 3-HP production under antibiotic-free cultiva-
tion. To the best of our knowledge, the obtained produc -
tivity of 3-HP was the highest value reported to date.
Conclusion
In this study, a plasmid maintenance system was devel -
oped to increase the stability of large plasmids in V. 
natriegens. By deleting the chromosomal glpD gene and 
complementing it in an expression vector, the system 
was shown to be effective to prevent plasmid loss since 
the glpD gene is essential for cell survival and glycerol

A heterologous 3-HP synthesis pathway is introduced by overexpressing genes encoding glycerol dehydratase (dhaBCE) and its activator (gdrAB) 
and a NAD-dependent aldehyde dehydrogenase (aldH). A plasmid stabilization system is developed by deleting the chromosomal glpD gene 
encoding glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase and expressing the corresponding gene in the expression vector

consumption in the cultivation using glycerol as the sole 
carbon source. The system was successfully implemented 
to engineer V. natriegens to produce 1,3-PDO and 3-HP 
from glycerol, enabling the resulting strains to pro -
duce 69.5  g/L 1,3-PDO and 64.5  g/L 3-HP in 24  h. The 
obtained productivities were significantly higher than

those by antibiotic selection cultivations. The developed 
antibiotic-free system provided an important tool for 
engineering V. natriegens as an industrial chassis for the 
production of chemicals on a large scale. The system can 
also be modified to produce chemicals from other carbon 
sources by selecting alternative essential genes.
