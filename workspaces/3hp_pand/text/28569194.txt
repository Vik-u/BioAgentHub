Abstract
Background: Primary hyperoxaluria type 2 is a rare monogenic disorder inherited in an autosomal recessive
pattern. It results from the absence of the enzyme glyoxylate reductase/hydroxypyruvate reductase (GRHPR). As a
consequence of deficient enzyme activity, excessive amounts of oxalate and L-glycerate are excreted in the urine,
and are a source for the formation of calcium oxalate stones that result in recurrent nephrolithiasis and less
frequently nephrocalcinosis.
Case presentation: We report a case of a 10-month-old patient diagnosed with urolithiasis. Screening of inborn
errors of metabolism, including the performance of GC/MS urine organic acid profiling and HPLC amino acid
profiling, showed abnormalities, which suggested deficiency of GRHPR enzyme. Additional metabolic disturbances
observed in the patient led us to seek other genetic determinants and the elucidation of these findings. Besides the
elevated excretion of 3-OH-butyrate, adipic acid, which are typical marks of ketosis, other metabolites such as 3-
aminoisobutyric acid, 3-hydroxyisobutyric acid, 3-hydroxypropionic acid and 2-ethyl-3-hydroxypropionic acids were
observed in increased amounts in the urine. Direct sequencing of the GRHPR gene revealed novel mutation,
described for the first time in this article c.454dup (p.Thr152Asn fs*39) in homozygous form. The frequent nucleotide
variants were found in AGXT2 gene.
Conclusions: The study presents metabolomic and molecular-genetic findings in a patient with PH2. Mutation
analysis broadens the allelic spectrum of the GRHPR gene to include a novel c.454dup mutation that causes the
truncation of the GRHPR protein and loss of its two functional domains. We also evaluated whether nucleotide
variants in the AGXT2 gene could influence the biochemical profile in PH2 and the overproduction of metabolites,
especially in ketosis. We suppose that some metabolomic changes might be explained by the inhibition of the
MMSADH enzyme by metabolites that increase as a consequence of GRHPR and AGXT2 enzyme deficiency. Several
facts support an assumption that catabolic conditions in our patient could worsen the degree of hyperoxaluria and
glyceric aciduria as a consequence of the elevated production of free amino acids and their intermediary products.

Background
Primary hyperoxalurias (PHs) are a group of rare auto-
somal recessive inherited diseases. PHs are characterized
by a defect in glyoxylate metabolism which results in en-
dogenous oxalate overproduction. The clinical conse-
quences of excessive oxalate excretion are nephrolithiasis
and/or nephrocalcinosis, and/or the early-onset end-stage
renal disease (ESRD) in childhood. Glyoxylate is a highly
reactive metabolite that is normally effectively removed
through its conversion to glycine and less effectively to
glycolate. In humans, the glycine producing pathway is
catalysed by the liver-specific peroxisomal enzyme ala-
nine/glyoxylate aminotransferase (AGXT1; EC 2.6.1.44)
also known as: serine-pyruvate aminotransferase (AGT1,
AGXT, SPT, SPAT). The second metabolic pathway in
which the glyoxylate is consumed by reduction to glyco-
late in the cytosol and mitochondria is catalysed by the
enzyme glyoxylate reductase-hydroxypyruvate reductase
(GRHPR; EC 1.1.1.79, alternative symbol: GLXR). In the
case of the deficiency of one of the above-mentioned en-
zymes, a compensative mechanism takes over – the oxida-
tion of glyoxylate to oxalate by cytosolic L-lactate
dehydrogenase (LD). Also hydroxypyruvate that is nor-
mally reduced by GRHPR to D-glycerate is converted to
L-glycerate by the same LD in the deficiency of enzyme
GRHPR [1 – 4]. Under normal conditions, the competition
between the reduction and oxidation of glyoxylate is bal-
anced and controlled mainly by the cytoplasmic pool of
NADPH, which can be utilized by GRHPR but not by LD
and favours the production of glycolate, whereas LD activ-
ity favours the production of oxalate [5, 6]. Mutations in
either the AGXT1 or GRHPR gene that result in the syn-
thesis of deficient proteins alter this equilibrium, and
cause the overproduction of the main metabolites respon-
sible for PHs. To date, the three types of PH (PH1, PH2
and PH3) have been described [7, 8]. Primary hyperoxa-
luria type 1 (PH1; OMIM #259900) is the most prevalent
and most severe form of primary hyperoxaluria caused by
AGXT1 deficiency. Primary hyperoxaluria type 2 (PH2;
OMIM #260000 also known as L-glyceric aciduria) is less
common than PH1 (exact incidence is unknown), and is
characterized by a GRHPR enzyme defect. Recently, a
third type of primary hyperoxaluria (PH3; OMIM
#613616) has been described that is caused by the defi-
ciency of the mitochondrial enzyme 4-hydroxy-2-oxoglu-
tarate aldolase (HOGA), the apical enzyme in the
mitochondrial hydroxyproline catabolism. Under physio-
logical conditions, the enzyme splits HOG into pyruvate
and glyoxylate, the latter being subsequently oxidized by
the cytosolic LD to oxalate [8, 9]. HOGA enzyme defi-
ciency results in HOG accumulation, however, the mech-
anism by which this deficiency causes hyperoxaluria has
not been elucidated in detail yet. The inhibitory effect of
HOG on the GRHPR enzyme has been assumed by Riedel
[10] with consequences similar to PH2. Our study focuses
on the deficiency of the GRHPR enzyme that possesses
glyoxylate reductase (GR), hydroxypyruvate reductase
(HPR), and D-glycerate dehydrogenase activities (DGDH)
[11– 14], which is causative of PH2. This homodimeric en-
zyme consists of 328 amino acids per subunit and is
encoded by the GRHPR gene, located in the centromeric
region of chromosome 9 and contains nine exons span-
ning 9 kbp. Though GRHPR deficiency is very rare, the
current mutation database includes about 30 different
types of mutations in the human GRPHR gene [2, 3,
15– 17]. We report the case of a 10 month-old female pa-
tient with a clinical finding of urolithiasis who a clinician
suspected of having a genetic disorder. Results of specific
biochemical analyses and genetic examination led to the
diagnosis of PH2 and the disclosure of a novel mutation
in the GRHPR gene. Given the unexpected and unclear
biochemical findings in relation to PH2, we subsequently
sought genetic variants in the relevant gene - AGXT2,t h e
protein of which is functionally closely coupled to
GRHPR. Finally we evaluate all the important biochemical
changes and genetic data observed in the patient, and dis-
cuss the possible metabolic consequences of GRPHR
deficiency.
Case presentation
A 10-month-old girl with a history of tonsilopharyngi-
tis, bilateral inborn hip dysplasia with improvement,
dispenzarised by an orthopaedist, was referred to hos-
pital because of a one-day febrilities and positive urin-
ary finding of ketone bodies, proteins, leukocyturia and
haematuria. She was born after a normal pregnancy at
full term with an uncomplicated perinatal and neonatal
course. There was no history of gross haematuria or
colicky abdominal pain, and she had received no medi-
cation except for antipyretics. The family history was
negative with respect to renal and metabolic disease, in-
cluding urolithiasis and nephrocalcinosis, however, gen-
etic counselling revealed that the parents have common
ancestors in the fourth generation.
On physical examination the child appeared mildly
dehydrated with increased body temperature of 37.6 °
C. A laboratory examination found moderate anaemia
(haemoglobin 93.0 g/l), leucocytosis (15x10 9/l) and
moderately elevated CRP (42.6 mg/l). Serum electro-
lyte, urea and creatinine levels were normal. The cal-
cium/creatinine ratio and 24 h calcium excretion was
within the reference range. Blood gas analysis was
normal with no evidence of metabolic acidosis. Ultra-
sonography of the abdomen raised suspicion of ureter-
olithiasis l.sin. Cystourethrography was indicated,
showing concrement sized 2 cm x 0.8 cm in the distal
part of the left ureter with mild dilatation of the renal
pelvis and ureter (Fig. 1).

At the age of 11 months, an ureterolithotomy was per-
formed at the University Children Hospital Bratislava. A
chemical analysis of the extracted stone was performed,
and the stone was characterised as a composite of virtu-
ally pure calcium oxalate. The following course was
without any complications.
Biochemical analyses
Methods
Biochemical analyses were performed in the Department
of Molecular and Biochemical Genetics of University Hos-
pital, and the obligatory recommended schemes and flow
charts were used to elucidate possible metabolic disorders.
Crucial for the diagnostics of rare monogenic forms of
urolithiasis is the application of chromatographic methods
such as HPLC, GC/MS focused on amino acids, and the
organic acids profile of urine.
Determination of amino acids in urine
Forty nmol of norvaline was added as an internal stand-
ard to each deproteinised urine sample. The routine
HPLC procedure recommended by Agilent Technologies
was applied for the separation of amino acids using the
Zorbax Eclipse AAA HPLC column and on line derivati-
sation with OPA-MPA. For the analysis, a HPLC instru-
ment of Agilent Technologies 1200 series was used with
the diode array detector operating at 338 nm. The calcu-
lation of amino acid concentration was performed in re-
lation to areas of internal standard in the sample.
Determination of organic acids in urine
The determination of organic acids in the urine sample
was performed by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry
(GC/MS) using an ITQ 1100 Thermo Scientific ion trap
mass spectrometer operating in split mode (split ratio
1:40). The separation of urine metabolites was achieved
on 30 m DB5 column with 0.25 i.d. (Agilent) and constant
helium column flow 1.2 ml/min during 28 min. Equal ali-
quot of the internal standard (0.61 mmol of 4-
phenylbutyric acid) was added to 1 ml - 2 ml of urine
sample, and organic acids were extracted by ethylacetate.
The derivatisation of organic acids was performed by a
mixture of BSTFA/DMCS/acetonitrile/pyridine (10:5:1:1)
in a heating block for 60 min at 60 °C. For the calculation
of excreted urine compounds, the calibration curves were
constructed from four different points of concentrations
of standards. All measured values were corrected on the
recovery of added internal standard. The urinary excretion
of organic acids was expressed in mmol/mol creatinine.
The values of all measured metabolites in the patient ’s
urine were compared with the reference data published by
Blau et al., 2008 and the Urine Metabolome Database
www.urinemetabolome.ca.
Results
The analysis of amino acids in urine is part of the routine
scheme focused on the diagnosis of defects in amino acid
metabolism or tubular transport. In the urine sample we
found only mildly elevated lysine and cystine excretion,
while the excretion of arginine and ornithine was within
reference values. We also found elevated excretion of β-
aminoisobutyric acid (BAIB) - 137 mmol/mol creatinine
(laboratory control ranges are 9 – 45 mmol/mol creatinine).
Nevertheless, such finding is frequent in the Caucasian
population and is caused by the presence of single nucleo-
tide variants in the AGXT2 gene, upon which genetic ana-
lysis was additionally performed.
A routine GC/MS analysis of organic acids in the patient ’s
urine samples revealed a marked peak in/with a retention
time of 12.7 min corresponding to compounds with reten-
tion index 1342 MU (methylene units). On the physiological
urine chromatogram this peak is negligible. A comparison

of the obtained chromatographic data with the library mass
spectra (NIST library) revealed that the peak corresponded
to glycerate (Fig. 2). Quantification of organic acids content
in the urine uncovered clear-cut abnormalities when com-
pared to accepted refference values.Oxalate was only mod-
erately elevated up to 349 mmol/mol creatinine (reference
age-related interval 61– 162 mmol/mol creatinine). In con-
trast to the oxalate, the glycerate value was extraordinarily
high, reaching 2796 mmol/mol creatinine (reference only
trace). On the other hand, the glycolate urine excretion was
normal, reaching 69 mmol/mol creatinine (reference inter-
val 22– 139 mmol/mol creatinine). The finding of extremely
high glycerate excretion was crucial for the choice of gene
responsible for methabolic pathology and molecular genetic
diagnostic. In addition to this principal metabolic finding,
we found increased excretion of 3-hydroxybutyrate (HBA;
605 mmol/mol creatinine), 3-hydroxyisobutyric acid (HIBA;
80.2 mmol/mol creatinine), and adipate (134 mmol/mol) in
the examined urine sample - all typical marks of ketosis. In
comparison to the control samples, two trace metabolites
3-hydroxypropionic acid (HPA, alternative name hydracry-
late) and 2-ethyl-3-hydroxypropionic acids (EHPA; alterna-
tive names: 2-hydroxymethyl-butyrate, 2-ethylhydracrylate)
were also substantially elevated in the urine. The quantity of
HPA was estimated by an obligatory procedure based on
the comparison of ion areas (Q-177) of the patient's sample,
and HPA standard and revealed value 593 mmol/mol cre-
atinine. Due to the absence o f a commercially available
standard, EHPA quantificationw a sp e r f o r m e du s i n ga r b i -
trary units (ratio of metabolite area to area of standard). Ac-
cording to data from the Human Urine Metabolome
Database, the average value of EHPA is 4 mmol/mol cre-
atinine, and based on this finding and data from our control
samples we estimate that the excretion of EHPA may be ap-
proximately 40 mmol/mol of creatinine in the patient ’s
urine sample. In the chromatogram we observed an un-
known metabolite at a retention time corresponding to
1500 MU.
The measurement of urine organic acids level in the
patient’s second sample (five days after surgical interven-
tion) confirmed increased values of oxalate and glycerate
(167 mmol/mol and 1113 mmol/mol creatinine respect-
ively), however, normal values of HBA and adipate were
observed. Furthermore, the excretion of BAIB acid
returned to the physiological level (27 mmol/mol cre-
atinine). As for HPA and EHPA, while the EHPA levels
decreased to normal, the excretion of HPA remained sig-
nificantly elevated. The unknown metabolite observed in
the first sample was not detected in this urine sample. In
order to interpret the observed secondary metabolic
changes correctly, we decided to compare the increase
in the urine excretion levels of all the mentioned metab-
olites with the control samples and the samples of keto-
nuric patients obtained from our database (Table 1). We
used values of 11 control samples of probands of both
genders and aged more than 6 months.
Molecular identification of the mutations
Methods
DNA isolation and PCR reactions
Genomic DNA was isolated from whole blood samples
using the NucleoSpin Blood Kit (Macherey-Nagel). The
DNA encoding of the GRHPR gene (ENST00000318158)
was amplified using primers as described in Table 2. Pri-
mer sequences were based on the published genomic
DNA sequence accession number AF146689. All nine
PCR fragments were performed in 20 μl volumes con-
taining approximately 100 ng of DNA, 2x PCR Master
Mix (Thermo Fisher Scientific), and 0.5 μmol/l of each
primer. The PCR program for all regions was as follows:
3 min at 95 °C, and then 40 cycles at 95 °C for 30s, 55 °
C for 30s, and 72 °C for 30s, followed by 7 min at 72 °C
for the final extension.
Sequencing analysis
The sequencing analysis of PCR fragments was per-
formed after their purification using Exonuclease I and
FastAP (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Both sense and anti-
sense strands were sequenced with a DNA-sequencing
kit - Big Dye terminator cycle sequencing ready reaction
version 3.1 (Applied Biosystems) – and subsequently
purified using the Nucleospin column purification sys-
tem (QIAGEN). The electrophoresis of amplified prod-
ucts was performed using an ABI PRISM®3100 (Applied
Biosystems), with 50 cm capillary columns loaded with
Alter-POP6 polymer (Applied Biosystems). Analytic data
was treated using SeqScape v2.6.0. software.
Results
PCR amplification of genomic DNA followed by the se-
quencing of all nine exons and the intron-exon boundaries
in the GRHPR gene (NM_012203.1) revealed several nu-
cleotide variants. Homozygous synonymous variant
c.579A > G (p.Ala193=, rs309458) and homozygous vari-
ant c.288-11C > T (rs2736664) were found in the exon 6
and intron 3, respectively. In the exon 5, we identified mu-
tation c.454dup in homozygous form (Fig. 3a). This causal
mutation has not been reported before [44] and results in
a frameshift (p.Thr152Asn fs*39) after the insertion of a
single A nucleotide. The frameshift generates a truncation
of the GRHPR protein - from the original 328 amino acids
to a 192-amino-acid-long polypeptide. In the truncated
protein, the first 152 amino acids remain the same as in
the wild-type protein, whereas the terminal 40 amino
acids display an altered sequence. The frameshift causes
the loss of two essential functional domains – the
coenzyme-binding domain (CBD) and the formate/glyce-
rate dehydrogenase substrate-binding domain (SBD). To

get a full picture, we also analysed the DNA of both the
patient’s parents. Sequence analysis of the GRHPR gene
showed that both were heterozygous for the causal
c.454dup mutation.
We performed a genetic analysis of the AGXT2 gene
(ENST00000231420) coding the AGXT2 enzyme (alter-
native names: Alanine Glyoxylate Aminotransferase 2;
Beta-Alanine-Pyruvate Aminotransferase; AGT2; DAI-
BAT) (E.C. 2.6.1.40), and we found the five nucleotides
variants. The two nucleotides variants in homozygous
state, rs37370, (serine 102 asparagine) and rs180749,
(threonine 212 isoleucine) were referred as responsible
for the loss of AGXT2 activity and increased BAIB ex-
cretion [18, 19].
Discussion and conclusions
Using a routine HPLC analysis of urinary amino acids, we
detected only a mildly elevated excretion of lysine and
cystine in the patient ’s sample, and hence we excluded
cystinuria as a cause of the diagnosed urolithiasis. Cystin-
uria (OMIM #220100) is a frequent disease inherited in an
autosomal recessive fashion that is caused by the insuffi-
cient transport of cystine and basic amino acids (lysine,
ornithine, and arginine) through renal tubules and entero-
cytes. Although the manifestation of cystinic urolithiasis
in children is rare, it was necessary to exclude this defect
as the cause of the disease.
The determination of organic acids and certain glycine
conjugates in urine by GC/MS is a widespread approach
used in the diagnosis of inherited metabolic disorders, in-
cluding the monogenic forms of urolithiasis. However, the
procedure consisting of liquid extraction, derivatisation,
and chromatographic separation of organic acids bears
non-negligible limitations. Furthermore, the excretion of
metabolites in the pathological condition is variable and,
among other factors, may be influenced by the type of
mutation, dietary regime, fasting and therapy. The limita-
tions of the routinely applied methods affect the diagnos-
tics of primary hyperoxalurias significantly, and hence
may obscure the published statistical data concerning the
incidence and prevalence of the disease. Only two cases of
PH1 have been described in Slovakia, and the presented
case of PH2 is the first report of the disease in our coun-
try. Coupled chromatographic and mass spectrometric
analysis resulted in the identification of glyceric acid as a
pathognomonic compound in the patient ’s urine samples.
When we then analysed several control urine samples, we
found only traces of glycerate in them. An ineffective ex-
traction procedure employing ethyl acetate could explain
the observed low recovery of many polar compounds, in-
cluding glycerate, in urine. Although novel effective
methods for the extraction of polar compounds such as
oxalate, glycolate, glycerate have been introduced [20],
they have not been used for routine analysis yet. Another

limitation of the routinely applied GC/MS methods is the
inability to distinguish between two optical isomers. Spe-
cial columns with chiral stationary phase or utilization of
chiral reagents, in combination with ordinary non-chiral
column [21] in the diagnosis of PH2 characterised by the
occurrence of L-glycerate, could alleviate this limitation. A
common peak for the two optical isomers in the GC/MS
analysis is a key problem in the evaluation of glyceric acid-
uria type. The two D(+) and L( −) glyceric acids enantio-
mers are normally excreted in trace amounts in urine [22],
however, both are important biochemical markers of two
rare inherited metabolic diseases with different pheno-
types. The first disease is the D-glyceric aciduria charac-
terized by D-glycerate kinase ( GLYCTK gene) enzyme
deficiency, whereas the second disease, PH2, is accompan-
ied by L-glyceric aciduria and hyperoxaluria caused by a
deficiency of the GRHPR enzyme. D-glyceric aciduria is a
very rare disease with variable phenotype; however, neuro-
logical and developmental manifestations predominate.
The clinical and biochemical findings in our patient were
not relevant to this diagnosis. The presence of a clinical
picture of ureterolithiasis proved by X-ray was highly sug-
gestive of the diagnosis primary hyperoxaluria. Whereas
imaging methods and chemical analysis of the urine stone
could not reliably distinguish between PH1 and PH2, the
applied GC/MS method with principal finding of high gly-
cerate and oxalate versus normal glycolate concentrations
in the urine helped us to resolve the diagnosis correctly.
However, we have to stress the fact that just an extremely
high excretion of glycerate was substantial in the bio-
chemical diagnostics of this disease in the patient.
Fasting and the resulting ketogenesis accompanied by
gluconeogenesis have undoubtedly worsened the bio-
chemical manifestations of enzyme deficiency in the pa-
tient, this due to the increased serine and hydroxyproline
flux and the subsequent overproduction of hydroxypyru-
vate and glyoxylate. Based on the molecular-genetic find-
ings and enzyme studies, it is assumed that PH2 could
manifest without hyperglyceric aciduria, as was referred
by Rumbsy et al. [23]. Hence molecular-genetic analysis
has to be favoured as crucial proof of the presence or ab-
sence of the disease. It is recommended to seek the muta-
tion in AGXT1 in the first step, and in the analysis of
GRHPR and HOGA1 genes in the second step when PH is
suspected and the biochemical phenotype is not clear-cut
expressed.
The assumption of PH2 was unequivocally confirmed
by the molecular-genetic analysis of the GRHPR gene,
which disclosed the presence of homozygous mutation
c.454dup in the patient and the same mutation in het-
erozygous state in her parents. This homozygous form
of mutation causes the frame shift after amino acid 152,
which is followed by 40 novel amino acids and a prema-
ture stop codon at amino acid position 192. The gener-
ated protein has only 192 amino acids in comparison to
the original 328 amino acids. The lacking of 136 amino
acids is responsible for the loss of the important
coenzyme-binding domain (CBD) of protein in position
107 to 298, and as well as the second domain of the two
formate/glycerate dehydrogenase substrate-binding do-
main (SBD) located in the region 299 – 328 amino acids
(Fig. 3b.) [24, 25].

During the attack coupled with febrilities and ketosis,
additional metabolic disturbances were observed in the pa-
tient which led us to seek other genetic determinants and
the elucidation of these findings. Since low amounts of gly-
colic acid were present in the urine of the patient, we sug-
gest that the AGXT1 enzyme correctly catalyses the
conversion of glyoxylate to glycine, and that the detoxifica-
tion of this harmful metabolite in peroxisomes is effective.

HOGA enzyme and its detoxification in this compartment
is less satisfactorily explained. Based on known data, it can
be inferred that except for the GRHPR enzyme, mitochon-
drial AGXT2 can effectively use pyruvate and glyoxylate
also for the transamination of D-3-aminoisobutyrate (D-
BAIB) and β-alanine (BAL) [26]. It has been long estab-
lished that genetic factors inf luence the high excretion of
BAIB, originated preferentially from the degradation of thy-
mine (R- form) and to a lesser extent from valine (S-form)
[27– 30]. In the patient ’su r i n ew eo b s e r v e da ne l e v a t e de x -
cretion of BAIB, which is usually related to the diminished
activities of AGXT2 enzyme. This frequent finding in Cau-
casians is typically caused by the presence of the five nucle-
otides variants. In our patient two such variants were found
in homozygous state, rs3737 0 and rs180749, and were re-
ferred to in literature as responsible for the loss of AGXT2
activity and increased urinary (BAIB) excretion [18, 19].
According to Landaans and Solen [31], the excretion
amounts of this amino acid in urine (95% in the form of R
isomer) increased markedly in patients with ketoacidosis, a
phenomenon that was also observed in our patient. An im-
portant finding was reported by Gennip et al. [32] that
urine has a constant ratio between R and S isomers (20:1),
supporting the idea that interc onversion between enantio-
mers can occur. It is unequivocally accepted that D-BAIB is
generated by the conversion of valine metabolite S-
methylmalonyl semialdehyde (S-MMSA) to R- methylma-
lonyl semialdehyde (R-MMSA), and in the second step to
R-BAIB by transamination. A critical point in this claim is
transamination because of the stereospecificity of the sup-
posed enzyme ABAT (E.C.2.6.1.19). This enzyme catalyses
the transamination of non-stereospecific BAL, GABA and
from stereospecific isomers only L-BAIB with 2-
oxoglutarate [33, 34]. In a report subsequently published by
Tamaki [26], a mixture of appropriate substrates and en-
zymes AGXT2 and ABAT provide in vitro condition con-
version between S-BAIB an dR - B A I B .I nc o n t e x tw i t h
genetic abnormality (AGXT2 d eficiency), we consider
changes of the mitochondrial pool of HOGA, glyoxylate,
and their additive inhibitory effects on GRHPR that accen-
tuate deficiency. Except for the basic biochemical finding
related to HP2, the GC/MS analysis of urinary organic
acids disclosed an increase in HBA and adipic acid excre-
tion. These observations are in accordance with the health
status of our patient with food restrictions that resulted in
the increase of ketone bodies and dicarboxylic acids
production. In addition, other minor metabolites (HIBA,
HPA, EHPA, 2-methyl-3-hydroxybutyrate) were found in
elevated quantities in the urine of patients with ketoacidosis
[35, 36]. When we compared the excretion of these metab-
olites in our patient ’s urine with control urine samples (to
means of values), the excretion of HIBA was elevated 8
times, EHPA 10 times, and HPA even 150 times. Subse-
quently when we compared the patient ’sv a l u e sw i t ht h o s e
of patients with ketosis, the elevation for HIBA is 4 times
EHPA 3 times, and HPA 20 times. Data regarding the cor-
relation between HBA and othe r mentioned metabolites in
urine from patients with ketoacidosis has been very rare
[35]. In our cohort of patients with ketosis, we observed a
relationship between HBA and HIBA excretion, but not be-
tween HBA and HPA or EHPA. The discrepancy in the de-
gree of excretion of ketone bodies and studied metabolites
is apparent at least for HPA in our patient. A possible ex-
planation is that there is an influence of overproduced me-
tabolites such as HOGA and glyoxylate on routes
producing these trace metabolites, probably by inhibitory
mechanism. Catabolic conditions and amino acid break
down probably augment this effect. Inspiring for the assess-
ment of this thesis was data pub lished by Pollitt et al. [37],
who reported a child with meth ylmalonyl semialdehyde de-
hydrogenase deficiency (MMSADH - E.C. 1.2.1.27). Bio-
chemical findings were characterised by an excessive
excretion of amino acids R-BAIB, S-BAIB, BAL, and hydro-
xyacids such as HPA, S-HIBA and EHPA, and were logical
consequences of MMSADH deficiency. Metabolic disorders
in the child were confirmed by the finding of a homozy-
gous mutation 1336G > A (Gly446Arg) by Chambliss et al.
[38]. Catalytical properties of a rat liver mitochondrial en-
zyme isolated by Goodwin et al. [39] enable NAD +
dependent dehydrogenation of malonate semialdehyde
(MSA) and MMSA. This enzyme participates in the metab-
olism of valine, thymine, uracile, and their catabolic prod-
ucts such as BAL and both isomers of BAIB. In relation to
the metabolism of MMSA kinetic data characterised by
Godwin et al. [39], Kedishvili et al. [40] and interconver-
sion studies published by Manning and Pollitt [41] indi-
cate that both stereo isomers are used by MMSADH,
though the R isomer is preferred. In our patient all the
above-mentioned metabolites (BAL was not measured)
show a significant increase in excretion, and are in thin
connection with the function of MMSADH. A possible
explanation is the inhibitory effect of overproduced me-
tabolites such as HOGA or unconsumed products such
as glyoxylate on MMSADH due to the deficiency of
GRHPR and AGXT2. In regard to the close structural
resemblance to MSA, we consider that glyoxylate may
be favorised as the inhibitor of the enzyme. The net of
metabolic changes in mitochondria, peroxisomes and
cytosol of patient is depicted in Fig. 4.

In conclusion we consider that several facts support the
assumption that catabolic conditions in PH2 patients
could worsen the degree of hyperoxaluria and glyceric
aciduria as a consequence of the elevated production of
free amino acids and their intermediary products. This
situation is triggered by urinary colic and leads to a vicious
circle. Hence mainly in children it is reasonable as soon as
possible to sustain parenteral energetic substitution. We
would like to point out the importance of considering rare
inborn errors of metabolism in differential diagnosis of
urolithiasis, especially when manifested in young age.
