Although CRISPR-dCas13, the RNA-guided RNA-binding protein, was recently
exploited as a translation-level gene expression modulator, it has still been
difﬁcult to precisely control the level due to the lack of detailed character-
ization. Here, we develop a synthetic tunable translation-level CRISPR inter-
ference (Tl-CRISPRi) system based onthe engineered guide RNAs that enable
precise and predictable down-regulation of mRNA translation. First, we opti-
mize the Tl-CRISPRi system for speciﬁc and multiplexed repression of genes at
the translation level. We also show thatthe Tl-CRISPRi system is more suitable
for independently regulating each gene in a polycistronic operon than the
transcription-level CRISPRi (Tx-CRISPRi) system. We further engineer the
handle structure of guide RNA for tunable and predictable repression of var-
ious genes inEscherichia coliand Vibrio natriegens. This tunable Tl-CRISPRi
system is applied to increase the production of 3-hydroxypropionic acid (3-
HP) by 14.2-fold via redirecting the metabolicﬂux, indicating the usefulness of
this system for theﬂux optimization in the microbial cell factories based on the
RNA-targeting machinery.
Developing synthetic gene expression modulators such as CRISPR-Cas
system and synthetic sRNA enabled high-throughput screening of
genes to systematically understand the microbial system and engineer
the metabolic pathways of microorganisms
1– 5. Catalytically dead Cas9
(dCas9) or dead Cas12 (dCas12) can speci ﬁcally bind to target
sequences in double-stranded DNA (dsDNA), block the transcription of
RNAP, and silence gene expression
6,7. Synthetic sRNA has been har-
nessed to suppress gene expression at the translation level since it can
efﬁciently bind to the mRNA together with the Hfq protein
8.
The Type VI CRISPR-Cas nuclease, called Cas13, is different from
Cas9 or Cas12 in that it can speciﬁcally target and cleave single-
stranded RNA9,10. Unlike Cas9 and Cas12, which require strict
protospacer-adjacent motif sequences for targeting, Cas13 requires
minimal or no protospacer ﬂanking sequences, allowing ﬂexible
targeting of mRNA
11. Unfortunately, when the nuclease-active state of
Cas13 binds to the target RNA and forms the ternary ribonucleoprotein
(RNP) complex, it causes non-speciﬁc degradation of adjacent RNA,
thereby signiﬁcantly limiting cell growth
9. This phenomenon has
confounded the utilization of Cas13 as a speciﬁc gene knockdown tool
in bacteria. Thus, the nuclease-inactive state of Cas13, called dead
Cas13 (dCas13), has been repurposed to repress the gene expression at
the translation level without causing growth retardation by seques-
tering the translation initiation region of mRNA
12. Also, gene activation
at the translation level was achieved by fusing the translation initiation
factor to the dCas13
13. However, the dCas13-based gene knockdown or
activation was only tested for a simple ON/OFF regulation of a
monocistronic gene. The characteristics of dCas13 as a synthetic gene
expression modulator, such as the speciﬁcity or the multiplexity, are

not yet investigated in detail. The lack of aﬁne-tuning strategy that can
moderately regulate the gene expression by the dCas13 has conﬁned
its usage in bacterial cells compared to other well-characterized syn-
thetic gene regulation systems.
In this study, we develop the dCas13-based tunable Tl-CRISPRi
system that can precisely tune the translation level of diverse genes in
two different bacteria. We apply the Tl-CRISPRi to the reporter genes in
the chromosome or plasmid, revealing its titratable, speciﬁc, and
multiplexed gene knockdown capability. Comparing the Tl-CRISPRi
with transcription-level CRISPRi (Tx-CRISPRi) under regulating the
expression of a polycistronic operon, we highlight the distinctiveness
of the Tl-CRISPRi system in that it can independently down-regulate
each gene in the synthetic and native operons. Furthermore, we
develop a strategy toﬁne-tune the expression level of a target gene by
modifying the sequence and structure of the guide RNA handle. The
library of attenuated guide RNAs allows uniformly distributed target
gene expression levels ranging from 2.6% to 86.3% and predictable
expression tuning across other genes. We verify that these attenuated
guide RNAs robustly work in bothEscherichia coliand Vibrio natrie-
gens, suggesting their expandability toward the other bacterial strains.
Finally, we adopt this tunable Tl-CRISPRi system to redirect the
metabolicﬂux for improving the bioproduction of 3-hydroxypropionic
acid (3-HP). We repress 48 target genes across metabolic pathways to
identify the effective knockdown targets. We utilize attenuated guide
RNAs to balance the bacterial growth and bioproduction, resulting in a
14.2-fold enhancement of 3-HP titer. Our tunable Tl-CRISPRi system
has the potential to be a robust and predictable translation-level gene
regulation system in bacteria.
Results
Design and characterization of the dCas13-based Tl-
CRISPRi system
Several previous studies have discovered hundreds of Cas13 orthologs
that can bind to target RNAs across a wide range of bacterial species
with the help of genome mining and classiﬁed into four subtypes
(Cas13a, Cas13b, Cas13c, and Cas13d) depending on the existence of
accessory proteins or the primary amino acid sequences of the Cas13
effectors
14– 17. We selected LbuCas13a, BzCas13b, PbCas13b, and
RfxCas13d, of which several biochemical properties and the critical
catalytic residues involved in non-speciﬁc nuclease activity are already
well characterized
15,18,19.W es o u g h tt oc o m p a r et h ee fﬁciency of
translation repression when these orthologs became catalytically
inactive. The catalytic residues were mutated to eliminate non-speciﬁc
RNA cleavage activity, generating the dCas13 proteins (Supplementary
Fig. 1a). In our experimental design, the expression of dCas13 protein
was induced by anhydrotetracycline (aTc), and the guide RNA target-
ing the 5’-untranslated region (5’-UTR) of mCherry mRNA was con-
stitutively expressed inE. coliK-12 MG1655 harboring the expression
cassette of mCherry (Fig.1a). While three dCas13 orthologs did not
show signiﬁcant gene knockdown upon the addition of aTc, the cata-
lytically dead version of RfxCas13d (dRfxCas13d) decreased the
expression level of the reporter gene to 2.8% compared to the non-
targeted control (Supplementary Fig. 1b). The bacterial growth was not
signiﬁcantly perturbed upon the mRNA knockdown of dRfxCas13d
(Supplementary Fig. 1c, d), which exhibits robustness as a synthetic
gene expression modulator. When we investigated the expression of
each dCas13 ortholog by western blotting and coomassie blue staining,
only the dRfxCas13d was clearly detected in both the total and soluble
fraction of bacterial cells (Supplementary Fig. 1e, f). This result
emphasizes the appropriate choice of dCas13 ortholog to be expressed
in the functional form for efﬁcient gene knockdown. Therefore, we
chose the dRfxCas13d and its cognate guide RNA to construct the
synthetic Tl-CRISPRi system.
We ﬁrst examined whether the binding of dCas13 indeed medi-
ated the knockdown of targeted mRNA since only the formation of
RNA duplex could knock down the mRNA as in the case of antisense
RNA
20– 22. We tested various concentrations of aTc, thereby differing
the expression level of dCas13, to evaluate the correlation between the
intracellular amount of dCas13 and the target gene expression. Nota-
bly, the decrease in mCherry level upon the addition of aTc was more
remarkable when themCherry-targeting guide RNA was expressed,
compared to the non-target strain (Supplementary Fig. 2). The corre-
lation between the concentration of dCas13 inducer and the target
gene expression level suggests that dCas13 is a critical component for
efﬁcient gene repression via Tl-CRISPRi, which can efﬁciently seques-
ter the translation initiation site of target mRNA. This result also shows
the possible usefulness of this system for biosensor-associated
dynamic regulation as performed in the previous CRISPRi studies
23,24.
Since the knockdown by the Tl-CRISPRi was saturated with more than
100 ng/mL of aTc, and some extent of growth retardation was
observed over 200 ng/mL of aTc (Supplementary Fig. 2), possibly due
to the metabolic burden from the expression of large Cas protein
25,w e
determined to induce the expression of dCas13 with 100 ng/mL of aTc
for the following experiments.
To validate that Tl-CRISPRi could robustly knockdown genes in
the various locations of the chromosome, we preparedE. colistrains,
each harboring reporter gene expression cassette (mCherry, GFP,
nanoluciferase) integrated into different loci of the chromosome. Six
spacers (sp1– sp6) spanning from 5’-UTR to the N-terminal region of the
coding sequence were designed and applied for the knockdown of
each reporter gene. We found that Tl-CRISPRi robustly knocked down
each gene regardless of its integrated location (Fig.1b). However, it
should be noted that each spacer’sk n o c k d o w ne fﬁciency was some-
what different. We reasoned that the accessibility toward targeted RNA
sequence or local AU and GC distribution, previously revealed as sig-
niﬁcant factors determining the targeting efﬁciency of Cas13
26,27,c o u l d
affect the binding efﬁciency of the dCas13-guide RNA complex toward
the target RNA to some degree. Nevertheless, all the spacers targeting
near the translation initiation region of mRNA showed remarkable
gene knockdown compared to the non-targeted strain. We applied the
sp1 spacer of each reporter gene to guarantee the robust repression of
gene expression for the following experiments. We next investigated
whether the Tl-CRISPRi could speciﬁcally and simultaneously repress
multiple gene expressions. We found that two or three reporter genes
were successfully knocked down by introducing multiple guide RNA
expression cassettes (Fig.1c, d). This result demonstrates the speciﬁ-
city and the multiplexity of the Tl-CRISPRi system.
Next, we tested whether the Tl-CRISPRi could efﬁciently inhibit
the translation of mRNA transcribed from the plasmid and whether the
amount of the target mRNA could affect the knockdown efﬁciency.
Four constitutive promoters with different transcription strengths
were adopted to express the mCherry on the plasmid (Supplementary
Fig. 3a). We found that the translation of mCherry mRNAs transcribed
from the plasmid could also be efﬁciently repressed by the Tl-CRISPRi
(Supplementary Fig. 3b). Additionally, the resulted relative expression
of the mCherry by the Tl-CRISPRi did not signiﬁcantly ﬂuctuate
regardless of the transcription rate of themCherry (Supplementary
Fig. 3c), showing from 3.8% (P
J23100)t o6 . 4 %( PJ23113).
Since optimizing the spacer length could reduce the possibility of
forming a secondary structure inside itself and enhance the RNA-
targeting efﬁciency
28,w es o u g h tt oﬁnd the minimum length of the
spacer that can retain the knockdown efﬁciency. To this end, we
changed the lengths of complementary sequences to the mCherry
mRNA in spacers by introducing mismatches. We found that the
expression level of mCherry gradually increased when the length of the
spacer-protospacer complementarity was lower than 22 nts (Supple-
mentary Fig. 4a). This result is consistent with the previous study
where the gene knockdown efﬁciency of RfxCas13d was maintained
over the 23-nt length of the spacer in the mammalian cell
28,29.T r u n -
cated spacers with a length of 27 nts, 23 nts, and 20 nts were also tested

for further validation, anchoring the position of the 3’ end of the
spacer. Indeed, tight knockdown of the reporter gene was observed
when the length of the spacer was reduced to 23 nts, conﬁrming that
the minimal size of the spacer should be 23 nts (Supplemen-
tary Fig. 4b).
We next investigated whether the amount of targeted mRNA
could also be affected by Tl-CRISPRi. Because of the co-localized and
coordinated transcription/translation processes in a prokaryotic cell,
suppressing the translation of the mRNA could lead to its degradation
and premature transcription termination due to the absence of ribo-
somes protecting the mRNA
30. We found that the Tl-CRISPRi decreased
the quantity of all three reporter mRNA, although it was less signiﬁcant
than the decrease in protein level (Supplementary Fig. 5). This result
suggests that excluding the ribosome by blocking translation initiation
via Tl-CRISPRi could moderately decrease the amount of targeted
mRNA, even though the dCas13 lacks the function of blocking

endogenous RNases as sRNA-Hfq does31,32.
Regulating the polycistronic operon expression via the Tl-
CRISPRi
When targeting a polycistronic operon, the conventional dCas9-based
Tx-CRISPRi turns off the expression of all cistrons located downstream
of a target gene33, known as the polar effect34 (Fig. 2a). We assumed
that Tl-CRISPRi would independently repress each gene in an operon,
unlike the Tx-CRISPRi, since Tl-CRISPRi could be speciﬁcally directed
to the translation initiation site of each cistron without disturbing the
translation of neighboring cistrons in the same transcript (Fig.2b). To
test this hypothesis, we introduced Tx-CRISPRi or Tl-CRISPRi, both
targeting near the N-terminal region of each gene in a polycistronic
operon comprised ofmCherry and GFP. When the upstreammCherry
was targeted, the Tx-CRISPRi led to far reduced expression of the
downstream GFP (19.6%) compared to that (63.1%) by the Tl-CRISPRi
(Fig. 2c, d). When the downstreamGFP was targeted, the Tx-CRISPRi
and the Tl-CRISPRi successfully down-regulated the expression ofGFP
(Fig. 2e, f). This result suggests that the Tl-CRISPRi could be harnessed
for a more speciﬁc knockdown of each cistron in the operon than the
conventional Tx-CRISPRi, which was also validated in tri-cistronic
reporter operon comprised ofGFP, nanoluciferase,a n dmCherry in
series (Supplementary Fig. 6). However, it should be noted that the Tl-
CRISPRi also showed some degree of polar effect. We reasoned that
the accelerated mRNA degradation due to the decoupled transcription
and translation could be responsible for the polar effect (Supple-
mentary Fig. 5). Since a similar polar effect from translation inhibition
was also observed in a previous study utilizing Hfq-sRNA
35,i ts h o u l db e
considered that some extent of the polar effect is unavoidable under
the translation-level gene knockdown. Nevertheless, the expression of
downstream genes was not signiﬁcantly turned off when Tl-CRISPRi
targeted the upstream gene.
Beyond the reporter genes, we next compared the Tl-CRISPRi with
Tx-CRISPRi by targeting the native operons ofE. coli,c o n s i s t i n go f
upstream non-essential genes and downstream essential genes, to
evaluate the inﬂuence of polar effect in bacterial growth. In the pre-
vious study, Tx-CRISPRi toward non-essential upstream genes in these
operons hampered bacterial growth owing to the polar effect
34.W e
anticipated that Tl-CRISPRi would less impede cellular growth when
targeting these genes due to the diminished polar effect (Fig.3a). Five
endogenous operons were selected for the proof of concept, and the
Tx-CRISPRi or the Tl-CRISPRi targeted upstream non-essential genes
(Fig. 3b). As expected, introducing the Tx-CRISPRi targeting upstream
non-essential genes caused remarkable growth retardation (Fig.3c). In
contrast, strains with the Tl-CRISPRi targeting the same genes exhib-
ited normal cellular growth (Fig.3d). When we quantiﬁed the mRNA
level of these genes, it was observed that the Tl-CRISPRi induced only a
moderate or weak decrease of mRNA level, which ranges from 40% to
70% compared to the non-target control strain (Supplementary
Fig. 7a). We speculated that this moderate decrease of mRNA con-
tributed to a less signiﬁcant polar effect in contrast to the Tx-CRISPRi.
Additionally, to verify that Tl-CRISPRi efﬁciently knocked down tar-
geted endogenous genes in the translation level, we fusednanoluci-
ferase with aﬂexible linker to the C-terminal region of the target gene
to measure the expression level. When the Tl-CRISPRi was adopted, the
luminescence level remarkably decreased compared to the non-
targeted control (Supplementary Fig. 7b), conﬁrming that Tl-CRISPRi
robustly and speciﬁcally knocked down the expression of these genes
while circumventing the polar effect. Overall, our Tl-CRISPRi system
could be exploited for the speciﬁc down-regulation of each cistron in
the synthetic and native bacterial operons, exerting diminished inter-
ference with the expression of neighboring genes in the same tran-
scription unit.

rather than ON/OFF control, especially for metabolic engineering

36– 40. We considered establishing an appropriate ﬁne-
tuning strategy for Tl-CRISPRi could be beneﬁcial to expand its usage.
Although modulating the expression level of dCas13 could be one way
of achieving dose-dependent gene knockdown41 (Supplementary
Fig. 2), the gene regulation dynamics could be inherently affected by
the promoter strength ofdCas13 or cell-to-cell variation of the indu-

difference between transcription-level control and translation-level control toward
polycistronic gene expression. If the dCas9 blocks the upstream gene in the
operon, all downstream genes are simultaneously turned off, called the polar

region was another strategy forﬁne-tuning the repression strength in
the Tx-CRISPRi43,44. However, estimating the activity of mismatched
guide RNA is complicated due to the differed tolerance of mismatch
position across the spacer, requiring massive experimental datasets
and modeling45. In our previous study, a library of sgRNA of dCas9
generated by mutating tetraloop andﬂanking regions yielded sgRNA
variants with diversiﬁed repression efﬁciencies39.T h i ss t u d ys u g g e s t e d
that modulating the efﬁciency of RNP complex formation by mutating
the handle sequence of the guide RNA could control the repression
efﬁciency of CRISPRi. In line with this approach, we explored whether
mutating the direct repeat (DR) sequences of the guide RNA, known to
be recognized by the Cas13 protein
29,46, could achieve tunable
expression of a target gene in the Tl-CRISPRi system (Fig.4a). From the
structure study, it was revealed that the stem distal from the spacer
and the terminal loop is solvent-exposed and does not interact with the
residues of Cas13d, while the stem proximal to the spacer and
nucleotides comprising theﬂanking sequences directly interact with
the Cas13d
29,46.B a s e do nt h e s eﬁndings, we selected potential sites of
mutations in the guide RNA handle by dividing it into three parts: stem,
bulge, andﬂanking sequence (Fig.4b). These parts were systematically
mutated, creating guide RNAs with diverse DR sequences. We applied
them to knock downmCherry and measured the relative expression
level derived from each mutated guide RNA (Fig.4a).
For the mutations in the stem of DR, disrupting base pairings
yielded plenty of attenuated guide RNAs inducing diverse expression
levels of mCherry (Supplementary Fig. 8a). However, replacing GC
base pairing into AU did not perturb the repression strength, albeit
increasing the minimum free energy of the stem-loop (Supplementary
Fig. 8b). When the length of the stem was varied from 4 bp to 9 bp,
shortening and extending the stem for more than 2 bp from the ori-
ginal DR signi ﬁcantly weakened the repression of mCherry
(Supplementary Fig. 8c). Considering that extending the stem duplex
helps to stabilize the RNA and increases the knockdown efﬁciency in
the case of antisense RNA
47, it was surprising that the stem longer than
8 bp strongly attenuated the knockdown ofmCherry compared to the
original DR. This suggests that the folding energy and the stability of
guide RNA itself is not the sole factor that affects the repression
strength of Tl-CRISPRi. Indeed, the minimum free energy of each stem-
mutated DR and the relative expression level of mCherry derived from
DR-mutated guide RNAs did not show a remarkable correlation (Sup-
plementary Fig. 9). Instead, we reasoned that the interaction between
DR of guide RNA and the residues of dCas13 would play an important
role determining the knockdown strength of Tl-CRISPRi, which should
be explored in further studies. Unlike the mutations on the stem,
modifying the bulge did not generate signiﬁcantly attenuated guide
RNAs, implying that these bases would not or weakly interact with the
residues of dCas13 (Supplementary Fig. 10). Substituting the base of
ﬂanking sequences adjacent to the stem (U25, G26) also generated
attenuated guide RNAs (Supplementary Fig. 11), suggesting that they
could be the potential targets for guide RNA attenuation. We obtained
51 different handle-mutated guide RNAs that can derive target gene
expression levels in a uniform distribution from 2.6% to 86.3% com-
pared to the non-target control (Fig.4c).
To investigate whether the mutated DR derives a similar relative
expression level across other genes, we targetedGFP and nanoluci-
ferase with the DR-mutated guide RNAs. The relative expression
derived from the same mutated DR showed strong positive correla-
tions across different reporter genes (Fig.4d). These results validate
that our tunable Tl-CRISPRi system could be adapted toﬁne-tune the
expression level of various genes inE. coli.W et h e na p p l i e do u rt u n a b l e

Fig. 3 | Diminished polar effect and growth retardation by the Tl-CRISPRi while
targeting the endogenous operons ofE. coli.a A diagram shows the difference
between the Tx-CRISPRi and the Tl-CRISPRi while targeting the operon of non-
essential genes and essential genes in series. Though the non-essential gene was
targeted, the polar effect causes Tx-CRISPRi to block the expression of downstream
essential genes, thus hindering bacterial growth. We speculated that the Tl-CRISPRi
would not cause growth retardation while targeting the same non-essential genes.

DR was used to target mCherry mRNA, the expression level of mCherry
decreased to 6.0%, showing that the Tl-CRISPRi could effectively
repress genes inV. natriegens(Fig. 4e). Furthermore, the guide RNAs
containing mutated DR sequences regulated the expression of
mCherry at various levels, with a positive correlation to that ofE. coli
(Fig. 4e). Our tunable Tl-CRISPRi system based on the engineered
guide RNAs has the potential to precisely down-regulate the gene
expression in other microbial systems beyondE. coliand V. natriegens.
Applying Tl-CRISPRi to optimize the metabolicﬂux
Optimizing the metabolicﬂux toward producing valuable compounds
by speciﬁc knockdown or knockout of genes is one of the common
approaches in metabolic engineering8,49. We examined whether the Tl-
CRISPRi could enhance metabolite production by adjusting the
endogenous gene expression level and, thus, intracellular metabolic
ﬂux. We selected the pathway converting malonyl-CoA into 3-HP
50,a
valuable industrial platform chemical51. This pathway is advantageous
in that the malonyl-CoA is a universal metabolic intermediate, which
allows the utilization of diverse carbon sources

the guide RNAs with the original DR sequence to ensure effective gene
repression and determine which gene target knockdown could
enhance the titer of 3-HP (Fig.5a).
Since this pathway consumes 2 moles of NADPH per 1 mol of
malonyl-CoA to produce 3-HP, we reasoned that targeting genes
related to the NADPH or malonyl-CoA pool could affect the biopro-
duction of 3-HP. Indeed, repressing genes comprising the fatty acid
synthesis cycle, a competitive pathway for consuming malonyl-CoA,
signiﬁcantly increased the 3-HP production (Fig.5b). The knockdown
of thefabI gene showed the most prominent increase of 3-HP titer up
to 1.87 g/L, which was 11.1-fold higher than the non-targeted strain
(0.17 g/L). This result could be attributed to the characteristics of the
enoyl-acyl carrier protein reductase encoded byfabI, which holds the
most crucial step for completing the fatty acid synthesis cycle

glycolysis, the knockdown ofaceE, pfkA,a n dpfkB enhanced the 3-HP
titer (Fig.5b). Atﬁrst, it seemed controversial that the knockdown of
aceE encoding one of the subunits of pyruvate dehydrogenase com-
plex (PDC) was bene ﬁcial for the 3-HP production since the

knockdown or knockout of PDC reduces theﬂux toward the acetyl-
CoA56,57. However, in one previous study, it was revealed that the
knockout of thelpdA gene encoding another component of PDC could
shift the carbonﬂux of glycolysis from the Embden– Meyerhof– Parnas
(EMP) pathway to the Entner– Doudoroff (ED) pathway or Pentose
Phosphate (PP) pathway, thereby increasing the intracellular level of
NADPH
58. The knockdown of thepfkA or pfkBgene would also enhance
the 3-HP titer by redirecting the carbonﬂux toward ED and PP
pathway59,60. Among the knockdown targets in amino acid biosynthesis
pathways, the knockdown of metB related to the generation of
methionine resulted in 3-HP titer enhancement (Fig.5b). We reasoned
that the knockdown ofmetB would increase the intracellular NADPH
pool since the synthesis of methionine consumes the most NADPH
molecule per one amino acid
61,62. In a comprehensive approach, we
employed combinatorial gene knockdown to investigate the collective
effect of these knockdown targets on enhancing 3-HP production
(Fig. 5c). However, the simultaneous knockdown offabI with other
genes did not increase the 3-HP titer against the single knockdown of
fabI. Repressing theaceE and fabZ showed combinatorial enhance-
ment of 3-HP production from 0.70 g/L and 0.80 g/L under the single
knockdown to 1.23 g/L under the double knockdown without causing
growth retardation.
Notably, the knockdown offabI signiﬁcantly decreased microbial
growth (Fig.5c, d). Although blocking the synthesis of fatty acid and
preserving the pool of malonyl-CoA was beneﬁcial for 3-HP produc-
tion, fully repressing this pathway could hamper microbial growth and
limit the optimal fermentation process
63. Therefore, we tried to adopt
the attenuated guide RNAs for the moderate repression of thefabI
gene and the optimal bioproduction of 3-HP. To implement diverse
knockdown strength on thefabI, we designed another spacer (fabI
spv2) targeting more upstream of thefabI mRNA than the original
spacer (fabI spv1) and adopted mutant DR sequences to both spacers,

yielding 16 different guide RNAs to repressfabI in total. We found that
the cellular growth gradually increased as the weaker DR sequence was
utilized in both spacers (Fig.5d). It was also noticeable that the optimal
DR sequence reaching a maximal 3-HP production differed in these
two spacers (S19 infabI spv2 and S10 infabI spv1). In total, the titer of
3-HP reached the maximum of 2.42 g/L when the guide RNA with S10
DR and fabI spv1 spacer was used, which was 14.2-fold improved
against the strain with non-target guide RNA (Fig.5d). However, the
titer of 3-HP was suddenly dropped as the weaker DR sequence was
adopted for both spacers. These results demonstrate that adjusting
the expression level offabI in a ﬁne-tuned manner for securing an
adequate amount of malonyl-CoA was critical for diminishing growth
retardation and achieving the optimal production of 3-HP. Since the
malonyl-CoA serves as a versatile precursor for the biosynthesis of
diverse value-added compounds such as polyphenols and
polyketides
64, we anticipate that our tunable Tl-CRISPRi system cap-
able of modulating the fatty acid synthesis could be further expanded
toward the production of these compounds.
Since all of these Tl-CRISPRi experiments on optimizing 3-HP
production were conducted based on the small-scale test tube culture
with a small amount of glucose (8 g/L), we investigated whether the
effect of the Tl-CRISPRi repression could be maintained for a larger
scale of culture and a higher concentration of carbon source. We
performed ﬂask-scale fed-batch culture using the best-regulated
strains from the Tl-CRISPRi screening, starting from 20 g/L of glu-
cose. We observed that the 3-HP titers were also remarkably increased
in these strains compared to the non-targeted strain, which was 16.4-
fold higher in strain with S10-fabI spv1 guide RNA (Supplementary
Fig. 12). This result suggests that our tunable Tl-CRISPRi could robustly
function and redirect the native metabolicﬂux of microbial cell
factories.
Discussion
Repurposing the CRISPR-Cas systemas a robust synthetic biology tool
has boosted genome engineering, metabolicﬂux redirection, and the
discovery of genotype-phenotype relationships in numerous microbial
systems
33,34,65. The innate programmability of the CRISPR-Cas system
allowsﬂexible targeting of genes and expansion of functions by fusing
diverse protein effectors6,66,67. The advent of dCas13 from the Type VI
CRISPR-Cas system holds new promise as a synthetic bacterial gene
regulation tool, as it speciﬁcally recognizes and binds to the RNA of
interest rather than the DNA-targeting dCas9 or dCas12
9,10,19.
In this study, we showed that detailed characterization of the Tl-
CRISPRi system with dose-dependent, speciﬁc, multiplexed gene
knockdown in translation level would accelerate the construction of a
dCas13-based genetic circuit. We observed that only the reporter
genes targeted by the guide RNAs were speciﬁcally knocked down in
multiplexed gene targeting, which suggests the high speciﬁcity of our
system. However, due to the difﬁculties in performing proteome
analysis, we could not inspect the genome-wide off-target perturba-
tions of translational inhibition under the application of Tl-CRISPRi.
Further investigation on proteome-level perturbation caused by Tl-
CRISPRi could suggest a detailed understanding of the off-target effect
and propose design rules of guide RNA to enhance speciﬁcity.
While targeting polycistronic operons, we also showed that Tl-
CRISPRi could overcome the polar effect and independently repress
the expression of each cistron in an operon, validated in the reporter
gene operons and native bacterial operons. The polar effect
caused by the Tx-CRISPRi is one of the obstacles to the accurate
identiﬁcation of the role of each gene in a polycistronic operon while
performing pooled genome-wide Tx-CRISPRi screening
34.W ea n t i c i -
pate that additional genome-wide Tl-CRISPRi screening could
reveal unprecedented information about the genotype-phenotype
relationships in bacterial cells not discovered in the Tx-CRISPRi-based
screening.
Based on the well-characterized Tl-CRISPRi system, we developed
a ﬁne-tuning strategy by engineering the handle structure of the guide
RNA and modulating the interaction between the guide RNA and
dCas13. Though we focused on the down-regulation of gene expres-
sion level, our attenuated guide RNAs might be applied to achieve
diverse magnitudes of gene activation if the dCas13 is fused with
translational activators
13. With the tunable Tl-CRISPRi system, we
achieved a 14.2-fold improvement of 3-HP production by precisely
redirecting metabolicﬂux without laborious genome engineering and
replacing genetic parts. Since ourﬁne-tuning strategy does not require
adjusting the expression level of the dCas13 or the guide RNA, we
expect that our tunable Tl-CRISPRi would help tune gene expression
and optimize the metabolic network in biological systems where the
usage of inducible gene expression systems or precisely characterized
genetic parts are limited
68. Also, targeting multiple pathways with
different down-regulation strengths by assembling multiple guide
RNAs with diverse mutant DR sequences could be applied to diversi-
fying the expression of genetic circuits and metabolicﬂux. Analyzing
the resulting bioproduction via machine learning could suggest fur-
ther design rules to guide RNAs and accelerate automated genetic
engineering to approach the optimum of the genetic circuit and
metabolicﬂux
69,70.
While we applied the tunable Tl-CRISPRi in two gram-negative
bacterial strains, detailed characterization on bacterial strains other
than E. colishould proceed to validate the expandability of our system
toward diverse strains. We believe that further investigation and
optimization could enable the usage of this tool in diverse bacterial
systems, including gram-positive bacteria, as other CRISPR-based tools
have been successfully adopted and widely utilized in diverse
strains
71,72.
To summarize, we developed a tunable Tl-CRISPRi system based
on the dCas13 and systematically engineered guide RNAs. We
demonstrated successful knockdown of target genes transcribed from
the chromosome and the plasmid, together with the sequence-
speciﬁcity and multiplexity of gene repression. We also highlighted
the uniqueness of Tl-CRISPRi versus Tx-CRISPRi in that it allows
context-independent regulation of each cistron in an operon. To
expand the scope of gene regulation, we established aﬁne-tuning
strategy for the Tl-CRISPRi by engineering the handle sequence of the
guide RNA. This tunable Tl-CRISPRi exhibited its usefulness for redir-
ecting the metabolicﬂux in aﬁne-tuned manner and optimizing the
bioproduction of a valuable compound, 3-HP. Further expansion of the
tunable Tl-CRISPRi to optimize the production of diverse metabolites
in non-model bacterial strains would expedite the engineering and
development of undomesticated microorganisms with versatile and
unique metabolic traits

coli K-12 MG1655 harboring pSIM573 plasmid was grown for 2 h at 30 °C
with shaking (250 revolutions per min (rpm)). It was shifted to 42 °C for
15 min to induce the expression of theλ-Red recombinases. After that,
the cells were centrifuged and washed to make electro-competent
cells. Four hundred microgram of DNA editing template containing
FRT-kanR-FRT and the reporter gene expression cassette was elec-
troporated into these cells for recombination. Thekan
R gene should be
removed from the chromosome for subsequent recombination of the
other reporter genes. To this end, the pCP20 plasmid was transformed
into recombinantE. coli,a n dt h eﬂippase was induced at 37 °C during
overnight culture to remove FRT-kan
R from the chromosome.
Construction of genetic components for the Tl-CRISPRi system
Mach-T1R cells were used for plasmid construction and cultured in LB
medium containing appropriate antibiotics. To construct the plasmids
with different dCas13 orthologs, the backbone plasmid containing aTc
inducible gene expression cassette was prepared by assembling two
PCR fragments. One fragment containingtetR, bidirectional P
tet pro-
moter, and the ribosome binding site of thedCas13gene was ampliﬁed
by tetR_BciVI_F and Ptet_RBS_GA_R. The other fragment containing the
rrnB T1 terminator was ampliﬁed by rrnBT1_RBS_F and rrnBT1_pA-
CYC_GA_R. These fragments were assembled into the pACYCDuet
backbone digested by BciVI and Bsu36I, yielding the pACYC_tetR
plasmid. SeveraldCas13 genes were incorporated between the ribo-

generating a catalytically dead version of BzCas13b and PbCas13b,
three separate PCR products, each containing alanine substitution
mutations in the catalytic residues of the HEPN domain, were assem-
bled and incorporated into the pACYC backbone using Gibson
assembly. The originalCas13or dCas13genes are ampliﬁed from p2CT-
His-MBP-Lbu_C2c2_R472 A_H477A_R1048A_H1053A (Addgene
#83485), pBzcas13b (Addgene #89898), pPbCas13b (Addgene
#89906), and pXR002: EF1a-dCasRx-2A-EGFP (Addgene #109050).
The precursor CRISPR-RNA (pre-crRNA) expression plasmid was
constructed based on pCDF_sgRNA-BsaI. To construct the LbuCas13a
crRNA expression plasmid, two different PCR fragments were pre-
pared; one is ampliﬁed by using SmR_BclI_F and crRNA_LbuCa-
s13a_DR1_R, and the other is ampliﬁed by using SmR_BclI_R and
crRNA_LbuCas13a_DR2_F. These two fragments were cut by BclI and
ligated, yielding pCDF_precrRNA(Lbu)-NT. The other pre-crRNA
expression cassettes were constructed similarly. For creating the vec-
tor containing a matured version of RfxCas13d guide RNA,
pCDF_sgRNA-BsaI was PCR ampli ﬁed with RfxCas13d_mature-
RNA_BsaI_F and RfxCas13d_matureRNA_BsaI_R and self-ligated. To add
a strong terminator downstream of mature guide RNA, the L3S2P21
terminator
74 was ampliﬁed by L3S2P21_Bsu36I_F and L3S2P21_AgeI_R
and inserted between the Bsu36I and AgeI sites of pCDF_RfxgRNA-NT.
Fragments harboring spacer sequences with appropriate 4-bp over-
hang were prepared by PNK treatment followed by oligo annealing,
and they were cloned into the pCDF_RfxgRNA-NT vector cut by BsaI.
For the effective targeting of dCas13, the spacer sequences were
rationally selected to form the least secondary structure inside itself
while targeting the translation initiation region spanning from the
Shine-Dalgarno sequence to the start codon of a target gene. The
spacer sequences used in this study are listed in Supplementary Data 3.
The pACYC plasmid harboring dRfxCas13d and constitutively
expressedmCherry was prepared from the pACYC_dRfx. ThemCherry
gene expression cassettes with four different constitutive promoters
were ampliﬁed by TJmT_pACYC_GA_F and mCherryRBS_J231XX_GA_R.
The PCR fragment harboring the L3S2P21 terminator was ampliﬁed by
TJmT_Pr_GA_F and L3S2P21_TJmT_GA_R. These two PCR fragments
were assembled with the backbone plasmid using Gibson assembly
and cloned into the downstream oftetR gene. The plasmids carrying
dRfxCas13d, mCherry, and the guide RNA, which was utilized for the
validation of tunable Tl-CRISPRi inV. natriegens, were prepared from
the pACYC_dRfx_P
J23100_mCherry. The guide RNA expression cassette
was ampliﬁed from pCDF-RfxgRNA vectors harboring the guide RNA of
interest by L3S2P21_pACYC_GA_R and UPJ23119_TJmT_GA_F and was
assembled into the pACYC_dRfx_P
J23100_mCherry digested by BamHI.
The mutated DR sequences of attenuated guide RNAs were
altered by site-directed mutagenesis. For example, the pCDF_RfxgRNA-
mCherry sp1 was PCR ampliﬁed using PJ23119_DRvariant (S01– F18)_R
containing the mutant DR sequence, and mChsp1_invPCR_F, followed
by PNK treatment and self-ligation by Quick Ligase. Other attenuated
guide RNAs with different spacer sequences were prepared using the
corresponding primers for each spacer and the mutated DR. The
mutated DR sequences used in this study are listed in Supplemen-
tary Data 3.
The pET_Ptac-mcr for the IPTG-inducible expression of themcr
gene inE. coliW was prepared by the following steps. The functionally
enhanced mutantmcr gene
75 encoding MCRN940V/K1106W/S1114R was ampli-
ﬁed from pET-mcr* plasmid52 with the Ptac_EcoNI_F and mcr_AvrII_R.
This PCR fragment was digested by EcoNI and AvrII and ligated into

Measuring relative expression levels of reporter genes and the
speciﬁcg r o w t hr a t e si nE. coli
All culture experiments measuringﬂuorescence or luminescence inE.
coli were performed using an LB medium containing appropriate
antibiotics (34μg/mL for chloramphenicol and 50μg/mL for specti-
nomycin). The overnight inoculum from a single colony was diluted 1/
100 into the fresh media with 100 ng/mL of aTc except in the experi-
ment of Supplementary Fig. 2, which was performed by varying the

shaking, 100μL of culture was sampled and washed with the PBS
buffer, and the ﬂuorescence was detected using a Hidex Sense
microplate reader (Hidex). The luminescence from nanoluciferase was
generated using the Nano-Glo® Luciferase Assay System from Promega
and was detected by Hidex. For dilution, the nanoluciferase buffer,
PBS, cell culture, and the nanoluciferase substrate were mixed with a
ratio of 50:40:10:1. OD
600 was measured from culture broth using the
Jenway 7300 spectrophotometer. The relative expression was deter-
mined by dividing ﬂuorescence or luminescence units into OD600
values and setting the value for the non-target control strain as 100%.
For measuring the maximum speciﬁc growth rate ofE. coliunder dif-
ferent conditions, the overnight culture of each colony was refreshed
into a ratio of 1:100 with 100 ng/mL of aTc and loaded on the 96-well
microplate, which was incubated at 37 °C with 600 rpm shaking using a
Hidex. The maximum speciﬁc growth rate was quantiﬁed from linear
regression of logarithmic OD
600 during the exponential phase. The
OD600 data of time points between 1 h and 3 h after refreshing the
culture were used to calculate speciﬁc growth rates, except for the
experiment of Fig.5,w h i c hu s e dt h ed a t ao f2– 4 h after refreshing.
Analyzing protein expression by western blotting and coo-
massie blue staining
To analyze the expression of four different dCas13 orthologs, the 6x
His-tag was inserted at the N-terminal of each dCas13 protein by site-
directed mutagenesis using Lb, Bz, Pb, Rfx_NHis(6x)_F and dCas13_N-
His(6x)_R. The NHis-dCas13 plasmid and the cognate guide RNA plas-
mid expressing pre-crRNA targeting mCherry mRNA were transformed
into EcM-mCherry cells. Culture conditions were the same for mea-
suring the ﬂuorescence of mCherry. After 8 h of induction, cells
reached the density of 1.8 OD
600 were collected by centrifugation and
resuspended into a 300μLv o l u m eo fe i t h e rl y s i sb u f f e r( 1 0 0 m M

(Invitrogen) for 1 h and destained with deionized water overnight. For
the visualization of His-tagged dCas13, western blotting was per-
formed using the invitrolon PVDF/ﬁlter paper sandwiches (Invitrogen),
6×-His tag monoclonal antibody (eBioscience), anti-mouse IgG (whole
molecule)-alkaline phosphatase antibody produced in goat (Sigma)
and 1-step™ NBT/BCIP substrate solution (Thermo) following the
instruction of manufacturers. The 6×-His tag monoclonal antibody was

Measuring relative expression levels of mCherry inV. natriegens
All culture experiments measuringﬂuorescence inV. natriegenswere
performed using an LBv2 medium (LB medium supplemented with
11.9 g/L of NaCl, 2.2 g/L of MgCl2, and 0.31 g/L of KCl) containing
appropriate antibiotics (10μg/mL for chloramphenicol). The over-
night inoculum from a single colony was diluted to the OD600 of 0.05
into the fresh media with 100 ng/mL of aTc. After incubating for 18 h at
30 °C with 250 rpm shaking, 100μL of culture was sampled and
washed with the PBS buffer, and theﬂuorescence was detected using a
Hidex Sense microplate reader (Hidex). OD
600 was measured from
culture broth using the Jenway 7300 spectrophotometer. The relative
expression was determined by dividing relativeﬂuorescence units into
OD
600 and setting the value for the non-target control strain as 100%.
RNA extraction and one-step reverse transcription and
quantitative PCR
The relative amount of mRNA of mCherry, GFP, and nanoluci-
ferase was determined by real-time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR).
The total RNA of each strain was prepared from the cell culture by
t h es a m ec o n d i t i o na p p l i e df o rﬂuorescence and luminescence
measurements. The RNeasy Plus Mini Kit (Qiagen) was used for
RNA extraction, and the on-column DNase treatment was fol-
lowed by the RNase-free DNase set (Qiagen). The concentration of
the total RNA sample was measured by NanoDrop One (Thermo
Scientiﬁc), and the extraction quality was veriﬁed using DNA 5K/
RNA/CZE24 LabChip (PerkinEl mer) on a LabChip GX Touch 24
(PerkinElmer). The one-step reverse transcription and quantita-
tive PCR were performed using Luna® Universal one-step RT-
qPCR kit (New England Biolabs) and StepOnePlus real-time PCR
system (Applied Biosystems). 180 ng of total RNA sample was
used for 10μL of qPCR mixture. The oligonucleotide primers used
for the RT-qPCR experiment are listed in Supplementary Data 2.
Three reference genes, cysG, idnT,a n dhcaT, were combinato-
rially used as internal standards of RT-qPCR experiments

Measuring knockdown efﬁciencies of endogenous operons ofE.
coli by the Tl-CRISPRi
The strains harboring thenanoluciferase-fused endogenous gene were
prepared using pCas_CDF for scar-less recombination78.A f t e ro v e r -
night culture and refreshing, theE. coliK-12 MG1655 strain harboring
pCas_CDF was grown for 2 h at 30 °C with 0.2% arabinose to induce the
expression ofλ-Red recombinases. The cells were washed with distilled
deionized water for making electro-competent cells and electro-
porated with 200 ng of the appropriate pCDF_sgRNA and 600 ng of
dsDNA editing template. After checking successful recombination and
detecting the activity of luciferase, subsequent curing of the pCDF
plasmid was performed by culturing in LB with 50μg/mL of kanamycin
and 200μM of IPTG at 30 °C. pCas_CDF was cured by culturing in LB at
37 °C. Subsequently, pACYC_dRfx and pCDF plasmid containing
appropriate guide RNA were electroporated for the Tl-CRISPRi
experiment. The time point of sampling was 6 h after refreshing the
culture and induction of the dCas13. The luminescence was generated
using the Nano-Glo® Luciferase Assay System from Promega and was
detected by Hidex. The nanoluciferase buffer, PBS, cell culture, and the
nanoluciferase substrate were mixed with a ratio of 50:40:10:1.
Analysis of 3-HP production inE. coliW
We transformed pACYC_dRfx, pCDF_RfxgRNAs with the effective
spacer, and pET_Ptac-mcr in theE. coliW (ATCC 9637) cell. The cell
culture and 3-HP production was performed in modiﬁed M9 media
(8 g/L of glucose, 2 g/L of NaCl, 2 g/L of NH4Cl, 10.7 g/L of K2HPO4,
5.2 g/L of KH2PO4, 0.5 g/L of MgSO47H20, and 1 g/L of yeast extract)
containing appropriate antibiotics (34μg/mL for chloramphenicol,
50 μg/mL for spectinomycin, and 75μg/mL for ampicillin), at 37 °C
with 250 rpm shaking. For the experiments in Fig.5, we conducted the

overnight culture was diluted at an OD600 of 0.05 and induced with
100 ng/mL of aTc for the expression of dCas13. Subsequently, when
the OD
600 of the culture was reached at 0.8, 20μM of IPTG was added
to induce themcr gene. After 24 h of shaking incubation, the culture
broth was centrifuged, and the supernatant was sampled to measure
the concentration of 3-HP. The fed-batch fermentations in Supple-
mentary Fig. 12 were performed in the 25 mL of culture volume in the
250 mL bafﬂed ﬂask and a 20 g/L initial concentration of glucose. The
overall scheme of fermentation was the same with the test tube culture
except for the concentration of IPTG, which was 200μMi nt h ef e d -
batch fermentation. The HPLC analysis for the samples was performed
by a 1260 Inﬁnity II LC system (Agilent) equipped with a Hi-Plex-H
column (Agilent). Theﬂow rate, mobile phase, and column tempera-
ture were 0.6 mL/min, 5 mM of H
