Abstract 
Background: Cyanobacterial carbohydrates, such as sucrose, have been considered as potential renewable feed-
stock to support the production of fuels and chemicals. However, the separation and purification processes of these 
carbohydrates will increase the production cost of chemicals. Co-culture fermentation has been proposed as an 
efficient and economical way to utilize these cyanobacterial carbohydrates. However, studies on the application of 
co-culture systems to achieve green biosynthesis of platform chemicals are still rare.
Results: In this study, we successfully achieved one-step conversion of sucrose derived from cyanobacteria to fine 
chemicals by constructing a microbial consortium consisting of the fast-growing cyanobacterium Synechococcus 
elongatus UTEX 2973 and Escherichia coli to sequentially produce sucrose and then the platform chemical 3-hydroxy-
propionic acid (3-HP) from  CO
2 under photoautotrophic growth conditions. First, efforts were made to overexpress 
the sucrose permease-coding gene cscB under the strong promoter Pcpc560 in S. elongatus UTEX 2973 for efficient 
sucrose secretion. Second, the sucrose catabolic pathway and malonyl-CoA-dependent 3-HP biosynthetic pathway 
were introduced into E. coli BL21 (DE3) for heterologous biosynthesis of 3-HP from sucrose. By optimizing the cultiva-
tion temperature from 37 to 30 °C, a stable artificial consortium system was constructed with the capability of produc-
ing 3-HP at up to 68.29 mg/L directly from  CO
2. In addition, cell growth of S. elongatus UTEX 2973 in the consortium 
was enhanced, probably due to the quick quenching of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the system by E. coli, which 
in turn improved the photosynthesis of cyanobacteria.
Conclusion: The study demonstrated the feasibility of the one-step conversion of sucrose to fine chemicals using an 
artificial consortium system. The study also confirmed that heterotrophic bacteria could promote the cell growth of 
cyanobacteria by relieving oxidative stress in this microbial consortium, which further suggests the potential value of 
this system for future industrial applications.

have recently attracted significant attention as envi -
ronmentally friendly and sustainable “microbial cell 
factories” for the production of biofuels and valuable 
chemicals directly from  CO
2 [1]. In addition, cyanobac -
teria have also been considered as a means of producing 
carbohydrate feedstocks to support industrial fermenta
-
tive processes [2]. Moreover, it has been reported that 
several cyanobacterial species are capable of synthesiz
-
ing and secreting sucrose as an osmolyte under appro -
priate environmental stimuli, such as osmotic pressure 
[3], and this production can be sustained over long time 
periods and at higher levels than that from plant-based 
feedstocks such as sugarcane and beet [4, 5]. As sucrose 
is an easily fermentable feedstock for many microorgan
-
isms [6, 7], significant efforts have been made to improve 
the production of extracellular sucrose in cyanobacteria 
[8]. For example, Du et al. achieved sucrose productivity 
at 1.43 mg/L/h in wild-type Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 
under 600 mM NaCl stress in a bioreactor and doubled 
the productivity to 3.13 mg/L/h by co-overexpressing key 
genes related to sucrose synthesis, namely, sps  (slr0045), 
spp (slr0953) and ugp  (slr0207), and deleting the gluco
-
sylglycerol phosphate synthase gene ggpS  (sll1566) [9]. In 
another study, Ducat et al. integrated a cscB gene encod -
ing sucrose permease from Escherichia coli W [10, 11] 
into the Synechococcus elongatus PCC 7942 genome 
and silenced the carbon competition pathway by knock
-
ing out the invertase inv A and ADP-glucose pyrophos -
phorylase glgC to achieve sucrose secretion at a rate of 
36.1 mg/L/h [12]. Recently, the fast-growing cyanobacte -
rium Synechococcus elongatus UTEX 2973 (hereafter S. 
elongatus UTEX 2973) with a growth rate similar to that 
of yeast was identified [13], and an extracellular sucrose 
productivity of 35.5  mg/L/h was demonstrated in an 
engineered S. elongatus UTEX 2973 carrying the sucrose 
transporter cscB in a bioreactor experiment [14]. Sucrose 
productivity was further increased to 79.2  mg/L/h 
through upregulation of sps,  which encodes a sucrose-
phosphate synthase enzyme, and sucrose synthesis genes 
in S. elongatus UTEX 2973 [15]. In addition to the high 
rate of sucrose secretion and growth, this strain exhibits 
high tolerance to high-temperature (41 °C) and high-light 
(500  μmol photons∙m
−2∙s−1) conditions, suggesting sig -
nificant advantages for outdoor cultivation in the future 
[13]. However, as purification of sucrose from culture 
supernatant is costly and the system is easily contami
-
nated when sucrose is produced at a large scale [16], 
alternative ways of utilizing sucrose produced by cyano
-
bacteria need to be developed for potential biotechno -
logical applications.
In nature, microorganisms typically live and interact 
with other microbes by establishing a stable interchange 
of substances in complex communities [17, 18]. Inspired 
by the commonly found symbiotic relationships of vari
-
ous microbes in nature, studies have been conducted to 
simulate symbiotic systems by designing artificial routes 
for the interchange of substances [19, 20]. Very recently, 
Ducat et  al. constructed a co-culture system with the 
cyanobacterium S. elongatus PCC 7942 and the hetero
-
trophic bacterium Halomonas boliviensis, in which the 
growth of H. boliviensis was supported by sucrose pro
-
duced by S. elongatus PCC 7942 [21], and Li et  al. con -
structed a co-culture system consisting of the sucrose 
secretory cyanobacterium S. elongatus PCC 7942 and 
three different yeasts to mimic lichen and research the 
interaction between the autotrophic and heterotrophic 
strains [22]. Although these studies have established new 
alternatives for the utilization of sucrose derived from 
cyanobacteria, the use of co-culture systems to achieve 
one-step conversion of sucrose to fine chemicals is still 
rare [23]. In addition, compared with axenic cultures of 
cyanobacteria, autotrophic–heterotrophic symbiotic sys
-
tems have been found to resist contamination effectively 
and exhibit good robustness in fluctuating environments 
[24, 25].
3-Hydroxypropionic acid (3-HP ,  C
3H6O3), as an impor-
tant platform chemical, is widely used for the production 
of many chemicals, such as acrylic acid, malonic acid and 
biodegradable plastic poly-3-hydroxypropionic acid, and 
can also be used as a food additive or preservative [26]. 
As chemical synthesis of 3-HP causes severe environ
-
mental pollution [27], biosynthesis of 3-HP has attracted 
significant attention recently. Several 3-HP biosynthetic 
pathways have been reported, and at least four substrates 
have been used to produce 3-HP , including β-alanine 
[28], lactate [29], malonyl-CoA [30] and glycerol [31]. 
Among these pathways, the malonyl-CoA-dependent 
pathway, which employs acetyl-CoA carboxylase to con
-
vert the precursor acetyl-CoA to malonyl-CoA and mal -
onyl-CoA reductase to convert malonyl-CoA to 3-HP 
[32, 33], was reported to have some distinct advantages 
over other pathways, such as a broad feedstock spectrum, 
thermodynamic feasibility, and redox neutrality [34]. 
To date, the malonyl-CoA-dependent pathway has been 
engineered in E. coli [35], Saccharomyces cerevisiae [36], 
Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 [37] and S. elongatus PCC 
7942 [38] for both heterotrophic and photoautotrophic 
production of 3-HP [35]. However, until now, no study 
about the biosynthesis of 3-HP by a co-culture system 
has been reported.
In this study, we reported the construction of an arti
-
ficial consortium system consisting of the fast-growing 
cyanobacterium S. elongatus UTEX 2973 and an engi
-
neered E. coli BL21(DE3) to produce 3-HP under pho -
toautotrophic conditions. In the consortium system, E. 
coli BL21(DE3) was genetically modified to synthesize

3-HP using sucrose produced by the engineered S. elon -
gatus UTEX 2973 (Fig.  1). With the application of this 
co-culture system, the final yield of 3-HP was approxi -
mately 68.29 mg/L, which is comparable to that obtained 
in E. coli when only malonyl-CoA reductase was over -
expressed [30]. In addition to the relationship where S. 
elongatus provides sucrose as a carbon source for growth 
and 3-HP production in E. coli, the study also found that 
increased expression of reactive oxygen species (ROS)-
quenching genes in E. coli may promote cyanobacterial 
growth by relieving oxidative stress in the environment.
Results
Growth of S. elongatus cscB+ 2973 and sucrose secretion
Synechococcus elongatus UTEX 2973 was engineered 
to secrete sucrose by expressing the sucrose permease-
encoding gene cscB (ECW_m2594) under the strong pro
-
moter Pcpc560. Sucrose secretion from S. elongatus cscB + 
2973 is mainly dependent upon the pH and NaCl concen-
tration of the medium, and an alkaline environment was 
previously reported to be beneficial for sucrose secretion 
from cyanobacterial cells [39]. We used an alkaline envi
-
ronment (pH ≈ 8.3) with 150 mM NaCl (37 °C) to ensure 
the production and secretion of sucrose from S. elonga -
tus cscB+ 2973 [14, 22]. The sucrose yield and the growth 
of S. elongatus cscB + 2973 in different culture media are 
compared in Fig.  2. The results showed that no sucrose 
was produced from S. elongatus cscB + 2973 cells with -
out NaCl in the culture medium. However, sustainable 
production and secretion of sucrose could be observed 
for 6 days when 150  mM NaCl was added, and titers 
of 612.0  mg/L and 576.5  mg/L sucrose were achieved 
when S. elongatus cscB
+ 2973 was grown in BG-11 and 
CoBG-11, respectively. To maintain the growth of E. coli 
in co-culture medium, the effect of different salt con -
centrations on cell growth was also examined (Addi -
tional file  1: Fig. S1), and the results showed that E. coli 
was able to grow normally under the tested range of salt 
concentrations. In this study, a sucrose titer of 576.5–
612.0 mg/L (4.00–4.25 mg/L/h) was achieved by S. elon
-
gatus cscB + 2973 cells over 6 days, which is comparable 
to the levels observed in similar studies conducted previ -
ously (Table  1). For example, although no  CO2 aeration 
occurred during S. elongatus cultivation, sucrose secre -
tion in this study was still higher than the 2.2  mg/L/h 
value reported in a previous study [22].
Growth of an engineered E. coli mutant in co‑culture 
medium
To ensure that E. coli BL21 utilizes sucrose as the sole 
carbon source, we cloned and expressed the essential 
genes for sucrose metabolism, namely, cscB ( ECW_
m2594), cscK ( ECW_m2595) and cscA ( ECW_m2596), 
into E. coli BL21 to generate an engineered strain, E. 
coli cscN. In addition, to synthesize 3-HP , the malo
-
nyl-CoA reductase-coding gene mcr ( Caur_2614) was 
introduced into E. coli cscN, resulting in the engineered 
strain E. coli ABKm. A growth comparison of these two 
strains is shown in Additional file  2: Fig. S2. As shown, 
under the same conditions, the final cell density of cscN 
without the mcr gene was slightly increased. In a pre
-
vious study, an artificial consortium was constructed 
by inoculating a heterotrophic bacterium into a S. 
elongatus PCC 7942 culture with  OD
750 = 0.5 [25]. In 
our study, the sucrose yield of S. elongatus cscB + 2973 
was ~ 200  mg/L when the cells reached  OD750 = 0.5. 
Therefore, we selected four concentrations, namely, 
50, 100, 150, and 200 mg/L, to examine whether E. coli

support E. coli growth and synthesis of 3-HP under photoautotrophic growth conditions (F6P , fructose 6-phosphate; 3-HP , 3-hydroxypropionic acid)

ABKm could be stably maintained in the system using 
these levels of sucrose as the sole carbon source in M9 
and CoBG-11 media (Fig.  3a, b). The growth of E. coli  
ABKm could be detected under 100, 150, and 200 mg/L 
sucrose. A previous study showed that the E. coli Δ cscR 
strain required a minimal sucrose concentration of 
1.2 g/L for growth [25], which is much higher than our 
result for strain ABKm, suggesting that after expression 
of cscA, cscB and cscK, the efficiency of sucrose utiliza
-
tion might have improved in strain ABKm [25, 40]. To 
demonstrate that this effect was not caused by a strain-
specific difference, the sucrose utilization pathway was 
also engineered into E. coli MG1655 and BW25113, and 
a similar result was observed (data not shown). Addi
-
tionally, we also determined the 3-HP yield in strain 
ABKm with the different concentrations of sucrose 
mentioned above (i.e., 50–200 mg/L) in CoBG-11, and 
the results showed that strain ABKm was able to pro
-
duce 3-HP under all the concentrations except 50 mg/L 
sucrose (Fig. 3 c).
Establishing a stable artificial consortium to produce 3‑HP
Since the optimal growth temperature for both E. coli 
and S. elongatus UTEX 2973 is 37 °C, we initially set this 
as the incubation temperature for the co-culture system. 
However, the analysis showed that E. coli strain ABKm 
grew poorly after 1–2 days in this system compared with 
the growth observed in a previous study [25] (Additional 
file 3: Fig. S3). According to the data (Fig.  2d), at 37 °C, S. 
elongatus cscB
+ 2973 cells produce a sufficient amount of 
sucrose, which prompted us to hypothesize that the rapid 
cell growth of E. coli and utilization of sucrose destroy 
the balance of the two species in this system. To con
-
firm this hypothesis, we determined the rates of sucrose 
secretion and sucrose utilization in S. elongatus UTEX 
2973 and E. coli, respectively. The results showed that the 
sucrose utilization rate of E. coli strain ABKm increased 
gradually with increasing initial sucrose concentration, 
reaching ~ 4.20  mg/L/h at an initial sucrose concentra
-
tion of 200 mg/L with growth at 37 °C for 48 h (Fig.  4b). 
Although the sucrose secretion rate of S. elongatus cscB + 
could reach ~ 4.11  mg/L/h, we speculated that with the

accumulation of E. coli biomass, the sucrose consump -
tion rate of ABKm could be faster than the sucrose secre-
tion rate of S. elongatus cscB + at 37  °C. Therefore, the 
“production–consumption” balance was disrupted, lead -
ing to collapse of the consortium. These results led us to 
adjust the cultivation temperature from 37  °C to 30  °C, 
aiming to slow down the consumption of E. coli and 
achieve balanced growth of S. elongatus UTEX 2973 and 
E. coli in the system. The growth of strain ABKm at 30 °C 
was then observed (Fig.  4a), and the sucrose utilization 
rate of this strain was determined to be ~ 2.00 mg/L/h at 
30 °C at 48 h (Fig.  4b). Interestingly, there was no signifi
-
cant difference between 37 °C and 30 °C in terms of cell 
growth and sucrose production of the S. elongatus cscB
+ 
2973 strain (Fig.  4c, d). As a result, the artificial con -
sortium with S. elongatus cscB + 2973 and E. coli strain 
ABKm was successfully constructed and could be main -
tained stably for at least 7 days at 30 °C (Fig. 4e).
To evaluate the production capacity of the artifi -
cial consortium, the 3-HP yield of E. coli strain ABKm 
was analyzed. As shown in Fig.  5a, 3-HP production 
reached ~ 68.29 mg/L in 7 days. In parallel, we also deter
-
mined 3-HP production in E. coli strain ABKm under 
pure culture conditions with continuous supplementation 
of sucrose according to the calculated sucrose secretion 
rate of S. elongatus cscB
+ 2973 (Fig.  5b), and the results 
showed that the 3-HP yield under pure conditions was 
at the same level. In addition, we also observed that S. 
elongatus cscB
+ 2973 cultivated in the consortium grew 
better than the cells cultivated in pure culture conditions 
(Fig. 6a), consistent with previous findings [25]. In addi
-
tion, the results showed that almost no free sucrose could 
be detected in the co-culture medium, suggesting that 
sucrose produced by the cyanobacterium was completely 
consumed by the E. coli ABKm strain to support cell 
growth and accumulate the desired product (Additional 
file 4: Fig. S4) [25].
Effect of oxidative stress on cyanobacteria in an artificial 
consortium system
ROS are common byproducts of aerobic metabolic 
processes, such as photoreactions and respiration, in 
oxygenic photosynthetic organisms [41], and ROS accu
-
mulation could cause oxidative damage to cyanobacte -
rial cells. In addition, previous studies have found that 
organic buffers in culture media may also contribute to 
the generation of  H
2O2 [42]. For example, 1 ~ 10  mM 
4-(2-hydroxyethyl)1-piperazineethanesulfonic acid

(HEPES) in culture medium could produce enough 
 H2O2 to kill Prochlorococcus [43]. Since there was also 
organic buffer (TES) used to maintain pH in our study, 
to clarify whether this organic buffer generates  H
2O2, we 
determined the titer of  H2O2 in blank CoBG-11 under 
the same culture conditions. The results showed that no 
 H
2O2 was detected in blank culture medium, suggesting 
that the  H2O2 in culture medium was mostly synthesized 
from living cells. Next, we examined the impact of E. coli 
co-cultivation on the  H
2O2 level, and the results showed 
that the  H2O2 content was significantly reduced when the 
heterotrophic partner of E. coli was included in the sys -
tem (Fig.  6b), which is consistent with a previous study 
[22].
To further understand this phenomenon at the molecu-
lar level, the expression levels of several  H2O2-quenching 
genes in the E. coli ABKm strain under pure and co-
culture conditions were comparatively analyzed by qRT-
PCR (Additional file  5: Table S1). It is well known that E. 
coli contains three types of catalases: hydroperoxidase 
I (HPI) (katG), hydroperoxidase II (HPII) (katF), and 
hydroperoxidase III (HPIII) (katE) [44–46]. In addition, 
the synthesis of HPII often increases markedly when 
cells enter the stationary phase [47, 48]. The transcrip
-
tional expression of these three genes was determined. 
As shown in Fig.  7, the relative expression levels of katG, 
katF and katE in the E. coli ABKm strain were dramati -
cally upregulated under co-culture conditions compared 
with those in CoBG-11 under continuous supplementa
-
tion with sucrose according to the calculated sucrose 
secretion rate of S. elongatus cscB
+ 2973, suggesting that 
E. coli might be able to remove ROS when co-cultivated 
with cyanobacterial partners and thus possibly alleviate 
the overall oxidative stress in the consortium system.
Discussion
Photosynthetic cyanobacteria have been considered an 
important alternative for providing sustainable feed
-
stock, and cyanobacterial carbohydrates have been 
considered a potential renewable feedstock to sup
-
port the production of fuels and chemicals. However, 
since axenic cultures of cyanobacteria are vulnerable 
to contamination [49] and it is expensive to separate 
and purify these products from culture medium [50], 
their application is limited. To address these issues, 
the use of synthetic consortia of cyanobacteria paired 
with specific heterotrophic partners has been pro
-
posed. The fast-growing S. elongatus UTEX 2973 strain 
reported recently exhibits high tolerance to high-tem -
perature and high-light conditions [13]. In this study,

we reported the construction of an artificial co-cul -
ture system utilizing S. elongatus UTEX 2973 and E. 
coli BL21 to produce the heterologous chemical 3-HP 
directly from  CO2. In addition, analysis of the mecha -
nism underlying the co-culture systems also provided a 
fundamental basis for further optimization of artificial 
consortium systems via metabolic engineering.

and obtained the sucrose-secreting strain S. elongatus 
cscB
+ 2973 with a productivity of 612.0 mg/L BG-11 in 6 
days. To construct an artificial consortium using sucrose 
as the sole carbon source, the sucrose utilization abil
-
ity of E. coli was also improved. It was previously shown 
that sucrose utilization could be endowed in the Pseu
-
domonas putida cscAB strain by introducing the cscA and 
cscB genes from E. coli W [23]. To achieve the growth 
of E. coli BL21 in the designed co-culture system, genes 
related to sucrose utilization, namely, cscA, cscB and cscK, 
were introduced [53]. The results showed that this engi
-
neering strategy enabled E. coli strain ABKm to grow 
on sucrose as the sole carbon source (Fig.  3). A previous 
study reported that E. coli ΔcscR strain required a mini
-
mal sucrose concentration of 1.2 g/L for growth, which is 
much higher than the concentration required by ABKm 
here, suggesting that this engineering strategy signifi
-
cantly improved the efficiency of sucrose utilization [40].
It was previously reported that ROS accumulation in 
the culture medium severely inhibited axenic growth of 
cyanobacteria; however, this effect was efficiently allevi
-
ated through co-culture with Rhodotorula glutinis [22]. 
We also observed improved growth of S. elongatus UTEX

2973 in the co-culture system (Fig. 6a). The  H2O2 content 
in the consortium system was found to be lower than that 
in the axenic culture, suggesting that E. coli might con -
tribute to the alleviation of ROS stress and thus promote 
the growth of cyanobacteria in the artificial consortium, 
which was further confirmed by the upregulation of ROS 
quenching-related genes in E. coli strain ABKm (Fig.  7). 
In addition, to confirm our hypothesis, we also tested the 
influence of  H
2O2 on the cell growth of axenic cyanobac -
terial cultures, and the results showed that the addition 
of 10 μM  H
2O2 significantly decreased cell growth (Addi-
tional file 6: Fig. S5). The upregulation of ROS quenching 
capability could be important, as ROS may deleteriously 
affect cellular metabolic processes, such as nutrient bio
-
availability, photosynthesis and carbon flux, in plants 
[54]. With the decreased  H
2O2 content and increased 
cell growth of S. elongatus UTEX 2973, we also evaluated 
the expression levels of several genes involved in photo
-
synthesis, including the carbon dioxide-concentrating 
mechanism protein-coding gene ccmM [55], ribulose-
1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (RuBisCO)-
coding gene rbcL [56], PSII-related subunit-coding genes 
cp43 and cp47, PSI essential subunits of reaction center-
coding genes psaA and psaB [57], and chlorophyll a 
synthesis-related genes chlaA and pcrA [58] (Additional 
file 5: Table S1); as expected, all these genes were upregu
-
lated (Additional file  7: Fig. S6). Several studies have also 
reported that heterotrophic partners can provide the nec-
essary inorganic carbon by decomposing organic matter 
and growth factors such as vitamin  B
12 to cyanobacteria 
in the natural and artificial consortium [18, 59, 60], which 
we will also analyze in future work. Further analysis of 
the interactions in the consortium could provide the nec
-
essary theoretical basis for the potential application of 
artificial co-culture systems in many areas, such as con
-
trolling blooms [61], degradation of pollutants [62–64], 
and soil remediation [65–67]. For example, Fedeson 
et  al. created an artificial consortium composed of two 
bacterial species (S. elongatus PCC 7942 and P. putida) 
that enables the degradation of the industrially produced 
environmental pollutant 2,4-DNT while simultaneously 
producing polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHA) bioplastic [68].
Our study also provided some insights into the poten
-
tial relationships between the two species. The first layer 
of interaction is that the cyanobacterium provides the 
carbon source for the E. coli strain, and the engineered 
E. coli strain consumes this carbon source to grow and 
produce fine chemicals. Interestingly, we also found that 
the cell growth of the cyanobacterium was somewhat 
improved in the co-culture system. By taking a close look 
at the changes in the factors involved in determining 
cell growth, we found that E. coli may help quench ROS, 
which in turn promotes the growth of cyanobacteria, 
which is considered the second layer of interaction 
between these two species. Collectively, we concluded 
that the relationship between these two species in the co-
culture system is mutualistic.
Although several previous studies have demonstrated 
promising characteristics of co-culture systems [21, 
25], our work showed their new application: first, the 
final product was different. Unlike polyhydroxybutyrate 
(PHB), 3-HP is a heterologous compound, and our study 
provides proof of the concept that the production of het
-
erologous fine chemicals can be achieved in co-culture 
systems by rational design. Second, S. elongatus UTEX 
2973 exhibits high tolerance to high-light conditions 
compared with other model cyanobacterial species, such 
as S. elongatus PCC 7942, which means that the robust
-
ness of our system may be improved. Furthermore, 
compared with traditional “two-stage” fermentation, 
this “one-step” strategy also has several unique advan
-
tages. Besides the issue of bacterial contamination as the 
excess sugar in the system is consumed by heterotrophic 
partners [21], the “two-stage” culture strategy typically 
requires two steps to obtain the chemical production: 
obtaining the supernatant of the cyanobacterial, and then 
inoculating the E. coli strain to achieve cell growth and 
chemical production, which can greatly increase the pro
-
duction cost.
Although the artificial consortium system was suc -
cessfully established and the desired product was 
obtained in this study, there remain many aspects that 
need to be improved in the future, such as the yield of 
3-HP . To increase the yield of the target product, on the 
one hand, we could enhance the supply of the carbon 
source. In addition to silencing the competing consump
-
tion pathway [12], Qiao et al. reported that sucrose yield 
in S. elongatus PCC 7942 can be enhanced from 6.5 to 
8.0  mg/L/h by overexpressing sucrose-phosphate syn
-
thase (sps ) and glucose-1-phosphate adenylyltransferase 
(glgC) at the same time [69]. The research also suggested 
that glycogen could serve as a supporting rather than a 
competitive carbon pool for sucrose synthesis. In addi
-
tion, Weiss et al. used alginate to encapsulate S. elonga -
tus and enhanced the sucrose yield rates ~ twofold within 
66 h [21]. On the other hand, heterotrophic partners also 
need to be improved. Chelladurai et al. developed a vari
-
ety of recombinant E. coli strains by expressing the het -
erologous gene mcr and overexpressing the endogenous 
acetyl-CoA carboxylase and biotinidase-encoding genes 
accADBCb and nicotinamide nucleotide transhydroge
-
nase-encoding gene pntAB, which converts NADH to 
NADPH in E. coli. In addition, several deletion mutations 
in phosphotransacetylase (pta) acetate kinase (ackA) 
and lactate dehydrogenase (ldhA) or the α-ketoglutarate 
dehydrogenase complex (sucAB) were carried out 
Page 10 of 14Zhang et al. Biotechnol Biofuels           (2020) 13:82 
with the recombinant strains. The final 3-HP titer was 
enhanced approximately threefold from 0.71 to 2.14 mM 
[30]. Moreover, Cheng et  al. reported the overexpres
-
sion of heterogeneous acetyl-CoA carboxylase (from 
Corynebacterium glutamicum) and codon-optimized 
mcr in E. coli BL21; three types of modified E. coli strains 
with different host–vector systems were constructed and 
investigated, and the results showed that the combina
-
tion of E. coli BL21 and pET28a was the most efficient 
host–vector system for 3-HP production. The concentra
-
tion of 3-HP was enhanced from 0.68 g/L to 1.80 g/L in 
shake flask cultivation [70]. These studies provide valu
-
able guidance for further metabolic engineering in E. coli.
Conclusion
With defined composition and controllable functions, 
synthetic consortia hold great promise for diverse value-
added production, bioenergy and environmental appli
-
cations. In this study, we demonstrated the feasibility of 
constructing an artificial consortium to achieve the one-
step conversion of sucrose to the platform chemical 3-HP 
directly from  CO
2. With the application of this co-culture 
system, the final production of 3-HP was approximately 
68.29 mg/L, which is comparable to that in E. coli when 
only malonyl-CoA reductase was overexpressed. Mean
-
while, this study also confirmed that in this microbial 
consortium, heterotrophic bacteria could promote the 
cell growth of cyanobacteria by relieving oxidative stress, 
which further demonstrates the potential value of this 
system for the green biosynthesis of chemicals in the 
future.
Materials and methods
Strains, plasmid construction and culture conditions
Synechococcus elongatus UTEX 2973 and E. coli 
BL21(DE3) were engineered and applied to the construc
-
tion of the artificial consortium system. The essential 
genes for sucrose metabolism, namely, the permease-
coding gene cscB, invertase-coding gene cscA and fruc
-
tokinase-coding gene cscK, were derived from E. coli W 
[53], while the malonyl-CoA reductase gene mcr was 
from Chloroflexus aurantiacus [71]. The super-strong 
promoter P
cpc560 was used to direct gene expression in S. 
elongatus UTEX 2973 [72]. All plasmids were prepared 
in E. coli DH5α. The sucrose hydrolysis system was inte
-
grated into pET-30a in E. coli with kanamycin resistance, 
and mcr was integrated into pACYC184 under the con
-
stitutive promoter P J23100 in E. coli with spectinomycin 
resistance.
Synechococcus elongatus UTEX 2973 and the resulting 
engineered strains were cultivated in BG-11 medium (pH 
7.5) under a light intensity of approximately 100  μmol 
photons  m
−2s−1 in an illuminating shaking incubator 
(HNYC-202T, Honour, Tianjin, China) at 130  rpm and 
37  °C or on BG-11 agar plates in an incubator (SPX-
250B-G, Boxun, Shanghai, China) [73]. To maintain the 
stable phenotype of sucrose secretion, appropriate anti
-
biotics were added when necessary. E. coli strains were 
grown on LB medium or agar plates with appropriate 
antibiotics added to maintain plasmids at 37 °C in a shak
-
ing incubator (HNY-100B, Honour, Tianjin, China) at 
200 rpm or in an incubator, respectively. All strains used 
in this study are listed in Table 2.

Conjugation of S. elongatus UTEX 2973
Constructs were delivered into S. elongatus UTEX 2973 
through conjugation [74]. E. coli HB101 harboring 
pRL443 and pRL623 (named “helper”) and E. coli DH5α 
harboring the plasmid with the target gene were culti
-
vated overnight and then transferred separately into fresh 
liquid LB medium with the appropriate antibiotics at a 
1:50 ratio. When both strains grew to exponential phase 
 (OD
600 = 0.3–0.5), 10  mL of the cells of each strain was 
collected by centrifugation and washed with fresh LB 
medium three times to remove all the antibiotics. Then, 
0.1  mL of fresh LB was used to resuspend each strain, 
and the cells were mixed together and incubated at 
37 °C for 30 min. During this time, 10 mL of S. elongatus 
UTEX 2973 cells at exponential phase  (OD
750 ≈ 1) was 
collected by centrifugation and resuspended in 0.2  mL 
of fresh BG-11 medium. S. elongatus UTEX 2973 cells 
were mixed with the E. coli mixture mentioned above 
and incubated at 37 °C under light for 30 min. Then, the 
mixture was spread on BG-11 agar plates, which were 
then covered by sterile cellulose filters (0.45  μm pore 
size). The plates were incubated under light at an inten
-
sity of approximately 100 μmol photons  m−2s−1 for 24 h, 
and then, the cellulose filters were transferred onto new 
BG-11 agar plates with appropriate antibiotics [75].
Construction of the artificial consortium system
Co-culture medium (named CoBG-11) was designed 
based on BG-11 medium and optimized for E. coli 
growth by supplementing with 150  mM NaCl, 4  mM 
 NH
4Cl and 3  g/L 2-[[1,3-dihydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl) 
propan-2-yl] amino] ethanesulfonic acid (TES). The pH 
value was adjusted with NaOH to 8.3. NaCl and  NH
4Cl 
were used to maintain the cell survival of E. coli, and 
NaCl was used as a stress inducer for sucrose accumula
-
tion in S. elongatus UTEX 2973.
Before the two strains were cultivated together, S. elon -
gatus UTEX 2973 was propagated in BG-11 at 37  °C 
with appropriate antibiotics to the exponential phase 
 (OD
750 ≈ 1.0), collected by centrifugation, inoculated into 
25 mL of CoBG-11 medium and grown at 30 °C for 48 h 
to an  OD
750 of 0.5. E. coli was incubated in CoBG-11 with 
1 g/L sucrose for 48 h and then collected by centrifuga -
tion, resuspended in deionized water and inoculated into 
the 25-mL S. elongatus culture described above at an ini
-
tial  OD600 of 0.01.
Quantification of cyanobacteria and E. coli
For pure cultures of S. elongatus UTEX 2973 and E. coli, 
cell density was measured at  OD750 and  OD600, respec -
tively, using a UV-1750 spectrophotometer (Shimadzu, 
Kyoto, Japan). For co-culture, serial dilutions were made, 
and solid LB agar plates were used to determine E. coli 
viability and cell number by counting colony-forming 
units (CFU) after 24  h of incubation at 37  °C. The cell 
number of S. elongatus UTEX 2973 was determined by 
a hemocytometer under a microscope (BX43, Olympus, 
Shinjuku, Tokyo, Japan).
Determination of extracellular sucrose content
Supernatants of pure S. elongatus UTEX 2973 cultures 
were collected and analyzed for sucrose content via a 
colorimetric glucose–sucrose assay (Megazyme, Ireland) 
that employs high-purity glucose oxidase, peroxidase and 
β-fructosidase (invertase). At pH 4.6, sucrose is hydro
-
lysed by invertase to d-glucose and d-fructose, and then, 
the free d-glucose content is determined by conversion 
to a red-colored quinoneimine dye compound through 
the action of glucose oxidase and peroxidase at pH 7.4 
and employing p-hydroxybenzoic acid and 4-aminoanti
-
pyrine. Measurements were conducted at 510 nm.
Quantification of 3‑HP
The 3-HP concentration was quantified according to 
a previously described method [37]. A 3-HP standard 
of analytical purity was purchased from Tokyo Chemi
-
cal Industry (Tokyo, Japan). The supernatant contain -
ing 3-HP was collected from the co-culture medium by 
centrifuging at 12,000  rpm for 2  min at room tempera
-
ture (Eppendorf 5430R, Hamburg, Germany) and used 
for 3-HP analysis. Sample derivatization was carried out 
according to the two-stage technique described previ
-
ously [76]. GC–MS analysis was conducted on a GC–MS 
system-GC 7890 coupled to an MSD 5975 (Agilent Tech
-
nologies, Inc., Santa Clara, CA) equipped with an HP-
5MS capillary column (30 mm × 250 mm id).
Quantitative real‑time RT‑PCR analysis
Approximately 4 × 106 pure or co-cultured S. elonga -
tus UTEX 2973 cells were collected by centrifugation at 
12,000  rpm and 4  °C for 1  min. The supernatant was 
removed, and the cells were used for RNA extraction and 
RT-qPCR analysis using methods described previously 
[77]. The relative abundance of different mRNA mole
-
cules could be estimated using  2−ΔΔCT [78].
Analysis of  H2O2 concentration
The  H2O2 content in the supernatant was analyzed using 
the  H2O2 Quantitative Assay Kit (Sangon Biotech, Shang-
hai, China). In the reaction,  Fe2+ is oxidized to  Fe3+ by 
 H2O2 when the pH is less than 7.0, and then, the gener -
ated  Fe3+ combines with dye molecules to form a claret-
colored  Fe3+–dye complex with a maximum absorption 
wavelength of 560  nm or 595  nm, and the absorption 
value is directly proportional to the concentration of 
 H
2O2 in cells.
