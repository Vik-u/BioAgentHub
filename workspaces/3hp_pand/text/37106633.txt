Abstract: Poly(3-hydroxybutyrate-co-3-hydroxypropionate) [P(3HB-co-3HP)] is a biodegradable and
biocompatible polyester with improved and expanded material properties compared with poly(3-
hydroxybutyrate) (PHB). This study engineered a robust malonyl-CoA pathway in Cupriavidus
necator for the efﬁcient supply of a 3HP monomer, and could achieve the production of [P(3HB-co-
3HP)] from variable oil substrates. Flask level experiments followed by product puriﬁcation and
characterization found the optimal fermentation condition (soybean oil as carbon source, 0.5 g/L
arabinose as induction level) in general consideration of the PHA content, PHA titer and 3HP molar
fraction. A 5 L fed-batch fermentation (72 h) further increased the dry cell weight (DCW) to 6.08 g/L,
the titer of [P(3HB-co-3HP)] to 3.11 g/L and the 3HP molar fraction to 32.25%. Further improving the
3HP molar fraction by increasing arabinose induction failed as the engineered malonyl-CoA pathway
was not properly expressed under the high-level induction condition. With several promising
advantages (broader range of economic oil substrates, no need for expensive supplementations such
as alanine and VB12), this study indicated a candidate route for the industrial level production of
[P(3HB-co-3HP)]. For future prospects, further studies are needed to further improve the strain and
the fermentation process and expand the range of relative products.

1. Introduction
With the exhaustion of fossil resources and environmental issues with regards to
petro-derived durable polyesters, polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAS) and other biodegradable
polyesters have attracted interest as renewable substitutes [1]. One of the representative
PHAs is poly(3-hydroxybutyrate) (P3HB) [2], which can be naturally produced by many
microorganisms. Cupriavidus necator H16 (also called Ralstonia eutropha H16) is one of
the commercial strains in P3HB production, which can efﬁciently produce intracellular
P3HB [3] from oil substrates. The full genome study of Cupriavidus necator H16 revealed
its efﬁcient P3HB pathway, mainly including 3-ketothiolase (PhaA), NADPH-dependent
acetoacetyl-CoA reductase (PhaB) and PHA synthase (PhaC) [3].
Due to the high crystallinity and brittleness, P3HB has limitations in the polyester
market and hundreds of copolymer derivatives of P3HB have been developed to improve
the material’s properties [4–6]. For example, the addition of 3-hydroxypropionate (3HP)
monomer in poly(3-hydroxybutyrate-co-3-hydroxypropionate) (P(3HB-co-3HP)) will im-
prove the thermal property, stiffness, malleability and tensile strength compared with the

properties of P3HB [7]. Differently to 3HB, biosynthetic pathways (pduP pathway, malonyl-
CoA pathway, β-alanine pathway) of 3HP do not exist in natural strains, thus feeding 3HP
or the precursors of 3HP (1,5-pentanediol and β-alanine) during the fermentation process
in the general strategy for the microbial production of P(3HB-co-3HP) [8–11].
A pioneering study attempted the de novo biosynthesis of P(3HB-co-3HP) from
different carbon sources. For example, the pduP pathway was engineered in Escherichia coli
for P(3HB-co-3HP) production from glycerol [12]. Another study further engineered the
pduP pathway in E. coli to produce P(3HB-co-3HP) from glucose [13]. However, the major
bottleneck of the pduP pathway is that vitamin B12 is required to maintain the function of
glycerol dehydratase. The malonyl-CoA pathway was also engineered in C. necator for the
de novo production of P(3HB-co-3HP) from fructose or alkanoic acids; however, due to the
low efﬁciency of malonyl-CoA reductase under a mild temperature, the content of 3HP
monomer was quite low (around 2% mol of 3HP) in P(3HB-co-3HP) [14], indicating the low
efﬁciency of the natural malonyl-CoA pathway in the engineered strains.
Therefore, it is essential to further research and optimize the de novo biosynthesis of
P(3HB-co-3HP) from a broader range of carbon sources by using the malonyl-CoA pathway.
In this study, a modiﬁed full malonyl-CoA pathway was engineered inC. necator for the
de novo biosynthesis of P(3HB-co-3HP) from three oil substrates. In addition, this study
researched the effects of induction level (arabinose) on the production of P(3HB-co-3HP),
aiming to regulate the content of 3HP in polyester products.
2. Materials and Methods
2.1. Strains and Plasmids
Detailed information of strains and plasmids used in this study is summarized in
Table 1. Three genes of key enzymes ( pct, propionate CoA-transferase; mcr (1–549), N-
terminal of malonyl-CoA reductase; mcr (550–1219), C-terminal of malonyl-CoA reductase;
acc ADBC, ATP-dependent acyl-CoA synthetase) were cloned from donor plasmids into
backbone vector pBBR1MCS-2 by several steps (Figure 1); in addition, the arabinose operon
(ara C-PBAD) was cloned from E. coli BL21 genome into backbone vector to gain the ﬁnal
expression vector pBBR-ara-pct-mcr-acc ADBC. The detailed cloning process is summarized
in Figure 1 and the primer information is summarized in Table 2.
The pBBR-ara-pct-mcr-acc ADBC was ﬁrstly transformed into E. coli S17 before its
conjugational transfer into the chassis strain C. necator H16 to gain C. necator ZL1 for PHA
production. During cloning, transformation and conjugation process, E. coli strains were
cultivated at 37 ◦C in Luria–Bertani (LB) broth (10 g/L peptone, 5 g/L yeast extract and
10 g/L NaCl) unless speciﬁed; C. necator strains were cultivated in a nutrient-rich Tryptic
Soy Broth (TSB), which contains 17 g/L peptone, 3 g/L soy peptone, 5 g/L NaCl, 2.5 g/L
K2HPO4. Kanamycin (50 µg/mL for E. coli strains and 150 µg/mL for C. necator strains) or
gentamicin (10 µg/mL for C. necator strains) were added in the medium when necessary.
2.2. P(3HB-co-3HP) Fermentation and Puriﬁcation
To obtain ﬁrst seed culture, a single colony ofC. necator ZL1 was inoculated into 10 mL
of TSB medium in a 50 mL centrifuge tube supplemented with 150 µg/mL kanamycin and
10 µg/mL gentamicin at 220 rpm for 24 h at 30 ◦C. Under inoculation-to-ﬂask volume ratio
of 1/20, the second seed culture was inoculated into 100 mL of TSB medium in a 200 mL
shake ﬂask with kanamycin and gentamicin at 220 rpm for 16 h at 30 ◦C.

was ended for product extraction and characterization.

For fed-batch level fermentation, 100 mL second seed culture was inoculated in 2 L MS
medium with kanamycin and gentamicin in a 5 L bioreactor (Bailun Inc., Shanghai China).
Total 15 g/L (fed rate round 0.3 g/L/h) marketing soybean oil (Wilmar Inc., Great World
City, Singapore) was fed during fermentation process (72 h). The fermentation process
was operated under the following conditions: temperature 30 ◦C, pH was controlled at
7.0 ± 0.1 by automatic addition of 5 mol/L KOH, the aeration rate was controlled at one
vvm, and dissolved oxygen (DO) level was maintained at 20 ± 1% by adjusting the stirring
rate. The PHA production was induced by the addition of 0.5 g/L arabinose at 12 h after
inoculation. At 72 h after inoculation, the fermentation was ended for product extraction
and characterization.
After fermentation, the broth was centrifuged at 12,000 rpm for 20 min at 4 ◦C. The
collecting cells were washed by ethanol once and then by distilled water twice before
lyophilization. Polyester products were extracted from the lyophilized cells with hot
chloroform in a Soxhlet apparatus and ﬁltered with a PTFE membrane ﬁlter to remove the
cell debris and ﬁnally puriﬁed by reprecipitation with ice-cold ethanol [17].

2.3. Analytical and Statistical Methods
Cell densities of the cultures were determined by measuring optical density at 600 nm
using a spectrophotometer. Cell density samples were diluted as necessary so as to fall
within the linear range. DCW (dry cell weight, g/L) of each sample was recorded af-
ter lyophilization. PHA wt% (weight percentage of PHA product towards DCW) was
calculated after PHA extraction.
The polyester product was qualitatively detected by 1H NMR analysis (Bruker AM-
500 MHz NMR spectrometer) in CDCl 3 solution. Molecular weight (Mw) of polyester
product was determined via gel permeation chromatography (GPC), with dichloromethane
as moving phase at a ﬂow rate of 0.35 mL/min, and 1.0 mg/mL of polyester solution was
applied for GPC analysis [18]. PHA molar fraction and composition of each sample was
roughly estimated via the comparison of the proton peak areas of featured polymer units by
1H NMR [9], and then accurately determined by gas chromatography [19,20]. During GC
analysis, sulfuric acid–methanol solution was applied for the methanolysis of sample. A
total of 15 mg of sample or standards (3HP or 3HB) was dissolved in methanolysis solution
(1.7 mL methanol, 0.3 mL sulfuric acid and 2 mL chloroform) and heated at 100 ◦C for
150 min. After methanolysis, 1 mL distilled water was mixed to cool the sample to room
temperature and 0.5 µL of organic layer was transferred for GC assay (SHMADZU GC-2010
Pro gas chromatograph equipped with an InertCap 1 capillary column and FID). The
program was set at 80 ◦C for 1 min, 15 ◦C/min to 160 ◦C, at 160 ◦C for 3 min, 10 ◦C/min
to 180 ◦C, and at 180 ◦C for 5 min. The temperatures of injector and detector were held
at 230 ◦C and 250 ◦C, respectively. N 2 was used as the carrier gas at the ﬂow rate of
30 mL/min.
The shown data are means of three repeated fermentations together with their standard
deviation. The signiﬁcance of differences between mean values of samples was compared
by Student’st-test. Differences at p < 0.05 were considered obvious and those at p < 0.01
were considered signiﬁcant.

3. Results and Discussion
3.1. Engineering the Fragmentized MCR in C. necator Promoted P(3HB-co-3HP) Production in
Mild Condition
As shown in Figure 2, a full malonyl-CoA pathway was successfully engineered
in C. necator ZL1 for P(3HB- co-3HP) production. Compared with the natural malonyl-
CoA pathway [21,22], C. necator ZL1 utilized an engineered malonyl-CoA reductase (MCR),
which was derived from the N- and C-terminal of natural MCR [16]. In 3HP production, the
fragmentized MCR presented a higher efﬁciency in the mild condition (around 30 ◦C) than
the natural MCR, which preferred a higher temperature (57–59 ◦C) [16,23]. In this study,
the advantage of fragmentized MCR in P(3HB- co-3HP) production was also approved.
The increased incorporation of 3HP into P(3HB- co-3HP) was conﬁrmed by qualitative
NMR analysis (Figure 3) and a quantitative GC assay in ﬂask fermentation by C. necator
ZL1 under 30 ◦C; the mol% of 3HP in the copolymer can reach 20–30% (Table 3), which is
signiﬁcantly higher than in the previous study that utilized natural MCR and only produced
a copolymer with 2% (mol%) of 3HP [14]. Other than MCR, propionate CoA-transferase
(PCT) is another important enzyme to generate 3HP-CoA before the polymerization of
P(3HB-co-3HP) (Figure 2). An evolved PCT (V193A, from Clostridium propionicum) has
previously conﬁrmed its activities in the biosynthesis of PLA (poly-lactic acid) [ 15], and
its CoA-transferase activity towards the 3HP substrate was conﬁrmed in this study. PHA
synthase is the last key enzyme in the biosynthesis of P(3HB-co-3HP) (Figure 2). This study
did not overexpress any heterologous PHA synthase and conﬁrmed that natural PHA
synthase in the chassis strain can effectively polymerize both 3HP-CoA and 3HB-CoA.

However, when a larger amount of inducer (1.0 and 2.0 g/L of arabinose) was added 
to further promote the prod uction of 3HP, the whole malonyl-CoA pathway was de-
pressed in C. necator ZL1. The incorporation of 3HP was almost absent in the high-level 
induction groups (Table 3). Although arabinose can be utilized as a non-cytotoxic inducer 
for C. necator strains [24], it was demonstrated in this study that over-induction by a large 
dosage of arabinose had side-effects on the expression of the malonyl-CoA pathway. The 
detailed mechanism towards the inhibited malonyl-CoA pathway was unclear. It is spec-
ulated that one or several overexpressed enzymes in the malonyl-CoA pathway may have 
lost their activities for 3HP biosynthesis. 
As indicated by a recent study [11], other candidate strategies should be tested to 
further improve the 3HP molar fraction in P(3HB-co-3HP): (1) the supplementation of cys-

resonance of the C5 methylene group in the 3HP monomer was detected at 4.70 ppm, conﬁrming
that the 3HP unit was polymerized to produce P(3HB-co-3HP). The resonance of the C4 methylene
group in the 3HP unit (2.40 ppm) was detected near the resonance of the C1 methylene group in 3HB
(2.50 ppm).

However, when a larger amount of inducer (1.0 and 2.0 g/L of arabinose) was added
to further promote the production of 3HP , the whole malonyl-CoA pathway was depressed
in C. necator ZL1. The incorporation of 3HP was almost absent in the high-level induction
groups (Table 3). Although arabinose can be utilized as a non-cytotoxic inducer for C.
necator strains [24], it was demonstrated in this study that over-induction by a large dosage
of arabinose had side-effects on the expression of the malonyl-CoA pathway. The detailed
mechanism towards the inhibited malonyl-CoA pathway was unclear. It is speculated that
one or several overexpressed enzymes in the malonyl-CoA pathway may have lost their
activities for 3HP biosynthesis.
As indicated by a recent study [11], other candidate strategies should be tested to fur-
ther improve the 3HP molar fraction in P(3HB-co-3HP): (1) the supplementation of cysteine
(increase CoA supply); (2) the suppression of the 3HB pathway (by interrupting genes
towards 3HB-CoA biosynthesis); (3) and the utilization of 3HP favored PHA synthases.

3.2. Production of P(3HB-co-3HP) from Variable Oil Substrates
Another advantage of the malonyl-CoA pathway in PHA production is that it can
theoretically utilize any carbon source. Earlier studies have produced P(3HB-co-3HP) from
variable carbon sources such as gluconate/alanine [11], glycerol [12], fructose and soybean
oil (only trace 3HP incorporation in the copolymer) [14]. This study further conﬁrmed that
multiple oil substrates can be utilized as sole carbon sources in P(3HB-co-3HP) production
(Table 3). From oil substrates, hydrolyzed fatty acids and glycerol can be converted to
acetyl-CoA for the 3HB and 3HP pathway (Figure 2). C. necator strains have a strong ability
to hydrolyze oil substrates, as indicated in an earlier study [25].
In comparing the effects of oil substrates on the production of P(3HB- co-3HP), the
group of olive oil had the best cell growth (Table 3), which was slightly higher than that
of the soybean oil group (p > 0.05) and obviously higher than that of the palm oil group
(p < 0.05). However, in consideration of the titer of P(3HB-co-3HP), the soybean oil group
had the highest titer, which was obviously higher than that of the olive oil group (p < 0.05)
and signiﬁcantly higher than that of the palm oil group (p < 0.01). The high PHA content
(around 60%, Table 3) majorly contributed to the high titer of the soybean oil group. These
results indicate that a broader range of oil substrates can be utilized for P(3HB-co-3HP)
fermentation, and are similar to the results of studies in being able to produce PHA from
oil substrate by C. necator strains [25].
3.3. Fed-Batch Production of P(3HB-co-3HP)
Of all the ﬂask level studies (Table 3), the soybean oil group with 0.5 g/L arabinose
induction exhibited better performance in the general consideration of the PHA content,
PHA titer and 3HP molar fraction. Thus, this condition was chosen to cultivate C. necator
ZL1 in a bioreactor to further investigate the scale-up results.
The fed-batch fermentation signiﬁcantly improved the cell growth and titer (CDW
reached 6.08 g/L, titer reached 3.11 g/L at 72 h) compared with ﬂask level fermentation
(p < 0.01, Table 3). The 3HP molar fraction reached 32.25%, which was slightly higher than
that of ﬂask level fermentation (27.57%), but the difference was not obvious (p > 0.05). The
molecular weight of fed-batch-level-produced P(3HB-co-3HP) was detected by GPC. The
results showed that the Mw (weight-average molecular weight) reached 201,105 (Da), the
Mn (number-average molecular weight) reached 105,845 (Da), and the Mw/Mn (molecular
weight dispersion index, denotes the molecular weight distribution width of the polymer)
was calculated as 1.9.
The comparison of current P(3HB-co-3HP) studies is summarized in Table 4. Com-
pared with the engineered E. coli strains, C. necator strains have the advantage of utilizing a
broader range of substrates, as approved in this study in that multiple oil substrates can
be utilized as sole carbon sources for P(3HB-co-3HP) fermentation. Among all the studies
utilizing C. necator strains, this study showed the best titer and a reasonable 3HP molar
fraction. Another advantage of the proposed method in this study comes from the efﬁcient
malonyl-CoA pathway: no speciﬁc supplementation (alanine by β-alanine pathway; VB12
by pduP) is needed, thus reducing the cost for industrial applications. The disadvantage of
the proposed method is that the 3HP molar fraction cannot be regulated and increased, and
this demands further studies to engineer a more robust and under-regulation malonyl-CoA
pathway in the chassis strain.
However, the bioreactor-scale fermentation in this study did not present a satisfactory
biomass (maximum 6.08 g/L). One of the main bottlenecks was that the oil substrate
was evenly fed during the fermentation process and the substrate’s concentration was
not properly maintained to further improve the biomass accumulation. Only three oil
substrates and several induction levels were tested in this study, and further systematic
process optimization and improvement are required to achieve satisfactory cell growth and
P(3HB-co-3HP) production.

4. Concluding Remarks and Future Prospects
By engineering a more efﬁcient malonyl-CoA pathway in C. necator, this study solved
the bottleneck question from a pioneering study [14] in that natural MCR presented low
efﬁciency at a mild temperature (around 30 ◦C). Due to the increased efﬁciency of the
malonyl-CoA pathway to supply 3HP , the 3HP molar fraction in P(3HB- co-3HP) was
signiﬁcantly increased (to 20–30 mol%) compared with the pioneering study [14]. However,
when a higher induction level of arabinose was added in this study, the 3HP molar fraction
was signiﬁcantly decreased, indicating that the engineered malonyl-CoA pathway was
not properly expressed in the high-induction condition. Compared with the β-alanine
and pduP pathway [10–12], which achieved the production of P(3HB-co-3HP) with a high
molar fraction (to 90 mol%), the malonyl-CoA pathway should be further investigated to
improve its performance in the production of HP containing polyester.
In addition, this study conﬁrmed that oil substrates can be utilized as a sole carbon
source in P(3HB-co-3HP) production through the malonyl-CoA pathway. The utilization
of oil substrates is normally seen in industrial PHA production by C. necator strains [25],
and the production of P(3HB-co-3HP) from oil substrates is cost-effective as no additional
supplementation is demanded, as seen in the production of P(3HB-co-3HP) through the β-
alanine and pduP pathway [10–12]. The low-cost method of this study provided candidate
techniques for tentative industrial applications.
Although the production of P(3HB-co-3HP) by C. necator through the malonyl-CoA
pathway has several advantages (broader carbon source, no expensive supplementation
such as alanine and VB12), the strain and process demand further optimization in future
studies: (1) testing a broader range of substrates in P(3HB- co-3HP), such as waste or
recycled cooking oil; (2) developing the metabolic engineering to gain adjustable metabolic
ﬂux towards 3HB and 3HP (to regulate 3HP molar fraction); (3) the expanding of product
streamlines by C. necator through the malonyl-CoA pathway, such as P3HP (natural 3HB
ﬂux should be depleted) and other copolymers containing the 3HP monomer; and (4) the
development of a high-density fermentation process to improve the titer and reduce the
unit cost.
