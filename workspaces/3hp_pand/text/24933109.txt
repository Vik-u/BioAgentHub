ABSTRACT: Herein we report a study combining metab-
olomics and mass isotopomer analysis used for investigation of
the biochemical fate of γ-hydroxybutyric acid (GHB). Using
various
13C incorporation labeling patterns into GHB, we have
discovered that GHB is catabolized by previously unknown
processes that include (i) directβ-oxidation to acetyl-CoA and
glycolate, (ii) α-oxidation to 3-hydroxypropionyl-CoA and
formate, and (iii) cleavage of C-4 to yield 3-hydroxypropionate
and CO
2. We further utilized the unique attributes of our
labeling patterns and the resultant isotopomers to quantitate
relative ﬂux down the identiﬁed pathways.
γ-Hydroxybutyric acid (GHB) is a ubiquitous molecule in vivo,
derived both endogenously (from the metabolism of the
neurotransmitter γ-aminobutyric acid, GABA)
1,2 and exoge-
nously in the form of a drug of abuse or prescription
medication (sodium oxybate). 3 Recently, we reported two
novel catabolic pathways, which act in parallel to eﬀectively
recycle 4-hydroxyacids to the fundamental cellular building
blocks of acetyl-CoA, propionyl-CoA, and formate.
4,5 The
hallmark of these newly discovered pathways involves the
phosphorylation and subsequent isomerization of 4-hydrox-
yacyl-CoAs to molecules that can readily be catabolized viaβ-
oxidation. An interesting caveat of this work was that GHB did
not generally proceed down the identiﬁed pathways. Rather, 4-
phosphobutyryl-CoA is found in very low concentration and
generally undergoes further β-oxidation processes to form
smaller cellular building blocks such as acetyl-CoA.
An analysis of the literature reveals only one deﬁned pathway
for the catabolism of GHB in vivo comprising its conversion to
succinic semialdehyde and subsequent oxidation to succinate,
an intermediate of the citric acid cycle.
6,7 However, during our
investigations we discovered that this anaplerosis,8,9 which is
deﬁned as the contribution of GHB to the catalytic
intermediates of the citric acid cycle, represented only 8% of
the steady-state fate of GHB. To develop a more thorough
understanding of GHB metabolism, we initiated a compre-
hensive metabolomics study using the chemical synthesis of
diﬀerent GHB isotopomers and rat liver perfusion that enabled
us to show that in addition to the metabolic fates described
above, GHB is also catabolized by processes that include (i)
direct β-oxidation resulting in acetyl-CoA and glycolate, (ii)
production of 3-hydroxypropionyl-CoA and formate via anα-
oxidation step, and (iii) cleavage of C-4 via an as of yet
undetermined mechanism to yield 3-hydroxypropionate and
carbon dioxide (Figure 1).
10 Although these ﬁndings represent
a major step forward in understanding the fate(s) of GHB in
vivo, a central question still remained as to the relative
contributions of the various pathways to the ultimate fate of
GHB.
In the present work, we have developed a series of analytical
tools that allow for a quantitative analysis of the steady state
metabolic fates for GHB. The relevance of these tools and
studies herein are multifaceted but can be clearly illustrated by a
rare inborn error in metabolism whereby individuals who lack
the ability to convert GHB to succinic semialdehyde (succinic
semialdehyde dehydrogenase de ﬁciency or GHB aciduria)
present clinically with developmental delay, mental retardation,
and seizure.
11,12 This combined with the greatly expanded use
of GHB clinically illustrate the relevance of de ﬁning a
comprehensive understanding of the fate(s) of this molecules.
As stated above, we have established thatβ-oxidation andα-
oxidation processes play critical roles in GHB metabolism.10
While β-oxidation reactions have been extensively studied for
diﬀerent biological transformations, little is known about α-
oxidation processes. Fatty acid α-oxidations are generally
characterized by identifying the labeled formate or formyl-
CoA production from the carboxy terminal, but the observation
of
13C-labeled formate (M1 formate) is not su ﬃcient to
conclude that the putative α-oxidation occurs as M1 formate
may arise from oxidation of glycine, serine, glycolate, and 3-
phospho-glycerate if these compounds become
13C-labeled
from the labeled parent molecules.13 One of the goals of the
current study was to develop a simple and sensitive method to
deﬁne α-oxidation via precursor-to-product relationships and

measure its rate versus the competitive β-oxidation step for
GHB metabolism. Essential to this work was the strategic
synthesis of isotopically labeled GHB molecules and evaluation
of the mass isotopomer distributions of its metabolites.
Our ﬁrst challenge was to devise synthetic route(s) that
would be high-yielding and e ﬃcient but more importantly
would allow the incorporation of 13C at any permutation of
carbons. While GHB syntheses have been reported previously,
none would allow for the criteria above.
14 As shown in Scheme
1, we developed two separate routes for the incorporation of
13C labels at any position(s) ofγ-butyrolactone. The rationale
behind two diﬀerent synthetic routes was based on the fact that
despite Scheme 1A being very high-yielding, it can only
incorporate 13C label selectively at C-1 or C-2 or C-1,2.
Therefore, to achieve labeling permutations that include C-3
and/or C-4, another strategy was developed as outlined in
Scheme 1B. To illustrate Scheme 1A, we show the synthesis of
[1,2-
13C2]-γ-butyrolactone (6c) starting from glycoaldehyde
dimer (4), which serves as a convenient in situ source of 2-
hydroxyacetaldehyde.15,16 The Wittig oleﬁniation followed by
hydrogenation and acid-catalyzed lactonization a ﬀorded
[1,2-13C2]-γ-butyrolactone, 6c, in 75% overall yield. In this
case, the labeling can be controlled through the Wittig reagent,
3c, which was synthesized from commercially available labeled
ethyl bromoacetate (1c) depending upon the desired labeling.
In Scheme 1B we illustrate the example of [1,2,3- 13C3]-γ-
butyrolactone (6g), synthesized starting with ethyl-[1-13C]-2-
bromoacetate (1a), which was reacted with the sodium salt of
benzyl alcohol followed by DIBAL-H reduction to give theα-
(benzyloxy)-[1-13C]-acetaldehyde (9a). This was subsequently
subjected to Wittig oleﬁnation using13C-labeled Wittig reagent
(3c) followed by hydrogenation and acid-catalyzed lactoniza-
tion as above to aﬀord the [1,2,3-13C3]-γ-butyrolactone, 6g,
with the overall yield of 55%. Storage of GHB in the lactone
form ameliorates issues of autolactonization that occurs during
long-term storage.
Our experimental system for studying the metabolism of
GHB is via perfusion of live rat liver, which has been reported
previously.17 This approach allows us to work in a carefully
controlled experimental setup while still using primary tissues
(mimicking in vivo conditions) as compared to transformed
and immortalized cell culture lines where we could not be sure
of the physiologic relevance.
We ﬁrst sought to quantitatively measure theﬁrst divergent
step where either 3,4- or 2,4-dihydroxybutyryl-CoA is produced
via β-oxidation and α-oxidation, respectively; see Figure 1. To
conﬁrm their production, we conducted an experiment with
[1,2,3,4-
13C4]-GHB (M4 GHB) and subsequently identi ﬁed
M4 labeling in both dihydroxybutyrates. An interesting
observation of this experiment was that although we found
extensive M4 labeling on 2,4-dihydroxybutyrate, the 3,4-
dihydroxybutyrate was labeled as both M2 and M4. Further
experiments with [1,2-
13C2]- and [3,4-13C2]-GHB revealed that
the C-1 and C-2 of 3,4-dihydroxybutyryl-CoA readily
equilibrate with endogenously present acetyl-CoA (unlabeled)
from other sources. We attribute the equilibration to two
reverse reactions catalyzed by 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogen-
ase and 3-ketoacyl-CoA thiolase. This ﬁnding illustrates the
inherent value in being able to produce GHB with any
permutation of carbon labeling, as [1-
13C]-, [2- 13C]-, or
[1,2-13C2]-GHB would not accurately diﬀerentiate the initial
ﬂux of β-oxidation versus α-oxidation. Our initial attempts to
quantitate relative ﬂuxes centered on an analysis of relative
abundance of 3,4- and 2,4-dihydroxybutyryl-CoA. However,
after it was determined that absolute rates ofﬂux could not
speciﬁcally be determined for the di ﬀerent molecules, we
focused on the common intermediate 3-hydroxypropionyl-
CoA. This molecule is common to both theα-oxidation andβ-
oxidation legs of the pathway, and with the utilization of the
[1,2,3-
13C2]-GHB and given the steady state nature of the
experiments, we can speciﬁcally determine relative ﬂuxes by
comparing the amount of M3 3-hydroxypropionyl-CoA to M2
3-hydroxypropionyl-CoA (see Figures 1 and 3). The only
limitation of this approach is that it can only set a lower
boundary (i.e., the ratio is at least the reported value). This
limitation became moot upon the analysis of the new data,
which showed that theβ-oxidation leg of the pathway is at least
16.8 times more predominant as compared to theα-oxidation
leg (Figure 3).
Next we aimed to investigate and quantitate the further
catabolism of 2,4- and 3,4-dihydroxybutyrates utilizing
[1,2,3-
13C3]-GHB and [2,3,4-13C3]-GHB. To conﬁrm the fate
of C-1, weﬁrst perfused rat livers with [1,2,3-13C3]-GHB and
found M2 3-hydroxypropionate (from 3-hydroxypropionyl-
CoA) and M1 formate, a product we tentatively ascribed to an
α-oxidation event. We subsequently found M3 GHB-CoA, M3
2,4-dihydroxybutyrate, M2 3-hydroxypropionate (from the in
situ hydrolysis of the CoA esters), and M1 formate in clear
precursor-to-product relationship (Figure 2A), This allowed us
to conﬁrm the α-oxidation process. As in other α-oxidation
reactions, the sequence involves the hydroxylation on theα-
carbon of GHB-CoA forming 2,4 -dihydroxybutyryl-CoA,
followed by its catabolism to give 3-hydroxypropionyl-CoA,
and formyl-CoA, which spontaneously converts to formate
during analysis. To uncover the downstream metabolism of 3,4-
dihydroxybutyryl-CoA, we conducted experiments with
[2,3,4-
13C3]-GHB. With this labeling strategy, we predicted
M2 glycolyl-CoA, M1 acetyl-CoA, M2 3-hydroxypropionyl-
CoA, and M1 formate. This was subsequently conﬁrmed via
GC−MS. Further, the identiﬁcation of glycolate and acetyl-
CoA from 3,4-dihydroxybutyryl-CoA con ﬁrmed β-oxidation
processes in the course of GHB metabolism, which was
previously unknown. Additionally, the M2 glycolyl-CoA can be
catabolized into M1 formate and CO
2 via glyoxylate
(Supplementary Figure 1).
We subsequently applied the precursor-to-product strategy
to identify the process(es) leading to formate production from
the 3,4-dihydroxybutyryl-CoA. In the [2,3,4-
13C3]-GHB
perfused liver, we identi ﬁed M3 GHB-CoA, M3 3,4-
dihydroxybutyryl-CoA, M2 3-hydroxypropionyl-CoA, and M1
formate, which are in clear precursor-to-product relationship

(Figure 2B). However, as this process involves an intermediate
of β-oxidation (3,4-dihydroxybutyryl-CoA), we are hesitant to
designate it as α-oxidation. Alternatively, the removal of C-4
might involve the oxidation of the primary alcohol into a
carboxyl-CoA, followed by its spontaneous removal as CO2.I n
this case, the product will be13C-labeled CO2, but as we use a
large amount of unlabeled CO2 in our perfusion experiments, it
is practically impossible to account for the extent of labeling in
the released labeled CO2.
Using the above logic, we sought to identify a unifying set of
experiments that would allow us to conﬁrm our assertion that
β-oxidation predominates overα-oxidation as indicated by our
3-hydroxypropionate experiments and also gain further insight
into the relativeﬂuxes of the downstream steps. Given that the
implications of all of the described pathways impact formate
production, we chose to use this as a tool to further assess the
quantitative nature of the GHB catabolism. To identify the
speciﬁc locations of GHB molecule-producing formate and to
quantitate the ﬂux down the various pathways, we synthesized
singly labeled GHBs ([1- 13C]-, [2-13C]-, [3-13C]-, [4-13C]-
GHB) and subsequently assayed the M1 formate released from
perfused livers as pentaﬂuorobenzyl derivatives under negative
chemical ionization to minimize natural enrichment of the
analytes (Figure 3).
As shown in Figure 1, M1 formate primarily originates from
C-1, C-3, and C-4 of GHB. The formate production from C-1
is derived from theα-oxidation of 2,4-dihydroxybutyryl-CoA as
detailed above. The fate of 3,4-dihydroxybutyryl-CoA could
undergo either theβ-oxidation or decarboxylation reactions to
be further metabolized. In the case of β-oxidation, 3,4-
dihydroxybutyryl-CoA loses one molecule of acetyl-CoA to
produce glycolyl-CoA that can be catabolized to produce
formate from itsα-carbon.13 This predominantly accounts for
the production of formate from C-4. We attribute the
production of labeled formate from C-3 as the result of the
cleavage of the β-carbon of 3-hydroxypropionate, which we
hypothesize involves a spontaneous retro-aldol type of reaction
(Supplementary Figure 2). T his reaction would liberate
formaldehyde, which would be rapidly converted to formate
in vivo. If this hypothesis were true, we would also predict
analogous processes from the 3-hydroxypropionate produced
from the initial α-oxidation step. Indeed, we observe that
formate derived from C-4 represents the largest contribution to
the formate pool, which would be congruent with this
hypothesis. Current experimentation is underway in the
laboratory to de ﬁnitively de ﬁne mechanistic fates of 3-
hydroxypropionate. Regardless, we postulate that theﬁnal fate
of C-4 of GHB as formate can mainly be ascribed as the
consequence of the catabolism of glycolyl-CoA. The minimal
amount of M1 formate from C-2 of GHB likely derives from
the nonspeci ﬁc anaplerotic incorporation of the
13C label
during its metabolism in the TCA cycle. Taken together, the
results from the analysis of formate production are consistent
with the results from the 3-hydroxypropionyl-CoA experiments
above that deﬁned β-oxidation as the dominant leg of the
pathway shown in Figure 1.
To place this pathway in a more global perspective, we
conducted a series of experiments to parse out the four known

fates of GHB: (i) conversion to succinate, (ii) conversion to
GABA and (iii) catabolism via phosphorylation and isomer-
ization, and (iv) catabolism via the newly discovered pathways
described here. In perfusions with M4 GHB, relative
anaplerosis was calculated as the enrichment ratio (M4
succinate)/(M4 GHB), as M4 succinate cannot be formed
from recycling of label in the citric acid cycle. In the M4 GHB
perfused liver, we identiﬁed 8 ± 2% of M4 succinate that
subsequently enters into the citric acid cycle and 59± 6% of
M4 GABA. Unlike the longer chain γ-hydroxyacids,
4 4-
phosphobutyryl-CoA was found in very low amount (<1%).
The remaining GHB undergoes the catabolic pathways detailed
here via conversion to 3,4-dihydroxybutyryl-CoA and 2,4-
dihydroxybutyryl-CoA.
In addition to the long history of GHB as a drug of abuse,
this molecule is an orphan drug
18 that has long been used to
treat narcolepsy with associated cataplexy (under the name
sodium oxybate). Further, it is currently being explored for use
as a main-line treatment in a variety of prevalent diseases
including ﬁbromyalgia
19−21 and Parkinson’s.22 On this basis, a
careful understanding of all the metabolic fates of this molecule
and the molecular tools to study these fates become critical,
especially in the context of deﬁning contraindications due to
metabolic toxicity. Regardless, this study clearly illustrates the
power of metabolomics studies coupled with stable isotope
incorporation to address biochemical questions relevant to
human health.
■ METHODS
Liver Perfusion Experiments. Livers from overnight-fasted
Sprague-Dawley rats were perfused for 2 h with 150 mL of
recirculating bicarbonate (15 mM) bu ﬀer containing 4% dialyzed
bovine serum albumin (fraction V, fatty acid-free, Intergen), 4 mM
glucose, ±2 mM GHB (unlabeled or labeled GHB). Livers were quick-
frozen at the end of the perfusions and stored in liquid nitrogen for
further analysis by LC−MS/MS. We subsequently monitored key
metabolic intermediates and their mass isotopomer distributions via
LC−MS/MS and GC−MS. The mass isotopomers are designated as
M, M1, M2, ..., Mn where n is the number of heavy atoms in the
molecule.
LC−MS/MS Method for the Labeling Pattern and Concen-
tration Measurement of Acyl-CoAs. For the concentration and
labeling pattern of acyl-CoA esters, powdered frozen liver (∼200 mg)
was extracted for 1 min with 4 mL of (methanol/water 1:1 containing
5% acetic acid) using a Polytron homogenizer. The supernatant was
added to a 3 mL ion exchange cartridge packed with 300 mg of 2-(2-
pyridyl)ethyl silica gel (Sigma). The cartridge had been preactivated
with 3 mL of methanol, then with 3 mL of extraction buﬀer. The acyl-
CoAs that were trapped on the silica gel cartridge were released with
(i) 3 mL of a 1:1 mixture of ammonium formate 50 mM pH 6.3 and
methanol (to release the short- and medium-chain acyl-CoAs), then
(ii) 3 mL of a 1:3 mixture of ammonium formate 50 mM pH 6.3 and
methanol, and (iii) 3 mL of methanol (to release the medium- and
long-chain acyl-CoAs). The combined e ﬄuent was dried under a
stream of nitrogen gas and stored at −80 °C until LC−MS/MS
analysis.
After dissolving the acyl-CoAs in 100 μLo fb u ﬀer A (5%
acetonitrile in ammonium formate 100 mM, pH 5.0), 40 μL was
injected on a Thermo Electron Hypersil GOLD column (150× 2.1
mm) protected by a guard column (Hypersil Gold 5μm, 10 × 2.1
mm) in an Agilent 1100 liquid chromatograph. The chromatogram
was developed at 0.2 mL/min (i) for 3 min with 98% buﬀer A and 2%
buﬀer B (95% acetonitrile in ammonium formate 5 mM, pH 6.3), (ii)
from 3 to 25 min with a 2% to 60% gradient of buﬀer B in buﬀer A,
(iii) from 26 to 31 min with 10% buﬀer A/90% buﬀer B, (iv) from 32
to 41 min with a 90% to 2% gradient buﬀer B in buﬀer A, and (v) 10
min stabilization with 98% buﬀer A before the next injection.
The liquid chromatograph was coupled to a 4000 QTrap mass
spectrometer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) operated under
positive ionization mode with the following source settings: turbo-ion-
spray source at 600°C under N
2 nebulization at 65 psi, N2 heater gas
at 55 psi, curtain gas at 30 psi, collision-activated dissociation gas
pressure held at high, turbo ion-spray voltage at 5,500 V, declustering
potential at 90 V, entrance potential at 10 V, collision energy at 50 V,
collision cell exit potential at 10 V. The Analyst software (version
1.4.2; Applied Biology) was used for data collection and processing.
GC−MS Assay of Formate via Pentaﬂuorobenzyl Bromide
(PFBBr) Derivatization Reaction.The concentrations and labeling
of formate was assayed as the pentaﬂuorobenzyl derivatives by NH
3-
negative chemical ionization as described below. Sample preparation
for formic acid with GC−MS assay is as follows. A 400μL portion of
100 mM PFBBr in acetone solution was added into 200 μLo f
perfusate samples or standard aqueous solution without precipitating
the protein. The sample was incubated at 60−70 °C for 1 h, and 1 mL
of hexane was added after the sample had cooled. The sample was then
vortexed for 5 min followed by centrifugation at 300g for 1 min, and
then 200 μL of upper phase (hexane phase) was transferred to GC
vials and prepared for GC −MS injection. All experiments were
processed in a laminar ﬂow hood to avoid contamination. Distilled
Milli-Q water was used for the preparation of all standard solutions.
Analyses were carried out on an Agilent 5973 mass spectrometer,
linked to a model 6890 gas chromatograph equipped with an
autosampler, an Agilent OV-225 capillary column (30 m, 0.32 mm
inner diameter). The carrier gas was helium (2 mL/min) with a pulse
pressure of 40 psi. The injection volume was 1μL with splitless. The
injector temperature was set at 200°C and the transfer line at 250°C.
The GC temperature program was as follows: start at 100°C, hold for
1 min, increase by 3°C/min to 145°C, followed by 50°C/min to 300
°C, and hold for 5 min. The ion source and the quadrupole were set at
150 °C. The ammonia pressure was adjusted to optimize peak areas.
For each analyte, we monitored the signals at the nominalm/z (M)
and at all detectable naturally labeled mass isotopomers with SIM
mode. The m/z monitored are 45 (M) and 46 (M1) for formate.
GC−MS Assay of GHB and Its Carboxylate Metabolites.For
the assay of GHB and its carboxylic acid metabolites, perfusate samples
(200 μL) spiked with 0.2 μmol of [
2H6]-GHB as internal standard
were deproteinized with 2 mL of acetonitrile. After centrifugation and
evaporation under N2, the residue was allowed to react with 100μLo f
trimethylsilyl reagent and heated for 1 h at 60°C. Then, 2 μL was
injected into an Agilent 6890 gas chromatograph linked to a 5973
MSD mass spectrometer. The chromatograph was equipped with a 60
m Varian CP 9017 VF-5 capillary column. The carrier gas was helium
(26.8 mL/min), and the injection mode was splitless. The injector
temperature was set at 290°C, and the transfer line was held at 290
°C. The column temperature was increased by 3°C/min from 50 to
300 °C, where it was held for 10 min. The mass spectrometer was
operated under electron impact ionization. The quadrupole and ion
source temperatures were 150 and 230°C, respectively. The mass scan
ranged from 50 to 700. The m/z of M0, M1, M2, and M3 3-
hydroxypropionates measured as their TMS derivatives are 219, 220,
221, and 222, respectively. Them/z of M0, M1, and M2 glycoates
(TMS derivative) are 205, 206, and 207, respectively. Them/z of M0,
M1, M2, M3, and M4 dihydroxybutyrate-TMS derivatives (same for
2,4- and 3,4-dihydroxybutyrate) are 321, 322, 323, 324, and 325,
respectively.
Calculations and Statistics.Correction of raw mass isotopomer
proﬁles for natural enrichment at each mass was conducted with the
CORMAT software.
