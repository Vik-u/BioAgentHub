Abstract: The mechanisms underlying the increase in external pH caused by heterotrophic nitriﬁca-
tion and aerobic denitriﬁcation microorganisms during ammonia oxidation were unclear. This work
demonstrated that after culturing Pseudomonas putida Y-9 for 60 h in a medium with ammonium
nitrogen as the sole nitrogen source at an initial pH of 7.20, the pH value increased to 9.21. GC-
TOF-MS analysis was used to compare the signiﬁcantly regulated metabolites and related metabolic
pathways between different time points. The results showed that the consumption of H+ in the
conversion of malonic acid to 3-hydroxypropionic acid in the β-alanine metabolic pathway was the
main reason for the increase in pH. RT-qPCR conﬁrmed that the functional gene ydfG dominated the
consumption of H+. This study provides new research ideas for the change of external pH caused by
bacterial metabolism and further expands the understanding of the interaction between bacteria and
the environment.

1. Introduction
Microbial oxidation of ammonia to nitrite is the ﬁrst step of the nitriﬁcation pro-
cess, which is a critical part of the global biogeochemical nitrogen cycle. Under aerobic
conditions, it is mainly driven by three aerobic autotrophic microorganisms, including
ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB), ammonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA), and comammox
bacteria (complete oxidation of ammonia to nitrate) [1]. The ammonia oxidation process
is an enzymatic process of microorganisms that converts ammonium nitrogen into nitrite
nitrogen through oxidation. A series of oxidation reactions that occur during this process
release H+ [2]. This indicates that ammonia oxidation may lead to an increase in acidity
and a decrease in pH value [3].
Heterotrophic nitriﬁcation and aerobic denitriﬁcation microorganisms (HNADMs) can
also heterotrophically perform ammonia oxidation. HNADMs have been extensively stud-
ied for their ability to simultaneously complete nitriﬁcation and denitriﬁcation under aero-
bic conditions [4]. HNADMs range from the aerobic denitriﬁcation species Paracoccus pan-
totrophus, which was reported as early as the 1980s, to species such as Rhodococcus sp., Chry-
seobacterium sp., Pseudomonas sp., Bacillus cereus, Ochrobactrum sp., and Acinetobacter sp. [5].
Contrary to the expectation that ammonia oxidation would lead to a decrease in external
pH, recent studies on the nitrogen cycle driven by HNADMs have shown that HNADMs
can lead to an increase in extracellular pH during heterotrophic ammonia oxidation. For
example, in the process of removing ammonium nitrogen by P . mendocinaX49, it was ob-
served that the pH of the medium increased from about 6.80 to 8.28–8.64 [5]. Our previous
studies focusing on the Pseudomonas putida Y-9-driven heterotrophic ammonia oxidation

process illustrated the same phenomenon. Cultured with ammonia nitrogen as the only
nitrogen source for 60 h, Y-9 causes the extracellular pH to rise continuously from 7.20 to
9.21. However, the reasons underlying this phenomenon remain unclear.
Available research attributes the phenomenon of bacteria causing an increase in the
pH of the external environment to two main reasons: (a) One reason is the production of
ammonium nitrogen or amines during bacterial metabolism. Ammonium nitrogen comes
from the ammoniation and mineralization of organic nitrogen [6]. The production of amines
is due to the action of amino acid decarboxylase [7]; (b) The other reason is the denitriﬁcation
process of bacteria. The conversion of nitrite in the denitriﬁcation process into nitric
oxide produces hydroxyl groups, which increase the external pH [8]. However, the above
conclusions solely explain the autotrophic bacteria metabolism during nitriﬁcation, which
cannot be used to interpret the increase in external pH for the heterotrophic ammonia
oxidation bacteria when they are cultured in a neutral medium (pH = 7.19) with ammonium
nitrogen as the sole nitrogen source. Several prior studies have shown that carbon sources
are also a factor that leads to the change in extracellular pH [9]. However, the mechanism
of the increase in extracellular pH caused by carbon sources is not clear.
Pseudomonas putida Y-9, a cold-tolerant strain of heterotrophic nitriﬁcation and
aerobic denitriﬁcation [10], was used to study metabolic-induced changes in extracellular
pH during heterotrophic ammonia oxidation. The nitrogen transformation and extracellular
pH changes of strain Y-9 during its growth were investigated, and the mechanisms of
changing the medium’s pH through the continuous changes of metabolites were explored.
We found that strain Y-9 was able to cause a sustained increase in extracellular pH during
a 60-h culture for ammonia oxidation with ammonium nitrogen as the sole nitrogen source,
which proved that strain Y-9 regulated external pH by a mechanism other than nitrogen
conversion. Further analysis inferred that nitrogen transformation was not the decisive
factor for strain Y-9 to change the pH of the medium. The main reason is that the strain
β-alanine metabolism consumes H+, thereby gradually increasing external pH. This study
revealed another metabolic path leading to the change of bacterial extracellular pH, which
offers new insights for studying the change of external environmental pH caused by
bacterial metabolism.
2. Materials and Methods
2.1. Microorganism and Culture Media
The heterotrophic nitriﬁcation and aerobic denitriﬁcation bacterium P . putidaY-9
(KP410740) used in this study were previously isolated by Huang et al. [ 10]. The nitriﬁ-
cation medium (NM) per liter comprised 1.3 g K2HPO4·3H2O, 0.24 g (NH4)2SO4, 2.56 g
CH3COONa, 0.05 g FeSO4·7H2O, and 0.1 g MgSO4·7H2O.
The initial pH of all the media mentioned above was adjusted to 7.20 with NaOH. Con-
ical ﬂasks (250 mL capacity) containing 100 mL NM were autoclaved for 15 min at 115 ◦C.
During incubation, samples were withdrawn and measured using a spectrophotometer. The
optical density (OD600) of the bacterial cells was measured from the absorbance at 600 nm.
2.2. Effect of Different Carbon Sources on Extracellular pH and Growth of Strain Y-9
In the carbon source experiments, one of the three carbon sources (sodium acetate,
glucose, or sodium citrate) was added to 100 mL of NM instead of CH 3COONa. Cells
killed by high temperature were inoculated into NM as a control. Approximately 20 mL of
culture medium was taken out to determine pH and OD600 at set intervals.
2.3. Ammonium Oxidation Capacity of Y-9
In order to explore the inﬂuence of Y-9 on extracellular pH during the ammonia
oxidation process, (NH4)2SO4 was used as the sole nitrogen source. A single colony of
Y-9 was inoculated into 100 mL LB medium and cultured at 150 r/min and 15 ◦C for 36 h.
Then, 8 mL of the precultured strain Y-9 were harvested by centrifuging at 4000 rpm for
8 min, and the pellet was washed twice with sterile water before inoculation into 100 mL of
Microorganisms 2023, 11, 356 3 of 15
the medium containing different initial concentrations of ammonium. The cultures were
incubated at 15 ◦C under aerobic conditions with shaking at 150 rpm. The medium without
inoculation was used as a control group. Samples were periodically (12 h, 18 h, 24 h, 36 h,
and 60 h) taken from the cultures to determine the optical density at 600 nm (OD600), pH,
and concentrations of NH4+, NO2−, NO3−, NO, and total nitrogen (TN). All experiments
were conducted in triplicate.
A total of 20 mL of culture medium was centrifuged at 8000 rpm for 5 min, and the
supernatant was used to determine the pH as the extracellular pH. The cells collected after
centrifugation were washed twice with sterile water and then broken with a cell disruptor.
The cell-disrupted mixture was resuspended with 10 mM KCl to a volume of 20 mL to
determine the pH value as the intracellular pH value.
2.4. Detection of Extracellular Metabolites Produced by P . putida Y-9
LB solid plates were used to activateP . putidaY-9, which was then enriched ina 100 mL
LB broth medium and cultured in the shaker at 150 rpm, and 15 ◦C for 36 h. Then, 80 mL of
precultured Y-9 strain was taken out and centrifuged for 5 min at 6000 rpm. Next, the pellet
was washed twice with sterilized pure water. The supernatant was discarded, and the
pellet was inoculated into a 100 mL basal medium with an initial pH of 7.20. The cultures
were incubated at 15 ◦C under aerobic conditions with shaking at 150 rpm. After culturing
for 12 h, 18 h, 24 h, 36 h, and 60 h, centrifugation was carried out at 8000 rpm for 5 min, and
the supernatant was taken to determine the pH value and metabolites. The control test was
carried out without inoculation and preculture. All experiments were repeated six times.
GC-TOF-MS analysis was performed using an Agilent 7890 (Agilent Technologies,
Santa Clara, CA, USA) gas chromatograph coupled with a time-of-ﬂight mass spectrometer.
The system utilized a DB-5MS capillary column. A total of 1 µL aliquot of the sample was
injected in the splitless mode. Helium was used as the carrier gas, the front inlet purge ﬂow
was 3 mL min−1, and the gas ﬂow rate through the column was 1 mL min−1. The initial
temperature was kept at 50 ◦C for 1 min, then raised to 310 ◦C at a rate of 10 ◦C min−1,
and kept for 8 min at 310 ◦C. The injection, transfer line, and ion source temperatures were
280, 280, and 250 ◦C, respectively. The energy was −70 eV in electron impact mode. The
mass spectrometry data were acquired in full-scan mode with the m/z range of 50–500 at
a rate of 12.5 spectra per second after a solvent delay of 6.27 min. Raw data analysis,
including peak extraction, baseline adjustment, deconvolution, alignment, and integration,
was performed on Chroma TOF (V4.3x, LECO) software. LECO-Fiehn Rtx5 database was
used for metabolite identiﬁcation by matching the mass spectrum and retention index.
Finally, the peaks detected in less than half of quality control (QC) samples or relative
standard deviation (RSD) > 30% in QC samples were removed [11,12].
2.5. Real-Time Quantitative PCR
The expression levels of three functional genes associated with key metabolites were
detected by real-time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR). Total RNAs of the bacteria were
extracted using the Trizol reagent (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA). The cDNA
was synthesized using PrimeScript™ RT reagent Kit with gDNA Eraser (Takara, Japan).
A ChamQTM Universal SYBR® qPCR Master Mix (Vazyme, China) was used for qPCR
sample detection. The qPCR instrument was a qTOWER3G (Analytikjena, Germany). The
PCR conditions were as follows: 95 ◦C (initial activation temperature) for 3 min, then 95 ◦C
(denaturation temperature) for 5 s, 60 ◦C (annealing temperature) for 5 s, and 72 ◦C (exten-
sion temperature) for 15 s by 40 cycles. All RT-qPCR experiments were repeated at least
three times. All data were determined by the 2−∆∆Ct method [13] and normalized to the 16S
rRNA reference gene in each sample. The primer sequences for qPCR were as follows: ydfG
(F: CGTGAAGGCATCACCGTCCATG; R: TGTCCAGACCTTCGACCACCTG), rutE (F:
CGAACTGGGAGCGTTACCTGAAC; R: GCTGCAAAGGTGGTCTTGGAAATG),PP-0596
(F: GCACCAGGAACGTCGTCGATATC; R: GCCACCGAAGCGTACATAGAAGC), 16S
rRNA (F: GAACGCTAATACCGCATACGTCC; R: ATCATCCTCTCAGACCAGTTAC).

2.6. Analytical Methods
NO was detected using the nitrate reductase method, in accordance with the NO kit
instruction designed by the Nanjing Jiancheng Bioengineering Institute, China [14]. TN was
determined by measuring the absorbance value at 220 nm, subtracting two times the back-
ground absorbance value at 275 nm after the sample (without centrifugation) was digested
using alkaline potassium persulfate. NH4+, NO2−, and NO3−concentrations in the super-
natant were measured after the samples were centrifuged at 8000 rpm for 5 min. NH 4+,
NO2−, and NO3−concentrations were determined using the indophenols blue method,
the hydrochloric acid photometry method, and the N-(1-naphthalene)-diaminoethane
spectrophotometry method, respectively, in line with the guidelines set by the State Envi-
ronmental Protection Administration of China (2012).
The enriched metabolic pathways and impact values of signiﬁcantly different metabo-
lites were analyzed with MetaboAnalyst 5.0 (https://www.metaboanalyst.ca, accessed on
16 June 2022).
2.7. Statistical Analysis and Graphical Work
Microsoft Excel 2010 and SPSS Statistics 19 were used to analyze the data. Hiplot (Sci-
entiﬁc research data visualization platform) and Origin 2018 were employed in generating
graphs. The results were presented as means ±SD (standard deviation of means).
3. Results
3.1. Effect of Different Carbon Sources on the Extracellular pH of P . putida Y-9
The effect of different carbon sources on the extracellular pH of Y-9 was evaluated.
Sodium citrate, sodium acetate, or glucose were used as the sole carbon sources to culture
Y-9 for 60 h, and the cultured dead cells were used as a control (Figure 1). When sodium
citrate or sodium acetate was used as the carbon source, Y-9 led to a continuous increase
in extracellular pH during the whole culture process, and the pH of the culture medium
increased from 7.20 to 9.00 (sodium citrate) and 9.21 (sodium acetate), respectively. In the
ﬁrst 24 h of culture with glucose as the sole carbon source, Y-9 caused the extracellular pH
to decrease from 7.20 to 5.52, but in the later stage of culture, the extracellular pH increased
from 5.52 to 6.85. Given the extracellular pH change curve of different carbon sources,
sodium acetate, which led to the highest increase in extracellular pH, was selected as the
typical carbon source for further research.

3.2. P. putida Y-9 Upregulates External pH during the Heterotrophic Ammonia Oxidation 
The ammonia oxidation process of strain Y -9 at an initial pH of 7.20 was evaluated, 
as well as the effect of Y -9 on the pH of the medium during cultivation  (Figure 2). The 
results showed that the growth of strain Y-9 increased the extracellular pH from the initial 
condition of 7.20 to 9.21 after 60 h of culture. During the whole culture process, the intra-
cellular pH (pHi) was stable at 7.00–7.20. The bacteria have a pH homeostasis mechanism, 
keeping the internal pH stable in the neutral range, which is consistent with the results of 
most bacterial internal pH studies [8]. During the nitrogen conversion process of Y-9, the 
total nitrogen dropped from the initial 49.76 to 41.44 mg/L in 24 h. After that, there was 
little change in total nitrogen, indicating that 8.32 mg/L of ammonium nitrogen was con-
verted to gaseous nitrogen. After culturing strain Y -9 for 24 h, the presence of NO in the 
medium was detected, which indicated that Y -9 underwent ammonia oxidation during 
the culturing phase. This conclusion is consistent with our previous study that showed a 
new aerobic ammonia oxidation pathway by Y-9, which directly oxidizes ammonium ni-
trogen to N2O through NO under aerobic conditions without hydroxylamine as the inter-
mediate [10]. Ammonium nitrogen was used as the sole nitrogen source of the culture 
medium, with an initial concentration of 48.80 mg/L. After 24 h of culture, ammonium 
nitrogen concentration was decreased to 1.25 mg/L. After 36 h of culture, ammonium ni-
trogen was completely consumed. The accumulation of NO2− and NO3− was not detected 
at any of the time points. OD600 reached a peak value of 1.247 at 36 h.

The ammonia oxidation process of strain Y-9 at an initial pH of 7.20 was evaluated,
as well as the effect of Y-9 on the pH of the medium during cultivation (Figure 2). The
results showed that the growth of strain Y-9 increased the extracellular pH from the
initial condition of 7.20 to 9.21 after 60 h of culture. During the whole culture process,
the intracellular pH (pHi) was stable at 7.00–7.20. The bacteria have a pH homeostasis
mechanism, keeping the internal pH stable in the neutral range, which is consistent with
the results of most bacterial internal pH studies [8]. During the nitrogen conversion process
of Y-9, the total nitrogen dropped from the initial 49.76 to 41.44 mg/L in 24 h. After that,
there was little change in total nitrogen, indicating that 8.32 mg/L of ammonium nitrogen

nitrogen to N 2O through NO under aerobic conditions without hydroxylamine as the
intermediate [10]. Ammonium nitrogen was used as the sole nitrogen source of the culture
medium, with an initial concentration of 48.80 mg/L. After 24 h of culture, ammonium
nitrogen concentration was decreased to 1.25 mg/L. After 36 h of culture, ammonium
nitrogen was completely consumed. The accumulation of NO 2− and NO 3− was not
detected at any of the time points. OD600 reached a peak value of 1.247 at 36 h.

3.3. Analysis of Significantly Different Metabolites of Y-9 Strains at Different Culture Times 
In order to investigate the medium pH change caused by Y -9 metabolites, GC-TOF-
MS was used to study the nontarget metabolites with initial culture pH conditions of 7.20. 
After peak extraction and matching of the original data, 186 peaks were retained, and 63 
known metabolites were measurable. Metabolites satisfying the criteria VIP > 1 and p < 
0.05 were identified as differentially expressed metabolites; those with a fold change (FC) 
> 1 were considered upregulated, while those with an FC < 0.9 were considered downreg-
ulated. Four groups of metabolites were obtained as comparative data, including S1 (18 h 
vs. 12 h), S2 (24 h vs. 12 h), S3 (36 h vs. 12 h), and S4 (60 h vs. 12 h), and 19 metabolites 
were significantly regulated by KEGG annotation (Table 1). The se metabolites included 
one from the group of alcohols and polyols, one of the sulfamic acid derivatives, eight 
carboxylic acids and derivatives, two hydroxy acids and derivatives, one fatty acyl, one 
imidazopyrimidine, one of keto acids and derivatives, and four unclassified compounds.

3.4. Analysis of Metabolic Pathway Enrichment of Y-9 Differential Metabolites
The differential metabolites were mapped to the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and
Genomes (KEGG) database (http://www.genome.jp/kegg/ accessed on 1 August 2022)
for metabolic pathway construction [ 15]. Through comprehensive analysis (including
enrichment and topological analyses) of the pathways where the differential metabo-
lites were located, the pathways were further screened, and the key pathways with the
highest correlation with metabolite differences were identiﬁed. As shown in Figure 3,
each bubble in the bubble chart represents a metabolic pathway. Seven metabolic path-
ways showed signiﬁcant enrichment ( p < 0.05), and ﬁve metabolites were mapped to
β-alanine metabolism (Figure 4) and glyoxylate and dicarboxylate metabolism (Figure 5).
In terms of the impact value and signiﬁcance of metabolites, these two metabolic path-
ways were relatively important, of which the largest impact value was 0.80 for β-alanine
metabolism. Although ﬁve metabolites were mapped to glyoxylate and dicarboxylate
metabolism, their impact value was as low as 0.08. Three metabolites were mapped to
Microorganisms 2023, 11, 356 7 of 15
sulfur metabolism and propanoate metabolism, but their impact values were relatively
low. Though only two metabolites mapped between the Citrate cycle (TCA cycle) and
Pantothenate and CoA biosynthesis, their inﬂuence value ranked second after β-alanine
metabolism. Two metabolites were mapped in monobactam biosynthesis with an impact
value of 0.

3.5. Correlation Analysis between FC of Metabolite and FC of the Medium’s pH 
From the analysis of substances with significant regulation in all comparative metab-
olite data groups, we found that in addition to oxalic acid, the FC of the upregulated sub-
stances continued to rise in the S1, S2, and S3 groups, whereas the FC of the downregu-
lated substances continued to decline in the S1, S2, and S3 groups, and rose slightly in the 
S4 group. This phenomenon was consistent wi th the accelerated rise of pH in the early 
stage of culturing and the slow rise of pH from 36 h to 60 h. Therefore, a Pearson correla-
tion analysis was conducted between the rising FC of the medium’s pH and the signifi-
cantly regulated FC of the metabolites (Figure 6). From the correlation heat map, it is clear 
that there was a significant negative correlation between the medium’s pH and the down-
regulated metabolite malonic acid 1 but no significant correlation with maleamate 4. The 
medium’s pH positively correlated with the upregulated metabolites 3-hydroxypropionic 
acid 1, alanine 1, serine 1, and cyclohexylsulfamic acid 1, but there was no significant cor-
relation with myo-inositol, ox alic acid, and pantothenic acid. The correlation analysis 
showed that the increase in extracellular pH was significantly related to β-alanine metab-
olism.

3.5. Correlation Analysis between FC of Metabolite and FC of the Medium’s pH
From the analysis of substances with signiﬁcant regulation in all comparative metabo-
lite data groups, we found that in addition to oxalic acid, the FC of the upregulated
substances continued to rise in the S1, S2, and S3 groups, whereas the FC of the downreg-
ulated substances continued to decline in the S1, S2, and S3 groups, and rose slightly in
the S4 group. This phenomenon was consistent with the accelerated rise of pH in the early
stage of culturing and the slow rise of pH from 36 h to 60 h. Therefore, a Pearson correlation
analysis was conducted between the rising FC of the medium’s pH and the signiﬁcantly reg-
ulated FC of the metabolites (Figure 6). From the correlation heat map, it is clear that there
was a signiﬁcant negative correlation between the medium’s pH and the downregulated
metabolite malonic acid 1 but no signiﬁcant correlation with maleamate 4. The medium’s
pH positively correlated with the upregulated metabolites 3-hydroxypropionic acid 1,
alanine 1, serine 1, and cyclohexylsulfamic acid 1, but there was no signiﬁcant correlation
with myo-inositol, oxalic acid, and pantothenic acid. The correlation analysis showed that
the increase in extracellular pH was signiﬁcantly related to β-alanine metabolism.

3.6. RT-qPCR Validation of Related Genes in β-alanine Metabolism 
Genes ydfG and rutE associated with the metabolism of malonate to 3-HP were iden-
tified from the whole-genome sequencing data of Y-9. ydfG encodes 3-hydroxypropionate 
dehydrogenase or malonate semialdehyde reductase, which can reduce malonate semial-
dehyde to 3-HP (Figure 7). rutE encodes malonate semialdehyde reductase, and previous 
studies have shown that its function is consistent with ydfG [16]. The enzyme encoded by 
gene PP-0596 is responsible for transforming malonate semialdehyde into β-alanine. RT-
qPCR verification on these three genes was performed using the 12 -h expression as the 
reference. Figure 8 shows the expression of these three genes treated at 18 h, 24 h, 36 h, 
and 60 h. After 18 h, all three genes were upregulated, but FC was less than 1.  ydfG was 
upregulated by a 2.65 ± 0.27 fold and a 0.46 ± 0.06 fold at 24 h and 36 h, respectively, while 
rutE and PP-0596 were downregulated. After 60 h, all three genes were downregulated.

Carbon source is one of the important factors which affect the extracellular pH. Previ-
ous studies have shown that the extracellular pH of Candida albicans ranged from 4.0 to
7.0 as a carbon source with acetate within 24 h, and a decrease of extracellular pH (ranging

Clemente et al. [9] cultured three strains (Escherichia coli ATCC 25922, Pseudomonas putida

found that alkalinization of the medium when citrate as the carbon source, while a slightly
acidic of the medium when glucose was added as the carbon source. In our study, both
increases in extracellular pH of Y-9 were observed when acetate and citrate were used
as carbon sources individually, which were in accord with previous studies [9]. Interest-
Microorganisms 2023, 11, 356 11 of 15
ingly, we also found that the extracellular pH showed a trend of decreasingﬁrst and then
rising when glucose was added as the carbon source, which differed from the ﬁndings
presented. These relationships may partly be explained by the fact that Y-9 has the abil-
ity to regulate extracellular pH. In this experiment, sodium acetate caused a continuous
increase in extracellular pH. Therefore, sodium acetate was used as a carbon source for
further research.
4.2. Nitrogen Metabolism Is Not the Reason Why Y-9 Causes the Increase in Extracellular pH
According to previous studies, the increase in external pH value caused by bacteria was
attributed to the accumulation of ammonium nitrogen or denitriﬁcation [18]. Zhang et al.
reported that in the process of using bacteria to remove Pb2+, the strain increased the pH
of wastewater from four to eight within 7 days, and the rising trend of pH correlated
with the accumulation of ammonium nitrogen [19]. The nitriﬁcation process can lead to
the opposite result. For instance, the ammonia oxidation process carried out by AOB
can lead to a drop in pH [ 20]. However, our research results contradict those from the
previous studies. Cultivating Y-9 with ammonium nitrogen as the sole nitrogen source for
ammonia oxidation resulted in a continuous increase in the pH of the medium. He et al.
also found a similar phenomenon when studying the nitriﬁcation process of Arthrobacter
arilaitensis Y-10 [21]. In their nitriﬁcation test, low-concentration ammonium nitrogen was
used as the only nitrogen source. After culturing strain Y-10 for 24 h, the ammonium
nitrogen concentration rapidly decreased from the initial 9.62 to 0 mg/L, and the pH value
gradually increased from 7.30 to 8.31. Yang et al. studied the heterotrophic nitriﬁcation
ability of Acinetobacter sp. JR1 with ammonium as the only nitrogen source at an initial
pH of 4.50. Ammonium nitrogen was completely removed within 24 h, and the pH of
the medium increased continuously from 4.50 to 9.50 within 48 h. During the whole
ammonium removal process, no accumulation of nitrate and nitrite was detected [22]. In
this study, assimilation and ammonia oxidation was performed during the culturing phase
of Y-9. Ammonium nitrogen was completely exhausted after 36 h of culture, and the pH of
the medium continued to rise to 60 h, indicating that the rise in pH of the medium was not
entirely caused by the nitrogen transformation path.
4.3. Analysis of the Reasons for the Increase in Extracellular pH Using Metabolites
To further study why Y-9 causes the increase in extracellular pH, we measured the
metabolites of Y-9 at different culture time points. Since the pH of the medium gradually
increased with time, the study focused on the substances that were upregulated or down-
regulated at each time point compared with the metabolites of 12 h. The substances that
were upregulated in all control groups were myo-inositol, cyclohexylsulfamic acid 1, serine
1, 3-hydroxypropionic acid 1, alanine 1, oxalic acid, and pantothenic acid. The substances
that were downregulated are malonic acid 1 and maleamate 4. In addition to myo-inositol,
these metabolites are all organic acids, indicating that the signiﬁcantly regulated metabo-
lites do not directly increase the medium’s pH. We speculate that this phenomenon may
be caused by the consumption of H + or the release of OH −in the medium during the
metabolism of Y-9. In the KEGG’s description of metabolites, the production of serine
1 requires the consumption of H + in the reaction of some metabolic pathways, such as
KEGG reaction: R10986 (Aminoacetaldehyde + CO2 + NADH + H+ →L-serine + NAD+).
In addition, 3-hydroxypropionic acid 1 can be generated from KEGG reaction: R01608
(3-oxopropanoate + NADH + H+ →3-hydroxypropanoate + NAD+), and 1 H+ is consumed
in the reaction process. Moreover, the production of oxalic acid is accompanied by the
production of H2O2, such as the KEGG reaction: R00466 (Glyoxylate + Oxygen + H2O →
Oxalate + Hydrogen peroxide). Fe2+ was added to the culture medium in this work, and the
Fenton reaction between Fe2+ and H2O2 released OH−[23]. However, the same metabolites
appear in a variety of different metabolic pathways. For example, 3-hydroxypropionic
acid (3-HP) is recognized by the U.S. Department of Energy as one of the most promising
value-added chemicals that can be obtained from biomass through the CoA-independent
Microorganisms 2023, 11, 356 12 of 15
pathway, malonyl-CoA pathway, andβ-alanine pathway [24]. To further explore whether
the related reactions of H+ consumption or OH−release did occur in these metabolites,
metabolic pathway enrichment analysis was performed on the above 19 metabolites.
4.4. Effect of β-Alanine Metabolism and Glyoxylate and Dicarboxylate Metabolism on the Rise of
pH in the Culture Medium
After comprehensively analyzing the signiﬁcance of the enriched metabolic pathways,
the number of metabolites mapped, and the impact value, it was deduced that the metabolic
pathways most likely to affect the increase of the medium’s pH wereβ-alanine metabolism
and glyoxylate and dicarboxylate metabolism. From the comprehensive analysis of the
enrichment and metabolic pathway of metabolites,β-alanine metabolism was the metabolic
pathway with the greatest effect on the medium’s pH. Five metabolites were labeled in
β-alanine metabolic pathway map, as shown in Figure 4. Namely, the metabolites mapped
on this metabolic pathway showed signiﬁcant upregulation (3-hydroxypropionic acid
and pantothenic acid) and signiﬁcant downregulation (malonic acid, 4-aminobutyric acid,
and β-alanine). From the comparative data and metabolic routes of the four groups of
metabolites, it was noticeable that there may be a transformation relationship between
the continuously upregulated 3-HP and the continuously downregulated malonic acid.
The two functional groups (carboxyl and β-hydroxyl) contribute to the versatility of 3-HP ,
which has a great potential for further transformation into useful chemicals. The ﬁrst part
of the pathway, from glucose to two acetyl-CoA, is achieved through endogenous sugar
catabolism, comprising glycolysis. Malonyl-CoA is then obtained from acetyl-CoA using an
acetyl-CoA decarboxylase. The last two steps, from malonyl-CoA to 3-HP , are catalyzed by
malonyl-CoA reductase (MCR). The MCR has two distinct functional domains, where the
ﬁrst one is C-terminal and catalyzes malonyl-CoA’s reduction into malonate semialdehyde
(MSA), while the second one is N-terminal and catalyzes MSA’s reduction into 3-HP [24].
Malonic acid can also be directly used as a substrate to produce 3-HP through the malonyl-
CoA pathway [25]. There have been no reports of wild strains producing 3-HP with malonic
acid as the substrate. In any case, there is H+ consumption in the production of 3-HP by
the malonyl-CoA pathway, which is considered to be one of the reasons for the rise of the
medium’s pH. Hydrogen ions are consumed through paths (1) and (2). The KEGG reaction
is as follows:
Acetyl-CoA + CO2 + NAD(P)H + H+ →Malonate semialdehyde + CoA + NAD(P)+(R00705/R00706) (1)
Malonate semialdehyde + NADH + H+ →3-Hydroxypropanoate + NAD+ (R01608) (2)
Five metabolites of glyoxylic acid and dicarboxylic acid metabolism were also mapped,
including serine 1, oxalic acid, succinic acid, glycolic acid, and citric acid. As suggested in
Figure 5, glycolic acid may also be transformed into oxalic acid, and hydrogen peroxide
is produced in this transformation process. Hydrogen peroxide is produced through
paths (3) and (4). The KEGG reaction process is as follows:
Glycolate + Oxygen →Glyoxylate + H2O2 (R00475) (3)
Glyoxylate + H2O + O2 →Oxalate + H2O2 (R00466) (4)
Since Fe 2+ was added to the medium, the reaction of Fe 2+ with H 2O2 released
OH−(H2O2 + Fe2+ →·OH−+ OH−+ Fe3+), and it was concluded that this might also be one
of the reasons for the rise of the medium’s pH. Gomez Toribio et al. reported that white-rot
fungi induced the production of extracellular hydroxyl radicals through the quinone redox
cycle, in which quinone redox produced H2O2, and the Fenton reaction occurred [23].
In addition, with acetate as the carbon source, 3-HP can be synthesized through the
malonyl-CoA pathway. Acetate can be converted into acetyl-CoA in glyoxylic acid and
dicarboxylic acid metabolism, and then 3-HP is synthesized through the malonyl CoA
pathway. The reaction from malonyl CoA to 3-HP is a part of the 3-hydroxypropionate
Microorganisms 2023, 11, 356 13 of 15
and 3-hydroxypropionate/4-hydroxybutyrate cycle, which are two of the six pathways
of autotrophic carbon dioxide ﬁxation [ 26]. This indicates that the increase in pH of the
medium may be related to the pathway of carbon sequestration.
4.5. Correlation Analysis and RT-qPCR Veriﬁcation Support That the Rise in Extracellular pH Is
Caused by β-Alanine Metabolism
Combined with the previous metabolic pathway analysis, we demonstrated that
3-hydroxypropionic acid 1, pantothenic acid, and malonic acid 1 were mapped in β-
alanine metabolism. We found that 3-hydroxypropionic acid 1 was signiﬁcantly positively
correlated with pantothenic acid and negatively correlated with malonic acid 1. This proves
that 3-hydroxypropionic acid 1 and malonic acid 1 are converted through the pathway ofβ-
alanine metabolism, and the increase of the medium’s pH signiﬁcantly negatively correlated
with malonic acid 1 and signiﬁcantly positively correlated with 3-hydroxypropionic acid 1.
Hence, the rise in the medium’s pH is mainly caused by the consumption of H in the
metabolic process of malonyl-CoA to 3-hydroxypropionic acid 1. In addition, there was no
signiﬁcant correlation between the rise of the medium’s pH and oxalic acid, indicating that
the Fenton reaction caused by glyoxylate and dicarboxylate metabolism was not the main
factor leading to the change in the medium’s pH.
To prove that the continuous increase in the pH of the medium was mainly due to the
consumption of H+ during the metabolism of malonic acid to 3-HP , we further performed
RT-qPCR veriﬁcation. Interestingly, from the results, the genes related to the metabolism
of malonate to malonate semialdehyde were not found, so we speculated that Y-9 has
distinct genes to accomplish this task. Gene PP-0596 related to the metabolism of malonate
semialdehyde to β-alanine was found in the analysis (Figure 7). RT-qPCR veriﬁcation on
these three genes was performed using the 12-h expression as the reference. Figure 8 shows
the expression of these three genes treated at 18 h, 24 h, 36 h, and 60 h. After 18 h, all three
genes were upregulated, but FC was less than 1, indicating that the upregulation of genes
was due to the rapid growth of the strain. ydfG was upregulated at 24 h and 36 h, indicating
that ydfG dominated the reduction of malonate semialdehyde to 3-HP . AlthoughrutE was
reported to have the same function as ydfG, its expression was downregulated at 24 h and
36 h, indicating that rutE was not involved in the reduction of malonate semialdehyde to
3-HP . The genePP-0596 was downregulated in both 24-h and 36-h treatments, which also
indicated that malonate semialdehyde was not converted to β-alanine. All three genes
were downregulated after the 60 h treatment, which may indicate that the growth of the
strain had reached the plateau stage. From the coherent analysis, it can be concluded that
ydfG dominates the reduction of malonate semialdehyde to 3-HP , which consumes H+ and
leads to an increase in the medium’s pH.
5. Conclusions
When P . putidaY-9 was cultured with ammonia nitrogen as the sole nitrogen source,
its metabolites led to a continuous increase in extracellular pH during the 60 h culture. The
process of ammonia oxidation could not dominate the change of extracellular pH, and the
most inﬂuential metabolic pathway was β-alanine metabolism. The persistent increase in
the pH of the medium was mainly due to the consumption of H+ during the metabolism of
malonic acid to 3-hydroxypropionic acid. RT-qPCR validation showed that the gene ydfG
was involved in this process. The ﬁnal change in extracellular pH was likely caused by
a combination of factors, and further studies are needed to clarify whether there are other
factors that affect the change in pH.
