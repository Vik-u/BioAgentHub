Autotrophic Crenarchaeota use two different cycles for carbon dioxide ﬁxation.
Members of the Sulfolobales use the 3-hydroxypropionate/4-hydroxybutyrate (HP/HB)
cycle, whereas Desulfurococcales and Thermoproteales use the dicarboxylate/4-
hydroxybutyrate cycle. While these two cycles differ in the carboxylation reactions
resulting in the conversion of acetyl-CoA +2 CO 2 to succinyl-CoA, they have a
common regeneration part in which succinyl-CoA is reconverted to two acetyl-CoA
molecules. This common part includes crotonyl-CoA conversion to acetoacetyl-CoA,
which has unequivocally been shown in Ignicoccus hospitalis (Desulfurococcales)
and Pyrobaculum neutrophilus (Thermoproteales) to be catalyzed by a bifunctional
crotonase/3-hydroxybutyryl-CoA dehydrogenase. It is a fusion protein consisting of an
enoyl-CoA hydratase and a dehydrogenase domain. As the homologous bifunctional
protein is present in Sulfolobales as well, its common functioning in the conversion
of crotonyl-CoA to acetoacetyl-CoA was proposed. Here we show that a model
autotrophic member of Sulfolobales, Metallosphaera sedula , possesses in addition
to the bifunctional protein (Msed_0399) several separate genes coding for crotonyl-
CoA hydratase and ( S)-3-hydroxybutyryl-CoA dehydrogenase. Their genes were
previously shown to be transcribed under autotrophic and mixotrophic conditions. The
dehydrogenase Msed_1423 (and not the bifunctional protein Msed_0399) appears
to be the main enzyme catalyzing the ( S)-3-hydroxybutyryl-CoA dehydrogenase
reaction. Homologs of this dehydrogenase are the only ( S)-3-hydroxybutyryl-CoA
dehydrogenases present in all autotrophic Sulfolobales, strengthening this conclusion.
Two uncharacterized crotonase homologs present in M. sedula genome (Msed_0336
and Msed_0384) were heterologously produced and characterized. Both proteins were
highly efﬁcient crotonyl-CoA hydratases and may contribute (or be responsible) for the
corresponding reaction in the HP/HB cycle in vivo.

Liu et al. 3-Hydroxypropionate/4-Hydroxybutyrate Cycle in Metallosphaera sedula
INTRODUCTION
Autotrophic CO 2 ﬁxation is the most important biosynthetic
process in nature, being responsible for the primary production
of organic matter. Autotrophy is arguably the oldest type of
metabolism (Wächtershäuser, 1988; Russell and Martin, 2004;
Fuchs, 2011), and the ﬁrst metabolic pathway was probably
the (autotrophic) reductive acetyl-CoA pathway (Russell and
Martin, 2004; Fuchs, 2011; Weiss et al., 2016). During evolution,
several fundamentally diﬀerent CO 2 ﬁxation pathways evolved.
They vary not only in their reaction sequences, but also in
their types of carboxylases, cofactors, and electron donors used
to ﬁx inorganic carbon into biomass (Berg et al., 2010a; Berg,
2011; Fuchs, 2011; Hügler and Sievert, 2011). Conversion of
CO2, a greenhouse gas, into value-added products attracts great
attention to autotrophic metabolism, rendering it one of the
popular topics for fundamental and applied research.
The 3-hydroxypropionate/4-hydroxybutyrate (HP/HB) cycle
was discovered in thermophilic aerobic Crenarchaeota of the
order Sulfolobales ( Figure 1 ; Ishii et al., 1996; Menendez
et al., 1999; Berg et al., 2007). Later, a formally similar,
but phylogenetically unrelated pathway was shown in aerobic
ammonia-oxidizing Thaumarchaeota (Könneke et al., 2014; Otte
et al., 2015). While the autotrophic cycle in Thaumarchaeota is
less studied, with some characteristic enzymes of the cycle still
being unidentiﬁed, all enzymes of the crenarchaeal cycle were
identiﬁed and biochemically characterized (Table 1).
In former studies, the model crenarchaeon Metallosphaera
sedula was used; it is capable of growing autotrophically
with hydrogen, sulﬁdic ores or S 0 under aerobic conditions.
Furthermore, heterotrophic growth with, e.g., peptone or yeast
extract and mixotrophic growth in the presence of organic
compounds and inorganic electron donors is possible. The
transcriptomic studies of M. sedula revealed that most of the
FIGURE 1 | 3-Hydroxypropionate/4-hydroxybutyrate cycle in Sulfolobales
(Berg et al., 2007). For the enzymes, see Table 1.
enzymes of the cycle were up-regulated under mixotrophic
and autotrophic growth conditions (Auernik and Kelly, 2010;
Hawkins et al., 2013a; Ai et al., 2019). Nevertheless, there
were several notable exceptions, as 3-hydroxypropionyl-CoA
dehydratase, 4-hydroxybutyryl-CoA synthetase and bifunctional
crotonyl-CoA hydratase/3-hydroxybutyryl-CoA dehydrogenase
were not regulated, or even down-regulated in the presence of
inorganic electron donors ( Table 1; Auernik and Kelly, 2010;
Hawkins et al., 2013a; Ai et al., 2019). Two of these enzymes, 4-
hydroxybutyryl-CoA synthetase and bifunctional crotonyl-CoA
hydratase/3-hydroxybutyryl-CoA dehydrogenase, stand out in
comparative analysis of speciﬁc activities of the puriﬁed enzymes
with the corresponding activities in cell extracts ofM. sedula. This
analysis allows to estimate the amount of the individual enzyme
proteins required to account for autotrophic growth, based on
the speciﬁc activities of the puriﬁed enzymes and the measured
speciﬁc enzyme activities in cell extract. This estimate led to the
surprising high number of 58% of total cellular protein required
to operate the HP/HB cycle ( Table 1 ). 4-Hydroxybutyryl-
CoA synthetase and crotonyl-CoA hydratase/3-hydroxybutyryl-
CoA dehydrogenase alone were responsible for more than half
of this amount (12.5 and 19.7%, respectively). Whereas 4-
hydroxybutyryl-CoA dehydratase appears to constitute a large
fraction of cellular protein as well, it slowly catalyzes a
mechanistically diﬃcult radical reaction (Martins et al., 2004;
Buckel, 2019) and is indeed present in high amounts in
other organisms (Scherf and Buckel, 1993). Furthermore, the
posttranscriptional inactivation of AMP-producing organic acid
CoA-ligases by acetylation has been frequently reported and
may result in down-estimation of the activity of recombinant
4-hydroxybutyryl-CoA synthetase (Crosby et al., 2010; Ramos-
Vera et al., 2011). However, crotonyl-CoA hydratase catalyzes a
relatively simple reaction, and its postulated high abundance in
the cell is surprising.
Here we studied enzymes catalyzing the conversion of
crotonyl-CoA to acetoacetyl-CoA in M. sedula . We found that
this conversion might be catalyzed by a number of isoenzymes
with diﬀerent kinetic properties, and not by a single bifunctional
enzyme, as was previously thought.

CoA-Esters
Crotonyl-CoA and methacrylyl-CoA were synthesized from
the corresponding anhydrides and CoA by the method
of Simon and Shemin (1953). ( S)-3-hydroxybutyryl-CoA,
(R)-3-hydroxybutyryl-CoA, and ( E)-2-octenoyl-CoA were
synthesized chemically from the corresponding free acids by
the mixed anhydride method described by Stadtman (1957).
3-Hydroxypropionyl-CoA was synthesized enzymatically with
recombinant propionate CoA-transferase from Clostridium
propionicum as described by Selmer et al. (2002). Acryloyl-CoA
was synthesized enzymatically with recombinant acyl-CoA
oxidase 4 from Arabidopsis thaliana as described in Schwander
et al. (2016). Crotonyl-CoA, 3-hydroxybutyryl-CoA, and ( E)-2-
octenoyl-CoA were puriﬁed using HPLC (Zarzycki et al., 2009).
The dry powders of the CoA esters were stored at −20◦C.
Strains and Culture Conditions
Cells of M. sedula TH2T (DSM 5348) were grown autotrophically
at 75◦C modiﬁed Allen medium, pH 2.0 (Huber and Prangishvili,
2006) in a 100-l fermenter under gassing with a mixture of 19%
CO2, 3% O 2, and 78% H 2 (0.5 l/min) (generation time, 8 h)
(Huber et al., 1989, 1992). Cells were frozen in liquid nitrogen
and stored at −80◦C until use. Escherichia coli strain DH5α and
E. coli strain Rosetta 2 (DE3) (Merck, Germany) were grown at
37◦C in lysogeny broth (LB) medium. Antibiotics were added to
the cultures to a ﬁnal concentration of 100 µg ampicillin ml −1
and 34 µg chloramphenicol ml−1.
Preparation of Cell Extracts
Frozen cells were suspended in a double volume of 20 mM
Tris–HCl (pH 7.8) containing 0.1 mg ml −1 DNase I. The cell
suspensions were passed twice through a chilled French pressure
cell at 137 MPa, and the cell lysates were centrifuged for 1 h
(100,000 ×g; 4◦C). The supernatant (cell extract) was used for
protein puriﬁcation or enzyme assays immediately.
Cloning of M. sedulaGenes in E. coli
Standard protocols were used for puriﬁcation, cloning,
transformation, and ampliﬁcation of DNA (Ausubel et al.,
1987). Plasmid DNA was isolated with the Monarch Plasmid
Miniprep Kit (NEB). Primers and restriction enzymes used for
the cloning of M. sedula genes are listed in Supplementary
Table S1. The genes were ampliﬁed using Q5 polymerase (NEB).
PCR conditions were as follows: 35 cycles of 10-s denaturation
at 98 ◦C, 30-s primer annealing at 60 ◦C and 30-s elongation at
72◦C. The PCR products were treated with the corresponding
restrictases ( Supplementary Table S1 ), and the genes were
separately ligated into the expression vector pET16b containing a
sequence encoding an N-terminal His 10-tag. The plasmids were
transformed into E. coli DH5α for ampliﬁcation, followed by
their puriﬁcation and sequencing.
Heterologous Expression of M. sedula
Genes in E. coli
The ampliﬁed expression vectors were used to transform E. coli
Rosetta 2 (DE3). The cells were grown at 37 ◦C in LB medium
with ampicillin and chloramphenicol. Expression was induced at
an optical density (OD 578 nm ) of 0.6 with 1 mM isopropyl-ﬂ- D-
thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG), and the temperature was lowered
to 20◦C. The cells were harvested after additional growth for 4 h
and stored at −20◦C until use.
Puriﬁcation of Recombinant Proteins
Recombinant crotonyl-CoA hydratase/( S)-3-hydroxybutyryl-
CoA dehydrogenase Msed_0399 was produced untagged.
The protein was puriﬁed as described previously (Ramos-
Vera et al., 2011). The heterologously produced His 10-tagged
(S)-3-hydroxybutyryl-CoA dehydrogenases Msed_1423 and
Msed_0389 as well as crotonyl-CoA hydratases Msed_0336
and Msed_0384 were puriﬁed using aﬃnity chromatography.
The corresponding cell extracts were applied at a ﬂow rate of

0.5 ml min −1 to a 1-ml Protino Ni-NTA column (Macherey-
Nagel) that had been equilibrated with 20 mM Tris–HCl
containing 150 mM KCl (pH 7.8 for Msed_1423 and Msed_0389,
pH 7.6 for Msed_0384, and pH 8.0 for Msed_0336). The column
was washed with the same buﬀer containing 50 mM imidazole
at a ﬂow rate of 0.5 ml min −1 to elute unwanted protein.
The recombinant enzymes were eluted with the same buﬀer
containing 500 mM imidazole. The enzymes were concentrated
using 10K Vivaspin Turbo 4 (Sartorius, Göttingen, Germany)
and stored at −20◦C with 50% glycerol. The identity of the
puriﬁed recombinant proteins was conﬁrmed using gel digestion
by trypsin followed by LC-MS/MS (Supplementary Table S2).
Enzyme Assays
The 3-hydroxybutyryl-CoA dehydratase and 3-
hydroxypropionyl-CoA dehydratase activities were measured at
42◦C. All other enzyme activities were measured at 65◦C.
Crotonyl-CoA Hydratase
Crotonyl-CoA hydratase activity was measured using ultra-high-
performance liquid chromatography (UHPLC) by monitoring
crotonyl-CoA-dependent formation of 3-hydroxybutyryl-CoA.
The reaction mixture (20 µl) contained 100 mM Tris–HCl (pH
7.8), 1 mM crotonyl-CoA, and puriﬁed enzyme. The reaction
was stopped after 1 min by the addition of 20 µl of 1 M
HCl/10% acetonitrile. Protein was removed by centrifugation,
and the samples were analyzed by UHPLC using a reverse-phase
(RP) C 18 column. For Km determination, the concentration of
crotonyl-CoA was varied (0.01–5 mM). For the measurement of
crotonyl-CoA hydratase activity of Msed_0399, 100 mM Tris–
HCl (pH 9) was used.
3-Hydroxybutyryl-CoA Dehydratase
3-Hydroxybutyryl-CoA dehydratase activity was measured
spectrophotometrically by coupling the reaction to crotonyl-
CoA carboxylase/reductase (Ccr) from Rhodobacter sphaeroides
which reductively carboxylates crotonyl-CoA and acryloyl-CoA
to ethylmalonyl-CoA and methylmalonyl-CoA, respectively
(Erb et al., 2009). The reaction mixture (20 µl) contained
100 mM Tris–HCl (pH 7.8), 1 mM 3-hydroxybutyryl-CoA,
1 mM NADPH, 0.1 mg ml −1 Ccr, 50 mM NaHCO 3, and
puriﬁed enzyme. The reaction was stopped as described above,
and the samples were analyzed by RP-C 18 UHPLC. For Km
determination, the concentration of 3-hydroxybutyryl-CoA was
varied (0.01–4 mM).
3-Hydroxypropionyl-CoA Dehydratase
3-Hydroxypropionyl-CoA dehydratase was measured
spectrophotometrically as 3-hydroxypropionyl-CoA-
dependent acryloyl-CoA formation by coupling the reaction
to Ccr. The reaction mixture (20 µl) contained 100 mM
MOPS/KOH (pH 7.0), 1 mM 3-hydroxypropionyl-CoA,
1 mM NADPH, 0.1 mg ml −1 Ccr, 50 mM NaHCO 3, and
puriﬁed enzyme. The reaction was stopped as described above,
and the samples were analyzed by RP-C 18 UHPLC. For Km
determination, the concentration of 3-hydroxypropionyl-CoA
was varied (0.01–1.5 mM).
Acryloyl-CoA Hydratase
Acryloyl-CoA hydratase activity was measured using UHPLC
by monitoring 3-hydroxypropionyl-CoA formation from
acryloyl-CoA. The reaction mixture (20 µl) contained
100 mM Tris–HCl (pH 7.8), 1 mM acryloyl-CoA, and
puriﬁed enzyme. The reaction was stopped as described
above, and the samples were analyzed by RP-C 18 UHPLC.
For Km determination, the concentration of acryloyl-CoA was
varied (0.02–4 mM).
Methacrylyl-CoA Hydratase
Methacrylyl-CoA hydratase activity was measured using UHPLC
by monitoring 3-hydroxy-2-methylpropionyl-CoA formation
from methacrylyl-CoA. The reaction mixture (20 µl) contained
100 mM Tris–HCl (pH 7.8), 1 mM methacrylyl-CoA, and
puriﬁed enzyme. The reaction was stopped as described above,
and the samples were analyzed by RP-C 18 UHPLC. For
Km determination, the concentration of methacrylyl-CoA was
varied (0.01–5 mM).
(E)-2-Octenoyl-CoA Hydratase
(E)-2-octenoyl-CoA hydratase activity was measured with
UHPLC by monitoring 3-hydroxyoctanoyl-CoA formation from
(E)-2-octenoyl-CoA. The reaction mixture (20 µl) contained
100 mM Tris–HCl (pH 7.8), 1 mM ( E)-2-octenoyl-CoA, and
puriﬁed enzyme. The reaction was stopped as described above,
and the samples were analyzed by RP-C 18 UHPLC. For Km
determination, the concentration of ( E)-2-octenoyl-CoA was
varied (0.01–2 mM).
Analytical UHPLC
CoA and CoA-esters were detected with Agilent 1290 Inﬁnity II
UHPLC using a reversed-phase C18 column (Agilent InﬁnityLab
Poroshell 120 EC-C18 1.9 µm 2.1 ×50 mm column). The
following acetonitrile gradient in 10 mM potassium phosphate
buﬀer (pH 7), with a ﬂow rate of 0.55 ml min −1, was
used: from 2 to 8% at 0–2.66 min; from 8 to 30% at 2.66–
3.33 min; from 30 to 2% at 3.33–3.68 min; 2% at 3.68–
5 min. Retention times were: 2-methylmalonyl-CoA, 0.9 min;
3-hydroxypropionyl-CoA, 1.4 min; acetyl-CoA, 1.6 min; 3-
hydroxybutyryl-CoA, 1.8 min; 3-hydroxy-2-methylpropionyl-
CoA, 2.0 min; acryloyl-CoA, 2.2 min; propionyl-CoA, 2.4 min;
crotonyl-CoA, 2.6 min; methacrylyl-CoA, 2.9 min. For the
conversions with ( E)-2-octenoyl-CoA, the following acetonitrile
gradient in 10 mM potassium phosphate buﬀer (pH 6.8),
with a ﬂow rate of 0.55 ml min −1, was used: from 2
to 30% at 0–3.33 min; from 30 to 2% at 3.33–3.68 min;

Apparent Km and Vmax values were calculated using GraphPad
Prism5 software. Protein concentration was determined using the
Bradford method (Bradford, 1976) with bovine serum albumin
as a standard. DNA sequence determination was performed
by Euroﬁns (Ebersberg, Germany). Sodium dodecyl sulfate-
polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) (12.5%) was
performed as described by Laemmli (1970). An unstained
protein MW marker (Thermo Scientiﬁc, 14.4-116 kDa) and a
prestained protein marker (Cell Signaling, 11-190 kDa) were
used as molecular mass standard. Proteins were visualized by
Coomassie blue staining (Zehr et al., 1989). Protein identiﬁcation
was performed at the IZKF Core Unit Proteomics Münster
based on tryptic in-gel digestion and mass spectrometric analysis
using Synapt G2 Si coupled to M-Class (Waters Corp.). Query
sequences for the database searches were obtained from the
National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) data
base. The BLAST searches were performed via NCBI BLAST
server1 (Altschul et al., 1990).
RESULTS
Catalytic Properties of Bifunctional
Crotonyl-CoA
Hydratase/(S)-3-Hydroxybutyryl-CoA
Dehydrogenase Msed_0399
Msed_0399 is a bifunctional crotonyl-CoA hydratase/( S)-3-
hydroxybutyryl-CoA dehydrogenase consisting of two domains,
a C-terminal enoyl-CoA hydratase domain ( ∼20 kDa) and
an N-terminal dehydrogenase domain ( ∼40 kDa) (Ramos-
Vera et al., 2011). This enzyme is widely distributed among
Archaea and has been predicted to be present in the common
ancestor of the TACK superphylum, i.e., it was already
present in the common ancestor of Cren- and Thaumarchaeota
(Williams et al., 2017). The enzyme was puriﬁed formerly
from autotrophically grown M. sedula cells, following the
reduction of NAD with crotonyl-CoA, i.e., the presence of both
crotonase and dehydrogenase reactions simultaneously (Ramos-
Vera et al., 2011). The identiﬁed msed_0399 was cloned and
heterologously produced, and the recombinant enzyme was
characterized (Ramos-Vera et al., 2011; Hawkins et al., 2014).
However, the characterization was preliminary, as the activity was
measured only as crotonyl-CoA or ( S)-3-hydroxybutyryl-CoA-
dependent NAD reduction (Ramos-Vera et al., 2011; Hawkins
et al., 2014). The measured hydratase activity in the coupled
assay was necessarily limited by the level of the much lower
dehydrogenase activity.
In order to ﬁll this gap, we heterologously produced and
puriﬁed the bifunctional protein Msed_0399, and characterized
the enzyme by measuring dehydrogenase and crotonase reactions
separately. In hydratase reaction, Msed_0399 was promiscuous
and could hydrate not only crotonyl-CoA, but also ( E)-2-
octenoyl-CoA and acrylyl-CoA ( Table 2 ). Similarly, it acted
1http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/BLAST/
as dehydrogenase with both C 4 and C 8 (S)-3-hydroxyacyl-
CoAs ( Table 2 ). Interestingly, the enzyme was most active
with octenoyl-CoA, thus suggesting that Msed_0399 may
participate in β-oxidation, in addition to autotrophic CO 2
ﬁxation. Importantly, Msed_0399 is the only 3-hydroxyacyl-
CoA dehydrogenase that was active with C 8 (3-hydroxy)acyl-
CoAs ( Tables 2 , 3), further suggesting its participation in
heterotrophic metabolism.
Crotonyl-CoA Hydratase and
(S)-3-Hydroxybutyryl-CoA
Dehydrogenase Activities in M. sedula
Cell Extract
The apparent Km value of Msed_0399 for crotonyl-CoA in the
crotonase/(S)-3-hydroxybutyryl-CoA dehydrogenase reaction
was four times higher than the corresponding value in M. sedula
cell extract ( Table 2 ) suggesting the presence of additional
crotonase(s). Furthermore, the apparent Km value of Msed_0399
for ( S)-3-hydroxybutyryl-CoA in the dehydrogenase reaction
was three times higher than the corresponding value in M.
sedula cell extract (Table 2). These data suggest that Msed_0399
may not be the only enzyme responsible for crotonyl-CoA
hydratase and (S)-3-hydroxybutyryl-CoA dehydrogenase activity
in autotrophically grown M. sedula . Therefore, we cloned and
expressed other candidate genes for these enzymes ( Table 1 )
in E. coli and characterized the catalytic activities of the
resulting enzymes.
3-Hydroxybutyryl-CoA Dehydrogenases
Msed_0389 and Msed_1423
The puriﬁed recombinant Msed_0389 and Msed_1423 catalyzed
the NAD-dependent oxidation of ( S)-3-hydroxybutyryl-CoA to
acetoacetyl-CoA and were highly speciﬁc for their substrate
(Km 2.6 and 5 µM, respectively; Table 3 ). Both enzymes
were not active with ( S)-3-hydroxyoctanoyl-CoA. Their kcat/Km
values were 3- and 20-fold higher than the corresponding value
of Msed_0399 in ( S)-3-hydroxybutyryl-CoA dehydrogenase
reaction ( Table 3). Interestingly, both these genes were shown
to be up-regulated in auto- and mixotrophically grown cell (see
Table 1; Auernik and Kelly, 2010; Ai et al., 2019). The Msed_0389
gene clustered together with various β-oxidation genes in the
M. sedula genome. In contrast, msed_1423 clustered with several
genes encoding speciﬁc enzymes of the HP/HB cycle, suggesting
its involvement in autotrophic CO2 ﬁxation (Figure 2).
Crotonyl-CoA Hydratases Msed_0336
and Msed_0384
The puriﬁed recombinant Msed_0336 and Msed_0384 catalyzed
the hydration of crotonyl-CoA to ( S)-3-hydroxybutyryl-CoA
(Table 4); the kcat/Km values of both enzymes for the reverse
reaction were ∼2.5 times higher. Both enzymes were also active
with ( E)-2-octenoyl-CoA and, to a lesser extent, with acrylyl-
CoA and methacrylyl-CoA. TheVmax values of these enzymes for
crotonyl-CoA hydration were lower than theVmax of Msed_0399;
yet their apparent crotonyl-CoA Km values were also much
lower, resulting in a catalytic constant kcat/Km similar to that

genes conforms with its higher kcat/Km value for octenoyl-
CoA. Nevertheless, it is Msed_0399 which has the highest
kcat/Km value for this substrate. In the published transcriptomic
analyses, Msed_0384 was shown to be down-regulated in auto-
and mixotrophically grown cell, while Msed_0336 showed no
signiﬁcant regulation in these cells (see Table 1; Auernik and
Kelly, 2010; Ai et al., 2019).
Distribution of Crotonase and
(S)-3-Hydroxybutyryl-CoA
Dehydrogenase Genes in Sulfolobales
The genes of the HP/HB cycle catalyzing reactions from
acetyl-CoA to crotonyl-CoA are present in all fully sequenced
Sulfolobales genomes ( Supplementary Table S3 ), indicating
that they have the potential to grow autotrophically. The
only exception was Sulfodiicoccus acidiphilus that does
not possess most of the key genes of the HP/HB cycle.
This species is only distantly related to other Sulfolobales
and is not capable to grow autotrophically (Sakai and
Kurosawa, 2017, 2019). On the contrary, most of the other
Sulfolobales are autotrophs, with the exception of Sulfolobus
acidocaldarius and Saccharolobus solfataricus that nevertheless
encode all key genes of the HP/HB cycle in their genomes
(Supplementary Table S3).
Homolog(s) of bifunctional crotonyl-CoA hydratase/( S)-3-

species ( Acidianus ambivalens , Acidianus hospitalis , Acidianus
sulﬁdivorans, and Stygiolobus azoricus ) do not possess the
corresponding gene ( Table 5 ). Notably, the functioning of
the HP/HB cycle was experimentally shown for S. azoricus
(Berg et al., 2010b), indicating that the presence of the
bifunctional protein is not essential for autotrophic CO 2
ﬁxation. The only two genes that are (almost) universally
distributed in Sulfolobales are the crotonase Msed_0566
gene and the dehydrogenase Msed_1423 gene ( Table 5 and
Supplementary Table S3). They are absent only in the genome
of S. acidocaldarius.
DISCUSSION
Genome analysis shows that M. sedula and most other
Sulfolobales have multiple homologs of genes responsible for the
conversion of crotonyl-CoA into acetyl-CoA, and our data indeed
suggest that crotonyl-CoA hydratase and ( S)-3-hydroxybutyryl-
CoA dehydrogenase reactions may be catalyzed by several
proteins in vivo . It is probably also true for the β-ketothiolase
reaction cleaving acetoacetyl-CoA into two molecules of acetyl-
CoA, as at least one of the homologous genes ( msed_0386) is
up-regulated under mixo- and autotrophic growth conditions,
in addition to the characterized β-ketothiolase Msed_0656 gene
(Table 1 ; Auernik and Kelly, 2010; Hawkins et al., 2013a;
Ai et al., 2019). The studied crotonases are homologous to
3-hydroxypropionyl-CoA dehydratase Msed_2001 and possess
low 3-hydroxypropionyl-CoA dehydratase activity ( Table 2 ),
thus probably also contributing to 3-hydroxypropionyl-CoA
dehydratase activity in the cells. 3-Hydroxypropionyl-CoA
dehydratase, in turn, has crotonase activity (Teufel et al.,
2009). Although analysis of deletion mutants would be very
helpful to clarify the role of individual proteins in autotrophic
CO2 ﬁxation, genetic system is unfortunately not available for
autotrophic Sulfolobales.
In contrast to the current understanding, our data show that
the bifunctional crotonyl-CoA hydratase/( S)-3-hydroxybutyryl-
CoA dehydrogenase is not the main enzyme that catalyzes
these reactions in M. sedula. This is corroborated by the
fact that its gene is absent in many other autotrophic
Sulfolobales. In fact, msed_0399 is located in the cluster
with the genes homologous to various β-oxidation genes
(Figure 2A ) and may thus be primarily involved in, e.g.,
fatty acid metabolism rather than CO 2 ﬁxation ( Table 2 ).
Although the growth of M. sedula on fatty acids has not
been shown, some Sulfolobales are capable to use these
compounds as a sole carbon source (Wang et al., 2019).
Furthermore, reversibility of β-oxidation enzymes in Archaea
and their involvement in fatty acid synthesis was proposed
(Dibrova et al., 2014).
Interestingly and in contrast to Sulfolobales, the
homologous bifunctional protein is the only enzyme capable
to covert crotonyl-CoA into acetoacetyl-CoA in autotrophic
Desulfurococcales ( Ignicoccus hospitalis ) and Thermoproteales
(Pyrobaculum neutrophilus ) that use the dicarboxylate/4-
hydroxybutyrate cycle for CO 2 ﬁxation (Huber et al., 2008;
Ramos-Vera et al., 2009, 2011). This cycle diﬀers from the
HP/HB cycle in the carboxylation reactions (ferredoxin-
dependent pyruvate synthase and phosphoenolpyruvate
carboxylase) but shares the regeneration part, i.e., the
conversion of succinyl-CoA into acetyl-CoA that includes
crotonase and ( S)-3-hydroxybutyryl-CoA dehydrogenase
reactions. The anaerobic dicarboxylate/4-hydroxybutyrate
cycle is probably the ancestral CO 2 ﬁxation pathway in
Crenarchaeota, and the presence of the bifunctional protein
widely distributed among Archaea seems to be an ancestral
feature for the pathway.
Nevertheless, even if several enzymes catalyze one and the
same reactions in M. sedula , our biochemical data ( Table 3 )
and the results of our gene distribution analysis ( Table 5 )
together with the published transcriptomic data (see Table 1)
show that Msed_1423 is the main ( S)-3-hydroxybutyryl-CoA
dehydrogenase in the HP/HB cycle in Sulfolobales. This
protein is clustered together with two speciﬁc enzymes of
the HP/HB cycle, succinic semialdehyde reductase Msed_1424
and acryloyl-CoA reductase Msed_1426 ( Figure 2B ), further
supporting its involvement in autotrophic CO 2 ﬁxation. The

The crotonase homolog, Msed_0566, was the only
monofunctional crotonase (besides the promiscuous 3-

Sulfolobales except for the heterotrophic S. acidocaldarius
(Table 5 ). Unfortunately, all our attempts to heterologously
express msed_0566 (as well as msed_0385) were not successful
and resulted in insoluble protein. It is to be shown whether
this protein is the primary crotonyl-CoA hydratase in M.
sedula and especially in S. azoricus , A. ambivalens , and
A. hospitalis (Table 5 ), or this reaction is also catalyzed
by a promiscuous 3-hydroxypropionyl-CoA dehydratase,
as was shown for the HP/HB cycle in Thaumarchaeota
(Könneke et al., 2014).

Liu et al. 3-Hydroxypropionate/4-Hydroxybutyrate Cycle in Metallosphaera sedula
The inability of S. acidocaldarius to grow autotrophically is
well-known (Berg et al., 2010b; Zeldes et al., 2019). It has recently
been suggested that the obligate heterotrophy of this organism is
rooted rather in gene regulation than in the biochemical capacity
(Zeldes et al., 2019). Our data suggest that this inability is likely
due to the absence of the Msed_1423 (and possibly Msed_0566)
homologs in this species.
Comparison of the activities of the characterized ( S)-3-
hydroxybutyryl-CoA dehydrogenase Msed_1423 and crotonase
Msed_0384 with the activities of these reactions in cell extract
of M. sedula leads to the values 1.7 and 7.1% of total
cellular protein, respectively. The last value was calculated based
on the activity of crotonase found in our work ( Table 2 ),
which is twice higher than the previously measured activity
(Berg et al., 2007; see Table 1). With these corrected values, the
estimated abundance of the HP/HB cycle enzymes is ∼47%
of total cellular protein, i.e., 11% less than was calculated
in Table 1 . This value may further be corrected (reduced?)
after the characterization of the further crotonase homologs
in M. sedula.
The studied enzymes were promiscuous, diﬀering in their
kinetic properties. Their simultaneous presence not only
increases the activity of particular reactions, but also allows
fast and eﬃcient ﬁne-tuning of metabolism and adaptation to
diﬀerent growth conditions, varying metabolite concentrations
and growth rates. This strategy may be especially advantageous
for metabolically versatile organisms that are not limited
in energy source.
The HP/HB cycle is a perspective route for the conversion
of CO 2 into liquid fuels and industrial chemicals and can be
engineered for the production of value-added compounds like
3-hydroxypropionate or n-butanol (Hawkins et al., 2011, 2013b;
Keller et al., 2013; Fuchs and Berg, 2014; Loder et al., 2016). The
identiﬁcation of highly speciﬁc thermophilic enzymes involved
in this pathway expands opportunities for the application
of the pathway. Simultaneous usage of several isoenzymes
diﬀering in their kinetic properties is an interesting concept
for biotechnology that may allow stable production under
varying conditions.
