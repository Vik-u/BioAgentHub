Abstract
Recently, evidence suggests that dark CO2 ﬁxation in the pelagic realm of the
ocean does not only occur in the suboxic and anoxic water bodies but also in
the oxygenated meso- and bathypelagic waters of the North Atlantic. To eluci-
date the signiﬁcance and phylogeny of the key organisms mediating dark CO2
ﬁxation in the tropical Atlantic, we quantiﬁed functional genes indicative for
CO2 ﬁxation. We used a Q-PCR-based assay targeting the bifunctional acetyl-
CoA/propionyl-CoA carboxylase (accA subunit), a key enzyme poweringinter
alia the 3-hydroxypropionate/4-hydroxybutyrate cycle (HP/HB) and the archa-
eal ammonia monooxygenase ( amoA). Quantiﬁcation of accA-like genes
revealed a consistent depth proﬁle in the upper mesopelagial with increasing
gene abundances from subsurface layers towards the oxygen minimum zone
(OMZ), coinciding with an increase in archaealamoA gene abundance. Gene
abundance proﬁles of metabolic marker genes (accA, amoA) were correlated
with thaumarchaeal 16S rRNA gene abundances as well as CO2 ﬁxation rates
to link the genetic potential to actual rate measurements. AccA gene abun-
dances correlated with archaeal amoA gene abundance throughout the water
column (r2 = 0.309, P < 0.0001). Overall, a substantial genetic predisposition
of CO2 ﬁxation was present in the dark realm of the tropical Atlantic in both
Archaea and Bacteria. Hence, dark ocean CO2 ﬁxation might be more wide-
spread among prokaryotes inhabiting the oxygenated water column of the
ocean’s interior than hitherto assumed.
Introduction
About two decades ago, molecular analyses have revealed
that mesophilicArchaea [Thaumarchaeota (Brochier-Arma-
net et al., 2008), previously coined marine Crenarchaeota
Group I, and Group II Euryarchaeota] are ubiquitously
present in the global ocean.
The ability of some marine archaeal groups to incorpo-
rate dissolved amino acids (Ouverney & Fuhrman, 2000;
Teira et al., 2006b) hints at a heterotrophic life mode.
Compound-speciﬁc isotope analyses of thaumarchaeal
lipids, however, revealed a chemoautotrophic lifestyle
(Pearson et al., 2001; Wuchter et al., 2003). Pronounced
differences in the D14C signature of thaumarchaeal DNA
were found at a Paciﬁc site at 670 and 900 m depth,
indicating a preferential auto- and heterotrophic thaum-
archaeal life mode, respectively (Hansman et al., 2009).
Experimental work and genomic analysis usingNitrosop-
umilus maritimus , Cenarchaeum symbiosum and an
enrichment culture obtained from the coastal North Sea
(K€onneke et al., 2005; Hallam et al., 2006a; Ingalls et al.,
2006; Wuchter et al., 2006; Martens-Habbena et al.,
2009) indicate that these members of theThaumarchaeota
are ammonia oxidizer (AOA) and hence chemolithoauto-
trophs.
The ﬁrst step in ammonia oxidation is enzymatically
catalysed by ammonia monooxygenase, and the encoding
amoA gene is currently the most commonly used marker
to determine the abundance of putatively ammonia-
oxidizing prokaryotes in environmental studies. Numerous

quantitative analyses have revealed that archaeal amoA
genes dominate over bacterialamoA genes in soil as well
as in marine and freshwater systems, tentatively suggest-
ing that Crenarchaeota might be the main ammonia
oxidizers in most environments (Treusch et al., 2005;
Wuchter et al., 2006; Francis et al., 2007; Beman et al.,
2008; Merbt et al., 2011). Hence, the oxidation of ammo-
nia by AOA has been generally assumed to be the main
energy source for dark carbon metabolism.
Apart from the prevalent pathway of carbon ﬁxation, the
Calvin–Bassham–Benson cycle (CBB), carried out by plants,
algae and mostly photosynthetic bacteria, novel CO
2 ﬁxation
pathways, such as the 3-hydroxypropionate/4-hydroxybuty-
rate (HP/HB) and dicarboxylate/4-hydroxybutyrate cycle
(DC/4-HB), were found to exclusively operate inArchaea
(Berg et al., 2007, 2010; Huber et al., 2008; Ramos-Vera
et al., 2009). These metabolic pathways require unique and
conserved enzymes that might serve as biomarkers for dark
CO
2 ﬁxation. A key multifunctional enzyme of the HP/HB
cycle, which is typically responsible for the synthesis of fatty
acids in Bacteria, is the biotin-dependent acetyl-CoA/propi-
onyl-CoA carboxylase complex (ACCase) (Moss & Lane,
1971; Chuakrutet al., 2003). Due to the lack of fatty acids
in archaeal lipids, the enzyme is thought to mediate auto-
trophic carbon assimilation via the HP/HB cycle (Chuakrut
et al.,2 0 0 3 ;H€ugler et al.,2 0 0 3 ) .
Additionally to dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) ﬁxa-
tion through autotrophic pathways, many carboxylases
substantially contribute to the acquisition of carbon via
assimilatory reactions as well as so-called anaplerotic reac-
tion sequences (Werkman & Wood, 1942; Erb, 2011).
While assimilatory carboxylases allow for a DIC ‘by-
uptake’, anaplerotic reactions are ‘reﬁlling’ the pools of
tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle intermediates, intimately
involved in the energy metabolism of cells. While anaple-
rotic CO
2 ﬁxation of heterotrophic Bacteria has been
shown to occur in laboratory cultures, particularly associ-
ated with the uptake of labile substrate (Dijkhuizen &
Harder, 1995), its contribution to the measured dark CO
2
ﬁxation in oceanic water remains enigmatic (Romanenko,
1964; Sorokin, 1993; Dijkhuizen & Harder, 1995; Alonso-
Saez et al., 2010; Reinthaleret al., 2010).
The objective of this study was to determine the rela-
tive abundance and distribution of putatively chemoauto-
trophic prokaryotes in the dark realm of the Atlantic. We
aimed at linking the genes indicative of chemoautotrophy
and their abundance to dark DIC ﬁxation. The abun-
dances of Archaea-speciﬁc accA genes were determined by
Q-PCR and related to archaeal 16S rRNA andamoA gene
abundances, as well as to DIC ﬁxation rates. Based on
our data, we conclude that meso- and bathypelagic
prokaryotes might have a larger potential for autotrophy
than assumed hitherto.
Material and methods
Sample collection
Water samples were collected from the major water masses
throughout the water column (from the lower euphotic to
the abyssopelagic zone) at 17 stations (Sts. 8–26) along a
transect through the Romanche Fracture Zone (RFZ) in
the tropical Atlantic during the Archimedes-3 cruise with
RV Pelagia from December 2007 to January 2008 (Fig. 1).
The physical and chemical characteristics of the sampled
water masses are given in Table 1. Speciﬁcally, water was
collected from the lower euphotic layer at 100 m depth,
the South Atlantic Central Water (SACW) exhibiting an
oxygen minimum, the Antarctic Intermediate Water
(AAIW), the upper (uNADW), middle (mNADW) and
lower North Atlantic Deep Water (lNADW) and the
Antarctic Bottom Water (AABW) (Table 1). From these
water masses, samples for prokaryotic variables (described
below) as well as a suite of other microbial parameters
(De Corteet al., 2011) were taken. Also, samples were col-
lected to determine inorganic nutrient concentrations
(Table 1) using standard spectrophotometric methods and
a TRAACS autoanalyzer (Gordonet al., 1993).

Picoplankton abundance determined by ﬂow
cytometry
Picoplankton collected from the different water masses
were enumerated by ﬂow cytometry. Water samples
(2 mL) were ﬁxed with 0.5% glutaraldehyde (ﬁnal con-
centration), shock-frozen in liquid nitrogen for 5 min
and stored at /C080 °C. Immediately before analysis, the
samples were thawed and the picoplankton cells stained
with SYBR Green I at room temperature in the dark for
15 min and enumerated on a FACScalibur ﬂow cytometer
(Becton Dickinson) equipped with a 488-nm laser. Fluo-
rescent microspheres (1 lm diameter, Molecular Probes)
were added to all samples as an internal standard. Pico-
plankton cells were identiﬁed based on their characteristic
right angle scatter vs. green ﬂuorescence signature.
Dark dissolved inorganic carbon ﬁxation
14C-bicarbonate ﬁxation in the dark was used to deter-
mine the bulk autotrophic activity of the prokaryotic
community as described previously (Herndlet al., 2005).
Brieﬂy, 40 mL of seawater [samples and formaldehyde-
ﬁxed blanks (2% ﬁnal conc.) each in triplicate] were
spiked with
14C-bicarbonate (100 lCi; SA 54.0 mCi
mmol/C01; Amersham) and incubated in the dark atin situ
temperature for 48–72 h. Subsequently, the samples were
ﬁxed with formaldehyde (2% ﬁnal conc.), ﬁltered onto
0.2-lm-pore-size ﬁlters (Millipore, polycarbonate, 25 mm
ﬁlter diameter) supported by HAWP ﬁlters (Millipore,
cellulose acetate, 0.45 lm pore-size) and rinsed three
times with 10 mL of ultra-ﬁltered seawater (30-kDa
molecular weight cut-off). Thereafter, the ﬁlters were
exposed to a fume of concentrated HCl for 12 h and
placed in scintillation vials. Scintillation cocktail (8 mL
Canberra-Packard Filter Count) was added, and after
18 h, the sample counted in a liquid scintillation counter
(Tri-Carb 3100TR, PerkinElmer) on board RV Pelagia.
The mean disintegrations per minute (DPM) of the form-
aldehyde-ﬁxed blanks were subtracted from the mean
DPM of the respective samples and the resulting DPM
converted into DIC ﬁxation rates taking into account the
ambient DIC concentration measured by continuous-ﬂow
analysis (Stoll et al., 2001).
DNA extraction
Ten litres of seawater were ﬁltered through 0.2-lm Steri-
vex ﬁlter units (Millipore), and thereafter, 1.8 mL of lysis
buffer (40 mM EDTA, 50 mM Tris-HCL, 0.75 M sucrose)
was added to the ﬁlter cartridges, sealed at both ends with
Paraﬁlm and stored in the dark at /C080 °C. Back in the
laboratory, the Sterivex ﬁlter cartridges were cracked open
and the lysis solution with the Sterivex ﬁlters transferred
to sterile 50-mL centrifuge tubes. DNA extraction was car-
ried out with the Mega Soil DNA extraction kit (MoBio
laboratories, Carlsbad, CA) according to the manufac-
turer’s protocol. Subsequently, isolated DNA was further
concentrated (approximately 10 times) with a Centricon
device (Millipore).
Evaluating the primer set for detecting accA
genes
The annealing temperatures for the primer set Crena_
529F/Crena_981R (Yakimov et al., 2009), speciﬁcally tar-
geting archaeal acetyl-CoA carboxylase alpha subunit
(accA), were tested by a temperature gradient as follows:
denaturation at 94°C for 4 min; 35 cycles of denaturation
at 94 °C for 40 s, annealing at 45–55 °C for 40 s and
extension at 72 °C for 90 s, followed by an extension at
72 °C for 10 min and cooling at 4°C. PCR products were
checked on a 2% agarose gel. The optimal annealing
temperature was at 51 °C for accA primer set. PCR
products of the expected size were obtained from enrichment
cultures (Nitrosopumilus maritimus, Sulfolobus solfataricus,

to encode a bifunctional acetyl-CoA/propionyl-CoA
carboxylase.
Quantitative PCR (Q-PCR) accA, archaeal amoA,
archaeal 16S rRNA genes
All Q-PCRs were performed using an iCycler iQ 5 ther-
mocycler (Bio-Rad) and i-Cycler iQ software (version 3.1,
Bio-Rad). The reaction mixture was composed of 1 U of
PicoMaxx high ﬁdelity DNA polymerase (Stratagene),
2 lLo f1 0 9 PicoMaxx PCR buffer, 0.25 mM of each
dNTP, 8 lg of BSA, 0.2lM of each primer, 50 000 times
diluted SYBR Green
/C226 (Invitrogen), and a ﬁnal concentra-
tion of 10 nM of ﬂuorescein, 3 mM of MgCl2,1 lLo f
template DNA (average concentration 11.3 nglL/C01) and
ultrapure sterile water (Sigma) was added to a ﬁnal vol-
ume of 20lL. All reactions were performed in iQ 96-well
PCR plates (Bio-Rad) with optical sealing foils (Bio-Rad).
The speciﬁcity of Q-PCRs was tested by electrophoresis
on a 2% agarose gel and melting curve analysis. Standard
curves were generated using serial dilutions of PCR prod-
ucts of known gene abundance (from 10
7 to 101 gene
copies) obtained with the described primers (Table 2).
The amount of DNA from the PCR products was deter-
mined spectrophotometrically (Nanodrop Technologies,
Rockland, DE), and the gene abundance was calculated
based on the fragment length and the DNA concentra-
tion. Ten-fold serial dilutions of the standard for the spe-
ciﬁc genes and no-DNA controls were run in triplicate
with each plate. The following thermal cycling protocol
was used: initial denaturation at 95 °C for 4 min; 41
cycles at 95°C for 30 s, followed by the respective primer
annealing temperature for 40 s, extension at 72 °C for
30 s and 80°C for 25 s with readings taken between each
cycle. To check for potential PCR artefacts, a melting
curve analysis was performed at this point by monitoring
SYBR Green ﬂuorescence in the temperature ramp 60
to 94 °C with an increase of 0.5 °C and a hold for 1 s
between each read.
The ‘total’ archaealamoA gene abundance was calcu-
lated as the sum of archaeal amoA gene abundances
yielded with the two primer sets Arch- amoA-for and
Arch-amoA-rev as well as Arch-amoA-rev NEW
(Table 2), assuming speciﬁc priming of distinct amoA
gene types.
The efﬁciencies of Q-PCRs were 98% (r
2 = 0.998) and
101% (r2 = 0.999) obtained with the archaealamoAp r i m e r s
of Wuchter et al. (2006) and Konstantinidiset al. (2009),
respectively. Ampliﬁcation efﬁciency for the ACCase-related
primer pair was 73% (r2 = 0.994). The speciﬁcity of PCR
products was conﬁrmed by melting curve analysis and analy-
ses of agarose gels. For Thaumarchaeota, primed with

Statistical analyses
Statistics of Q-PCR data were performed with SigmaPlot,
and linear regressions were calculated between archaeal
amoA and accA gene abundances.
Results
Hydrography
Speciﬁc water masses were sampled as shown by their
distinct physical and chemical characteristics (Table 1).
The highest apparent oxygen utilization (AOU) was
detected in the SACW followed by AAIW and AABW
(Table 1). The two lower NADW layers (mNADW and
lNADW) were characterized by a higher concentration
of silicate than the upper NADW reﬂecting a certain
extent of mixing of the underlying AABW with its char-
acteristically high silicate concentration with NADW
(Table 1).
Picoplankton and archaeal abundance
Picoplankton abundance, determined by ﬂow cytometry,
decreased by one order of magnitude from the 100-m
layer to the abyssopelagic waters with little lateral variabil-
ity throughout the RFZ (Fig. 2a). Picoplankton abundance
varied between 1.8 9 10
5 and 3.5 9 105 cells mL/C01 at
100 m depth, 4.69 104 and 2.4 9 105 cells mL/C01 in the
mesopelagic waters, 1.6 9 104 and 3.3 9 104 cells mL/C01
in the bathypelagic, and between 1.5 9 104 and
3.8 9 104 cells mL/C01 in the abyssopelagic realm (Fig. 2a).
The 16S rRNA gene abundance of Thaumarchaea
obtained by Q-PCR varied by 3 orders of magnitude over
the entire depth range: between 1.5 9 10
4 and 1.7 9
105 mL/C01 in the 100-m layer, 9.7 9 103 and 3.9 9 105
mL/C01 in the mesopelagic, 5.99 102 and 2.9 9 104 mL/C01
in the bathypelagic, and between 1.2 9 102 and
1.6 9 104 mL/C01 in the abyssopelagic waters (Fig. 2b,
Fig. S2). In the oxygen minimum zone (between 250 and
750 m depth), thaumarchaeal 16S rRNA gene abundance
was signiﬁcantly higher (Kruskal–Wallis, one-way
ANOVA;
P /C200.001, for 1750, 2750, 3500, 4500 and 6000 m) than
in the waters below the O 2 minimum layer. Overall,
thaumarchaeal 16S rRNA gene abundances were signiﬁ-
cantly lower in the western than in the eastern part of the
RFZ (
ANOVA on ranks, Kruskal–Wallis, P /C200.001). How-
ever, no signiﬁcant difference ( ANOVA on ranks, Dunn’s
method P /C210.05) was detectable in the thaumarchaeal
16S rRNA gene abundance between the western and
eastern part of the RFZ in the meso- and upper bathype-
lagic waters (200–2500 m, Fig. 2b).
Distribution of carboxylase genes determined
by Q-PCR
The abundance of acetyl-CoA/propionyl-CoA carboxylase
alpha subunit (accA) genes ranged between 1.19 104 and
5.3 9 104 mL/C01 at 100 m depth, 1.1 9 104 and 5.2 9
105 mL/C01 in the mesopelagic, 2.6 9 103 and 4.9 9 104
mL/C01 in the bathypelagic, and between 7.6 9 102 mL/C01
and 4.8 9 104 genes mL/C01 in the abyssopelagic realm
(Fig. 2c, Fig. S2). In the AAIW and SACW, the abundance
of accA genes was similar (
ANOVA on ranks, Kruskal–Wallis,
Dunn’s method,P /C210.05) to thaumarchaeal 16S rRNA
gene abundance (Fig. 2b and c).
Generally, accA gene abundance was higher in the
AAIW, SACW, NADW and the AABW in the eastern
(Sts. 19 –26) than in the western section of the RFZ
(Figs 2c and 3). Total picoplankton, however, did not
increase in abundance from west to east through the RFZ
(Fig. 2a).
Relation between archaeal amoA and accA
gene abundances
The amoA gene encoding the archaeal ammonia monoox-
ygenase-a subunit was quantiﬁed as a proxy for putatively
ammonia-oxidizing Archaea (Fig. 2d). The abundance of
archaeal amoA genes obtained with both primer sets
(Table 2) was summed and related to accA gene abun-
dance (Fig. 4). ArchaealamoA and accA gene abundance
were weakly related to each other over the entire depth
range ( r
2 = 0.309, P < 0.0001, n = 91). Excluding the
data of the 100 m-depth horizon, however, resulted in a
tighter correlation ( r
2 = 0.407, P < 0.0001, n = 80) of
archaeal amoA and accA gene abundance than with the
gene abundances of the 100 m layer included (Fig. 4).
Relation between thaumarchaeal 16S rRNA and
accA gene abundance
The biotin carboxylase alpha subunit was signiﬁcantly
correlated with 16S rRNA gene abundances of Tha-
umarchaeota, excluding the samples from 100 m depth
(accA: r2 = 0.552, P < 0.0001, not shown). Including the
gene abundance obtained in the 100 m layer resulted in a
slightly weaker correlation with accA genes (r
2 = 0.493,
P < 0.0001, not shown). The ratio ofaccA/thaumarchaeal
16S rRNA gene abundance ranged between 0.6 and 5.9
from the subsurface to the bathypelagic layers, respec-
tively (Fig. 3). In the O
2 minimum zone (250–750 m),
this ratio approached roughly unity and remained above

1 towards deeper layers (Fig. 3). No signiﬁcant differences
were found in the accA/thaumarchaeal 16S rRNA gene
ratio between the western and eastern part of the RFZ
(Fig. 3;
ANOVA, Kruskal–Wallis, P > 0.05, respectively).
Dark DIC ﬁxation
Generally, prokaryotic dark DIC ﬁxation rates increased
from 4.3 /C60.7 lmol C m/C03 days/C01 in the 100 m layer to
6.2 /C64.2 lmol C m/C03 days/C01 at 250 m depth (Table 3,
Supporting Information, Fig. S1). Below 250 m depth,
DIC ﬁxation rates were well below 1lmol C m
/C03 days/C01
(Table 3). In the central part of the RFZ (Sts. 16 –19),
higher dark DIC ﬁxation rates were observed in the meso-
pelagic realm than in the marginal regions of the RFZ
ranging from 6.7 to 14.1 lmol C m
/C03 days/C01. Relating
gene abundances to activity rates, only 30% of the varia-
tion in the CO
2 ﬁxation was explained by the summed
abundance of archaeal amoA genes (not shown). A lower
or similar explanatory power was found between DIC ﬁxa-
tion rates and accA (10%) and thaumarchaeal 16S rRNA
(30%) gene abundances (data not shown).
Discussion
In this study, we related the abundance of genes encoding
the archaeal biotin carboxylase and archaeal ammonia
monooxygenase to dark DIC ﬁxation rates, exploring the
genetic potential for chemoautotrophy. The occurrence of
archaeal accA genes and their ubiquitous distribution
throughout the pelagic realm of the open ocean are
highly indicative of a chemoautotrophic lifestyle via the
HP/HB cycle (Wuchter et al., 2006; Berg et al., 2007,
2010; Ward et al., 2007; Auguet et al., 2008; Pratscher
et al., 2011) as archaeal lipids are devoid of fatty acids.
DIC ﬁxation in the dark ocean
Dark carbon metabolism and ﬁxation rates in the oxygen-
ated realm of the global ocean have been of interest for
some time (Prakash et al., 1991), yet the organisms
responsible for it remained ambiguous. Gradually, evi-
dence is accumulating that DIC ﬁxation in the dark ocean

Chemoautotrophic potential in the deep equatorial Atlantic 467
might be more prevalent than hitherto assumed (Auguet
et al., 2008; Alonso-Saez et al., 2010; Hu et al., 2011;
Varela et al., 2011). Measurements by Reinthaler et al.
(2010) indicate dark DIC ﬁxation rates in the meso- and
bathypelagic waters of the North Atlantic amounts to
about 15–53% of the export primary production. Com-
parative studies of prokaryotic heterotrophic biomass
synthesis and DIC ﬁxation in the dark realm of the North
Atlantic revealed that DIC ﬁxation is within the same
order of magnitude as heterotrophic biomass production
(Baltar et al., 2009; Reinthaler et al., 2010). Whether this
DIC ﬁxation is mainly due to autotrophic or heterotro-
phic microorganisms remains uncertain. Some recent
studies emphasize the signiﬁcance of anaplerotic CO
2
conversion (Alonso-Saez et al., 2010; Lliros et al., 2011)
in the context of microbial carbon cycling. Laboratory
studies, however, provide contradictory evidence, showing
that anaplerosis amounts to < 10% of organic carbon
uptake by heterotrophic bacteria (Goldman et al., 1987;
Dijkhuizen & Harder, 1995; Roslevet al., 2004). Anaple-
rosis, as reported by Doronina & Trotsenko (1985),
appears to be stimulated by the presence of easily metab-
olizable organic carbon and consequently might play a
minor role in the DIC ﬁxation in deep waters (Reinthaler
et al., 2010) where the organic carbon pool is largely
refractory (Hansell et al., 2009; Jiaoet al., 2010). A recent
study indicates that members of the SAR324 cluster are
ubiquitous present in the mesopelagic waters of the
Atlantic and Paciﬁc using RuBisCO as DIC acquisition
enzyme (Swan et al., 2011). Hence, neither the extent of
chemoautotrophy nor the potential metabolic pathways
are probably completely known.
In this study, we determined the abundance of the
archaeal accA gene and used it as a marker for DIC ﬁxa-
tion via the HP/HB cycle. This cycle functions in (micro)
aerobic members of the crenarchaeal order Sulfolobales
containing the acetyl-CoA/propionyl-CoA carboxylase for
CO
2 assimilation (Ishii et al., 1996; Menendez et al.,
1999; Berg et al., 2007, 2010; Fuchs, 2011). The presence
of genes encoding the key enzymes in the HP/HB cycle of
Thaumarchaeota suggests that these and related abundant
marine Archaea (Karner et al., 2001) may use a similar
cycle. Key enzymes of the HP/HB cycle, including the
acetyl-CoA/propionyl-CoA carboxylase, were unambigu-
ously identiﬁed, whereas enzymes encoding genes of other
autotrophic pathways were absent in the ammonia-oxidizing
sponge symbiontC. symbiosumand the free-livingN. mari-
timus (K€onneke et al., 2005; Hallam et al., 2006a; Berg
et al., 2007).
Q-PCR proﬁles of accA genes assessed in the western
and eastern part of the longitudinal transect of the RFZ
revealed highly similar tendencies in their distribution
along the depth strata (Fig. 3). The accuracy of determin-
ing the gene abundance of the accA subunit by Q-PCR
depends on the efﬁciency of the Q-PCR and a reliable
standardization of the method. The observed Q-PCR efﬁ-
ciencies varied depending on the primer pair used and
were lower amplifying the accA gene (Yakimov et al.,
2009) than other genes quantiﬁed in this study (Table 2).
Determination of gene numbers and differences in efﬁ-
ciencies can be caused by a number of factors, such as
initial extraction of nucleic acids, preparation and ampli-
ﬁcation of the standard curve template (Love et al.,
2006), the presence of reverse transcriptase, reaction
reagents, fragment size of the target gene and PCR inhibi-
tors. AccA primers, applied in DGGE analyses (Yakimov
et al., 2009) as well as Q-PCR assays (Hu et al., 2011),
yield rather long amplicons (Table 2), possibly impairing
PCR efﬁciencies. However, ampliﬁcation efﬁciencies were
constant throughout our measurements and hence repro-
ducible. We are conﬁdent that reliable estimates of the
different gene abundances were achieved in this study.
DNA extraction efﬁciencies were consistent, yielding
DNA concentrations proportional to total cell counts
(Fig. 2) within discrete depth layers (Table S2). Dilution
series were performeda priori to check on PCR inhibitors

empirically (see Supporting Information, Data S1). Vari-
ance in Ct values of triplicate reactions was higher when
gene abundance was high and ranged between 102 and 104
gene copy numbers (Supporting Information, Table S1).
Fierer et al. (2005), however, showed that varying DNA
concentrations do not result in signiﬁcant changes in
gene abundances, supporting our conclusion of accurate
gene numbers using the Q-PCR assay.
Spatial variations in gene abundances
Prokaryotic abundance (Fig. 2) and dark DIC ﬁxation
(Table 3, Fig. S1) declined exponentially from surface to
abyssopelagic layers as shown in previous studies from the
North Atlantic (Reinthaleret al., 2006; Teiraet al., 2006a;
Varela et al., 2008). Also, a pronounced stratiﬁcation in
the composition of prokaryotic communities in the meso-
and bathypelagic realm in the Atlantic and the Paciﬁc has
been reported (DeLonget al., 2006; Aristeguiet al., 2009;
Agogue et al., 2011). In this study, thaumarchaeal 16S
rRNA gene abundance in the deep waters of the tropical
Atlantic was within the range of abundances previously
found (Varela et al., 2008; De Corte et al., 2009). How-
ever, thaumarchaeal 16S rRNA gene abundance proﬁles
revealed a patchy spatial distribution in the upper meso-
pelagic layer and a more homogenous distribution below
1750 m depth (Fig. 2b). The percentage of thaumarchaeal
16S rRNA genes to total picoplankton counts (determined
by ﬂow cytometry) ranged between ~7% and < 23% in
the AABW, the oxygen minimum layer and in the
lNADW. Similar abundances were also reported using
CARD-FISH (catalyzed reporter deposition-ﬂuorescence
in situ hybridization) (Varela et al., 2008). Hence, inde-
pendent of the quantiﬁcation method used, a coherent
pattern in the distribution of Thaumarchaeota in the
different depth layers of the Atlantic is evident.
In the central-eastern part of the RFZ, the high abun-
dance of thaumarchaeal 16S rRNA genes down to 1750 m
depth (Fig. 2b, Sts. 15 –23) coincided with high DIC
ﬁxation rates (10.5–14 lmol C m
/C03 days/C01) and a high
AOU (~172 lmol O2 kg/C01). While the high AOU may
indicate an increased heterotrophic activity, the high DIC
ﬁxation rates are likely due to the activity of chemoauto-
trophs rather than anaplerotic reactions of heterotrophs
because the autotrophic activity is similar to the mea-
sured heterotrophic prokaryotic biomass production (De
Corte et al., 2010).
Correlating the abundance of biotin carboxylasea-subunit
genes to the 16S rRNA gene abundance ofThaumarchaeota,
ratios close to one were obtained in the central parts of the
RFZ. The high abundance ofaccA genes below 2000 m depth
at Sts. 23 and 25 (Fig. 2c), however, is not reﬂected in
enhanced DIC ﬁxation rates (measured down to 4550 m
depth, Fig. S1) or elevated concentrations of ammonia and/or
nitrite (data not shown). This might indicate that the ecologi-
cal function ofCrenarchaeota is changing across the depth
strata or alternative pathways of DIC ﬁxation are followed.
Similar dynamics have been shown by Grzymskiet al.(2012),
reporting seasonal shifts of chemolithoautotrophic organisms
i ns u r f a c ew a t e r so ft h eA n t a r c t i cP e n i n s u l a .
A positive relation of thaumarchaeal 16S rRNA gene
abundance and the concentration of ammonia (Wuchter
et al., 2006; Kirchman et al., 2007; Varela et al., 2008) as
well as nitrite (Teira et al., 2006a; Lam et al., 2007)
has been reported for surface and mesopelagic waters,
tentatively indicating chemolithoautotrophy of ammonia-
oxidizing Thaumarchaeota. Dark DIC ﬁxation rates nor-
malized to accA gene abundance varied over three to ﬁve
orders of magnitude over all depths sampled (data not
shown) reﬂecting either large variations in the expression
of ACCase and/or a large variability in the enzymes
responsible for CO
2 ﬁxation in the deep ocean.
Relating the gene abundance of archaeal amoA and
thaumarchaeal 16S rRNA genes in the upper 250 m
revealed a ratio ofaccA/thaumarchaeal 16S rRNA gene of
~ 1.2 averaged over the whole transect of the RFZ
(Table 3). Similar values were reported by Alonso-Saez
et al. (2012) in polar oceans and Minceret al. (2007) for
the HOTS station in the Paciﬁc, whereas Beman et al.
(2008) and Wuchter et al. (2006) obtained accA/thau-
marchaeal 16S rRNA gene ratios of about 2.5 and 2.8 in
the Gulf of California and the North Atlantic, respec-
tively. Signiﬁcantly lower accA/thaumarchaeal 16S rRNA
gene ratios (Table 3) were obtained from the lower meso-
and bathypelagic waters of the RFZ, tentatively indicating
that other energy sources than ammonia might be utilized
in the lower meso- and bathypelagic waters.
Archaeal amoA and accA gene abundances were only
weakly correlated over the whole depth range (Fig. 4).
A metagenomic survey by Hallamet al. (2006b) reported
a gene ratio ofaccA/amoA close to one in surface waters.
In our study, the exclusion of the 100-m samples, how-
ever, resulted in a tighter relationship of archaealamoAt o
accA gene abundances. These differences might be caused
by the speciﬁcity of the primers designed based on a few
sequences (Yakimov et al., 2009), possibly failing to target
accA homologues of epipelagicArchaea. Data indicative of
a vertical stratiﬁcation of Crenarchaeota in a ‘shallow-’
and ‘deep-water clade’ have recently been suggested based
on accA gene diversity (Hu et al., 2011; Yakimov et al.,
2011). A genomic and transcriptomic survey in the deep
waters of the Gulf of California also revealed multiple
populations of Crenarchaeota (Baker et al., 2012). Based
on our data, the rather weak correlation between genes
encoding the archaeal ammonia monooxygenase and ace-
tyl-CoA carboxylase suggests that the HP/HB cycle might

Chemoautotrophic potential in the deep equatorial Atlantic 469
be fuelled at least to a certain extent by energy sources
other than ammonia.
The overall ratio of the acetyl-CoA/propionyl-CoA car-
boxylase gene to thaumarchaeal 16S rRNA gene abun-
dance supports the assumption that a major fraction of
Thaumarchaeota is capable of ﬁxing DIC via the HP/HB
cycle. Assuming the accA gene is present as a single copy
in the crenarchaeal genome (K€onneke et al., 2005; Hallam
et al., 2006a), its abundances matches roughly those of
thaumarchaeal cells in the SACW and AAIW (Fig. 3). In
the water layers of the NADW and AABW, the ratio of
accA/thaumarchaeal 16S genes increased to 3.8 and 5.5,
respectively. Highest accA gene abundance (1.14 9 10
5
genes mL/C01) was obtained in the oxygen minimum zone
(200–750 m depth) corresponding to the highest abun-
dance of thaumarchaeal 16S rRNA genes. In a previous
study, high accA gene abundance (2.08 9 10
3 /C6
312 mL/C01) was found at 3000 m depth in the Tyrrhenian
Sea (western Mediterranean Sea) and a ratio of accA/
thaumarchaeal cells of about unity (Yakimovet al., 2009).
Overall, the gene abundances obtained by Q-PCR of
archaeal accA, archaeal amoA and thaumarchaeal 16S
rRNA genes reveal similar trends of gene abundances with
depth. The high abundance of thaumarchaeal 16S rRNA
genes in the oxygen minimum layer might reﬂect the
importance of Thaumarchaeota in the biogeochemical
processes, particularly nitriﬁcation, occurring in this layer.
However, also some groups of mesopelagicBacteria such
as members of the SAR324 or the SUP05 cluster contrib-
ute to autotrophy in the dark ocean (Swanet al., 2011).
Taken together, this study, along with some other
recent work, demonstrates that there is a substantial
genetic predisposition of DIC ﬁxation present in the dark
ocean. In this context, it adds to the emerging notion that
dark ocean DIC ﬁxation might be more important than
hitherto assumed. The extent to which this DIC assimila-
tion is due to anaplerotic reactions of heterotrophic prok-
aryotes or true autotrophy remains to be shown.
Additional studies, including the quantiﬁcation of other
related genes and proteomic approaches, are needed to
shed light on the modes of archaeal carbon metabolism.
The sheer magnitude of DIC ﬁxation, roughly equalling
heterotrophic production in the North Atlantic deep
waters, however, might indicate that the anaplerotic
metabolism of heterotrophic prokaryotes is of minor
importance and that autotrophic processes prevail in the
DIC ﬁxation pathway in the Atlantic’s interior.
