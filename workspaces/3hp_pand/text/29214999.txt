3-Hydroxypropionic acid (3-HP) can be produced via the biological route involving two enzymatic 
reactions: dehydration of glycerol to 3-hydroxypropanal (3-HPA) and then oxidation to 3-HP . 
However, commercial production of 3-HP using recombinant microorganisms has been hampered 
with several problems, some of which are associated with the toxicity of 3-HPA and the efficiency 
of NAD
+ regeneration. We engineered α-ketoglutaric semialdehyde dehydrogenase (KGSADH) 
from Azospirillum brasilense for the second reaction to address these issues. The residues in the 
binding sites for the substrates, 3-HPA and NAD+, were randomized, and the resulting libraries were 
screened for higher activity. Isolated KGSADH variants had significantly lower Km values for both 
the substrates. The enzymes also showed higher substrate specificities for aldehyde and NAD+, less 
inhibition by NADH, and greater resistance to inactivation by 3-HPA than the wild-type enzyme. A 
recombinant Pseudomonas denitrificans strain with one of the engineered KGSADH variants exhibited 
less accumulation of 3-HPA, decreased levels of inactivation of the enzymes, and higher cell growth 
than that with the wild-type KGSADH. The flask culture of the P. denitrificans strain with the mutant 
KGSADH resulted in about 40% increase of 3-HP titer (53 mM) compared with that using the wild-type 
enzyme (37 mM).
3-Hydroxypropionic acid (3-HP) is an attractive renewable building block that can be produced from biomass. 
The presence of two functional groups, hydroxyl and carboxyl groups, allows its conversion into many useful 
chemicals
1,2. For example, acrylic acid can be derived from 3-HP by catalytic reactions3,4. The global market for 
acrylic acid is expected to reach USD 22.55 billion by 2022 according to Grand View Research 5. Biosynthetic 
pathways utilizing sugar6–9 or glycerol10–16 have been proposed and employed to develop metabolically engineered 
microorganisms to produce 3-HP . In particular, a metabolic pathway starting from glycerol (Fig. 1) has attracted 
much attention owing to the economic advantages stemming from the low price of crude glycerol (byproduct 
of biodiesel industry) 17–19. Glycerol is converted into 3-hydroxypropanal (3-HPA) via a dehydration reaction

catalyzed by glycerol dehydratase (GDHt), and the aldehyde intermediate 3-HPA is oxidized to 3-HP , along with 
the reduction of NAD(P)+ to NAD(P)H by aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH). Coenzyme B12-depedent glycerol 
dehydratase (DhaB) has been most widely used for the first reaction, despite the requirement of the expensive 
coenzyme B
12
1,20,21. To reduce or completely eliminate the need for coenzyme B12, several microorganisms that 
can naturally produce the vitamin have been tested for developing 3-HP producing recombinant strains includ-
ing Klebsiella pneumoniae and Pseudomonas denitrificans
22–25. ALDH enzymes from diverse sources have been 
assessed for the conversion of 3-HPA to 3-HP10,23,26–29. However, none of them were designed in nature for the 
production of 3-HPA, and their relatively low activities have hampered the development of 3-HP-producing 
recombinant strains. Comparative studies for ALDHs were previously conducted, and α -ketoglutarate semial-
dehyde dehydrogenase (KGSADH) from Azospirillum brasilense was found a suitable ALDH enzyme for 3-HP 
production
27,30.
There are several challenges associated with ALDH in developing recombinant microorganisms for an eco-
nomically viable 3-HP production process. Among them, the toxicity of 3-HPA, cell death resulting from its 
accumulation, and the consequent cessation of 3-HP production have been well documented
31–34. To prevent 
the accumulation of 3-HPA, the activity of ALDH (the second-step enzyme) was maintained at a higher level 
than that of GDHt (the first step enzyme), by balancing their expression levels
27,30. A recent report described the 
optimization of the ratio between the two enzymatic reaction rates via UTR engineering21. A fed-batch cultivation 
of an engineered strain with the optimized pathway exhibited the higher 3-HP titer (40.51 g/L) and productivity 
(1.35 g/L/H) than that with the parental strain14. However, the strategy of controlling expression has a couple of 
limitations: the high expression of ALDH can be a burden on the host strain; the 3-HPA concentration cannot be 
decreased below a certain level which is dependent on the K
m of ALDH for 3-HPA. A more effective solution for 
addressing the 3-HPA toxicity would be engineering ALDH for higher activity, especially, by decreasing Km. Chu 
et al. reported an engineered ALDH, which exhibited 1.4-fold higher activity (78.07 U/mg) than the wild-type 
enzyme (55.12 U/mg), and a recombinant E. coli strain with the engineered enzyme showed about 20% increase 
of the 3-HP titer (71.9 g/L) in a 5 L bioreactor compared with the parental strain
29. Another issue in glycerol-based 
3-HP production is the regeneration of NAD(P)+. The redox balance in the cell affects various aspects of cellular 
physiology. The ratio of NAD(P)+ to NAD(P)H is adjusted and controlled based on the metabolic and environ-
mental conditions. However, the extraneously introduced metabolic pathway converting NAD(P)+ to NAD(P)
H could decrease the NAD(P)+/NAD(P)H ratio, especially in the late stages of 3-HP production, because of the 
toxic effects of 3-HPA and 3-HP on cellular physiology1. Anaerobic 3-HP production in the presence of nitrate 
was attempted to deal with the NAD(P)+ regeneration issue, and NAD(P)H accumulation can be alleviated by 
introducing NAD(P)H oxidation pathways35. However, engineering ALDH for lower Km toward NAD(P)+ could 
be a more direct solution to address the low NAD(P)+ concentration. Based on these hypotheses, we attempted 
in this study, to engineer ALDH for improved activity toward 3-HPA and NAD(P)+ via lowering the Km values 
for both the substrates. Specifically, KGSADH was chosen because the ALDH enzyme exhibited the highest 3-HP 
productivity among the ALDHs in the comparative analyses
30. Directed evolutionary strategy 36–39 was adopted 
as the engineering approach for modifying the substrate-binding sites of KGSADH. The engineered KGSADH 
enzymes were characterized with respect to various catalytic properties, including activities toward 3-HPA and 
NAD
+, substrate specificities, product inhibition, 3-HPA inactivation, pH-dependence of activity, and temper-
ature sensitivity. In addition, one of the variants was compared with the wild-type enzyme for 3-HP production 
from glycerol by a recombinant Pseudomonas denitrificans strain on flask scale.
Results and Discussion
Engineering the aldehyde-binding pocket of KGSADH. Initially, we targeted residues close to the 
active site of KGSADH. Since its structure was not available when we started the engineering, a homology model 
of the enzyme was constructed using the structure of human mitochondrial aldehyde dehydrogenase complexed 
with its aldehyde substrate, crotonaldehyde (PDB: 1O01)
40, as template (Figures S1 and S2). The complex struc-
ture is one of several aldehyde dehydrogenase structures having their aldehyde substrates in the active site 40–42, 
which helps to predict residues interacting with the aldehyde molecule in the modeled KGSADH structure. The 
comparison of its sequence with those of other aldehyde dehydrogenase enzymes had predicted E253 and C287 as 
the catalytic residues
43. The superimposition of the template and the modeled KGSADH structures supported this 
prediction (Figure S1B). Based on the modeled structure, 10 positions close to the catalytic residues (Figure S3) 
were selected and randomized individually, using the NNK (K: G or T) degenerate codon, producing 10 libraries. 
Each library was screened (approximately 200 colonies) using the criterion of rate of formation of NADH from 
NAD
+, by monitoring the increase in A340. Substrate concentrations chosen for 3-HPA and NAD+ were 1.5 mM 
and 1.0 mM respectively. The solution pH chosen for screening the libraries was 6. The rationale was to find vari-
ants tolerant to and/or showing an improved activity at low pH, because 3-HP production can lead to a decrease 
in cytoplasmic pH
1,44. However, clones exhibiting higher activity than or comparable activity to the wild-type

clone in cell lysate did not have any changes in the amino acid sequence (data not shown). The resistance to 
even small changes in the side chains suggests the critical roles of the 10 residues in catalysis and/or structure of 
KGSADH.
We then turned our focus to the residues in the aldehyde-binding pocket but having some distance to the 
catalytic residues. Based on the comparison of the template structure and the homology model of KGSADH, we 
selected 13 residues (Fig. 2A). Two more residues (E213 and K273) were chosen based on a report on the engi-
neering of an aldehyde dehydrogenase from Cupriavidus necator  (GabD4)
29. In this study, two residues (E209 
and E269) of GabD4 had been randomized for engineering the enzyme. We selected E213 and K273 of KGSADH 
as target positions, based on the sequence alignment of KGSADH with that of GabD4 (Figure S4). A total of 
15 libraries were generated, in which the target residues were randomized using the NNK degenerate codon. 
Approximately 200 colonies were screened for each library. Eleven clones, the cell lysates of which exhibited 
similar or higher enzyme activity compared to that of the wild-type clone and included changes in the amino acid 
sequence, were purified and their kinetic properties of k
cat and Km were characterized (Table S1). Several clones 
showed slightly higher activities (kcat/Km) toward either 3-HPA or NAD+ than the wild-type enzyme, but there 
was no variant having an enhanced activity for both the substrates. Interestingly, the N159V mutation signifi-
cantly increased the K
m value toward 3-HPA, resulting in a 5.7-fold reduction of kcat/Km, but showed an enhanced 
activity toward NAD +, largely due to the decrease in K m. The crystal structure of KGSADH complexed with 
NAD+ was reported, while this manuscript was under preparation45. N159 is located close to the NAD+ binding 
pocket, but does not directly interact with the substrate (Figure S5). Actually, in the KGSADH structure paper, 
this residue was proposed to interact with 3-HPA. We suspect that the N159V mutation causes a relatively large 
structural perturbation in the substrate binding pockets.
An additional library was generated to investigate the combination of the mutations found in the 
aldehyde-binding site, and degenerate codons were used to replace a target position with multiple amino acids 
(Figure S6). The theoretical size of the library was 27648, and approximately 8000 colonies were examined using 
the same screening method. Three variants (designated 104, 106, and 108), whose cell lysates exhibited high activ-
ity, were isolated, and their amino acid sequences were determined (Table 1). These enzymes were purified, and 
their catalytic properties were characterized with respect to 3-HPA and NAD
+ (Table 2). One variant (108) exhib-
ited enhanced catalytic activity as demonstrated by the kcat/Km value for 3-HPA. The Km of variant 108 decreased 
more than 2-fold, compared to that of the wild-type enzyme. However, two enzymes (104 and 106) had lower kcat/
Km values than the wild-type enzyme toward 3-HPA. Interestingly, all three variants exhibited enhanced catalytic 
activities toward NAD+, in contrast to that toward 3-HPA, which was largely because of the increased kcat values.
Engineering the NAD +-binding pocket of KGSADH.  Next, we targeted the NAD + binding site of 
KGSADH, and its K m for NAD+ was determined as 0.21 mM (Table 2). While the aldehyde-binding sites of 
ALDHs are as diverse as their substrates, the binding site for NAD+ of ALDHs has been known to be relatively 
conserved 46. Therefore, we examined the interaction with NAD +, using the crystal structures of two ALDHs 
complexed with NAD+, whose Km values were 0.047 mM and 0.0019 mM respectively (PDB: 1A4Z, 1BXS) 47,48. 
Nineteen positions were identified, whose side chains are involved in the interactions with NAD+, and the resi-
dues of KGSADH for the positions were identified based on the sequence alignment (Table S2). Then, the amino 
acid residues at these positions of KGSADH were compared with those of ALDHs showing low K
m values toward 
Figure 2. Target residues for randomization to generate libraries. (A) Residues for generating the single-site 
variant libraries of the aldehyde-binding site are shown using the KGSADH structure derived from homology 
modeling. Thirteen residues at the edge of the aldehyde-binding pocket and two residues (E215 and K273) 
based on the results of GabD4
29 were chosen for randomization. The catalytic residues (C287 and E253) are 
shown in magenta. (B) Residues chosen for generating the NAD+ binding pocket library were shown using the

NAD+ 49–59 (Table S2). Seven positions (P211, A212, V235, Q238, L239, R334, and A337) (Fig. 2B), which show 
variations as compared with the sequences of other ALDHs showing low K m values, were selected and rand-
omized, as shown in Figure S7. Even though some residues (P153 and Q160) in the NAD +-binding pocket of 
KGSADH are different from other ALDHs, they were tested earlier, when the residues close to the catalytic resi-
dues were targeted (Figure S3), and therefore were not included for making the NAD+ binding pocket libraries.
Two libraries were made using clones 104 and 106 as templates and were screened at low substrate concen-
trations (0.5 mM of 3-HPA and 0.3 mM of NAD+), with the objective of finding variants with reduced K m val-
ues. Clones from both the libraries, which showed high activity in cell lysates, were isolated, and their amino 
acid sequences are shown in Figure S8. Clone 104-M5, exhibiting the highest activity, had two changes at posi-
tions R334 and A337; the two residues were mutated into Q and R respectively. Interestingly, two clones (clones 
106-M4 and 106-M5) isolated from the 106 library also had the same changes (R334Q and A337R) in the targeted 
NAD
+-binding site and another clone (clone 106-M8) showing a comparable activity to that of these two clones 
had one additional mutation at position 238 (Q238K) (Figure S8B). Based on these results, we decided to intro-
duce the two mutations, R334Q and A337R, into the 108 variant also. The three enzymes (104-QR, 106-QR, and 
108-QR; the sequences are shown in Table  1) were purified and their catalytic properties, k
cat and Km, toward 
3-HPA and NAD+ were characterized (Table  2). The two mutations in the NAD + binding pocket resulted in 
7–11-fold reduction of Km toward NAD+ for the three variants, and unexpectedly the Km values for 3-HPA also 
decreased to a considerable extent. However, the kcat also decreased. Therefore, the improvement in kcat/Km was in 
the range of 2–4-fold. It is quite interesting that the mutations in the NAD+-binding pocket made such a dramatic 
effect on the binding of 3-HPA to the enzyme. The two mutations are located far from the 3-HPA-binding site. To 
examine the effect of the mutations R334Q and A337R in the absence of other mutations, these mutations were 
introduced into the wild-type enzyme, and the catalytic properties were characterized (Table  2). Similar to the 
three variant enzymes, the wild-type enzyme harboring R334Q and A337R mutations, named WT-QR, showed 
a decrease in the K
m values for both 3-HPA and NAD+, which suggests that the two mutations affect not only 
the NAD+ binding pocket, but also the binding of 3-HPA. However, variants found in this study showed higher 
activities (kcat/Km) than WT-QR, which indicates the contribution of other mutations, besides the two mutations 
in the NAD+ binding site, to the improvement of catalytic efficiency.
Substrate specificity and product inhibition of KGSADH enzymes.  The wild-type KGSADH 
showed enzymatic activity toward various aldehyde substrates, in addition to its original substrate, α-ketoglutaric 
semialdehyde30,60. To examine how the mutations in the KGSADH variants affected the substrate specificity, their 
activities toward several aldehyde compounds were compared (Fig.  3A). All the variants showed lower relative 
activity toward other aldehydes, compared to that toward 3-HPA, than the wild-type enzyme, which indicates that 
the wild-type enzyme is more promiscuous toward aldehyde substrates than the engineered ones. In particular, 
the 108-QR variant exhibited the highest specificity, which might be attributed to its lowest K
m value toward 
3-HPA, among all the tested enzymes. Interestingly, the WT-QR, which has mutations only in the NAD+ binding 
site, also exhibited increased specificity toward 3-HPA. The results, in addition to the decreased Km for 3-HPA of 
WT-QR, suggest that the two mutations, R334Q and A337R, induce a structural change in the aldehyde-binding 
pocket, even though they are located away from the site. The KGSADH variants were characterized with respect 
to NADP
+ also, because the wild-type enzyme was shown to be active with this cofactor (Table 2). The engineered 
enzymes had several-fold lower K m values toward NADP+ and showed higher catalytic activity (k cat/Km) than 
the wild-type enzyme. However, the improvement toward NAD+ was higher than that for NADP+, and thus the 
activity of the engineered enzymes for NAD+ relative to those engineered for NADP+ was higher, compared to 
that of the wild-type enzyme.
Biological processes for the production of 3-HP , for which the engineered KGSADH variants are intended 
to be used, should generate high concentrations of 3-HP and NADH inside the recombinant microorganisms. 
Therefore, we investigated the reverse reaction of 3-HPA formation from 3-HP and product inhibitions by 3-HP 
and NADH. The highest concentration tested for 3-HP was 1 M, since the targeted titer of 3-HP production is 
approximately 100 g/L for developing an economically feasible process. The highest concentration chosen for 
NADH was 3 mM, considering the reported concentrations of NAD
+ and NADH61. The reverse reaction did not 
take place up to 1 M 3-HP and 3 mM NADH, as determined by monitoring the absorbance at 340 nm (data not 
shown). However, product inhibitions were observed with both 3-HP and NADH. While there was no detectable

inhibition by 3-HP up to 100 mM, the activities of KGSADH enzymes dropped approximately by 40% at 1 M 
3-HP for all the tested KGSADH enzymes (Figure S9). Interestingly, the wild-type KGSADH exhibited much 
higher inhibition by NADH than the engineered enzymes (Fig. 3B). The inhibition was observed even at 0.5 mM 
NADH for the wild-type enzyme. The activity decreased linearly with increasing NADH concentration. In con-
trast, the variants showed less than 10% decrease in activity up to 2 mM NADH. The residual activity at 3 mM 
NADH was approximately 60%, compared to that in the absence of NADH. The concentration of NADH is rarely 
over 2 mM in the cytoplasm of microorganisms
62. Therefore, the engineered KGSADH variants are not likely to 
experience inhibition by NADH during 3-HP production by recombinant microorganisms.
pH sensitivity, 3-HPA inactivation, and heat inactivation of KGSADH enzymes. The screening 
of the libraries were conducted under the slightly acidic conditions, with the objective of finding variants toler-
ant to and/or showing improved activity at low pH, and the catalytic properties of the engineered enzymes were 
also characterized at pH 6 (Table S3). In general, the k
cat values decreased at low pH, whereas the Km values did 
not change much. Interestingly, for the two variants, WT-QR and 106-QR, the Km values for 3-HPA were lower 
at pH 6 than those at pH 8. The ratio of k cat/Km value at pH 6 vs. pH 8 of these two variants was higher than 
that of other enzymes (Table S3). The two mutations, R334Q and A337R, in the NAD + binding pocket might 
play a role in lowering the K m for 3-HPA at acidic pH. However, it is not clear why only WT-QR and 106-QR 
exhibited the decreased Km at pH 6, even though 104-QR and 108-QR have the same mutations. It is of note that 
106-QR has two mutations near the aldehyde-binding site, whereas 104-QR and 108-QR have four mutations. 
Therefore, the structural difference between these two enzymes and WT-QR might be greater compared to that 
between WT-QR and 106-QR. The relative activities of the enzymes were determined in the pH range of 4–10 
(Figure S10). These relative activities reflect k
cat rather than kcat/Km, considering the concentrations of the sub-
strates used in this experiment (3 mM 3-HPA and 2 mM NAD+). The KGSADH enzymes showed similar pH 
profiles, with the exception of at pH 10. The activities of all the variants increased up to pH 10; the wild-type 
KGSADH had the highest activity at pH 9. The variant enzymes were more resistant to alkaline conditions than 
the wild-type enzyme.
3-HPA is a highly reactive compound and reacts with side chains of various amino acids, including those of 
Cys, Lys, His, and Arg
63,64. Chemical modifications of the side chains can result in the loss of enzyme activity. 
We characterized the inactivation kinetics of the KGSADH variants (Fig. 3C). When incubated with a high con-
centration of 3-HPA (20 mM), the engineered enzymes exhibited higher resistance to 3-HPA inactivation than 
the wild-type KGSADH: the half-life values (t1/2) for the KGSADH variants, calculated using the fitted exponen-
tial decay, were at least 50% higher than that for the wild-type enzyme (Table S4). One possible reason for the 
resistance to alkaline condition and 3-HPA inactivation is the improved stability of the enzymes. We, therefore, 
compared the thermal stability of the enzyme variants (Figure S11 and Table S5). Contrary to our expectation, 
wild-type enzyme showed the highest resistance to heat inactivation, which is largely related to the structural 
stability. These results suggest that the tolerance to basic pH and resistance to inactivation by 3-HPA of the engi-
neered enzymes do not arise from the thermodynamic stability, but might be related to the remodeled substrate 
binding sites, considering their correlation to the enhanced activity, altered substrate specificity, and decreased 
product inhibition by NADH.
Structural modeling of the WT-QR variant. The results above indicated that the mutations in the NAD+ 
binding site, R334Q and A337R, affect various catalytic properties of KGSADH; Km for both NAD+ and 3-HPA, 
substrate specificity, product inhibition by NADH, pH sensitivity, and resistance to 3-HPA inactivation. In order 
to investigate the effect of the two mutations, the structure of WT-QR was modeled using Molecular Operating 
Environment (MOE), based on the crystal structure of KGSADH complexed with NAD
+ 45 (Figures S12 & S13). 
The two mutations, R334Q and A337R, result in new interactions with NAD+. In the wild-type enzyme, the gua-
nidine group in the side chain of R334 interacts with the ribose ring close to the nicotinamide group via hydrogen 
bonding, but A337 does not show any interaction with NAD
+ (Figure S12B). However, Q334 and R337 of the 
WT-QR variant interact with the phosphate group close to nicotinamide, resulting in structural changes in the 
region where the mutations are located (residue 325–337) and also conformational changes of NAD
+ binding

pocket (Figure S12B). The new interactions could contribute to the reduced K m of WT-QR toward NAD +. 
Unexpectedly, in addition to the NAD+ binding site, the substrate entry regions of aldehyde-binding pocket (res-
idues 101–109, 265–290 and 436–442) of WT-QR exhibit changes in the backbone structure, compared to that 
of wild-type structure (Figure S12C&S13). The peptide backbone for residues 441–445 moves inward, and thus 
the entrance size of aldehyde-binding pocket decreases, compared to that of wild-type enzyme (Figure S12C), 
which might explain the decreased K
m and the increased specificity toward 3-HPA. It is of note that the three

variants (104, 106, and 108), isolated by screening the libraries constructed by targeting the 3-HPA-binding site, 
have mutations in residues 442, 443, or 444 (Table  1). While the two proteins showed nearly identical peptide 
backbone structures in the region close to the catalytic residues, conformational differences in the side chains 
were observed (Figure S12D), which might be associated with the decrease in k
cat of the mutant enzyme. Even 
though the modeled structure of WT-QR provides interesting insights into the effects of the two mutations, the 
results need to be confirmed by experimental work. Currently, we are trying to determine the crystal structures 
of the engineered KGSADH variants.
Production of 3-HP from glycerol by a recombinant P. denitrificans strain on a flask scale. We 
successfully engineered KGSADH for higher activity toward both 3-HPA and NAD+ via decreasing the Km val-
ues. We were interested in investigating how the engineered enzymes performed in the production of 3-HP from 
glycerol by recombinant bacterial strains. The 108-QR enzyme showed the highest activity among the engineered 
enzymes, and we decided to compare the wild-type KGSADH with this variant. The P . denitrificans Δ3hpdH 
Δ3hibdhIV strain
65 was transformed with the pUCPK plasmid25 for expressing glycerol dehydratase (DhaB), its 
reactivase (GdrAB), and KGSADH. The genes for DhaB and GdrAB are under the constitutive bla  promoter25 
and that for KGSADH, under the constitutive 3hibdhIV promoter63. The culture experiments were conducted in 
duplicate for each enzyme, and the results were averaged. As shown in Fig. 4A and B, during the initial period of 
cultivation (3–12 hours), the 3-HP titer and the cell density were similar for the two recombinant P . denitrificans 
strains harboring wild-type KGSADH or 108-QR. However, in the late stage (15–24 hours), differences in 3-HP 
production and cell growth were observed. P . denitrificans with 108-QR exhibited a higher 3-HP titer (53 mM 
vs. 37 mM at 24 hours) and greater cell growth than P . denitrificans with the wild-type KGSADH (OD600 = 2.1 vs. 
OD600 = 1.6 at 24 hours) (Fig. 4A and B). The concentrations of 3-HPA were compared between the two strains at 
the two culture points (12 and 24 hours) (Fig. 4C). P . denitrificans with 108-QR showed ~50% lower 3-HPA accu-
mulation at both the time points. The 3-HPA toxicity has been shown to be related to the inactivation of cellular 
enzymes, in particular, DhaB and KGSADH
33,66,67. The reduced accumulation of this intermediate in P . denitrifi-
cans with 108-QR, results in less reduction of the activity of the two enzymes during the culture (Fig. 4D and E). 
In summary, the results described above indicate that the higher enzyme activities via decreased Km enabled the

higher cell growth, glycerol consumption, and 3-HP production. Further studies for the evaluation of the mutant 
KGSADH enzymes in culture experiments are under progress.
Conclusion
In this study, we engineered the aldehyde dehydrogenase of KGSADH to address the issues in the biological 
production of 3-HP from glycerol using recombinant microorganisms: toxicity of the intermediate, 3-HPA, and 
low NAD
+ regeneration efficiency in the late stages of culture. One of the approaches to tackle these problems 
could be improving the enzyme activity toward its substrates, 3-HPA and NAD+. KGSADH variants were isolated 
through screening various libraries targeting the substrate binding pockets. The engineered enzymes exhibited 
improved activity compared to the wild-type enzyme. In particular, the K
m of the enzymes for both the substrates 
decreased significantly. In addition, the KGSADH variants had several interesting properties: higher substrate 
specificities for aldehyde and the reducing cofactor; less product inhibition by NADH; and greater resistance to 
inactivation by 3-HPA. One of the engineered enzymes (108-QR) was compared with the wild-type KGSADH 
for 3-HP production in a recombinant P . denitrificans strain. The microorganism harboring the variant enzyme 
exhibited lower accumulation 3-HPA, less inactivation of the two enzymes that produce 3-HP from glycerol, 
higher cell growth, and higher 3-HP production than that with the wild-type enzyme. These phenomena were 
more pronounced in the late stage of culture. We expect that the problems of 3-HPA toxicity and NAD
+ regen-
eration associated with developing economically feasible 3-HP production process could be addressed to some 
extent by using engineered aldehyde dehydrogenases. However, some of the properties of engineered enzymes 
can be further improved. These include the unintended decrease in k
cat and thermal stability observed in this 
work, product inhibition by 3-HP , 3-HPA inactivation, and activity under acidic conditions.
Materials and Methods
Materials. Pfu DNA polymerase was purchased from Solgent Co. Ltd. (Daejeon, KOREA). Restriction 
enzymes and T4 DNA ligase were purchased from New England BioLabs (Ipswich, MA, USA). Isopropyl 
β-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG), Bovine Serum Albumin (BSA) and β -mercaptoethanol were purchased 
from BioShop (Burlington, ON, Canada). DNase, lysozyme, NAD
+ and NADH were purchased from Sigma-
Aldrich (St. Louis, Missouri, USA). B-PER reagent and Ni-NTA resin were purchased from Thermo Fisher 
Scientific (Waltham, MA, USA) and Clontech (Palo Alto, CA, USA) respectively. Centrifugal ultrafiltration filter 
(MWCO: 10,000) was purchased from Merck Millipore (Billerica, MA, USA). 3-HPA was synthesized chemically 
from acrolein, using the method described by Hall and Stern
68. All other chemicals were of analytical grade and 
were used as received.
Construction of libraries. Mutations were introduced into the KGSADH gene, using the assembly PCR 
method. The pQE80L/KGSADH plasmid 43 was used as template. The primers used are shown in Table S6. The 
PCR products from primers 1 and 2 were ligated into the pQE80L plasmid, using the BamH1 and Pst1 sites. 
The resulting KGSADH libraries were transformed to E. coli DH10β . Primers 1–32 were used for constructing 
single-site variant libraries for the aldehyde-binding pocket, and primers 1, 2, and 33–42 for combining the ben-
eficial mutations from the single-site variant libraries. Primers 1, 2, and 43–58 were used for the NAD
+ binding 
site library.
Screening of KGSADH libraries. Oxidation of 3-HPA to 3-HP is coupled with the reduction of NAD+ to 
NADH. Increase in absorbance at 340 nm (λmax of NADH = 340 nm) was used to monitor the reaction catalyzed 
by KGSADH. Single colonies were picked from each library and inoculated into 96-well plates (U type). Cells 
were grown overnight in 100 µL 2xYT medium containing 200 µg/mL of ampicillin at 37 °C and then transferred 
into the same, but fresh media. When the OD
600 approached 0.5, KGSADH expression was induced by adding 
1 mM IPTG. After 6 h, the cells were harvested by centrifugation at 3,134 g and 4 °C for 45 min, and the cell pellets 
were stored at −80 °C until further use. The cell pellets were resuspended in 100 µL extraction buffer (100 mM 
phosphate buffer, pH 8, containing 10% B-PER, 100 µg/mL lysozyme, and 5 U/mL DNase), and incubated at 
25 °C for 1 h. The cell lysates were centrifuged at 3,134 g and 4 °C for 45 min. Ten microliters of the supernatant 
was diluted with 170 µL activity assay buffer (100 mM phosphate buffer, pH 6, containing 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM 
DTT, and 1 mM β-mercaptoethanol), and the activity assay was initiated by adding the substrates, 3-HPA and 
NAD+. The rate of 3-HP formation was determined via the ΔA/min at 340 nm. To compensate the enzyme con-
centrations from different cell growth, the 3-HP production rate (ΔA/min) was divided by OD600 for analyzing 
the results.
Expression and purification of KGSADH enzymes. The wild-type and mutant KGSADH enzymes in 
the pQE80L plasmid were expressed in E. coli DH10β cells. Cells were grown in 2xYT medium at 37  °C until 
OD600 reached 0.5, and then the expression of enzyme was induced by 1 mM IPTG. After 6 h, the cells were har-
vested by centrifugation at 9,300 g and 4 °C for 15 min, and the cell pellets were stored at −80 °C until further use. 
The KGSADH enzymes with the N-terminal His6-tag were purified using the Ni-NTA resin following manufac-
turer’s instructions. The protein buffer was exchanged with 10 mM phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, containing 150 mM 
NaCl, using the centrifugal ultrafiltration filter. The purified proteins were stored in the storage buffer (20 mM 
potassium phosphate, pH 7.5, containing 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM DTT, and 50% (v/v) glycerol). The concentrations 
of the purified proteins were determined by measuring the absorbance at 280 nm, using extinction coefficients 
calculated from the ProtParam site (http://web.expasy.org/protparam/).
Characterization of KGSADH enzymes. kcat and Km values of the wild-type and variant enzymes were 
determined by measuring the reaction rate at 25 °C, by monitoring the increase in A 340 (ε = 6,220 M−1 cm−1). 
To determine the kinetic constants for 3-HPA, the enzyme concentration was adjusted to 20 nM in 100 mM

phosphate buffer (pH 8 or pH 6) containing 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM DTT, 0.2% BSA (w/v), and 2 mM NAD+. The 
reactions were initiated by the addition of varying concentrations of 3-HPA. For the kcat and Km values for NAD+ 
or NADP+, the enzymes were diluted with the buffer without NAD+ or NADP+, and the reactions were initiated 
by the addition of 3 mM 3-HPA and varying the concentrations of NAD+ or NADP+. The results were analyzed 
by nonlinear regression for the Michaelis-Menten equation, using Origin software (Northaempton, MA, USA). 
The relative activity of the enzyme toward various aldehyde substrates was determined by measuring the activity 
in 100 mM phosphate buffer, pH 8, containing 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM DTT, 0.2% BSA (w/v), 1.5 mM NAD
+, and 
1 mM aldehyde (3-HPA, propionaldehyde, butyraldehyde, valeraldehyde or hexaldehyde) at 25 °C43. The inhibi-
tion of KGSADH enzymes by 3-HP was determined by measuring the activity in 100 mM phosphate buffer, pH 
8, containing 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM DTT, 0.2% BSA (w/v), 2 mM NAD+, and 1–1000 mM 3-HP . NADH inhibition 
was assayed in the same buffer containing 3 mM 3-HPA and 0–3 mM NADH. The effect of pH on the enzyme 
activity was investigated using actetate buffer (pH 4 and 5), phosphate buffer (pH 6–8), and glycine buffer (pH 9 
and 10). The reactions were conducted in 100 mM buffer containing 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM DTT, 0.2% BSA (w/v), 
2 mM NAD
+, and 3 mM 3-HPA, at 25 °C. The inactivation of KGSADH by 3-HPA was investigated by measuring 
the residual activity after incubating the enzyme with 20 mM 3-HPA for varying lengths of time. The enzyme 
activity was determined in 100 mM phosphate buffer, pH 8, containing 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM DTT, 0.2% BSA (w/v), 
and 2 mM NAD+, at 25 °C. Heat inactivation of the enzymes was determined by measuring the residual activity 
after incubating the enzymes at 65 °C for varying lengths of time. The enzyme activity was determined in 100 mM 
phosphate buffer, pH 8, containing 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM DTT, 0.2% BSA (w/v), 2 mM NAD+, and 3 mM 3-HPA at 
25 °C. The half-life (t1/2) values for inactivation by 3-HPA or heat treatment were determined by fitting the data to 
exponential decay (y = aebx) using Origin software.
Structural modeling of KGSADH enzymes. The three-dimensional structure of KGSADH was con-
structed by homology modeling, using the x-ray structure of human mitochondrial aldehyde dehydrogenase 
(PDB ID: 1O01) as the template
40. The model was built using Molecular Operating Environment (MOE) and 
evaluated by PROCHECK and ProSA online structure analysis69,70. The protein structure was visually examined 
using PYMOL viewer (http://www.pymol.org).
The crystal structure of KGSADH complex with NAD + (PDB ID: 5X5U) and apo form (PDB ID: 5X5 T) 
were retrieved form the Protein Data Bank and investigated for structural abnormalities and missing residues. 
The unbound solvent molecules and other nonstructural residues were removed to clean the structure for fur -
ther structural analyses. The In silico structure of WT-QR complexed with NAD
+ was generated via the residue 
scan module within MOE under the LowMode ensemble, in which the LowModeMD Search method generates 
mutant conformations using ~1 ps run of molecular dynamics simulation at constant temperature, followed by 
all-atom energy minimization under Amber10:EHT force field, as explained elsewhere
71. Pymol and MOE were 
used for visual inspections and generating structural figures.
Flask scale production of 3-HP . Recombinant Psuedomonas denitrificans was grown in an Erlenmeyer 
flask for comparing the performance of wild-type KGSADH with that of 108-QR. P . denitrificans Δ3hpdH 
Δ3hibdhIV65, which does not degrade the produced 3-HP , was used as the host. The dhaB- gdrAB and kgsadh  
genes were cloned under the constitutive bla25 and 3hibdhIV63 promoters, respectively. Experiments were carried 
out in a working volume of 100 mL in a 250 mL non-baffled Erlenmeyer flask at 37 °C, on an orbital shaker incu-
bator at 200 rpm. Modified M9 medium was used, which contained (per liter) 100 mmol potassium phosphate, 
0.25 g MgSO4·7H2O, 1.0 g NaCl, 1.0 g NH4Cl, 1 g yeast extract, 2.0  g tryptone, 2.5  g glucose, 2.5 g L-glutamate, 
30 mg kanamycin, 25 mg cobalt chloride, and 100 mmol glycerol. Inoculum culture was conducted under the 
same conditions as the main culture, except that glycerol was not added in the medium. Inoculum was cultured 
for 9 h to reach late exponential growth phase and added at ~0.01 OD
600. The DhaB and KGSADH activities in 
the crude cell extract were measured using previously reported methods 20,72. The 3-HPA concentrations were 
determined indirectly by measuring 1,3-propanediol using HPLC after enzymatic conversion of the aldehyde 
using alcohol dehydrogenase.
