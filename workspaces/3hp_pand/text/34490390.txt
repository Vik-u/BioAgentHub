Metabolic disorders may lead to the inactive ovaries of dair y cows during early
lactation. However, the detailed metabolic proﬁle of dairy cows with inactive ovaries
around 55 days postpartum has not been clearly elucidated. T he objective of this
study was to investigate the metabolic difference in cows wi th inactive ovaries and
estrus from the perspective of serum metabolites. Accordin g to clinical manifestations,
B-ultrasound scan, rectal examination, 15 cows were assign ed to the estrus group
(E; follicular diameter 15–20 mm) and 15 to the inactive ovar y group (IO; follicular diameter
<8 mm and increased <2 mm within 5 days over two examinations). The blood was
collected from the tail vein of the cow to separate serum 55–6 0 days postpartum,
and then milked and fasted in the morning. Serum samples were analyzed using
gas chromatography time-of-ﬂight mass spectrometry techn ology (GC-TOF-MS) and
ultra-high-pressure liquid chromatography-quadrupole- time-of-ﬂight mass spectrometry
(UHPLC-QTOF-MS). Differences in serum metabolites were id entiﬁed using multivariate
statistical analysis and univariate analysis. Thirty diff erentially abundant metabolites were
identiﬁed between the two groups. In cows with inactive ovar ies compared with cows in
estrus, 20 serum metabolites were signiﬁcantly higher (bet a-cryptoxanthin ( p = 0.0012),
9-cis-retinal ( p = 0.0030), oxamic acid ( p = 0.0321), etc.) while 10 metabolites were
signiﬁcantly lower (monostearin ( p = 0.0001), 3-hydroxypropionic acid ( p = 0.0005),
D-talose ( p = 0.0018), etc.). Pathway analysis indicated that the serum d ifferential
metabolites of multiparous cows in estrus obtained by the tw o metabolomics techniques
were mainly involved in β -alanine metabolism and steroid biosynthesis metabolism,
while other involved metabolic pathways were related to met abolism of glyoxylate;
dicarboxylate metabolism; fructose, mannose, glutathion e, glycerolipid, glycine, serine,
threonine, propanoate, retinol, and pyrimidine metabolis m. This indicates that the
abnormalities in glucose metabolism, lipid metabolism, am ino acid metabolism, and
glutathione metabolism of postpartum dairy cows obstructe d follicular development.

INTRODUCTION
“Inactive ovaries” refers to two ultrasonographic examinat ions
of the ovaries, approximately 7 days apart, revealing no
substantial changes in the follicular structures, accompan ied by
a characteristic absence of a corpus luteum or cystic follicul ar
structures (
1). Inactive ovaries in dairy cows can cause cow
anestrus, which will prolong calving intervals, increase em ptying
periods and breeding costs, reduce milk yield, and seriously a ﬀect
the reproductive eﬃciency and economic beneﬁts of cows ( 2).
It is well known that maternal metabolic changes can aﬀect
follicle health and oocyte development ( 3). There are many
factors that aﬀect the development of postpartum follicles in
dairy cows, such as negative energy balance (NEB), mineral
elements, vitamins, and improper management (
4, 5). Early-
lactation dairy cows have increased nutritional requireme nts,
and their metabolism changes to meet the needs of postpartum
mammary glands and the intake of decrease (
6). If the energy
intake cannot meet the body’s requirements, the cow will be
in an NEB. When cows are in a severe NEB, the metabolism
of glucose, lipids, proteins, and other substances will be
disordered. The glucose, amino acids, and lipids required fo r
follicle growth and development will be insuﬃcient, resulti ng
in a lack of follicles or follicular growth, causing cows to b e
anestrous (
7). However, the pathogenesis of inactive ovaries
remains unknown.
Metabolomics generates a proﬁle of small-molecule
metabolites that are derived from cellular metabolism and
can reﬂect metabolic network activity so that potential
biological status information can be derived (
8). It is worth
noting that although the gene sequence is static at birth,
metabolomics measurements are relatively dynamic and
represent the eﬀects of cell activity and external exposure
(
9). Therefore, the wealth of small-molecule metabolite data
represented by individual metabolomes can generate key
pathological insights.
Metabolomics has also been widely used in dairy cows
over the past few years. Gerard et al. used 1H-nuclear
magnetic resonance spectroscopy ( 1H-NMR) to perform
metabonomic analysis of small and large follicular ﬂuids of
cattle and to screen four diﬀerential metabolites, includin g
α -glucose, β -glucose, lactic acid, and tyrosine (
10). Bender
et al. applied gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GC/MS)
metabonomics to study the metabolic diﬀerences between
follicular ﬂuid in dominant follicles of lactating cows and
heifers (
11).
However, metabolomics technology is still not perfect. At
present, it is not yet possible to detect all compounds with
one technology and diﬀerent detection platforms are required .
Therefore, this study combined GC-TOF-MS and UHPLC-
QTOF-MS techniques to screen the diﬀerential metabolites in
serum between cows with inactive ovaries and normal cows in
estrus to explore the potential role of diﬀerential metabolite s
in follicular development, and to provide a new strategy for
the prevention and treatment of postpartum inactive ovaries in
dairy cows.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Animals
This study was administered in strict accordance with the
Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of the
National Institutes of Health. All experiments on animals
were carried out according to the International Guiding
Principles for Biomedical Research Involving Animals. This
experiment is under the supervision of the Animal Medicine
Welfare Committee of Heilongjiang Bayi Agriculture University
(Number of permit) SY201909005.
This experiment was carried out in a large intensive dairy
farm with about 1,500 Holstein cows in Heilongjiang Provinc e.
Cows were fed a total mixed ration (TMR) in free-stall barns
with continuous access to freshwater and were milked three
times daily. The major ingredients of the TMR diet during earl y
lactation were whole corn silage and oat hay.
The cows were fed a TMR diet during early lactation, which
consisted of 8–9 kg of concentrate, 19 kg of silage, 3.5–4.0 k g
of hay, and 350 g fat. Their nutritional level on a DM basis
included 55.60% DM, 16% crude protein, 7.322 MJ ·kg−1 net
lactation production, 5.60% fat, 39.10% NDF, 20.30% ADF,
180 g of calcium, and 116 g of phosphorus. The basal diet was
formulated to meet the nutrient requirements according to t he
Feeding Standards of Dairy Cattle in China.
Fifteen normal cows in estrus at 55–60 days postpartum (pp)
were in the estrus (E) group and 15 anestrous cows at 55–60
days postpartum were in the inactive ovary (IO) group. The
estrous cows had the expected signs of spontaneous estrus at 55 –
60 days postpartum. After rectal examination and B-ultrasoun d
tests, the uterus did not show abnormalities. Follicular ovu lation
can occur on bilateral or unilateral ovaries (diameter: 15– 20 mm).
IO cows had no estrus performance at 55–60 days postpartum,
the developmental follicle diameter was less than 8 mm, and
the follicular diameter increased <2 mm within 5 days over
two examinations.
After the second B-ultrasound examination, 10 ml of blood
without anticoagulant was collected from the tail veins of 3 0
milk-producing cows 55–60 days postpartum, and then milked
and fasted in the morning. Blood samples were centrifuged at
4,000g for 5 min, and 0.5 ml of serum was transferred in aliquo ts
to a 1.5-ml EP tube and centrifuged at 12,000g for 5 min, and
supernatant was transferred to a 1.5-ml EP tube and stored
at −80◦C.
Commercial enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay
(ELISA) kits were used to measure the concentrations of
the concentrations of estradiol (E 2) and progesterone (P 4) in 15
untreated serum samples per group. These ELISA kits were from
Shanghai Hengyuan Company in China.
The background information, health status, and reproductiv e
status of the cows were recorded through the Aﬁmilk Cow Farm
Management software.
GC-TOF-MS Metabolite Extraction
Samples (pp 55–60d 50 µ l) in 1.5-ml Eppendorf (EP) tubes
were extracted using 200 µ l of methanol as extraction liquid

Bai et al. GC/MS and LC/MS
with 5 µ l 2-chloro-L-phenylalanine (1 mg/ml stock in dH 2O)
added as an internal standard, followed by vortex-mixing fo r 30 s.
Samples were incubated at −20◦C for 10 min and centrifuged
at 12,000 g for 15 min at 4 ◦C. We then transferred the 180- µ l
supernatants to new 1.5-ml EP tubes to be new samples and
took the 20- µ l aliquot from each sample pooling to obtain a
quality control (QC) sample. This was dried completely in a
vacuum concentrator without heating. We then added 30 µ l of
methoxyamination hydrochloride (20 mg/ml in pyridine) and
incubated the mixture for 30 min at 80 ◦C. Subsequently, 40
µ l of bis(trimethylsilyl)triﬂuoroacetamide (BSTFA) regen t [1%
trimethylchlorosilane (v/v)] was added to the sample aliquot s
and incubated for 1.5 h at 70 ◦C. We then added 5 µ l of fatty
acid methyl ester (FAME) (in chloroform) to the QC sample
after cooling to room temperature. All samples were analyzed
using a gas chromatograph system coupled with a Pegasus HT
time-of-ﬂight mass spectrometer (GC-TOF-MS).
GC-TOF-MS Analysis and Data
Preprocessing
The processed samples were analyzed via GC-TOF-MS using
an Agilent 7890 gas chromatography system [manufactured
by Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, CA, United States (USA)]
coupled with a Pegasus HT time-of-ﬂight mass spectrometer
(manufactured by LECO Corporation, San Jose, MI, USA). We
utilized a DB-5MS capillary column coated with 5% diphenyl
cross-linked with 95% dimethylpolysiloxane [30 m × 250 µ m
inner diameter, 0.25 µ m ﬁlm thickness; J&W Scientiﬁc, Folsom,
California (CA), USA]. A 1- µ l aliquot of the analyte was injected
in splitless mode. Helium was used as the carrier gas, the fron t
inlet purge ﬂow was 3 ml min −1, and the gas ﬂow rate through
the column was 1 ml min −1. The initial temperature was kept at
50◦C for 1 min, then increased to 310 ◦C at a rate of 20 ◦C·min−1,
and then kept for 6 min at 310 ◦C. The injection, transfer line,
and ion source temperatures were 280 ◦C, 280 ◦C, and 250 ◦C,
respectively. The energy was −70 eV in electron impact mode.
The mass spectrometry data were acquired in full-scan mode wit h
an m/z range of 50–500 at a rate of 12.5 spectra per second after a
solvent delay of 4.70 min.
Chroma TOF 4.3X software from the LECO Corporation
and the LECO-Fiehn Rtx5 database were used for raw peak
extraction, ﬁltering, and calibration of the data baseline , peak
alignment, deconvolution analysis, peak identiﬁcation, an d
integration of the peak area (
12). Metabolites were identiﬁed
by the mass spectrum match and the retention index match.
We removed peaks when they were detected to be < 50% of
QC samples or where the relative standard deviation (RSD) >
30% (
13).
UHPLC-QTOF-MS Metabolite Extraction
Samples (pp 55–60d 50 µ l) were thawed on ice (4 ◦C). Next, 100
µ l of the sample was placed in an EP tube and extracted with
400 µ l of extraction solvent (V methanol–: V acetonitrile = 1:1),
followed by vortexing for 30 s, ultrasound treatment for 10 m in
(with sample in ice–water), and incubation for 1 h at −20◦C to
precipitate proteins. The mixture was then centrifuged at 12,0 00g
for 15 min at 4 ◦C. The supernatant (425 µ l) was transferred to
EP tubes, and the extracts were dried in a vacuum concentrato r
without heating and reconstituted in 100 µ l of extraction solvent
[acetonitrile–water = 1:1 (v/v)]. The mixture was vortexed for
30 s, sonicated for 10 min in a 4 ◦C water bath, and centrifuged
at 12,000 g for 15 min at 4 ◦C. The supernatant (60 µ l) was
transferred to a new 2-ml LC/MS glass vial, 10 µ l was taken from
each sample and was pooled to create QC samples, and 60 µ l of
supernatant was used for UHPLC-QTOF-MS analysis.
LC-MS/MS Analysis and Data
Preprocessing
LC-MS/MS analyses were performed using a UHPLC system
1290 (manufactured by Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, CA,
USA) with a UPLC BEH Amide column (1.7 µ m, 2.1 ∗100 mm,
Waters) coupled with a TripleTOF 6600 (Q-TOF, manufactured
by AB Sciex, Framingham, MA, USA). The mobile phase
consisted of 25 mM NH 4Ac and 25 mM NH 4OH in water (pH
= 9.75) (A) and acetonitrile (B), and this process was carried ou t
with an elution gradient, delivered at 0.5 ml ·min−1, as follows:
0 min, 95% B; 0.5 min, 95% B; 7 min, 65% B; 8 min, 40% B; 9 min,
40% B; 9.1 min, 95% B; 12 min, 95% B,. The injection volume
was 2 µ l. The Triple TOF mass spectrometer was used for its
ability to acquire MS/MS spectra on an information-dependent
basis (IDA) during an LC/MS experiment. In this mode, the
acquisition software (Analyst TF 1.7, AB Sciex) continuously
evaluates the full-scan survey MS data as it collects and trigg ers
the acquisition of MS/MS spectra depending on preselected
criteria. In each cycle, 12 precursor ions whose intensity is g reater
than 100 were chosen for fragmentation at a collision energy (CE)
of 30 V (15 MS/MS events with a product ion accumulation time
of 50 ms each). ESI source conditions were set as follows: Ion
Source Gas 1 = 60 Psi, Ion Source Gas 2 = 60 Psi, curtain gas
= 35 Psi, source temperature = 650◦C, and Ion Spray Voltage
Floating (ISVF) = 5,000 V or −4,000 V in positive or negative
modes, respectively.
MS raw data (.wiﬀ) ﬁles were converted to the mzXML
format using ProteoWizard and processed using the R package
XCMS (version 3.2). The preprocessing results generated a
data matrix that consisted of retention time (RT), mass-
to-charge ratio ( m/z) values, and peak intensity. The R
package CAMERA was used for peak annotation after XCMS
data processing. An in-house MS2 database was applied for
metabolite identiﬁcation.
Statistical Analysis and Pathway Analysis
SPSS 19.0 software was used to perform one-way ANOV A on the
basic clinical information and blood test items of selected 30 test
cows. The results are expressed as “mean ± SD, ” and statistical
signiﬁcance was deﬁned at p < 0.05, with highly signiﬁcant values
at p < 0.01.
The normalized data (.txt ﬁle) were subjected to multivariat e
statistical analysis using R software (version 3.02) (
14), which
included principal component analysis (PCA) and supervised
orthogonal signal correction partial least-square discrimi nant
analysis (OSC-PLS-DA). A repeated 10-fold cross-validation and
a permutation test ( n = 200) were applied in the OSC-PLS-DA
model. The quality of the model was evaluated by R 2 and Q 2,

which indicated the total explained variation and represente d the
model predictability ( 15).
Signiﬁcantly diﬀerential metabolites were screened
using variable importance in projection (VIP) scores
(VIP > 1) obtained from the OPLS-DA model and
for p < 0.05.
Metabolic pathway analysis (MetPA) and hierarchical
cluster analysis (HCA) were performed by MetaboAnalyst
3.0 (http://www.metaboanalyst.ca) to indicate a disturbed
metabolism and construct network diagrams based
on the correlations observed between diﬀerentially
regulated metabolites.
RESULTS
As shown in Table 1, the postpartum daily milk yield of the
cows in the estrus group was signiﬁcantly lower than that of
the cows with inactive ovaries ( p < 0.05). Compared with
cows in the estrus group, the serum E 2 and follicle diameter
concentration of cows in the IO group reduced signiﬁcantly

(p < 0.01). Age, parity, BCS, and P 4 showed no signiﬁcant
diﬀerences between the two groups ( p > 0.05). These data
implied that higher milk yield and lower E 2 level were related to
the postpartum inactive ovaries during early lactation in hig h-
producing dairy cows.
GC/MS
As the PCA results were not signiﬁcantly separated between th e
two groups, orthogonal partial least square discriminant ana lysis
(OPLS-DA) was performed. The results are shown in Figure 1A.
Red represents the estrus group, and blue represents the IO
group. The two groups are clearly separated and are basically
at the 95% conﬁdence interval. The displacement test result
is shown in Figure 1B, and R 2Y is 0.82. As the replacement
retention decreases, the proportion of the Y variable increas es,
and Q 2 gradually decreases. This shows that the original OPLS-
DA model is robust and ﬁts the sample data, reﬂecting the real
situation accurately.
Univariate analysis was used to statistically analyze the
metabolites, and a total of 16 serum diﬀerential metabolites w ere
screened (Table 2). There were nine metabolites for the IO group
that were increased relative to the estrus group, which were 6 -
phosphoglyconic acid ( p = 0.0368), D-fructose-2,6-diphosphate
(p = 0.0227), D-galactonic acid ( p = 0.0159), oxamic acid ( p =
0.0321), alpha-tocopherol ( p = 0.0211), 24,25-dihydrolanosterol
(p = 0.0037), 1-methylhydantoin ( p = 0.0485), and elaidic acid ( p
= 0.0487). There were seven metabolites that were comparativel y
reduced, namely, glyceric acid ( p = 0.0131), monostearin ( p
= 0.0001), 3-hydroxypropionic acid ( p = 0.0005), D-talose, 5-
oxoproline (p = 0.0018), glutathione ( p =0.0061), and thymidine
(p = 0.0223).
Figure 2 shows the MetPA of diﬀerential metabolites
between cows in estrus and cows with inactive ovaries. These
pathways include glyoxylate and dicarboxylate metabolism,
fructose and mannose metabolism, β -alanine metabolism,

LC/MS
The PCA results were not able to signiﬁcantly distinguish
the two groups, so OPLS-DA was performed. The results are
shown in Figures 3A,C. Blue represents the E group, and green
represents the IO group. The two groups are clearly separated
and are basically at the 95% conﬁdence interval in both ESI
modes. The displacement test result is shown in Figures 3B,D.
R2Y is 0.79 and 0.78; as the replacement retention decreases,
the proportion of the Y variable increases, and Q 2 gradually
decreases in both ESI modes. This shows that the original mod el
is robust and ﬁts the sample data, accurately reﬂecting the
real situation.
As shown in Table 3, four diﬀerential metabolites were
screened in ESI(–). Compared with the estrus group, three
metabolites increased and one reduced in the IO group. Ten
diﬀerential metabolites were screened in ESI( +), and compared
with the estrus group, eight metabolites increased and two
reduced in the IO group.
Figure 4 shows the MetPA of diﬀerential metabolites in
estrous cows and cows with inactive ovaries, including thos e
involved in β -alanine metabolism, retinol metabolism, and
steroid biosynthesis metabolism.
HCA Results
HCA based on Euclidean distances and the average linkage
method was conducted to determine possible variations for th e
metabolite proﬁling of cows with inactive ovaries and cows in
estrus. In common with the results from PCA, we also found that
the metabolic proﬁles of each sample in HCA were very similar
within a given group, while the metabolite proﬁles of the IO
group were signiﬁcantly distinct from those of the estrus gro up
(Figure 5).
DISCUSSION
We screened diﬀerential metabolites in the serum of cows with
inactive ovaries and estrous cows by GC-TOF-MS and UHPLC-
QTOF-MS. Due to the speciﬁcity, sensitivity, and metabolic
libraries of the two technologies, there are some diﬀerences in
the identiﬁcation results. Thirty diﬀerential metabolites w ere
identiﬁed by screening, of which 20 were increased and 10 wer e
reduced in cows with inactive ovaries. Based on the analysis
of the metabolic pathways, a network metabolic map for all
diﬀerential metabolites was constructed ( Figure 6). Based on the
network metabolic map, the following discussion will be held .

Glucose Metabolic Changes at 55–60 Days
Postpartum in Dairy Cows With Inactive
Ovaries
In the serum of cows with inactive ovaries examined in this
study, glucose 2, D-fructose-2,6-bisphosphate, 6-phospogluco nic
acid, D-galactonic acid, and D-tagatose were found to be ele vated
while D-talose was reduced. Glucose can be involved in many
pathways, including the glycolytic pathway, gluconeogenesis, the
hexosamine biosynthesis pathway, and the pentose phosphate
pathway. Regardless of the pathway, the ﬁrst step is to metabolize
glucose to 6-phospogluconic acid (
16). 6-Phospogluconic acid is
catalyzed by phosphate isomerase to form fructose-6-phosphate,

and pyruvate is then generated to enter the tricarboxylic acid
(TCA) cycle in the glycolytic pathway (
17). The levels of glucose
2, D-fructose-2,6-bisphosphate, and 6-phospogluconic acid in
serum were increased in cows with inactive ovaries. Accordi ng
to Table 1, the milk yield is high in cows with inactive ovaries.
The increase of these metabolites may be due to the lack of
energy in dairy cows, and thereby enhanced glucose metaboli sm
supplies energy to the body and provides the energy required for
lactation (
18).
Glucose is preferentially supplied for lactation in cows
(19). Lactose comes from blood glucose, whereby 60–85%
circulating glucose is used for lactose synthesis in the rumi nant
mammary gland ( 20). Glucose is converted to galactose in
the mammary gland, which then combines with glucose to
produce lactose (
21). Galactose is a hexose. There are two
main metabolic pathways of galactose. One is to generate
D-tagatose through galactitol-2-dehydrogenase, which is then
converted to D-fructose-6-phosphate and enters the pentose

Bai et al. GC/MS and LC/MS
phosphate pathway. The other is the conversion of galactose
oxidase to D-galactonic acid, which in turn generates D-gly cerol
and enters the pentose phosphate pathway (
22). In this study,
D-talose, D-galactonic acid, and D-fructose-2, 6-bisphosph ate
were increased in the serum of cows with inactive ovaries,
which suggests galactose metabolism is enhanced to present
greater lactation capacity. Glucose and galactose metaboli sm are
enhanced to meet the body’s requirements for energy and lact ose
for lactation.
Lipid Metabolic Changes at 55–60 Days
Postpartum in Dairy Cows With Inactive
Ovaries
Oleic acid, sphingomyelin, lathosterol, and 24, 25-
dihydrolanostero were elevated and glyceric acid, 1-palmit oyl
lysophosphatidylcholine, 1-stearoyl-2-hydroxy-sn-glycer o-
3-phosphocholine, and monostearin were reduced in the
serum of cows with inactive ovaries. Glyceric acid, 1-palmit oyl
lysophosphatidylcholine, 1-stearoyl-2-hydroxy-sn-glycer o-3-
phosphocholine, and monostearin in serum are involved in
glycerolipid metabolism (
23). Glucose enters the glycolytic
pathway to produce glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate. There
are then two metabolic pathways that follow. One is the
generation of pyruvate in the TCA cycle, and the other is
the formation of glyceric acid in glycerolipid metabolism
(
24). The reduction of these metabolites suggests that the
metabolism from glucose to lipids is reduced in cows with
inactive ovaries. When the lipid reserve decreases in these c ows,
lipid mobilization increases to provide energy for lactation ,
and elaidic acid increases. However, the relationship betw een
the increase in sphingomyelin and inactive ovaries is unclea r.
In addition, lathosterol and 24, 25-dihydrolanostero can b e
converted into each other by the action of delta-24-sterol
reductase. They are all involved in steroid biosynthesis, w hich
are intermediate metabolites of cholesterol. They are all
involved in steroid biosynthesis and play the role of many
precursors of steroid hormone synthesis (
25, 26). Their
increase may be hindered by steroid synthesis, which leads t o
aggregation and inability to participate in the next metaboli sm.
The weakened steroid biosynthesis aﬀects the synthesis of
cholesterol and sex hormones (
27). It is characterized by
a low E 2 level and a small follicle diameter, which aﬀects
follicular development.
Amino Acid Metabolic Changes at 55–60
Days Postpartum in Dairy Cows With
Inactive Ovaries
In this study, L-Anserine, Lys-Leu, Pro-Val, L-Leucine-L- proline,
phenylpropionylglycine, 1-methylhydantoin, and oxamic acid
were increased in the serum of cows with inactive ovaries,
and glutathione, 5-oxoproline, and hydroxypropionic acid wer e
reduced. Among the increased amino acids, leucine and valin e
are branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs) while the others are
glucogenic amino acids. They can participate in the TCA cycle
by being converted into acetyl-CoA, pyruvate, and oxaloacet ate.
They can also enter the gluconeogenesis pathway through
oxaloacetate to generate phosphoenolpyruvate to provide energy
for the body (
28–31). The increase in these amino acids suggests
that cows with inactive ovaries mobilize protein to enhance
amino acid metabolism. The increase in glucogenic amino
acid especially promotes the TCA cycle to provide energy for
lactation (
32).
Hydroxypropionic acid and L-anserine are involved in
β -alanine metabolism; the reduction of 3-hydroxypropionic an d
the increase of L-anserine suggest that β -alanine metabolism is
weakened (33, 34).
Pyruvate produces less alanine and enters the TCA cycle for
energy. Therefore, L-glutamic acid, the intermediate meta bolite
of pyruvate and alanine, is correspondingly reduced. L-
Glutamic acid, glutathione, and 5-oxoproline participate in t he
glutathione cycle, resulting in a reduction in the content o f 5-
oxoproline and glutathione (
35, 36). The antioxidant properties
of GSH can protect cells from free radical damage ( 37). In
vitro cysteine supplementation during embryo maturation can
improve development by increasing GSH synthesis in several
species. This may enhance the oocyte’s antioxidant capacity
and promote its development (
38). Therefore, the weakened
glutathione cycle may aﬀect follicular development in dairy co ws.
1-Methylhydantoin is an intermediate metabolite involved
in the urea cycle of arginine, which is mainly used for the
synthesis of sarcosine. Sarcosine is stored in muscle as creat ine
phosphate and promotes ATP synthesis (
39). The increase in 1-
methylhydantoin in cows with inactive ovaries may suggest t hat
the conversion of arginine to phosphocreatine in the urea cycle is
enhanced to produce energy.
Other Metabolic Changes at 60 Days
Postpartum in Dairy Cows With Inactive
Ovaries
9-cis-Retinal, beta-cryptoxanthin, alpha-tocopherol, and γ -
tocopherol were elevated in cows with inactive ovaries, and
cytosine and thymidine were reduced. Both vitamin A and
vitamin E have antioxidant eﬀects. 9-cis-Retinal and beta-
cryptoxanthin are metabolites of provitamin A, while alpha-
tocopherol and γ -tocopherol are hydrolysates of vitamin E. The
elevated levels of these metabolites in the serum of cows with
inactive ovaries suggest beneﬁcial antioxidative eﬀects in the
body and follicles. Tocopherol can also promote the secretion
of sex hormones, increase the concentration of estrogen, an d
improve fertility (
40). Vitamin A may aﬀect protein synthesis
through steroid hormones which, in turn, aﬀects follicular
development (
41). The increase of these vitamins in IO dairy
cows suggests that their utilization is blocked or that util ization
is low in the early stages of follicular development, or that the y
are not a factor in hindered follicular development, but furth er
conﬁrmation is needed. In addition, cytosine and thymidine were
reduced in cows with inactive ovaries, suggesting insuﬃcie nt ATP
in cows with inactive ovaries ( 42).

content observed in this study will aﬀect glucose metabolism .
Glyceride metabolism disorder results in increased lipid
mobilization and limited steroid biosynthesis.
CONCLUSION
This study investigated 30 diﬀerential metabolites in serum from
estrous cows and cows with inactive ovaries via GC-TOF-MS
and UHPLC-QTOF-MS. Compared with estrous cows, there
were 20 increased metabolites and 10 reduced metabolites in
the cows with inactive ovaries. These metabolites are mainl y
involved in glucose metabolism, lipid metabolism, amino aci d
metabolism, and other pathways. Disturbances in galactose
metabolism, glyceride metabolism, steroid biosynthesis, and β -
alanine metabolism were found to be the main factors, but
the detailed mechanisms that aﬀect inactive ovaries require
further veriﬁcation and conﬁrmation through other experime nts.
According to the obtained network metabolic map regarding
cows with inactive ovaries, we explored the metabolic change s
and the importance of the postpartum follicular development
of glucose, amino acid, lipids, and others such as glutathion e,
vitamin A, vitamin E, and pyrimidine in these cows. Our
study provides new directions for the further exploration of t he
mechanisms of and prevention strategies for postpartum inacti ve
ovaries in dairy cows.
