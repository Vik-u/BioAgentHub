Bio-based 3-hydroxypropionic- 
and acrylic acid production from biodiesel 
glycerol via integrated microbial and chemical 
catalysis

Abstract 
Background: 3‑Hydroxypropionic acid (3HP) and acrylic acid (AA) are industrially important platform‑ and secondary 
chemical, respectively. Their production from renewable resources by environment‑friendly processes is desirable. In 
the present study, both chemicals were almost quantitatively produced from biodiesel‑derived glycerol by an inte‑
grated process involving microbial and chemical catalysis.
Results: Glycerol was initially converted in a fed‑batch mode of operation to equimolar quantities of 3HP and 
1,3‑propanediol (1,3PDO) under anaerobic conditions using resting cells of Lactobacillus reuteri as a biocatalyst. The 
feeding rate of glycerol was controlled at 62.5 mg/gCDW.h which is half the maximum metabolic flux of glycerol to 
3HP and 1,3PDO through the L. reuteri propanediol‑utilization (pdu) pathway to prevent accumulation of the inhibi‑
tory intermediate, 3‑hydroxypronionaldehyde (3HPA). Subsequently, the cell‑free supernatant containing the mixture 
of 3HP and 1,3PDO was subjected to selective oxidation under aerobic conditions using resting cells of Gluconobacter 
oxydans where 1,3PDO was quantitatively converted to 3HP in a batch system. The optimum conditions for the bio‑
conversion were 10 g/L substrate and 5.2 g/L cell dry weight. Higher substrate concentrations led to enzyme inhibi‑
tion and incomplete conversion. The resulting solution of 3HP was dehydrated to AA over titanium dioxide (TiO2) at 
230 °C with a yield of >95 %.
Conclusions: The present study represents the first report on an integrated process for production of acrylic acid at 
high purity and ‑yield from glycerol through 3HP as intermediate without any purification step. The proposed process 
could have potential for industrial production of 3HP and AA after further optimization.

Background
Significant efforts are continuously being made around 
the world to move from the current fossil-based econ -
omy to a more sustainable economy based on renewable 
resources. In order to match the efficiency and flexibil -
ity of the petrochemical industry, the bio-based indus -
try needs to develop a set of versatile building blocks, or 
platforms from which a range of products can be derived 
[1, 2]. Taking this into consideration, the Department of 
Energy, USA has identified 30 platform chemicals com -
posed of 1–6 carbon atoms as potential candidates for 
bio-based production [ 2]. Polyols and organic acids con -
stitute the majority of these chemicals; examples are glyc-
erol, propionic acid and 3-hydroxypropionic acid (3HP) 
[1, 2].
Acrylic acid (AA) is a bulk chemical with annual pro -
duction capacity of 4.2 million metric tons [3]. The major 
application of acrylate is its use in water-based acrylic

resins in the form of acrylate esters [4], which are used 
in decorative, masonry and industrial coatings and also 
in adhesives, binders for paper, leather and textile, pol
-
ishes, carpet backing compounds and tablet coatings [5, 
6]. Glacial AA is also used for the manufacture of super 
absorbent polymers used in disposable diapers [4]. The 
current industrial production of AA involves gas-phase 
catalytic oxidation of fossil-based propylene via acrolein 
as intermediate [4, 6]. Besides the non-renewable raw 
material, acrolein is highly toxic and explosive. The pro
-
cess is estimated to result in emissions of 3.25  kg CO 2 
eq per kg AA, shared equally between the raw materials 
plus the process, and waste treatment [7]. Most of the 
alternative chemical production routes were abandoned 
as they were found to be economically unattractive, use 
non-environmental friendly catalysts or have low acrylate 
yields [6].
Many renewable routes for production of AA using 
bio-based raw materials have been reported such as 
direct fermentation of lactate using Clostridium propi
-
onicum [8], catalytic dehydration of lactic acid or 3HP 
obtained by fermentation [9–12], and catalytic conver
-
sion of microbially-produced fumaric acid [13]. Although 
lactic acid is less toxic and is produced industrially via 
fermentation at a concentration exceeding 10  %, pro
-
duction of acrylate by fermentation of lactate is limited 
by a strong product inhibition [8]. Additionally, catalytic 
dehydration of the secondary hydroxyl group of lactic 
acid has proven to be difficult, because it is quite resistant 
toward hydrolysis [11, 12]. On the other hand, β-hydroxy 
acid (3HP) was shown to be more easily dehydrated into 
AA than the α-hydroxy acid (lactic acid) [9, 10, 14]. This 
was the main trigger for several companies and research 
groups to develop novel renewable, economically feasible 
routes for production of 3HP as a potential source for AA 
[14].
3HP is a structural isomer of lactic acid (2-hydroxypro
-
pionic acid). Its two functionalities, hydroxyl- and car -
boxyl groups, make it a versatile compound for organic 
synthesis [15–17]. It can also be incorporated as a cross-
linking agent in coatings, lubricants and antistatic agents 
for textiles [18]. Other applications are expected in food 
industry, cosmetics and fertilizers [19].
Industrial production of 3HP has not yet been estab
-
lished due to lack of economic feasibility and/or environ -
mental compatibility for most of the suggested chemical 
production routes [15, 18]. Nevertheless, the high expec
-
tation for 3HP as a platform chemical gives a projected 
market volume of 3.6 million ton/year [3].
Biologically, 3HP can be obtained in small quantities 
as an end product of glycerol and acrylate metabolism 
by few wild-type microorganisms [18]. Jiang et  al. and 
Henry et al. have suggested different metabolic pathways 
for the production of 3HP from glucose and glycerol [20, 
21], and many have been practically evaluated [22–26]. 
However, most of these biological production routes 
are limited by low 3HP yield, and the need for nitrogen 
source/cofactors for maintaining the production process 
as well as for product recovery and purification thereafter 
which increase the production cost [22–26].
The rapid expansion of the biofuels market, especially 
biodiesel and bioethanol, has resulted in accumulation of 
surplus amounts of glycerol as a by-product. In order to 
convert glycerol to 3HP , two different pathways have been 
described; all share the first step of selective dehydration 
of glycerol yielding 3-hydroxypropionaldehyde (3HPA) 
in a reaction catalyzed by glycerol/diol dehydratase. The 
resulting aldehyde is then oxidized forming 3HP through 
aldehyde dehydrogenase, or through the three-step cas
-
cade reaction catalyzed by propionaldehyde dehydro -
genase (PduP), phosphotransacylase (PduL), and kinase 
(PduW) [20]. However, for achieving the redox balance 
other products are produced simultaneously such as 
1,3-propanediol (1,3PDO) through 1,3-propanediol oxi
-
doreductase (PduQ).
In an earlier study, the biocatalytic dehydration of glyc-
erol and dismutation of the resulting 3HPA was achieved 
yielding equimolar amounts of 1,3PDO and 3HP using 
resting cells of Lactobacillus reuteri, hence resulting in 
50 mol % yield of 3HP from glycerol [27]. L. reuteri is an 
obligate heterofermentative lactic acid bacterium that 
does not utilize glycerol as a carbon source but instead 
as an indirect electron acceptor [28, 29]. The metabo
-
lism of glycerol takes place through propanediol-utili -
zation (Pdu) pathway comprising five enzymes, vitamin 
B12-dependent glycerol/diol dehydratase (PduCDE) 
catalyzing the dehydration of glycerol to 3HPA, PduQ 
for reduction of 3HPA to 1,3 PDO, and PduP , PduL and 
PduW catalyzing oxidation of 3HPA to 3HP . 3HPA flux 
through these pathways is influenced by the level of 
NADH inside the microbial cell; higher NADH levels 
resulting in reduction of 3HPA (normal case with grow
-
ing cells in which the reduced cofactor is generated as 
a result of sugar metabolism), while accumulation of 
NAD
+ favors the oxidative pathway (the case with resting 
cells).
Acetic acid bacteria possess several alcohol dehydro -
genases capable of selective oxidation of alcohols to the 
corresponding aldehydes and ketones. The resulting 
aldehydes can be further oxidized to the corresponding 
carboxylic acids by the action of aldehyde dehydroge
-
nases working in cascade with the alcohol dehydrogenase 
[30]. Acetic acid bacteria are used industrially as cata
-
lysts for the oxidation of ethanol to acetic acid, glucose 
to glucuronic acid, glycerol to dihydroxyacetone, and 
many other processes [30–35]. Gluconobacter oxydans

was earlier used as a biocatalyst for selective oxidation of 
2-methyl-1,3-propanediol to 2-methyl-3-hydroxypropi -
onic acid [31], a reaction not easily achievable by chemi -
cal catalysis.
The present study demonstrates the production of AA 
from biodiesel glycerol via integrated three-step process. 
Glycerol was initially converted to 1,3 PDO and 3HP using 
resting cells of L. reuteri under anaerobic conditions. The 
product mixture was then subjected to selective biological 
oxidation under aerobic conditions using resting cells of 
G. oxydans resulting in 3HP . The resultant acid was cata
-
lytically dehydrated using TiO2 to AA (Fig. 1).
Results and discussion
Fed‑batch biotransformation of glycerol to 1,3PDO 
and 3HP using resting cells of L. reuteri
Using L. reuteri cells as biocatalyst for transformation 
of glycerol requires induction of expression of the genes 
encoding the enzymes and structural proteins in the 
Pdu pathway, by including small amounts of glycerol or 
1,2-propanediol in the cultivation medium with a sugar 
carbon source [36]. Co-metabolism of glycerol with 
the main carbon source results in higher cell density, as 
regeneration of NAD
+ resulting from the conversion of 
3HPA to 1,3PDO diverts the sugar metabolism to acetate 
(via pyruvate and acetyl-phosphate) yielding ATP instead 
of being reduced to ethanol and lactate [37, 38].
Our earlier study on the analysis of glycerol fluxes 
towards 3HPA, 1,3PDO and 3HP revealed that the rate of 
formation of 3HPA is higher than the rate for its further 
conversion to 3HP and 1,3PDO [27]. The maximum spe
-
cific production rates of 3HP and 1,3PDO using wild-type 
L. reuteri at pH 5 were 62.4 and 52.7  mg/g
CellDryWeight  h, 
respectively [27]. Considering these maxima, the maxi -
mum specific glycerol consumption rate yielding only 
1,3PDO and 3HP without accumulation of the intermedi-
ate 3HPA was calculated to be 128.3 mgGly/gCDW h by sum-
ming up the molar specific production rates for 1,3PDO 
and 3HP using the following equation:
Since 12 g dry weight of biocatalyst is used in the pre
-
sent study, the specific consumption rate was 1.54 gGly/12 
gCDW  h. Using a feeding rate of 0.75 g Gly/h (half of the 
maximum rate), conversion of 40 g glycerol and produc -
tion of high amounts of 3HP (19.9 g) and 1,3PDO (17.5 g) 
at a rate of 0.35 and 0.3 g/h, respectively, were achieved. 
The increase in the reaction volume caused by the feed
-
ing solution resulted in final concentration of 14 and 
12  g/L for 3HP and 1,3PDO, respectively (Fig.  2). The 
molar ratio of 1,3PDO to 3HP was 1  mol/mol ensuring 
the balanced production for maintaining redox equiva
-
lence, and their corresponding yields were 0.42  g 1,3PDO/
gGly and 0.48 g 3HP/gGly. No accumulation of the interme -
diate aldehyde and/or product inhibition was observed 
during the whole biotransformation process.
The co-production of 1,3PDO and 3HP is mediated by 
a co-factor (NADH-NAD
+) recycling between the oxi -
dative and reductive branches of the metabolic pathway 
which is essential for continuity of the biotransforma
-
tion reaction. Hence, directing the reaction towards 3HP 
as a single product by knocking out the gene encoding 
1,3-propanediol oxidoreductase seems unfeasible. One 
realistic approach is to oxidize the produced 1,3PDO to 
3HP in a separate step.

10  mg/mL substrate) and 1,3PDO concentration (5, 10, 
15, 20, 25 and 30 mg/mL using 5.2 mg CDW/mL biocata -
lyst), the results of which are summarized in Table 1. The

ing volume containing G. oxydans cells in aqueous sub -
strate solution. Highest conversion of 91 % was achieved 
with 5 mg/mL 1,3PDO in 2 h reaction time. Over 90 % of 
10 mg/mL 1,3PDO was converted in 5 h yielding 3HP as 
the main product with minute amounts of the intermedi

ate 3HPA (Fig. 3). After 5 h, the conversion was marginal 
and was 96.9 % after 24 h.
Higher substrate concentrations, 15–30  mg/mL 
resulted in 77.96, 66.71, 57.56 and 53.26 % conversion, 
respectively in 24  h. Slight accumulation of the inter
-
mediate 3HPA was observed at 25–30 mg/mL 1,3PDO. 
Two main enzymes are functional in this step including 
alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) and an aldehyde dehy
-
drogenase (ALDH) [30– 35]. According to Wei et  al. 
(2003) and our modeling/docking studies of 1,2-pro -
panediol and 1,3PDO in the active site (data not shown), 
ethanol dehydrogenase is thought to be the enzyme 
responsible for oxidation of the propanediols to the cor
-
responding aldehydes [32]. For the second step of oxi -
dation of the aldehyde to the carboxylic acid, different 
aldehyde dehydrogenases were reported to be responsi

ble, one is membrane-bound and the others are either 
membrane-bound or cytoplasmic enzyme(s). However, 
further studies are required to identify all the enzymes 
involved [32].
The effects of biocatalyst concentration [mg
CDW/mL] 
and substrate concentration [mg/mL] on specific ini -
tial reaction rate [mg/g CDW.min] are shown in Fig.  4. 
Although a higher biocatalyst concentration resulted in 
faster conversion rate, the specific initial reaction rate 
was significantly reduced (Fig.  4a). This could be a result 
of oxygen limitation that might occur at higher biomass 
concentration. On the other hand, the initial volumetric 
reaction rate was increased from 30.4  ± 5.3 µg/mL min 
using 2.6  mg
CDW/mL to a maximum of 47.9  ±  0.8  µg/
mL min using 5.2 mgCDW/mL. Increasing the cell concen-
tration to 6.5  mg CDW/mL did not result in a significant 
increase in volumetric reaction rate. This explains the use

of 5.2 mgCDW/mL for studying the effect of substrate con-
centration on biotransformation kinetics.
As seen in Fig.  4b, the rate of ADH catalyzed reaction 
decreased significantly with increase in substrate con -
centration from 10 to 30  mg/mL, suggesting substrate 
inhibition. Product inhibition could be ignored since the 
intermediate 3HPA was continuously converted to the 
corresponding acid and did not accumulate to an inhibi
-
tory level. On the other hand, increasing the substrate 
concentration for the ALDH catalyzed reaction was 
accompanied with increase in the reaction rate within the 
tested range. At initial 1,3PDO concentration of 25 and 
30 mg/mL, accumulation of the intermediate aldehyde to 
1.4 and 1.6 mg/mL, respectively, indicated that the over
-
all rate of 1,3PDO oxidation to 3HPA catalyzed by ADH 
is higher than that for further oxidation of 3HPA to 3HP 
by the second enzyme in the cascade, ALDH.
The highest 3HP concentration obtained was 
18.4  ±  0.4  mg/mL from 30  mg/mL 1,3PDO within 
24  h. The final pH of the biotransformation reaction 
dropped from 3.5  ± 0.07 in case of 5 mg/mL 1,3PDO to 
2.98 ± 0.01 with 30 mg/mL of 1,3PDO (Fig. 5). This sharp 
drop in the pH of the reaction might explain the marginal 
biotransformation of 1,3PDO observed after 5  h of the 
reaction since the optimal pH range for the alcohol and 
aldehyde dehydrogenases is between pH 5 and 7 [31–33].
Biotransformation of 1,3PDO performed under con
-
trolled aeration and pH in a bioreactor using 3.25 gCDW/L 
cells resulted in enhanced 1,3PDO oxidation and 3HP 
production rates (Fig.  6a). Consumption of the entire 
1,3PDO (10  mg/mL) was achieved in 4.75  h at a volu
-
metric rate exceeding 2.1  g/L  h with formation of 3HP 
at a rate of 2.4  g/L  h and a molar yield of ~1  mol

rates during the initial 3.25  h were 14.4 and 13.8  mg/

Once the reaction kinetics for 1,3PDO was determined, 
the conversion of 1,3PDO present in a mixture with 3HP 
produced from biodiesel-derived glycerol by L. reuteri 
was investigated. No inhibitory effect of 3HP at an initial 
concentration of 11.8  g/L was observed on the reaction 
kinetics. The biotransformation of 1,3PDO in the mixture

showed a similar profile to that of pure 1,3PDO. Quanti -
tative conversion of 1,3PDO to 3HP was achieved yield -
ing a final concentration of 23.6  g/L 3HP (Fig.  6b). The 
yield of 3HP with respect to the glycerol used reached 
approximately 1  mol/mol which is the highest reported 
so far (Additional file  1: Table S1), and the product had 
high purity exceeding 95 % as determined by HPLC. This 
solution was filtered and utilized as substrate for AA 
production.
Catalytic dehydration of 3HP to AA
Dehydration for the introduction of double bond is one 
of the less investigated reactions through enzymatic 
catalysis. This could be a result of the high toxicity of 
these products such as acrolein, AA and methacrylic 
acid to the producing microorganisms [8]. On the other 
hand, chemical catalysis provides several green routes 
for production of these chemicals catalyzed by inor
-
ganic catalysts. Among the different processes for pro -
duction of acrylic acid, the catalytic dehydration of 
3HP over TiO
2 gave the highest yield (Additional file  1: 
Table S2). Titanium dioxide (TiO 2) is considered to be a 
green catalyst and is widely used in paints, cosmetics and 
food as whitening agent. We have reported earlier the 
catalytic dehydration of 3-hydroxy-2-methylpropionic 
acid over TiO
2 at 210  °C to methacrylic acid with high 
purity exceeding 90  % and a yield over 85  % [31]. The 
same approach was for catalytic dehydration of 3HP to 
AA. The effect of the substrate flow rate on the dehydra
-
tion step was tested in a continuous mode of operation. 
Table  2 summarizes the percentage of conversion and 
product yield in each case. Over 99.9 % 3HP conversion 
and 99.0  ± 5.1 % product formation was achieved using 
the substrate flow rate of 1.5 mL/h at 230 °C (Fig. 7).
Conclusions
The present study provides a proof of concept for a novel 
green route for production of AA from biodiesel-derived 
glycerol via an integrated three-step process. The conver
-
sion of the substrate to the final product was mediated by 
seven enzymes in two whole cell biocatalysts and an inor
-
ganic catalyst. All the reactions were performed in aque -
ous medium, which resulted in high yields and purity of 
the final products without the need for further purifica
-
tion (Fig. 8). All the catalytic steps were performed at pH 
(5.5) in order to lower the base consumption and facili -
tate subsequent gas-phase dehydration step to AA [9].

According to a recent simulation study for AA pro -
duction from glucose via 3HP using recombinant E. 
coli, the main concerns were the estimated high cost for 
downstream processing and the cost of nitrogen source 
required for microbial growth and maintaining the pro
-
duction [39]. For making the system reported in the pre -
sent study economical and attractive for industrial scale 
production of 3HP and AA requires further investiga
-
tions with respect to designing less expensive cultivation 
media for growing the microorganisms, and the biocon
-
version to handle higher substrate loads to obtain more 
concentrated product stream. This may also involve the 
use of engineered cells with overexpressed enzymes for 
improving the activity and productivity and lowering the 
product inhibition.
Methods
Materials
Glycerin tech (98  %), a co-product of biodiesel produc -
tion process and 3-hydroxypropionic acid standard (30 % 
w/v) were provided by Perstorp AB, Sweden. Lactobacilli 
MRS broth (composition per liter: 10  g protease pep
-
tone, 10  g beef extract, 5  g yeast extract, 20  g dextrose, 
1  g Tween 80, 2  g ammonium citrate, 5  g sodium ace
-
tate, 0.1  g magnesium sulfate, 0.05  g manganese sulfate 
and 2 g dipotassium phosphate) and Bacto yeast extract 
were products of Difco (BD laboratories, Detroit, Michi
-
gan, USA). 1,3-Propanediol, 28 % ammonium hydroxide, 
acrylic acid, TiO
2 and glycerol (99 %) were obtained from 
Sigma–Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, USA) and glucose mono -
hydrate from Prolabo (VWR International, Fontenay-
sous-Bois, France), while 1,2-propanediol and phosphate 
salts were from Merck (NJ, USA).
Microorganisms and culture conditions
Two microorganisms were used in this study, L. reuteri 
DSM 20016 and G. oxydans DSM 50049.
For preparation of L. reuteri pre-culture, MRS medium 
containing 1.5 g/L 1,2-propanediol was used. Stock cul
-
ture of the microorganism in 20 % v/v glycerol (0.2 mL) 
was added to 20  mL of the culture medium in 30  mL 
serum bottles and incubated at 37 °C for 8 h. The result
-
ing culture was used to inoculate another 20 mL medium 
(1 % v/v) and incubated under similar conditions for 8 h 
and then used as inoculum for biomass production step.
G. oxydans inoculum preparation and biomass pro
-
duction was done as described elsewhere [31], by 
transferring 1  mL stock culture in 20  % v/v glycerol to 
an agar slant, and after incubation at 28 °C for 2 days the 
culture on the agar surface was transferred to a 1 L baf
-
fled E-flask containing 100  mL culture medium (10  g/L 
yeast extract, 10  g/L glycerol and 5  g/L KH
2PO4). The 
culture was placed in an incubator shaker (New Brun -
swick, Innova 4430, Edison, USA) at 200 rpm and 30 °C 
for 4 days and then used for biomass production step.
Biomass production step
The production of L. reuteri and G. oxydans cells was 
done in a 3-L bioreactor (Applikon, Microbial Biobun
-
dle, The Netherlands). Monitoring and control of all the 
parameters was done through ez-control unit. Tempera
-
ture was maintained via a heating blanket and a cooling 
finger, and pH was controlled using 5 N NH
4OH.
For L. reuteri, 20 mL (1 % v/v) of the fresh pre-culture 
was aseptically added to 2 L fermentation medium con -
taining 55 g/L MRS broth, 5 g/L 1,2-propanediol and glu-
cose concentration was adjusted to 40 g/L. Stirrer speed 
was maintained at 200 rpm, temperature at 37 °C and pH 
at 5.5. Anaerobic conditions were maintained by con
-
tinuous bubbling of nitrogen gas. Fermentation was con -
tinued for 10 h after which the broth was collected and 
centrifuged at 15,000×g for 10 min.
Production of G. oxydans cells was done as described 
elsewhere [31]. Seventy-five milliliters of the pre-culture 
was added to 1.5  L fermentation medium. The opera
-
tional conditions used were temperature of 30 °C, pH 5.5, 
stirrer speed 500 rpm and airflow at 1 v/v/m during the 
entire cultivation. After cultivation for 2 days, cells were 
harvested as described earlier for L. reuteri.
Fed‑batch biotransformation of glycerol to 1,3PDO 
and 3HP using resting cells of L. reuteri
Biotransformation of glycerol was done in 3-L bioreactor 
(Applikon, The Netherlands) with 1 L initial working vol -
ume. The process was started by resuspending the har -
vested L. reuteri cells from the biomass production step 
in 1 L solution containing 2  g/L glycerol to a final den -
sity of 12 g CDW/L. After 3 h of batch biotransformation, 
glycerol (100 g/L) feed was started at a rate of 7.5 mL/h 
(0.75 g
Gly/h) and was continued for 55  h. Samples were 
collected and analyzed for the concentrations of residual 
substrate and metabolites. The biotransformation condi
-
tions were the same (pH 5.5, 37  °C) as described in the 
L. reuteri biomass production step. The resulting solution

containing equimolar concentrations of 1,3PDO and 3HP 
was collected, filtered through 0.2 µm filter and used as 
the substrate for resting cells of G. oxydans. The biotrans
-
formation kinetics were determined using the following 
equations:
  •  
  •  
  •  
  •  
  •  
where P and S are the concentrations of the products 
and substrate (g/L), respectively, V  is the reaction vol
-
ume, x is the amount of the biocatalyst (g CDW), and ∆t is 
the time elapsed between the initial and final conditions 
(h).
Batch biotransformation of 1,3PDO to 3HP using resting 
cells of G. oxydans
G. oxydans cells were obtained by centrifugation of the 
culture broth at 15,000×g for 2  min in Eppendorf tube. 
Oxidation of 1,3PDO (5–30  mg/mL) was studied using 
2.6–6.5 mg (dry weight) resting G. oxydans cells per mL 
(1 mL reaction volume in 5 mL glass vials). The vials were 
placed in a thermomixer (Heidolph, Germany) at 28  °C 
and stirring at 800  rpm for maintaining aerobic condi
-
tions. Samples of 50 µL were collected and analyzed for 
concentrations of residual substrate and products.
Oxidative biotransformation of 1,3PDO to 3HP was 
also investigated using resting cells of G. oxydans with 
controlled pH and aeration. The biotransformation was 
done in a 3-L Applikon bioreactor with 1 L working vol
-
ume under batch mode of operation. The experiment was 
started by resuspending 3.25 g
CDW of G. oxydans cells in 
1 L solution containing 10.0 g/L 1,3PDO, and was main -
tained at 28 °C, pH 5.5 by addition of 5 N NH4OH, stirrer 
speed of 800 rpm and air flow at 1 L/min. The experiment 
was continued until 1,3PDO was entirely consumed.
In a similar manner, the conversion of 1,3PDO present 
in a mixture with 3HP produced from glycerol was per
-
formed. The G. oxydans cell pellet from the biomass pro -
duction step was resuspended in the solution containing 
10.0 g/L 1,3PDO and 11.8 g/L 3HP (equimolar) to a final

density of 3.25  g CDW/L and biotransformation started 
under the same conditions as above.
Samples were collected and analyzed for the concen -
trations of 1,3PDO, 3HP and 3HPA. The initial reaction 
rates for the oxidation of 1,3PDO and 3HPA by ADH and 
ALDH were calculated for the initial 3 h of the reaction. 
For ADH, the reaction rate was calculated as the con
-
sumption rate of 1,3PDO, while for ALDH, the reaction 
rate was calculated as the production rate of 3HP . Since 
3HPA is not available commercially, for plotting the rela
-
tion between the substrate concentration (3HPA) and 
the initial reaction rate, the substrate concentration was 
calculated as the number of moles of 1,3PDO consumed 
after 3  h of biotransformation. Since 1,3PDO oxida
-
tion is a quantitative process ([3HPA] initial  =  consumed 
[1,3PDO] = accumulated 3HPA + 3HP). The same strat-
egy was used earlier for measuring the kinetics of the 
same enzymes [31].
The biotransformation kinetics were determined using 
the following equations:
 –
  –
  –
 –
where X is the cell density (g
CDW/L).
Catalytic dehydration of 3HP to AA
The 3HP solution obtained as a product from glycerol via 
two-step biotransformation was sterilized by filtration. 
A stainless steel tube (300  ×  7.8  mm) was packed with 
12  g TiO
2 and placed in an oven. Pre-heated 3HP solu -
tion (8.00  mg/mL, pH 5.7) was fed into the pre-heated 
reaction tube using a quantitative pump (JASCO, Tokyo, 
Japan) at different flow rates for providing different resi
-
dence times. The reaction temperature was 230  °C. The 
eluate containing AA was condensed in a cold water 
bath, collected in fractions and analyzed.
Analyses and structural elucidation
Cell growth
Cell growth was followed by measuring optical density at 
620 nm (OD620) using Ultrospec 1000 spectrophotometer 
(Pharmacia Biotech, Uppsala, Sweden) and then corre -
lated with cell dry weight (CDW). The following equation

optical density:
Measurement of substrates and products
Glycerol, 3HP , 1,3PDO and AA concentrations were 
determined by HPLC (JASCO, Tokyo, Japan) equipped 
with RI detector (ERC, Kawaguchi, Japan) and JASCO 
intelligent autosampler. Separation of the compounds was 
done using Aminex HPX-87H chromatographic column 
connected to a guard column (Biorad, Richmond, CA, 
USA). The column temperature was kept at 65  °C using 
chromatographic oven (Shimadzu, Tokyo, Japan). Sam
-
ples were diluted with Millipore quality water and mixed 
with 10  % v/v sulfuric acid (20  µL/mL sample) and then 
filtered. Forty microliter sample was injected in 0.5  mM 
sulfuric acid mobile phase flowing at a rate of 0.4 mL/min.
For the determination of 3HPA concentration, the 
modified colorimetric method of Circle et  al. 1945 [40] 
as described by Ulmer and Zeng (2007) [41] with acrolein 
as standard was used. Briefly, 200 µL of properly diluted 
sample was mixed with 150 µL of 10 mM DL-tryptophan 
solution in 50 mM HCl and 600 µL of concentrated HCl 
(fuming 37  %). The reaction mixture was incubated for 
20  min at 37  °C. The produced purple color was then 
measured using spectrophotometer at 560 nm.
Statistical analysis
The presented data are the average of two independent 
replicates  ±  standard deviation. Significant differences 
among treatment means were tested using the Student’s t 
test, with a level of significance of 0.05.
