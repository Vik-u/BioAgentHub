Malonyl-coenzyme A (malonyl-CoA) is a critical precursor for the biosynthesis of a variety
of biochemicals. It is synthesized by the catalysis of acetyl-CoA carboxylase (Acc1p),
which was demonstrated to be deactivated by the phosphorylation of Snf1 protein
kinase in yeast. In this study, we designed a synthetic malonyl-CoA biosensor and
used it to screen phosphorylation site mutations of Acc1p inSaccharomyces cerevisiae.
Thirteen phosphorylation sites were mutated, and a combination of three site mutations
in Acc1p, S686A, S659A, and S1157A, was found to increase malonyl-CoA availability.
ACC1S686AS659AS1157A expression also improved the production of 3-hydroxypropionic
acid, a malonyl-CoA-derived chemical, compared to both wild type and the previously
reported ACC1S659AS1157A mutation. This mutation will also be beneﬁcial for other
malonyl-CoA-derived products.

INTRODUCTION
Saccharomyces cerevisiae is a very potential microbial cell factory for production of a wide range
of fuels and chemicals due to its robustness and high tolerance to environmental stresses. When
engineering the cell factory to produce these products, the precursor availability is one of key
limiting factors that aﬀects the product titer. Malonyl-coenzyme A (malonyl-CoA) is a major
precursor for the production of many important biochemicals and biofuels, such as polyketides,
ﬂavonoids, and fatty acid-derived chemicals (Dixon and Steele, 1999; Hara et al., 2006; Christian,
2009; Chooi and Tang, 2013). However, the intracellular level of malonyl-CoA is very low because
malonyl-CoA synthesis is tightly regulated in S. cerevisiae (Li et al., 2014). Therefore, insuﬃcient
malonyl-CoA synthesis largely limits the production of malonyl-CoA-derived products.
In S. cerevisiae , cytosolic malonyl-CoA is synthesized from acetyl-CoA by acetyl-CoA
carboxylase (Acc1) and it is subsequently used for fatty acid synthesis. Acc1p is crucial for fatty
acids biosynthesis and the maintenance of the nuclear envelope. Acetyl-CoA carboxylases are large,
multidomain enzymes and contain a biotin carboxylase (BC) domain, a carboxyltransferase (CT)
domain and a biotin carboxyl carrier protein (BCCP) domain. Eukaryotic ACCs also contain two
non-catalytic regions, the large central domain (CD) and the BC–CT interaction domain (BT)

Chen et al. Mutating Phosphorylation Sites of Yeast Acc1p
(Hunkeler et al., 2016). As the rate-limiting enzyme for fatty
acid metabolism, Acc1p is tightly regulated both transcriptionally
and post-translationally. Similar to other phospholipid synthesis
pathway genes, the transcription of ACC1 is regulated by
the positive transcription factors Ino2p and Ino4p and the
negative regulator Opi1p (Hasslacher et al., 1993). The enzyme
activity of Acc1p is also negatively regulated by AMP-activated
protein kinase (Snf1) in S. cerevisiae (Woods et al., 1994).
It is reported that the phosphorylation of Acc1p by Snf1p
inactivates the catalytic ability of Acc1p. The activation of
Snf1p is triggered during growth under glucose derepression
conditions (less than 0.05% glucose) (Woods et al., 1994),
then the activated Snf1p phosphorylates Acc1p at one or more
phosphorylation sites and results in the partial deactivation of
Acc1p. However, potential residues for Acc1p phosphorylation
are not fully understood. Feng et al. (2015) reported that
deletion of Snf1 did not increase the 1-hexadecanol production,
but overexpressing ACC1 in 1SNF1 strain increased the
production by 50% (Feng et al., 2015). Asides from regulating
ACC1, Snf1 is also a global regulator for carbon metabolism,
β-oxidation, and stress response (Zhang et al., 2011). Thus,
SNF1 deletion may not speciﬁcally increase malonyl-CoA derived
products.
Choi and Da Silva (2014) aligned the Rattus norvegicus
(rat) Acc1p with yeast Acc1p and identiﬁed an amino acid
(Ser1157) that is critical for phosphorylation and causing
deactivation of the enzyme. The introduction of a S1157A
mutation in Acc1p increased its activity and enhanced polyketide
6-methylsalicylic acid and native fatty acid production (Choi
and Da Silva, 2014). A recent report demonstrated that the
phosphorylation of the Ser1157 residue by Snf1p triggered a
conformational change, leading to a disassociated BC domain
dimer, thus inactivating the catalytic ability of Acc1p (Wei
et al., 2016). Shi et al. identiﬁed two phosphorylation sites that
were regulated by Snf1p by comparing the phosphorylation
recognition motif (Hyd-X-Arg-XX-Ser-XXX-Hyd) (Dale
et al., 1995) and introduced a two-site mutation (S659A and
S1157A) in Acc1p. These mutations enhanced the activity
of Acc1p and subsequently increased the production of
two malonyl-CoA-derived products, fatty acid ethyl esters
and 3-hydroxypropionic acid (3-HP) (Shi et al., 2014).
However, although these studies reported the positive role
of mutations S659A and S1157A, it is still uncertain whether
Snf1p regulates Acc1p only by phosphorylating these two
sites. Li et al. (2014) manually examined the modiﬁcation
sites on Acc1p using MIDAS and conﬁrmed that 15 sites
were phosphorylated. The authors also noted that both the
native state and phosphorylated state were identiﬁed at the
same time, indicating that the regulation of phosphorylation is
complicated.
The Acc catalytic activity determination is complicated,
therefore limited the high-throughput screening the mutation
libraries of the enzyme. Intracellular malonyl-CoA concentration
is another way to reﬂect the Acc activity. The malonyl-
CoA biosensor has been designed in S. cerevisiae to facilitate
the malonyl-CoA determination using a bacterial transcription
factor FapR (fatty acid and phospholipid biosynthesis regulator)
and its DNA binding site ( fapO operator) (Schujman et al.,
2003). Li et al. (2015) designed a malonyl-CoA sensor by
inserting a fapO operator immediately upstream the TATA
box in GPM1 promoter and expression of an adapted FapR
to monitor the malonyl-CoA levels in S. cerevisiae . By using
this sensor to search a genome-wide overexpression library,
two genes, TPI1 and PMP1, were identiﬁed that improved
the intracellular malonyl-CoA concentration, thereby improving
3-HP production (Li et al., 2015). David introduced three fapO
operators in yeast TEF1 promoter to increase the sensitivity
of responding the malonyl-CoA concentration and used it
to modulate pathway ﬂux. The introduction of dual pathway
control increased 3-HP production (David et al., 2016). However,
these sensors either have a relatively high leaking transcription
or low dynamic change response to malonyl-CoA levels
(Table 1).
In this study, we aimed to construct a malonyl-CoA sensor in
S. cerevisiae that has higher sensitivity and low leaky transcription
which is very important for library screening. The sensor we
designed showed better response to malonyl-CoA concentrations
than previously reported sensors. Then we used the sensor to
detect the eﬀect of mutating all possible phosphorylation sites
of Acc1p. A mutation, Acc1p (S686AS659AS1157A), that could
increase the concentration of malonyl-CoA and the production
of 3-HP (a chemical derived from malonyl-CoA) (Figure 1), was
isolated.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Medium and Growth Conditions
Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain CEN.PK102-5B (MATa; ura3-52;
his311; leu2-3,112) was used as the background strain. Synthetic
complete (SC) dropout medium was used for recombinant yeast
strain selection. The SC medium contained 1.7 g/L yeast nitrogen
base (BBI Life Science Corporation, China), 5 g/L ammonium
sulfate, complete supplement mixture (without uracil, histidine,
or leucine) (Sunrise Science Products, United States), and
20 g/L glucose. In total, 800 µg/mL G418 (Promega Corporation,
United States) was used for selecting strains with the Kanr
marker. For routine cloning procedures, Escherichia coli Trans2-
Blue (Beijing TransGen Biotech Co., Ltd, China) was used
and grown in Luria–Bertani (LB) medium with 100 µg/L
ampicillin.
Plasmid and Strain Construction
All the plasmids and strains used in this study are listed in
Supplementary Tables S1 and S2. The primers used in this study
are listed in Supplementary Table S3. Yeast strain transformation
was accomplished using the LiAc method. The obtained plasmids
were veriﬁed by DNA sequencing.
The malonyl-CoA reductase encoding gene MCR from
Chloroﬂexus aurantiacus was codon optimized, digested with
NotI and SacI, and ligated into the 2µ plasmid pIYC04 under the
control of the TEF1 promoter and ADH1 terminator. T4 DNA
ligase (New England Biolabs, United States) was used for plasmid
construction.

For a high level of fapR expression, the codon-optimized
fapR was digested with SacI and SalI and then ligated
into the pre-digested 2 µ plasmid pYX242WS, resulting in
the plasmid pYX242WS-fapR. A synthetic promoter was
constructed by combining 203 bp of the TEF1 promoter
upstream activation sequence and 147 bp of the GAL1 core
promoter (with an identiﬁed TATA box). The FapR binding
site, 17 bp of the fapO operator (TTAGTATCAGGTACTAA),
was inserted into the GAL1 core promoter, 7 bp immediately
behind the TATA box and replaced the original sequence
to obtain the synthetic promoter GAL1p(7)fapO ( Figure 2A )
(Schujman et al., 2003; Blazeck et al., 2012; Xu et al.,
2014). The yeGFP (yeast-enhanced green ﬂuorescent protein-
encoding gene) was fused with the synthetic promoter by
fusion PCR, and the fragment was then digested with AatII
and EcoRI and inserted into the pre-digested pYX242WS
or pYX242WS-fapR plasmid to create pJfapO and pJfapO-
fapR. To obtain synthetic promoters GAL1p(61)fapO and
fapO(0)GAL1p, the fapO operator was inserted 61 bp behind
or immediately upstream the TATA box separately. Each of
the synthetic promoters was fused with yeGFP and then
was cloned into a 2 µ plasmid to obtain plasmid pIFapO(0)
and pIFapO(61) through yeast homologous recombination.
The codon-optimized fapR with SV40 NLS sequence at the
3′ end was digested with NotI and SacI and then cloned
into plasmids pIFapO(0) and pIFapO(61) separately to create
pIFapO(0)-FapR and pIFapO(61)-FapR. To obtain a low
level of fapR expression, fapR, which was controlled by the
TEF1 promoter, was integrated into the yeast genome using
Kanr as the selection marker. The plasmid pJFE3-fapO was
transformed into the fapR integration strain. The sequence
information of fapR and MCR was included in supplemental
data.
Site-directed mutagenesis was introduced by designing
mutant sites containing primers. A full ACC1 sequence with
mutated residues was obtained by fusion PCR. ACC1 mutations
were inserted into the 2µ plasmid pJFE3 under the control of the
TEF1 promoter and PGK1 terminator through yeast homologous
recombination. The constructed plasmids were veriﬁed by PCR
and sequencing.

Fluorescence intensity was used to evaluate the sensor activity.
The sensor-carrying strains were pre-cultured overnight. The

fresh SC medium at an initial OD600 of 1 at 30 ◦C, 200 rpm,
and diﬀerent concentrations of cerulenin (0, 0.5, 2.5, 5, 10,
15 µM) were added if necessary. For the ﬂuorescence intensity
assay, a 1 mL culture was isolated after 2 h of growth and
centrifuged at 4 ◦C and 13,000 rpm for 2 min, and the pellets
were washed twice with distilled water. A 200 µL cell suspension
was used for ﬂuorescence intensity measurement in triplicate.
Fluorescence was measured using a 1420 Multilabel Counter
(VICTOR3V , PerkinElmer, United States). The excitation and
emission wavelengths for GFP were 485 ±20 and 585 ±20,
respectively. The cell density was measured at 600 nm (Eppendorf
BioPhotometer, Germany). The ﬂuorescence intensity (a.u.) was
determined relative to cell density. To detect the ﬂuorescence
intensity of the mutations, the strains were pre-cultured
overnight, inoculated in shake ﬂasks at an initial OD600 of 0.2 in
10 mL of SC medium, and cultivated 30 ◦C at 200 rpm. Samples
were taken after 6 h, and ﬂuorescence was measured as described
above.

RESULTS
Design an Efﬁcient Malonyl-CoA Sensor
in S. cerevisiae
Malonyl-CoA acts as a direct and speciﬁc inducer of FapR-
regulated promoters in Bacillus subtilis (Schujman et al., 2006).
FapR binds to fapO (the operator region on the fap regulon)
in the promoter region, which blocks the access of RNA
polymerase II, thus repressing the transcription of downstream
fatty acid pathway genes. Malonyl-CoA interacts with FapR and
triggers a conformational change in FapR, consequently enabling
FapR to disassociate from DNA and relieve the transcription
repression. Based on that, we designed a malonyl-CoA sensor
in S. cerevisiae and used yeGFP as a reporter to monitor the
intracellular malonyl-CoA levels. To obtain a more eﬃcient
sensor, the leaking transcription should be low, which means
that when fapR binding to fapO, the basic transcription level
should be low. In addition, the sensor also needs to response
to the change of malonyl-CoA level sensitively, which means
that the dynamic change of the ﬂuorescence intensity should be
high. Therefore, we chose a synthetic hybrid promoter containing
the upstream activated sequence (UAS) of TEF1 promoter and
core promoter sequence (begin with TATA box) of GAL1. The
UAS from TEF1 allowed the high expression of downstream
gene without fapR binding, and TATA box in the core promoter
facilitate to decide the locations of fapO operator. The FapR
binding site, 17 bp of the fapO operator, was inserted either 7 bp
or 61 bp downstream of the TATA box inGAL1 core promoter, or
immediately upstream the TATA box, and yeGFP was controlled
by these synthetic hybrid promoters in a 2µ plasmid (Figure 2A).
The codon-optimized fapR was expressed under the control
of the TEF1 promoter in a 2 µ plasmid. When fapO was
inserted 7 bp downstream of the TATA box [GAL1p(7)fapO for
briefness], the transcription was almost completely shut down.
The ﬂuorescence intensity with FapR was only 0.05% relative to
that without FapR, demonstrating the eﬃcient repression eﬀect
of FapR when binding to this position ( Figure 2B ). However,
when fapO was inserted 61 bp downstream of the TATA box
[GAL1p(61)fapO for briefness] or immediately upstream of
the TATA box [fapO(0)GAL1p for briefness], no transcription
repression was observed, demonstrating that the location of fapO

Chen et al. Mutating Phosphorylation Sites of Yeast Acc1p
on these two sites was not eﬃcient enough for FapR to inhibit
transcription initiation.
Besides the eﬀect of fapO location in promoter, we also
detected the expression level of FapR to the behavior of
the sensor. The fapR was integrated into the genome to
obtain low expression level, and the yeGFP was controlled
by the GAL1p(7)fapO synthetic promoter. We found that
compared with the FapR expressed in a 2 µ plasmid, a low
level of FapR expression resulted in high ﬂuorescence intensity
which implicated that low FapR expression caused high leaky
transcription (Figure 2B).
Cerulenin inhibits fatty acid synthesis by speciﬁc inhibition
of β-ketoacyl-acyl carrier protein synthetase (Kawaguchi
et al., 1982), and inhibits malonyl-CoA consumption for
fatty acid synthesis. Thus, the intracellular malonyl-CoA
concentration correlates with the amount of cerulenin added
to the culture. As shown in Figure 2C , as for the sensor
containing the GAL1p(7)fapO synthetic promoter, with a
gradient supply of cerulenin, the ﬂuorescence intensity also
increased gradually, reaching to eightfold with 10 µM cerulenin
(saturated concentration) relative to the condition without
cerulenin in high FapR expression strain. The ﬂuorescence
intensity only increased onefold with cerulenin supply in
low FapR expression strain ( Figure 2C ). As expected, the
ﬂuorescence intensity of the sensor containing fapO(0)GAL1p
or GAL1p(61)fapO synthetic promoter did not increase with
increased dose of cerulenin addition, indicating these two
designs could not respond the malonyl-CoA concentration.
These results demonstrated that high FapR expression combined
with GAL1p(7)fapO synthetic promoter showed better response
to the change of malonyl-CoA levels.
Comparing with the previously reported malonyl-CoA sensor
(Table 1), the sensor with GAL1p(7)fapO synthetic promoter and
high FapR expression designed in this study showed a low leaky
transcription and a better sensitivity to the change of malonyl-
CoA levels, which are very important properties for library
screening.
Site-Directed Mutations of
Phosphorylation Sites of Acc1p
Increased Intracellular Malonyl-CoA
Levels
Although mutations of Ser659 and Ser1157 phosphorylation
sites have been shown to improve the synthesis of malonyl-
CoA-derived products, it remains unclear whether other
phosphorylation sites may have a positive impact. In this
work, we mutated 13 predicted phosphorylation sites of Acc1p
according to Li et al.’s (2014) report ( Figure 3A ), which
conﬁrmed 15 phosphorylation sites of Acc1p via MIDAS.
The other two predicted phosphorylation residues are not
existed in the Acc1p from CEN.PK background strain used
in this work. The phosphorylation residues were mutated to
alanine. The sensor plasmid was then transformed into the
Acc1p mutation-containing strains to screen the malonyl-CoA-
overproducing mutants. We found that the ﬂuorescence intensity
of strains containing Acc1p(S686A) and Acc1p(T1823A)
was increased relative to the wild type, even though the
increased range was still lower than strain with the previously
reported Acc1p(S659AS1157A) double mutation. The remaining
phosphorylation site mutations did not show a positive eﬀect
on malonyl-CoA levels ( Figure 3B ). We further combined
S686A and T1823A single mutations with the S659AS1157A
double mutation to see if the combination mutations can
achieve further increase in malonyl-CoA generation. As shown
in Figure 3C , the introduction of the S686A mutation further
improved the ﬂuorescence intensity of the ACC1S659AS1157A-
expressing strain, whereas T1823A did not further enhance the
ﬂuorescence intensity, although the ﬂuorescence intensity of
the Acc1p(T1823A) mutant was higher than wild-type Acc1p.
These results indicated that Acc1p(S686AS659AS1157A) can
produce more malonyl-CoA and should have higher enzyme
activity.
The Effect of Site Mutations of Acc1p to
3-HP Production
We then analyzed the production of 3-HP , a malonyl-CoA-
derived chemical, to determine whether the increase in malonyl-
CoA would result in higher production of malonyl-CoA-
derived chemical ( Figure 1 ). The heterogeneous gene MCR,
which encodes a bifunctional enzyme that includes malonyl-
CoA reductase and 3-hydroxypropionate dehydrogenase, was
overexpressed in Acc1p mutation strains (Hugler et al., 2002).
The titer of 3-HP in the ACC1S659AS1157A-expressing strain
was improved by 1.2-fold relative to the wild type, which is
consistent with the positive role of the S659AS1157A mutation
in a previous study (Shi et al., 2014). The titer of 3-HP in
the ACC1S686AS659AS1157A-expressing strain was improved by
1.5-fold compared with the wild type, which is higher than
the ACC1S659AS1157A-expressing strain ( Figure 4 ). This ﬁnding
conﬁrmed that the S686AS659AS1157A mutation of Acc1p
contributed to an increase in malonyl-CoA availability. However,
the S686A single mutation of Acc1p did not improve 3-HP
production. This result indicated that S686A could beneﬁt 3-
HP production only when integrated with the S659AS1157A
mutation. Additionally, although the ﬂuorescence intensity of
ACC1T1823A- and ACC1T1823AS659AS1157A-expressing strains was
higher than the wild type, 3-HP production did not increase,
excluding the positive role of T1823A for 3-HP generation. Cell
growth of the engineered strains was not obviously changed by
ACC1 mutation expression (Supplementary Figure S2).
DISCUSSION
The low production of malonyl-CoA in yeast constrains the
biosynthesis of many valuable malonyl-CoA-derived compounds,
such as ﬂavonoids, polyketides, and fatty acid-derived fuels.
Malonyl-CoA is generated from acetyl-CoA by the catalysis of
acetyl-CoA carboxylase. The activity of Acc1p is tightly regulated,
and the phosphorylation of Acc1p by Snf1 protein kinase can
inactivate Acc1p. Mutations of the phosphorylation sites Ser1157
and Ser659 have been shown to enhance the activity of Acc1p
and consequently the ability to synthesize malonyl-CoA-derived

products (Choi and Da Silva, 2014). However, there are more
phosphorylation sites in Acc1p. Li et al. (2014) predicted 15
possible phosphorylation sites in Acc1p by in vitro experiments,
and it is necessary to explore the role of these phosphorylation
sites in the enzymatic bioactivity of acetyl-CoA carboxylase.
To facilitate the screening of phosphorylation site mutations,
a malonyl-CoA sensor was constructed. Compared with the
other two previously reported malonyl-CoA sensors (Li et al.,
2015; David et al., 2016), the sensor we designed in this work
showed low leaky transcription and better sensitivity to the
change of malonyl-CoA concentrations (Table 1). Although these
malonyl-CoA sensors used operators from the same origin (fapO
from B. subtilis ), the behavior is very diﬀerent when inserting
the operator to diﬀerent promoters. As for the TEF1-GAL1
synthetic promoter in this work, the transcription was not
repressed when fapO was located immediately upstream TATA
box, while the same position in GPM1 promoter worked well.
When the distance between fapO and the TATA box in TEF1-
GAL1 synthetic promoter extended to 61 bp, the transcription
repression eﬀect was disappeared. It seems that inserting one
operator 7 bp downstream of TATA box in TATA-containing
promoter is enough for FapR to repress the transcription
initiation, whereas it is not the case when the operators were
inserted to the TATA-less promoter TEF1 where three operators
were needed to repress the transcription eﬀectively. In fact,
the promoter property and operator locations are important to
decide the performance of the biosensors.
Among the phosphorylation site mutations, the S659AS1157A
double mutation increased 3-HP production, which conﬁrmed
the role of these phosphorylation sites. Combining the S686A
mutation with the S659AS1157A double mutation further
increased 3-HP production, suggesting that the phosphorylation
site mutation of Ser686 further improved the enzyme activity
of Acc1p. Ser1157 phosphorylation triggers a conformational
change that disables the formation of the BC dimer domain, thus
eliminating the catalysis activity (Hunkeler et al., 2016). However,

induced by the phosphorylation of Ser659. By analyzing the
Acc1p structure (from RCSB Protein Data Bank) using PyMOL
software, we speculated that phosphorylation of Ser659 might
inﬂuence the biotin moiety binding by regulating the active loop
in BC domain. It is possible that the phosphorylation of Ser686
aﬀected the enzyme activity through indirectly regulating the
covalent state of Ser659 (Supplementary Figure S1).
We found that the ﬂuorescence intensity was not completely
consistent with 3-HP production. Only the strains with much
higher ﬂuorescence intensity showed a beneﬁcial eﬀect on 3-
HP production. It is probably because malonyl-CoA is an
intermediate metabolite and can be consumed easily. Synthetic
malonyl-CoA sensor can show the transient malonyl-CoA
concentration. However, the production of 3-HP revealed the
amount of malonyl-CoA ﬂux to the downstream products.
Therefore, when using a malonyl-CoA sensor to do high-
throughput screening, it is essential to set up a ﬂuorescence
intensity threshold to obtain the mutations with higher products
titer.
In this work, we studied the impact of phosphorylation
regulation on the activity of acetyl-CoA carboxylase. We
discovered that a combination mutation with S686A, S659A, and
S1157A could beneﬁt 3-HP production better than the previously
reported S659S1157A mutation. Moreover, the malonyl-CoA
sensor designed in this work was demonstrated to be a useful tool
to screen mutations with improved malonyl-CoA pools.
