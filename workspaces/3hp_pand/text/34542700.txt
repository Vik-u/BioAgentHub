Abstract 
Acetic acid bacteria (AAB) can selectively oxidize diols into their corresponding hydroxyacids. Notably, they can 
convert 1,3‑propanediol (1,3‑PDO) into 3‑hydroxypropionic acid (3‑HP), which is a promising building‑block. Until 
now, 3‑HP production with AAB is carried out in batch and using resting cells at high cell densities (up to 10 g  L−1 of 
cell dry weight). This approach is likely limited by detrimental accumulation of the intermediate 3‑hydroxypropanal 
(3‑HPA). Herein, we investigate an alternative implementation that allows highly efficient 3‑HP production with lower 
cell densities of growing cells and that prevents 3‑HPA accumulation. First, growth and 3‑HP production of Acetobac-
ter sp. CIP 58.66 were characterized with 1,3‑PDO or glycerol as growth substrate. The strain was then implemented 
in a bioreactor, during a sequential process where it was first cultivated on glycerol, then the precursor 1,3‑PDO was 
continuously supplied at a varying rate, easily controlled by the pH control. Different pH set points were tested (5.0, 
4.5, and 4.0). This approach used the natural resistance of acetic acid bacteria to acidic conditions. Surprisingly, when 
pH was controlled at 5.0, the performances achieved in terms of titer (69.76  g3‑HP  L−1), mean productivity (2.80  g3‑HP 
 L−1  h−1), and molar yield (1.02  mol3‑HP  mol−1
1,3‑PDO) were comparable to results obtained with genetically improved 
strains at neutral pH. The present results were obtained with comparatively lower cell densities (from 0.88 to 2.08 g 
 L−1) than previously reported. This feeding strategy could be well‑suited for future scale‑up, since lower cell densities 
imply lower process costs and energy needs.

Introduction
Future petroleum shortage as well as environmental con -
cerns have become major issues for the chemical indus -
try to face in the upcoming decades. In order to ensure 
that these challenges are addressed and that companies 
remain competitive, public policies are pushing towards 
more bio-based processes. In 2015, bio-based chemi -
cals represented only 6.8% of the overall manufacture 
of chemicals in the European Union (Piotrowski et  al. 
2018). Yet the European Union has set itself ambitious 
objectives through its Bio-based Industries Consortium 
(BIC). In particular, 30% of the production of chemi -
cals in the European Union should become bio-based 
by 2030 (BIC 2012). In order to meet these objectives, 
new products and processes still need to be imagined

or further optimized, so that they reach industrial scale 
and financial viability. Top value-added chemicals from 
biomass were listed by the US Department of Energy 
in order to focus research efforts on the most promis -
ing candidates (Bozell and Petersen 2010; Werpy and 
Petersen 2004). Among them is 3-hydroxypropionic acid 
(3-HP): its bifunctionality makes it a versatile platform 
molecule for further conversion into useful chemicals. 
Microbial production of 3-HP has been extensively stud -
ied and significant advances have been made (de Fou -
chécour et  al. 2018; Kumar et  al. 2013). However, some 
technical hurdles remain and bio-based 3-HP is not yet 
commercialized.
One of the dominant approaches so far has been 
3-HP biosynthesis from glycerol, either through a coen -
zyme A-dependent or -independent metabolic route (de 
Fouchécour et  al. 2018). In both cases, glycerol is first 
converted into 3-hydroxypropanal (3-HPA), which is 
subsequently oxidized into 3-HP or reduced into 1,3-pro-
panediol (1,3-PDO). These oxidative and reducing path -
ways are in redox balance with one another: 1,3-PDO 
is an obligate co-product of the biosynthesis of 3-HP 
from glycerol. Consequently, it is of interest to imple -
ment a subsequent step for its conversion to 3-HP , so 
that the yield and the selectivity of the overall process are 
improved.
Acetic acid bacteria (AAB) have a double interest (i) 
they can selectively oxidise diols into hydroxycarbox -
ylic acids (Füchtenbusch et  al. 1998; Lynch et  al. 2019); 
(ii) moreover, they have been selected, through evolu -
tion, to resist relatively high acid concentrations and low 
pH, because their activity acidifies their natural envi -
ronments. In this light, 1,3-PDO conversion into 3-HP 
using AAB was recently investigated on a few occasions 
(Dishisha et al. 2015; Li et al. 2016; Zhao et al. 2015; Zhu 
et al. 2018). By analogy with ethanol oxidation into ace -
tate, 3-HP synthesis from 1,3-PDO by these bacteria is 
thought to be a two-step pathway, set on the outer side of 
the membrane, with 3-HPA as an intermediate (Dishisha 
et al. 2015; Zhu et al. 2018). The AAB Gluconobacter oxy-
dans was implemented, as part of multi-step processes 
where 1,3-PDO was first produced from glycerol by 
Klebsiella pneumoniae or Lactobacillus reuteri (Dishisha 
et  al. 2015; Zhao et  al. 2015). The pathway is presented 
on Fig.  1. The performances of immobilized Acetobacter 
sp. CGMCC 8142 for 3-HP production from 1,3-PDO 
were also evaluated (Li et al. 2016). These studies mainly 
focused on pH, temperature, and concentrations of sub -
strate and biocatalyst as main parameters for process 
optimization. In all these studies, resting bacteria were 
operated in batch mode and showed promising results: 
1,3-PDO was quantitatively converted to 3-HP , with lit -
tle to no by-products, and high titres could be reached 
(up to 66.95  g  L−1), thanks to the bacterial tolerance to 
acidic conditions. Acrylic acid was the only reported 
by-product of 1,3-PDO oxidation (Zhao et  al. 2015). In 
their study, Dishisha et  al. (2015) also observed tran -
sient 3-HPA accumulation, with a peak around 2  g  L−1, 
which could be explained by an imbalance between the 
two successive enzymatic steps (Zhu et al. 2018). 3-HPA 
is a strong microbial inhibitor and could notably hinder 
performances of the process. Indeed, the accumulation 
observed by Dishisha et al. (2015) exceeded the minimum 
inhibitory concentrations (MIC) of 3-HPA that were esti-
mated on Escherichia coli and ranged from 0.56 to 1.11 g 
 L−1 (Cleusix et al. 2007).
Accumulation of 3-HPA will likely become a major 
limitation to the practical implementation of 3-HP pro -
duction by AAB. In addition, previous studies used high 
AAB cell densities in their experiments: from 3.25  g of 
cell dry weight (DW) per litre (Dishisha et al. 2015), up 
to 10  gDW  L−1 (Zhao et al. 2015). Batch operation of such 
biocatalyst concentrations may contribute to fast 3-HPA 
accumulation, so future scale-up 3-HP production with

AAB will necessitate alternative approaches. Genetic 
engineering work could help overcoming these chal -
lenges, for example by overexpressing the aldehyde 
dehydrogenase. Complementarily, a tailored bioprocess 
design can also contribute to increasing the production 
performance. This paper proposes a sequential process 
for efficient 3-HP production with the wild-type AAB 
Acetobacter sp. CIP 58.66 at low pH. First, the potential 
of the strain as 3-HP producer was verified. Preliminary 
tests were carried out in shake flasks, in order to identify 
the key limitations and the best suited operational condi -
tions. When used as sole energy source, only low concen-
trations of 1,3-PDO could ensure sub-inhibitory 3-HPA 
levels and thus growth remained limited. A sequential 
process was then designed where the strain was first 
cultivated in batch mode on glycerol as energy source, 
then, at late exponential-phase, a fed-batch bioconver -
sion of 1,3-PDO into 3-HP was started in order to keep 
a low 1,3-PDO concentration and to prevent high 3-HPA 
accumulation. Since the consumption of 1,3-PDO ulti -
mately acidifies the medium due to 3-HP accumulation, 
a simple feeding strategy based on pH control was imple -
mented for the fed-batch phase: 1,3-PDO was mixed with 
the base used for pH control in equimolar proportions. 
By doing so, it is expected that 1,3-PDO will be added 
continuously to the broth in the same amount than the 
amount of base required for 3-HP neutralization. A simi -
lar approach was already proven successful for lactic acid 
production by Lactobacillus lactis (Zhang et  al. 2010). 
The present work investigates the performances and the 
advantages of such a strategy for 3-HP production by 
AAB at low pH which is a clear advantage for industrial 
production and is favourable to specific in  situ product 
recovery (de Fouchécour et  al. 2018). A kinetic analysis 
was carried out by fitting a modified Gompertz model 
to bacterial growth and 3-HP production kinetics. This 
allowed to estimate the specific production and growth 
rates and it contributed to a better description of the 
underlying physiological phenomena.
Materials and methods
Materials
The strain was purchased as Acetobacter aceti CIP 58.66 
from the Biological Resource Center of Pasteur Institute 
(Paris, France). However, 16S rRNA gene analysis per -
formed for this study revealed that the strain does not 
belong to the aceti species but to the cerevisiae species. 
The strain is thus referred to as Acetobacter sp. CIP 58.66 
in this paper. Its 16S rRNA nucleotide sequence is avail -
able on the GenBank database with the accession number 
MZ242087.
Yeast extract and Bacto ™ Peptone were obtained 
respectively from Organotechnie (La Courneurve, 
France) and BD-France (Le Pont de Claix, France). 
Monohydrate citric acid was purchased from Acros 
Organics (Geel, Belgium). Glycerol and trichloroacetic 
acid were acquired from VWR Chemicals (Leuven, Bel -
gium). 1,3-PDO,  K2HPO4, ammonium hydroxide and 
sulfuric acid were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich (Saint 
Louis, USA). 3-HP (30% w/v) was purchased from TCI 
Europe (Zwijndrecht, Belgium). Lastly, 3-HPA was chem-
ically synthesized at URD Agro-Biotechnologies Indus -
trielles (Pomacle, France) according to (Burgé et al. 2015).
Preparation of the inocula
The strain was stored at – 80  °C in 20% (w/v) glycerol. 
For inocula preparation, 1 mL of stock culture was added 
to 25 mL of sterile, basal medium (5 g  L−1 yeast extract, 
8.71 g  L−1  K2HPO4, 3 g  L−1 peptone; pH was adjusted to 
6.5 with a 5.5  mol  L−1  H2SO4 solution) in 250  mL baf -
fled shake flasks, and incubated for 63  h in an incuba -
tor shaker (Infors Multitron, Bottmingen, Switzerlan) at 
30 °C and 200 rotations per minute (rpm). This inoculum 
was used directly for batch experiments in shake flasks. 
For bioreactor experiments, a second culture was car -
ried out for volume expansion: 1 mL of the first culture 
was inoculated to 50  mL of sterile basal medium sup -
plemented with glycerol (10  g  L−1), in 500  mL baffled 
shake flasks. This culture was incubated 24  h at 30  °C 
and 200  rpm. Sterility was assured by autoclaving all 
medium-containing flasks at 120 °C for 20 min.
Batch growth experiments in shake flasks
Batch cultures on 1,3-PDO were carried out in 500  mL 
baffled shake flasks containing 50  mL of sterile basal 
medium. Prior to inoculation, the medium was supplied 
with filter-sterilized 1,3-PDO, in order to reach concen -
trations of 5, 10 or 20  g  L−1. Cultures were inoculated 
with an initial cell dry weight (DW) of 0.04  gDW  L−1. Cul-
tures were then incubated at 30  °C and 200  rpm. Each 
condition was tested in duplicate. A control condition 
was also tested without any addition of 1,3-PDO to the 
basal medium.
Batch cultures on glycerol were performed similarly. 
Sterile basal medium was supplemented with 10 g  L−1 of 
glycerol and a citrate–phosphate buffer was used (9 g  L−1 
 K2HPO4 and 4.4 g  L−1 citric acid). Initial pH was adjusted 
to 6.5, 5.0, 4.5 or 4.0, using  H2SO4 (5.5  mol  L−1). Each 
condition was tested in three replicates.
Semi‑continuous bioconversion experiments 
in a bioreactor
Semi-continuous bioconversions were carried out at 
30 °C in a 3.6 L Labfors 4 bioreactor (Infors, Bottmingen, 
Switzerland), with an initial working volume of 1 L. The 
bioreactor was autoclaved with the medium at 120  °C 
Page 4 of 11de Fouchécour et al. AMB Expr          (2021) 11:130 
during 20 min. Online measurements (temperature, pH, 
partial pressure of  O2, stirring rate, air flow rate) were 
saved through Iris v.5 software (Infors). Partial pressure 
of  O2  (pO2) and pH were monitored with 405-DPAS-SC 
and InPro 6800 probes respectively (Mettler Toledo). The 
 pO2 probe was calibrated in the medium at 30  °C, just 
before inoculation. 100% and 0% values were calibrated 
by successively saturating the medium with dry air at 4 
normal litres per minute (NL  min−1) and with  N2 (> 99%) 
at 1.5  bar, with a constant agitation speed of 400  rpm, 
during 20 min each. During bacterial cultures, agitation 
speed (100–800  rpm, Rushton turbine) and airflow rate 
(1–4 NL  min−1) were automatically controlled in order to 
maintain  pO2 above 40%.
First, a growth phase on glycerol was carried out in 
batch mode. The initial medium (1 L) was composed of 
10 g  L−1 glycerol, 5 g  L−1 yeast extract, 3 g  L−1 peptone. 
pH was initially adjusted to 5.0 using  H2SO4 (5.5 mol  L−1) 
and then left uncontrolled during growth on glycerol. 
The bioreactor was inoculated so that the initial DW was 
around 0.02  gDW  L−1. Due to the inoculation, the initial 
pH rose to 5.2. Once the late exponential growth phase 
was reached, pH was adjusted to 4.0, 4.5 or 5.0 using 
 H2SO4 (5.5  mol  L−1). Filter-sterilized 1,3-PDO (5  mL) 
was then added to the medium in order to trigger bio -
conversion, and an equimolar solution of  NH4OH and 
1,3-PDO was plugged to the bioreactor, for both pH con -
trol and 1,3-PDO feeding purposes. Each condition was 
tested in duplicates. A schematic representation of the 
process is shown on Fig. 2.
Analytical methods
Bacterial biomass measurements
Cell growth was monitored by off-line optical density 
(OD) measurements at 600  nm using an Evolution 201 
spectrophotometer (ThermoScientific, Madison, USA). 
OD was correlated to cell dry weight (DW) using five 
dedicated shake flask cultures on glycerol. At 8, 24, 30 
and 48 h of culture, 10 mL broth samples were taken and 
filtered on pre-dried PES filters (pore size: 0.2 µm). These 
filters were then dried in an oven at 90 °C for at least 24 h. 
Filters were weighted just before filtration and after dry -
ing, on a precision scale (Sartorius ED224S, Goettingen, 
Germany). DW was derived from the difference between 
the two weightings. Measurements were also performed 
with sterile, basal medium. The following relationship 
was established:
Chemical analysis
Glycerol, 1,3-PDO, 3-HP and 3-HPA were quantified 
by HPLC with a refractive index detector (Waters 2414, 
(1)DW = 0.59·OD (R2 = 0.96)
Guyancourt, France). 750 µL of each sample was mixed 
with 750 µL of a trichloroacetic acid solution (6% v/w) 
and put at 0  °C for at least 45  min, for protein precipi -
tation. Samples were then centrifuged at 10,000g during 
4  min at 4  °C. Supernatants were then filtered through 
nylon filters (pore size: 0.2 µm). Analysis was performed 
on an Aminex HPX-87H column (300  mm × 7.8  mm; 
Bio-Rad, Richmond, USA). 3-HPA was analyzed at a 
0.6 mL  min−1 flow rate at 35 °C, with 5 mmol  L−1  H2SO4 
as mobile phase. 1,3-PDO and 3-HP from samples not 
containing glycerol were analyzed in the same condi -
tions, while samples containing glycerol were analyzed 
at a 0.4  mL   min−1 flow rate at 65  °C, with  H2SO4 at 
0.5 mmol  L−1 as mobile phase, allowing better resolution 
between 3-HP and glycerol peaks. Chromatograms were 
analyzed using Empower 3 software (Waters). Regarding 
3-HP and 3-HPA, no high purity, analytical-grade prod -
uct can be found commercially. Their quantifications are 
therefore likely to be subjected to higher measurements 
errors, which could explain why the overall carbon recov-
ery of some experiments was found slightly above 100%.
Calculations
Working volume correction In bioreactor experiments, 
despite the use of a condenser on the gas outlet pipe, a 
volume loss still occurred, due to dry air sparging and to 
long culture times. It was thus necessary to take this phe -
nomenon into account in the analysis. For each experi -
ment, the final working volume was measured and the

overall volume loss was calculated proportionally to the 
cumulative air flow.
Kinetics analysis Kinetics were analysed using the 
Gompertz model, as modified by Zwietering et al. (1990) 
(Eq. 2):
where e represents exp(1), t is the time (h) and a, b, c 
are the parameters to be fitted. The model was first fit -
ted to the natural logarithm of the relative population 
size ln(DWt/DW0). In this case, parameter b is the maxi -
mal specific growth rate µ max  (h−1). Results are given as 
parameter estimation ± standard error of estimation. 
Model fitting was validated by computing the Root Mean 
Square Error (RMSE). RMSE were normalised by the 
mean value of the experimental data, in order to compare 
them for different models.
The same model was also fitted to 3-HP concentrations: 
the time derivative of this is the volumetric productivity 
 r3-HP  (g3-HP  L−1  h−1). Specific 3-HP productivities,  q3-HP 
 (g3-HP  gDW
−1  h−1), were estimated by first fitting dedi -
cated Gompertz models to 3-HP and DW amounts in 
grams, in order to take into account the variation of vol -
ume. Then, using both fitted models,  q3-HP was computed 
using Eq. 3, with a 0.01 h time step:
Parameter optimisation was performed with the Leven-
berg–Marquardt least-squares method, using Python 3.6 
and the “curve_fit” function from package scipy.optimize.

Because of a biphasic exponential growth on glycerol, 
specific growth rates were estimated for both phases 
separately by performing linear regression of ln(DW t/
DW0) values against time. These regressions were 
done in Python 3.6, with function “OLS” from package 
statsmodel.api.
Moreover, number of generations  Ng of a growth phase 
were computed as  log2(DWf/DWi), where  DWi and  DWf 
are respectively the initial and the final DW values of the 
considered growth phase.
Statistical analysis Results are all given as mean ± sam-
ple standard deviation, and the sample size is reminded 
as “n = ” . For n = 2, results are given as mean ± half the 
amplitude between the duplicates. Means were compared 
using the Fisher-Pitman permutation test, for which no 
distribution hypothesis is required. These tests were car -
ried out with the “oneway_test” function (with “distribu -
tion” option set to “asymptomatic”) from “coin” package 
on R 3.3.1 software. Differences were considered signifi -
cant when p-value was lower than 0.05.
Results
Effect of initial 1,3‑PDO concentration in batch cultures
First, the ability of Acetobacter sp. CIP 58.66 to perform 
growth-coupled 1,3-PDO bioconversion was investi -
gated. Growth was tested in shake flasks on a complex 
medium containing either 0, 5, 10 or 20  g  L−1 of 1,3-
PDO. To some extent, the basal medium without 1,3-
PDO was sufficient to support the growth of the strain. 
Indeed, in absence of 1,3-PDO, growth was observed, 
with a final cell density of 0.18  gDW  L−1 (Table 1). When 
1,3-PDO was added to the basal medium, changes in 
growth patterns were observed. Maximal growth rate

µmax was found significantly higher with 1,3-PDO than 
without (p -value = 0.01), but it was independent from 
the initial concentration. With 5 and 10  g  L−1 initial 
1,3-PDO, final cell densities were also higher com -
pared to the control, whereas they were lower for 20 g 
 L−1 initial 1,3-PDO (Table  1). These results show that 
Acetobacter sp. CIP 58.66 is able to use 1,3-PDO during 
its growth, either as carbon or energy source. Yet, the 
highest cell density was achieved with the lowest ini -
tial 1,3-PDO concentration, meaning that higher sub -
strate levels cause inhibition either directly (substrate 
inhibition) or indirectly (product inhibition). Previous 
studies on 1,3-PDO bioconversion into 3-HP using 
AAB focused on resting cells only, and biomass evolu -
tion was not measured over time (Dishisha et al. 2015; 
Zhao et  al. 2015). Therefore, this is the first report of 
1,3-PDO affecting the growth of an AAB.
The conditions with the best growth performances 
(5 g  L−1 initial 1,3-PDO) was also the one displaying the 
best bioconversion performances: only in that condi -
tion was 1,3-PDO fully depleted. For 10 and 20  g  L−1 
initial concentrations, consumption dropped to 53.7% 
and 14.4%, respectively. This trend is consistent with 
the observations of Dishisha et  al. (2015) on another 
AAB: in their study, resting cells of Gluconobacter oxy -
dans consumed 95.3%, 86.1% and 31.3% of 5, 10 and 
20 g  L−1 of initial 1,3-PDO. Furthermore, full substrate 
depletion was also associated with the highest 3-HP 
yield and titre, as well as with the lowest level of 3-HPA 
production (Table  1). Contrarily, for 10 and 20  g  L−1 
initial 1,3-PDO, final 3-HP yields were lower: this was 
attributed to higher HPA accumulation.
These results show that AAB growth and 3-HP pro -
duction is best achieved with a 5  g  L−1 initial 1,3-PDO 
concentration. In this case, 1,3-PDO was quasi-quantita -
tively converted to 3-HP; substrate and 3-HPA inhibition 
were thus prevented. The almost quantitative production 
of 3-HP may suggest that 1,3-PDO is not used as carbon 
source for growth, but rather as energy source. In that 
case, the strain may have used another carbon source 
from the complex medium.
Impact of initial pH on the growth on glycerol
Previous results showed that despite 1,3-PDO having 
a positive impact on the growth of Acetobacter sp. CIP 
58.66, it could not ensure high biomass density. Growth 
was thus investigated on a separate substrate, namely 
glycerol. It was already used as growth substrate in other 
studies on 3-HP production with AAB (Dishisha et  al. 
2015; Li et  al. 2016; Pyo et  al. 2012; Zhao et  al. 2015), 
but only few details were generally given on this step. In 
the present paper, four different initial pH were tested in 
shake flask, batch cultures of Acetobacter sp. CIP 58.66 
on 10 g  L−1 of glycerol (Table 2).
When the initial pH was 4.0, glycerol remained uncon -
sumed and biomass density remained low (0.14  gDW 
 L−1). This condition was thus considered too stressful 
and could not ensure high biocatalyst concentrations. In 
other conditions (i.e. initial pH of 4.5, 5.0 and 6.5), glyc -
erol consumption occurred and higher biomass densi -
ties were reached (Table  2). The highest concentration 
(1.14  gDW  L−1) was obtained with an initial pH of 5.0. 
Even though glycerol consumption remained low at the 
time of comparison (30.5  h), full glycerol depletion was 
observed for all conditions after 115  h. In all instances, 
two distinct exponential growth phases were identified: a 
slope break appeared between 4 and 8 h of culture. The 
highest growth rates were observed with an initial pH of

5.0, which was also the only condition reaching late expo-
nential phase by 30.5 h of culture. Since it led to the best 
growth performance (highest cell density, growth rates 
and biomass yield), pH 5.0 was the selected condition for 
the production of biocatalyst in a bioreactor, during the 
sequential process (i.e. biomass production directly fol -
lowed by bioconversion).
Biocatalyst production as part of a sequential strategy
First, we tested whether Acetobacter sp. CIP 58.66 could 
grow on 10 g  L−1 glycerol in a bioreactor controlled at pH 
5.0, while simultaneously converting 1,3-PDO into 3-HP . 
In this case, both growth on glycerol and 1,3-PDO con -
version remained very limited (data not shown). There -
fore, a sequential strategy was designed: biomass was 
first produced on glycerol in batch mode; once the late 
exponential phase was reached, 1,3-PDO was supplied in 
fed-batch mode. This section presents the first step (i.e. 
biocatalyst production) that was common to all sequen -
tial experiments.
Biomass was produced on the basal medium contain -
ing 10  g  L−1 glycerol in a 3.6 L bioreactor. Initially, pH 
was set to 5.0 and it was then left uncontrolled. Results 
are shown in Table 2 and Fig.  3. Except for one of the six 
replicates, bacterial growth started without any latency. 
In all instances, late exponential phase was reached after 
31 h of culture, with a 0.88 g  L−1 DW concentration. Sim-
ilarly to previous shake flask experiments, two distinct 
exponential growth phases could be detected. Further -
more, by 31 h of culture, glycerol consumption remained 
low (18.6% of initial glycerol). Since no buffer solution 
was added to the medium, pH rose up to 6.94. This rise 
in pH may be the cause of the slowing down of growth 
before full substrate depletion.
Growth on glycerol showed a satisfactory reproduc -
ibility: the coefficient of variation for final DW was 6%. 
It was thus considered that these six growth replicates 
constitute a consistent basis to compare the subsequent 
bioconversions at different pH.
pH‑based fed‑batch bioconversion
Once produced as described in Sect.  3.2.2, biomass 
of Acetobacter sp. CIP 58.66 was used as biocatalyst 
for 1,3-PDO selective oxidation into 3-HP in pres -
ence of the residual glycerol. After growth on glycerol, 
pH was adjusted to the desired value with  H2SO4 and 
the fed-batch bioconversion was triggered by adding 
5  mL of 1,3-PDO as starter, and by plugging the feed -
ing solution to the bioreactor. The latter solution was a 
1:1 molar mix of ammonium hydroxide and 1,3-PDO in 
order to ensure both pH control and substrate feeding. 
In the first instance, bioconversion was tested at pH 5.0. 
A secondary exponential growth phase was observed, 
without any latency (Fig.  3). DW concentration further 
increased to 2.08 ± 0.04 g  L−1 at a maximal growth rate of 
0.16 ± 0.06  h−1. No significant difference in growth rates 
was evidenced when comparing with previous results for 
growth on glycerol alone or on 1,3-PDO alone. Glycerol 
was further consumed during 1,3-PDO oxidation (Fig.  3): 
its consumption increased from 18.6% at the beginning 
of bioconversion to 42.1% at 25 h of bioconversion. So it 
remains unclear whether this secondary growth can be 
attributed to the uptake of glycerol or 1,3-PDO, or both of 
them. Consumption of 1,3-PDO began as soon as it was 
added to the medium, without any latency (Fig.  4A). At 
25 h of bioconversion at pH 5.0, a total of 51.45 ± 6.63 g 
of 1,3-PDO was consumed and converted quantitatively 
into 3-HP (Table 3; Fig. 4B). Within the first three hours, 
a transient accumulation of 3-HPA occurred, that peaked 
at 0.10 ± 0.01 g  L−1. In one of the replicates, 3-HPA was 
later accumulated again, reaching a final concentration of 
0.78 g  L−1 (Fig. 4C).
The pH was successfully controlled at 5.0 during 
these bioconversions. However, 1,3-PDO was not kept 
at 5 g  L−1 as intended: a slight decrease happened and 
the final concentration was 2.96 ± 0.79 g  L−1 (Fig.  4C). 
In addition to 3-HPA accumulation in one replicate, 
two likely limiting factors for cells were identified: (i) 
high 3-HP concentrations, and (ii) oxygen limitation.

this step is performed in the same conditions for all experiments. 
2. Secondary growth during 1,3‑PDO fed‑batch bioconversion, at 
different pH (4.0, 4.5 or 5.0). For each growth phase, logarithmic 
growth is calculated on the basis of the initial DW of the concerned 
phase. For each pH condition, n = 2. The initial working volume was 
1.02 L, and the final estimated volumes varied between 0.83 and 0.91 
L, depending on replicates
Page 8 of 11de Fouchécour et al. AMB Expr          (2021) 11:130 
Indeed, from 4.4  h of bioconversion, a drop in  pO2 
below the set point was observed, despite maximal 
stirring and air flow rates. In one instance,  pO2 even 
dropped to 4% for 4  h before increasing again to the 
set point. Overall, the bioconversion process presented 
here achieved promising results, reaching the highest 
3-HP titre with AAB. Also it is the first time growing 
AAB are used for 3-HP production instead of resting 
AAB. By doing so, the process could be performed with 
lower cell densities (from 0.88 to 2.08  gDW  L−1) as com -
pared with the previous literature, where cell densities 
vary from 3.25  gDW  L−1 (Dishisha et al. 2015) to 10  gDW 
 L−1 (Zhao et al. 2015).
Given the promising results obtained at pH 5.0, the 
process was further tested for lower pH values during 
the bioconversion stage, in order to try to take advan -
tage of the great resistance of AAB to acidic conditions. 
The selected pH values were 4.5 and 4.0: by doing so, the 
bioconversion performance can be compared for a pH 
above the pKa of 3-HP (pH 5.0), equal to it (pH 4.5), or 
lower to it (pH 4.0). Again, a secondary growth phase 
happened (Fig.  3). Yet, the lower the pH was, the lower 
were the growth rates, the final DW concentration, and 
the final glycerol consumption (Table  3). This is consist -
ent with the results of shake flask cultures on glycerol, 
during which growth was more limited with initial pH 
values of 4.0 and 4.5 compared to 5.0. Concomitantly to 
this secondary growth phase, 1,3-PDO was consumed in 
all pH conditions and was quasi-quantitatively converted 
to 3-HP (Table 3). Similarly to bioconversions at pH 5.0, a

at pH = 4.5
at pH = 5.0

slight 3-HPA accumulation occurred and peaked around 
2 h of bioconversion, at sub-inhibitory levels, but no later 
3-HPA accumulation was observed (Fig.  4). Overall, bio -
conversion performances were lower with lower pH: less 
1,3-PDO was consumed and therefore less 3-HP was 
produced.
Discussion
Prevention of detrimental 3‑HPA accumulation
Shake flask cultures on 1,3-PDO showed a drop in 3-HP 
yield for initial substrate concentrations higher than 10 g 
 L−1 (Table 1), with 3-HPA accumulation being responsi -
ble for the lower 3-HP yield. Such a drop in 3-HP yield 
was already observed with immobilised cells of Aceto -
bacter sp. CGMCC 8142, but only for substrate concen -
tration above 50  g  L−1, and the side-products were not 
mentioned (Li et  al. 2016). A recent study on another 
AAB, Gluconobacter oxydans DSM 2003, suggested that 
the aldehyde dehydrogenase was the rate limiting enzyme 
of 1,3-PDO oxidation into 3-HP (Zhu et  al. 2018). This 
could explain why 3-HPA accumulates for high initial 
substrate concentrations: in these cases substrate excess 
might have led to detrimental 3-HPA levels. Indeed, final 
3-HPA concentrations were within the range of the MIC 
that was measured on the model organism Escherichia 
coli: from 0.56 to 1.11 g  L−1 (Cleusix et al. 2007).
These observations highlight the importance of moni -
toring 3-HPA and preventing its accumulation, in order 
to ensure efficient 3-HP production with AAB. The study 
of Li et  al. (2016) suggests that cell immobilisation on 
sodium alginate beads is a means of preventing 3-HPA 
accumulation, since 3-HP production yields remained 
between 90 and 100% with 1,3-PDO up to 50 g  L−1. The 
present study offers an alternative for the prevention of 
3-HPA accumulation: when 1,3-PDO levels were con -
trolled under 5 g  L−1 in the bioreactor, little to no 3-HPA 
accumulation occurred, and 3-HP was quantitatively pro-
duced up to 70 g  L−1.
Glycerol and 1,3‑PDO metabolism of Acetobacter sp. CIP 
58.66
To a large extent, the growth results obtained on glyc -
erol in a bioreactor are comparable with those of Kylmä 
et al. (2004), who tested the growth of Acetobacter aceti 
on a mineral medium at pH 5.8, with glycerol as only 
substrate. In their experiment, at 32  h of culture, about 
20% of glycerol was consumed and DW was around 0.5 g 
 L−1. However, they observed lower specific growth rate 
(0.15   h−1) and biomass yield (0.16  gDW  gglycerol
−1) than 
the ones reported in Table  2. These differences could be 
attributed to nutrient limitations because of the use of a 
minimal medium in the study of Kylmä et al.
Surprisingly, no product of glycerol catabolism could 
be detected in the present study. This is in contradiction 
with previous observations by Kylmä et  al. (2004), who 
detected lactate and succinate (up to ca. 1.1 and 0.1 g  L−1, 
respectively), when A. aceti was grown on 10 g  L−1 glyc-
erol. In these concentrations, lactate and succinate would 
have been detected in the conditions of analysis pre -
sented here. Besides, no medium acidification occurred 
in our experiments (Table  2). It was thus hypothesized 
that glycerol was fully oxidised into  CO2, which was 
the main product from glycerol oxidation in the study 
of Kylmä et  al. (2004). Moreover, maximal growth rates

were lower than the ones determined in the presence of 
1,3-PDO with the same initial pH (Table  1). This would 
suggest that glycerol and 1,3-PDO are metabolised in two 
distinct metabolic pathways by Acetobacter sp. CIP 58.66. 
This is consistent with studies of Kylmä et al. (2004) and 
Zhu et al. (2018): the former proposed two distinct path -
ways for glycerol and ethanol metabolism in Acetobacter 
aceti, while the latter showed that the AAB Gluconobac -
ter oxydans oxidises 1,3-PDO through a pathway similar 
to the one of ethanol. Further investigations would be 
required in order to understand what triggered the sec -
ondary growth phase during bioconversion and what the 
contributions of these two metabolic pathways are. Two 
more factors are likely to have contributed to triggering 
the new growth phase: (i) pH adjustment prior to biocon-
version; and (ii) ammonium hydroxide addition as pH-
control agent, also potentially serving as nitrogen source.
Balance in feeding solution for pH‑based fed‑batch
The pH-based fed-batch strategy was shown relevant for 
pH control and substrate feeding. However, for lower pH 
conditions, it appeared that 1,3-PDO levels decreased 
instead of keeping around 5 g  L−1. 3-HP having a pKa of 
4.51 (Lide 2005), the undissociated (or protonated) and 
dissociated (or anionic) forms are present in almost equal 
amounts for pH 4.5. For pH 5.0, the dissociated form is 
predominant over the other; while the undissociated 
form is predominant at pH 4.0. Therefore, even though 
3-HP production was quite similar for all pH during the 
first 5 h of bioconversion (Fig.  4B), the lower the pH was, 
the more predominant was the protonated form. Because 
of its higher lipophilicity, the protonated form is usually 
considered as more toxic to cells than the anionic form 
(Trček et al. 2015). It enters the cell through passive dif -
fusion in the membrane, thus leading to cytosolic acidi -
fication and to the disruption of the electro-chemical 
gradient. This could contribute to explain the shorter bio-
conversion duration at pH 4.0 compared to 5.0. Resist -
ance mechanisms are then triggered in AAB, including 
efflux pumps (Nakano and Fukaya 2008). In particular, 
A. aceti IFO 3283 was shown to possess a proton motive 
force-dependent efflux system for acetic acid resistance 
(Matsushita et al. 2005). Despite a relative specificity for 
acetic acid, this system seemed to work with short-chain 
organic acids, and the presence of a respiratory substrate 
could enhance this activity. Since 1,3-PDO oxidation in 
AAB is associated to the electron transport chain (at least 
through the adhB subunit of the alcohol dehydrogenase) 
(Zhu et  al. 2018), 1,3-PDO may be considered as a res -
piratory substrate. Existence of such an efflux system in 
Acetobacter sp. CIP 58.66 – with 1,3-PDO as respiratory 
substrate – could contribute to explaining the apparently 
paradoxical increase in specific productivities for the 
lowest pH (Table 3).
Furthermore, consumption of one equivalent of 1,3-
PDO would lead to less important proton release for 
lower pH, due to the predominance of undissociated 
3-HP . Consequently, smaller volumes of the feeding solu-
tion are needed for pH control. In our case, this means 
that there is also less 1,3-PDO supplied than consumed: 
the lower the pH, the greater the imbalance. This explains 
why 1,3-PDO could not be kept at 5 g  L−1 as desired, and 
was even completely depleted after 10 h of bioconversion 
at pH 4.0. These results suggest that the ammonia to 1,3-
PDO ratio in the feed should be determined specifically 
for each pH condition, in order to prevent the slowing 
down of the process. Adequate base-to-substrate ratio 
might help taking advantage of the strain’s great poten -
tialities, even at low pH. Maintaining pH levels below the 
pKa of 3-HP would also be an advantage for its down -
stream recovery. Indeed, the most popular technique in 
the literature for 3-HP recovery is in situ product recov -
ery by liquid–liquid reactive extraction during bioconver-
sion (de Fouchécour et al. 2018). This technique requires 
that 3-HP is in its undissociated form to be extracted.
In conclusion, the designed process using wild-type 
Acetobacter sp. CIP 58.66 achieved high productivities 
and titres, with a quasi-quantitative molar yield, thus lim-
iting accumulation of detrimental 3-HPA. These perfor -
mances (titre and productivity) are the highest reported 
with AAB and they were comparable to those of the most 
efficient genetically engineered 3-HP producers. More -
over, it was possible at acidic pH (5.0) which limits the 
risk of contamination and is a significant advantage for 
industrial production. This point is also favourable to 
the in  situ product recovery. These results also demon -
strate that high bacterial densities are not required for 
3-HP production by AAB, but that the substrate 1,3-PDO 
should be fed at a rate compatible with the biocatalytic 
activity. Moreover, this is the first report of 1,3-PDO 
affecting the growth of an AAB. Processes using obligate 
aerobes, such as Acetobacter sp. CIP 58.66, generally have 
high energy demands due to aeration (air compressors 
and stirring). Thus, achieving efficient 3-HP production 
with low cell densities may become an asset when con -
sidering scale-up. Key limitations were identified here, 
viz. dioxygen availability, low pH, and composition of the 
feeding solution. The proposed feeding strategy seems 
promising for its implementation in a complete inte -
grated process for 3-HP production from glycerol.
