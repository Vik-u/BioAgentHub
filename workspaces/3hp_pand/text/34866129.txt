Introduction
3HP is one of the top building block chemicals issued in 2004 and 2010 by the United States Department of
Energy. As a platform chemical, 3HP can be converted into other valuable C3-based chemicals, such as acrylic
acid, acrylamide, malonic acid, and other 3HP- or acryl- based polymers [1-4]. Several chemical approaches to
produce 3HP industrially using oxidation from 1,3-propanediol or 3HPA, and hydration from acrylic acid have
been reported [5, 6]. However, several advantages associated with free of petroleum-based raw materials, low cost,
and environmental issues are driving the production of 3HP through biological methods [7].
For the biological production of 3HP , two biosynthetic pathways have been developed using glucose or glycerol
as carbon sources. In the glucose pathway, 3HP can be produced by a carbon fixation pathway such as the 3HP/
4HB cycle [8-11]. In the glycerol pathway, glycerol dehydratase converts glycerol to 3HPA, and then ALDH
converts 3HPA to 3HP [12, 13]. In recent years, a large amount of glycerol has been produced as a byproduct in the
biodiesel industry, therefore glycerol is attracting attention as a suitable carbon source for 3HP production [14, 15].
Eight 3HP-producing ALDH enzymes have been reported to date, including BsDhaS, CnGapD4, EcAldH,
KpPuuC, KpYd c W,  KpYneI, ScAld4, and AbKGSADH (Table S1) [16-22]. Among these, only one crystal structure
of AbKGSADH has been reported, and this report explained how AbKGSADH stabilize to catalyze various
chemicals such as α-ketoglutaric semialdehyde, su ccinic semialdehyde, and 3-HPA [23]. The structural
information was also utilized to enhance its reactivity [24]. However, enzyme reactivity of ALDH for the
conversion of 3HPA to 3HP is still low, and the activity imbalance in between DhaB and ALDH causes toxic 3HPA
to accumulate in the cell. Moreover, the high expression of ALDH enzyme can be a burden on the host strain,
therefore ALDH increasing activity by enhancing 3HPA specificity has been required [25].
Here, we elucidate the unique substrate specificity of ALDH enzymes by bioinformatic analysis. Crystal
structure of AbKGSADH, structure homology modeling, and molecular docking simulation revealed unnatural
3HPA binding modes of eight 3HP-producing ALDHs, and various amino acid residues are positioned in each
substrate binding pocket of ALDHs. Based on this information, ten AbKGSADH variants were constructed and
several variants with enhanced activity were obtained successfully. The results from this study could be utilized for
the improved production of 3HP .
3-Hydroxypropionic acid (3HP) is a platform chemical and can be converted into other valuable C3-
based chemicals. Because a large amount of glycerol  is produced as a by-product in the biodiesel 
industry, glycerol is an attractive carbon source in  the biological production of 3HP . Although eight 
3HP-producing aldehyde dehydrogen ases (ALDHs) have been reported so far, the low conversion 
rate from 3-hydroxypropionaldehyde (3HPA) to 3HP using these enzymes is still a bottleneck for the 
production of 3HP . In this study, we elucidated the substrate binding modes of the eight 3HP-
producing ALDHs through bioinformatic and struct ural analysis of these enzymes and selected 
protein engineering targets for developing enzymes with enhanced enzymatic activity against 
3HPA. Among ten 
AbKGSADH variants we tested, three variants  with replacement at the Arg281 site 
of AbKGSADH showed enhanced enzymatic activities. In particular, the AbKGSADHR281Y variant 
exhibited improved catalytic efficiency by 2.5-fold compared with the wild type.

Materials and Method
Protein Homology Modeling
Protein homology modeling was performed using SWISS-MODEL [26, 27]. Model structures of seven 3HP-
producing ALDHs were built. NCBI accession codes of target sequences are: AFQ57871.1 ( BsDhaS),
WP_011617618.1 (CnGapD4), OSL13388.1 ( EcAldH), WP_020323708.1 ( KpPuuC), ABR77355.1 ( KpYd c W ) ,
WP_015958390.1 (KpYneI), and NP_015019.1 (ScAld4). PDB codes of template structures, amino acid sequence
identity between query and template sequences, and QMEAN scores are shown in Table S2.
Molecular Docking Simulation
Molecular docking simulations of 3HP A to 3HP-producing ALDH structures were performed by AutoDock
Vina software [28]. Crystal structures of AbKGSADH (PDB code 5X5U) [23] and seven model structures of 3HP-
producing ALDHs, including BsDhaS, CnGapD4, EcAldH, KpPuuC, KpYd c W,  KpYneI, and ScAld4, were
superimposed and then docking simulations were performed. The 3HPA ligand structure was prepared using the
JLigand software [29]. The pdbqt files were generated using AutoDock Tools, and all steps were performed by the
AutoDock Vina manual [30]. The grid size for AbKGSADH was x = 44, y = 40, z = 34, and the grid center was
designated at x = -31.496, y = -11.696, z = -2.0. The grid size for BsDhaS was x = 44, y = 40, z = 32, and the grid
center was designated at x = -31.725, y = -11.576, z = -2.897. The grid size for CnGapD4 was x = 44, y = 40, z = 32,
and the grid center was designated at x = -31.227, y = -11.339, z = -2.604. The grid size for EcAldH was x = 42, y =
40, z = 32, and the grid center was designated at x = -31.382, y = -11.676, z = -3.182. The grid size for KpPuuC was
x = 44, y = 40, z = 40, and the grid center was designated at x = -31.571, y = -11.640, z = -2.65. The grid size for
KpY dcW was x = 44, y = 40, z = 32, and the grid center was designated at x = -30.644, y = -10.669, z = -3.018. The
grid size for KpYneI was x = 42, y = 40, z = 42, and the grid center was designated at x = -30.794, y = -11.876, z = -
2.618. The grid size for ScAld4 was x = 44, y = 40, z = 32, and the grid center was designated at x = -31.586, y = -
11.833, z = -2.735. 90 docking poses in each ALDH were generated, and one pose with the most appropriate
direction and distance in between aldehyde group of 3HPA and catalytic residue was selected
Site-Directed Mutagenesis and Enzyme Preparation
Site-directed mutations were performed using a QuikChange kit (Agilent, USA), and mutated nucleotide
sequences were confirmed. AbKGSADH enzyme was prepared with same method as described in our previous
study [23]. AbKGSADH wild type and variants sub-cloned into pProEX-HTa vector (Thermo Fischer Scientific,
USA) were transformed into an E. coli BL21(DE3)-T1
R strain, and each strain was cultured to an OD600 of 0.6 in
fresh LB medium with 100 mg l -1 ampicillin at 37oC. AbKGSADH protein expression was induced by 0.5 mM
IPTG. After 20 h at 18oC, the cells were harvested by 4,000 g for 15 min at 4oC. The cells were resuspended in ice-
cold 40 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and disrupted by ultrasonication. Cell debris was removed by centrifugation at
13,000 g for 30 min, and the lysate was applied onto a Ni-NTA agarose column (Qiagen, Germany). After washing
with 40 mM Tris and 25 mM imidazole, pH 8.0, the AbKGSADH protein was eluted with 40 mM Tris and 300 mM
imidazole, pH 8.0. 
Enzyme Activity Assay
The activity of AbKGSADH wild type and variants was determined by measuring the increase of absorbance at
340 nm. Enzyme reaction was performed with a reaction mixture of 0.5 mM total volume at 25
oC. For kinetic
analysis, reaction mixtures contained 100 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 500 μM NAD, 50 nM AbKGSADH enzyme, and
various concentrations of 3HPA (0.5-10 mM). The reactions were initiated by the addition of enzyme. All
reactions were performed in duplicate. The initial velocity of each measurement was calculated with extinction
coefficient of NADH (6.22 M
-1 cm-1). Statistical analysis for KM and kcat values was performed by Michaelis Menten
models using OriginPro software (OriginLab, USA).
Results and Discussion
Unnatural Substrate Availability of ALDHs
According to the enzyme nomenclature databases operated by the Nomenclature Committee of the
International Union of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, ALDHs belonging to the EC 1.2.1.- group
(oxidoreductases acting on the aldehyde- or oxo-group of donors with NAD or NADP as acceptor) are divided
into 107 classes (1.2.1.1-107) based on their specific activity [31]. Among these 107 classes, 2 classes have been
deleted, 12 classes have been transferred to another entry, and 13 classes have no annotated nucleotide/amino acid
sequence data in the database. Another 34 classes have amino acid sequences that refer to their entries, but no
crystal structure has been reported to verify their structural fold and elucidate detailed molecular mechanisms
and catalyses. Finally, the selected crystal structures of the remaining 46 different ALDH classes were compared
(Tables S3, S4). Interestingly, when the selected crystal structures were superimposed on each other,
approximately 70% of the ALDH classes displayed a similar overall structure (ALDH fold) and the remaining
ALDHs have the GapDH fold (15%) or their own unique shape (15%) (Tables S3, S4). Moreover, many enzymes
with the ALDH fold are multi-classified in the EC 1.2.1.- category. These observations indicate that most ALDH
enzymes have similar structural conformations, and differences in only several amino acids involved in the
constitution of the substrate binding pocket cause ALDH enzymes to accommodate different substrates. Due to
these structural properties, ALDH enzymes have relatively broad substrate specificities, which in turn allow some
ALDH enzymes to utilize unnatural aldehyde chemicals as substrates.

Unnatural 3HPA Binding Mode Prediction
The oxidation reaction from 3HPA to 3HP is a key step in the efficient production of 3HP from glycerol.
However, because enzymes utilizing the unnatural 3HPA as a substrate have not yet been reported in natural
organisms, use of the unique enzyme property of the ALDH enzymes with a broad substrate specificity is crucial
for the enzymatic conversion of 3HPA to 3HP . Although eight 3HP-producing ALDHs have been reported to date,
their low activities against 3HPA still remain a bottleneck for highly efficient 3HP production [16-22]. Here, an
understanding of the substrate binding sites of the eight ALDHs and detailed structural comparisons of these
ALDHs can be considered essential for the development of the ALDH enzymes with high activity against 3HPA.
Because the crystal structure was reported only in AbKGSADH among the eight 3HP-producing ALDHs [23], we
first attempted to obtain the three-dimensional structure of the seven other ALDHs through homology modeling.
We used the known structure with the highest amino acid homology to each ALDH as a template model for more
accurate structural prediction, and all seven modeled structures had reasonable model quality estimation scores
(Table S2).
We also performed the molecular docking simulations of the 3HPA molecule into the eight 3HP-producing
ALDHs to identify the 3HPA binding mode of these enzymes (Fig. 1). Although the 3HPA molecule was
positioned in a slightly different mode in each enzyme, the aldehyde group where the catalysis occurs was directed

toward the catalytic residues in all eight enzymes. When we compared the structures of the eight 3HP-producing
ALDHs, the two catalytic residues, Glu253 and Cys287 in AbKGSADH, were completely conserved in all eight
enzymes, indicating that these enzymes catalyze the reaction in an identical manner (Fig. 1). We then selected ten
residues located in the vicinity of the 3HPA molecule and compared these residues in eight 3HP-producing
ALDHs. Among eight enzymes, the EcAldH and KpPuuC enzymes, with 83% sequence identity, contained all ten
residues, and the other six enzymes contained variable residues (Fig. 2). Of the ten selected residues, three
residues, Phe156, Val286, and Phe450 in AbKGSADH, were highly conserved in the 3HP-producing ALDHs, with
the exception of KpYneI, which contained Tyr156, Asp285, and His450 residues, respectively. Seven other
residues, including Ser109, Asn159, Gln160, Arg163, Arg281, Ile288, and Pro444 in AbKGSADH, were variable in
the 3HP-producing ALDHs (Fig. 2). In particular, three residues, Ser109, Ile288, and Pro444 in AbKGSADH, were
highly variable, so that a dominant residue was not found (Fig. 2).
Protein Engineering of AbKGSADH to Improve 3HP A Utilization 
As we described above, the residues involved in stabilization of the 3HPA substrate are quite diverse among the
known 3HP-producing ALDHs, and these variable residues can be potential targets for enzyme engineering for
more efficient 3HP production. Of ten residues involved in substrate binding, we selected four relatively more
variable residues, Ser109, Arg281, Ile288, and Pro444 in AbKGSADH, for target engineering sites. We then
replaced these four residues of AbKGSADH with the various corresponding residues located in seven other 3PH-
producing ALDHs, and generated the following ten AbKGSADH variants: AbKGSADH
S109G, AbKGSADHS109L,
AbKGSADHR281Y, AbKGSADHR281F, AbKGSADHR281Q, AbKGSADHI288T, AbKGSADHP444F, AbKGSADHP444G,
AbKGSADHP444L, and AbKGSADHP444S.
We measured the specific activities and kinetic parameters of these ten variants and compared them with the
same parameters for AbKGSADHWT. The AbKGSADHS109G and AbKGSADHS109L variants showed somewhat
decreased activities compared with AbKGSADHWT (Fig. 3A). The kinetic parameters of these two variants
indicate that the decreased activities are due to decreased kcat values rather than decreased substrate affinity
(Table 1). The phenomenon was more dramatic in the AbKGSADHS109G variant, and we suspect that replacement

of Ser109 by a small hydrophobic glycine increased the binding affinity for 3HPA, however, the altered binding
conformation to the molecule by the replacement severely hampered the conversion ability of the variant. The
AbKGSADH
I288T variant showed only 28% activity compared to the wild type, and kinetic analysis of the variant
revealed that decreased activity was due mainly to decreased kcat value (Fig. 3A and Table 1). In the case of the
variants mutated at the Pro444 site, all four variants showed decreased activities compared with the wild type
(Fig. 3A). Kinetic analysis of the four variants indicated that the levels of decreased activities were almost
proportional to the levels of decreased k
cat values, with the KM values similar to each other (Table 1). Based on these
observations, we conclude that three residues, Ser109, Ile288, and Pro444 of AbKGSADH, provide a more suitable
conformation for 3HP binding and enzyme catalysis compared with the residues possessed by other 3HP-
producing enzymes. 
Interestingly, the three variants mutated at the Arg281 position of AbKGSADH exhibited substantially
increased catalytic efficiencies. The  Ab KGSADHR281F variant displayed a kcat value almost identical to
AbKGSADHWT, but displayed a dramatically decreased KM value, resulting in 23% enhanced catalytic efficiency
for this variant. The AbKGSADHR281Q variant displayed higher values in both kcat and K M, resulting in a 16%
improvement in catalytic efficiency for this variant. The most remarkable improvement was observed in the
AbKGSADHR281Y variant. This variant showed 2.5-fold increased catalytic efficiency with approximately half the
KM value and 24% higher kcat value compared with AbKGSADHWT, indicating that the enhanced catalytic
efficiency was due to both the higher substrate affinity and increased conversion rate to product (Table 1 and
Figs. 3A and 3B). Based on these results, we believe that the location of an amino acid with a bulky or ring side-
chain, such as Arg, Gln, Phe, and Tyr, at the position of Arg281 of AbKGSADH is crucial for stabilization of the
3HPA substrate. In particular, the tyrosine residue appears to be most optimal for the unnatural 3HPA substrate,
and in fact, half of the 3HP-producing ALDHs have the tyrosine residue at this site.
In summary, bioinformatic analysis of ADLHs belonging to the EC 1.2.1.- category shows that most ALDHs
have the same overall fold, and their substrate specificity depends on amino acid residues involved in the
formation of the substrate binding pocket. ALDH enzymes with a conventional ALDH fold can utilize a wide
range of aldehyde chemicals as substrates, indicating th at unnatural aldehydes can also be catalyzed by these
ALDHs. Structure homology modeling and molecular docking simulation allowed us to identify detailed
substrate binding modes of the eight 3HP-producing ALDHs reported to date and determine amino acids that can
be protein engineering targets to improve utilization of the unnatural 3HPA substrate. Of the ten AbKGSADH
variants, three variants in which the Arg281 site of AbKGSADH was mutated showed enhanced 3HPA utilization
ability. In particular, AbKGSADH
R281Y exhibited improved catalytic efficiency by 2.5-fold. This study offers
valuable information in the pursuit of highly efficient 3HP production.
