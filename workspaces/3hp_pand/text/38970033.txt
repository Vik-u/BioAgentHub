Abstract
Background Biotransformation of CO2 into high-value-added carbon-based products is a promising process for 
reducing greenhouse gas emissions. To realize the green transformation of CO2, we use fatty acids as carbon source 
to drive CO2 fixation to produce succinate through a portion of the 3-hydroxypropionate (3HP) cycle in Cupriavidus 
necator H16.
Results This work can achieve the production of a single succinate molecule from one acetyl-CoA molecule 
and two CO2 molecules. It was verified using an isotope labeling experiment utilizing NaH13CO3. This implies that 
50% of the carbon atoms present in succinate are derived from CO2, resulting in a twofold increase in efficiency 
compared to prior methods of succinate biosynthesis that relied on the carboxylation of phosphoenolpyruvate or 
pyruvate. Meanwhile, using fatty acid as a carbon source has a higher theoretical yield than other feedstocks and 
also avoids carbon loss during acetyl-CoA and succinate production. To further optimize succinate production, 
different approaches including the optimization of ATP and NADPH supply, optimization of metabolic burden, and 
optimization of carbon sources were used. The resulting strain was capable of producing succinate to a level of 
3.6 g/L, an increase of 159% from the starting strain.
Conclusions This investigation established a new method for the production of succinate by the implementation 
of two CO2 fixation reactions and demonstrated the feasibility of ATP , NADPH, and metabolic burden regulation 
strategies in biological carbon fixation.

Background
The “greenhouse effect” gradually intensifies as a huge 
number of greenhouse gas emissions are released. United 
Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres stated in 
July 2023 that “The era of global warming has ended; 
the era of global boiling has arrived. ” It is noteworthy 
that the proportion of CO 2 in global greenhouse gas has 
risen to 76.7% (v/v), making it the primary cause of cli -
mate change [ 1]. Consequently, reducing CO 2 levels in 
the atmosphere has become a priority. In order to accom-
plish this objective, a viable approach involves the con -
version of CO 2 into valuable multi-carbon chemicals via 
the engineering of biological processes.
Over the course of the last four billion years, several 
complicated mechanisms for CO 2 fixation have emerged 
in the natural world [ 2]. To present, a total of eight natu -
ral mechanisms for CO 2 fixation have been confirmed. 
These mechanisms include the Calvin-Benson-Bassham 
(CBB) cycle, the 3-hydroxypropionate (3HP) cycle [ 3], 
the 3-hydroxypropionate-4-hydroxybutyrate (3HP/4HB) 
cycle [ 4], the reductive tricarboxylic acid (rTCA) 
cycle [ 5], the Wood-Ljungdahl (WL) pathway [ 6], the 
dicarboxylate/4-hydroxybutyrate (DC/4HB) cycle [7], the 
reductive glycine pathway [ 8], and the reverse oxidative 
TCA cycle [ 9]. Each carbon dioxide fixing mechanism 
has distinct properties that dictate its range of applicabil -
ity. For example, the process of the WL pathway is lim -
ited to absolutely anaerobic settings because of the high 
sensitivity of the CO dehydrogenase/acetyl-CoA synthase 
to oxygen. The oxygen-sensitive enzymes in DC/4HB 
cycle and rTCA cycle, leading them just to operate under 
conditions of anaerobic and microaerobic. Liu et al. com-
pleted the task of compiling an extensive dataset encom -
passing various natural pathways for CO 2 fixation. This 
dataset includes information on the sensitivity to oxy -
gen, ATP requirement, thermodynamics, enzyme kinet -
ics, and carbon species associated with these pathways, 
which indicate that the WL pathway and the 3HP cycle 
are the most appropriate mechanisms for anaerobic and 
aerobic CO2 fixation, respectively [ 2]. However, an ideal 
mechanism for one-carbon use in common synthetic 
biology platforms, would be capable of functioning in a 
robust manner under both aerobic and anaerobic con -
ditions [10]. Therefore, this article selects the 3HP cycle 
as the research object, focusing on its application in the 
synthesis of high-value-added chemicals by fixing CO2.
The 3HP cycle was discovered in photosynthetic green 
nonsulfur bacteria such as Chloroflexus aurantiacus  
[11]. Of the several natural carbon fixation processes, 
this cycle stands out as the most complicated, including 
a total of 16 enzymatic reaction steps that are catalyzed 
by a set of 13 enzymes. The 3HP cycle uses acetyl-CoA 
as the initial substrate and assimilates bicarbonate as 
carbon source by two CO 2-fixing enzymes: acetyl-CoA 
carboxylase (ACC) and propionyl-CoA carboxylase 
(PCC) [ 12]. Up to now, a portion of the 3HP cycle has 
been added to E. coli  in order to facilitate the conver -
sion of CO 2 into the synthesis of valuable compounds, 
including 3HP and succinate [ 13]. However, glucose was 
utilized as a source of carbon in these studies, and CO 2 
will be produced in the transformation of pyruvate into 
acetyl-CoA, which lead to loss of carbon and inefficient 
biosynthesis process (Fig.  1). Therefore, a carbon source 
utilization strategy with higher carbon yield is required. 
Here, we propose using fatty acids as the alternative bio -
mass to drive CO 2 fixation using a portion of 3HP cycle 
for the production of succinate in Cupriavidus necator  
H16.
Fatty acids can be derived from a range of cost-effec -
tive feedstocks, including waste cooking oil, sometimes 
referred to as “gutter oil” [ 14]. Fatty acids, which have 
highly reduced long aliphatic hydrocarbon chains, are 
primarily catabolized through the β-oxidation pathway, 
resulting in the formation of acetyl-CoA without car -
bon loss [ 15]. In addition, the process of β-oxidation of 
fatty acids produces a substantial quantity of reducing 
power, which may be utilized effectively in carbon fixa -
tion mechanisms. Nevertheless, the majority of microbial 
strains cannot effectively use fatty acids [ 16]. Our previ -
ous studies found that Cupriavidus necator  H16 maybe 
a good choice. Cupriavidus necator H16 is a Gram-nega -
tive bacterium that has a rod-shaped morphology and is 
a facultative chemolithoautotrophic β-proteobacterium, 
found mostly in soil and freshwater [ 17]. Owing to its 
metabolic versatility, it has the capacity to use a wide 
spectrum of renewable resources. Throughout hetero -
trophic development, different carbohydrates, lipids and 
organic acids function as carbon and energy sources, 
whereas in the lack of organic substances, a mixture of 
H2, CO2, and O2 allows Cupriavidus necator H16 to grow 
autotrophically [18]. To the best of our knowledge, there 
have been few attempts of using fatty acids as carbon 
source to fix CO 2 for succinate production in Cupriavi-
dus necator H16.
Succinate, a dicarboxylic acid that is generated as an 
intermediary compound in the TCA cycle, has a wide 
range of uses as a foundational substance for the synthe -
sis of diverse derivatives. In the conventional pathway 
of succinate biosynthesis, the generation of succinate is 
achieved by the carboxylation of phosphoenolpyruvate 
or pyruvate. This process leads to the fixation of one CO 2 
molecule and the subsequent creation of one molecule 
of succinate (Fig. 1A) [12, 19]. However, the CO2 fixation 
capacity for succinate biosynthesis can still be improved. 
We propose using a portion of the 3HP cycle to build a 
novel method for succinate production. Via two types 
of carbon fixing enzymes (ACC and PCC) in the 3HP 
cycle, each mol of succinate can be produced from one

acetyl-CoA molecule and two molecules of CO 2. The 
CO2 fixation capacity of this strategy is 2-fold higher than 
that of the conventional approach (Fig. 1B).

When using fatty acids as the carbon source (tak -
ing palmitic acid as an example), the stoichiometry of 
acetyl-CoA production from fatty acids can be calcu -
lated by Eq. (1). Utilizing the 3HP bypass proposed in this 
study, the stoichiometry for converting acetyl-CoA and 
CO2 to succinate can be calculated by Eq.  ( 2). Accord -
ing to Eq.  ( 2), the carbon fixation process in this study 
requires additional reducing force and ATP . In addi -
tion, the complete oxidation process of fatty acids can 
be calculated by Eq. ( 3). The conversion between FADH 2 
and ATP can be calculated by Eq.  ( 4). Thus, combining 
Eq.  (1)+(2)+(3)+(4), the stoichiometry of succinate from 
CO2 and fatty acids via 3HP bypass can be calculated 
by Eq.  ( 5). Using Eq.  5, we can calculate the theoreti -
cal yield of succinate is 2.37  g/g and the theoretical net 
fixation capacity of CO 2 is 0.8 g/g via the 3HP bypass in 
this study. Comparatively, when calculating the theoreti -
cal yield using the original natural route of assimilating

acetyl-CoA to produce succinate (the glyoxylate shunt), 
the theoretical yield of succinate is just 1.84  g/g, which 
is less than the theoretical yield of 2.37 g/g in this study. 
Meanwhile, if utilizing glucose as the carbon source, the 
3HP bypass pathway would just demonstrate a theoreti -
cal succinate yield of 1.02  g/g, lower than the 2.37  g/g 
yield using fatty acids as the carbon source. Similarly, the 
theoretical net CO 2 fixation capacity of 0.054 g/g via the 
3HP bypass with glucose as the carbon source falls short 
of the 0.8  g/g capacity in this study (Fig S3). In conclu -
sion, the production of succinate from fatty acids through 
a portion of the 3HP cycle in Cupriavidus necator  H16 
represents a new method with substantial advantages.
In addition, for a metabolic pathway with multiple 
enzymes, the production is affected by numerous factors 
including but not limited to functional balance between 
enzymes, enzyme activity, supply of precursors, energy 
and reducing power. Special attention must be paid to 
the supply of ATP and reducing power in this study, as 
two ATP molecules and three NADPH molecules are 
required for the production of one succinate molecule 
via this portion of 3HP cycle. In this study, the new 
pathway for succinate biosynthesis based on a portion 
of 3HP cycle was first constructed in Cupriavidus neca -
tor H16. Then the feasibility of this pathway was con -
firmed through isotope labeling validation experiments. 
At last, different approaches including the optimization 
of ATP and NADPH supply, optimization of metabolic 
burden, optimization of carbon sources were used to fur -
ther optimize the fixation of CO 2 and the biosynthesis of 
succinate.
Methods
Strains and chemicals
The E. coli strain DH5α was employed as the host strain 
for the production of the plasmids. Cupriavidus necator  
H16 was used as the host strain for CO 2 fixation and suc-
cinate biosynthesis. The NaH 13CO3 (99%) was acquired 
from Cambridge Isotope Laboratories (USA). Additional 
chemicals were obtained from Macklin (Shanghai, China) 
or Sinopharm (Beijing, China). Plasmid creation was 
conducted using the ClonExpress II One Step Cloning 
Kit, manufactured by Vazyme Biotech located in Nan -
jing, China. The PCR was performed employing Prime -
STAR Max DNA Polymerase, manufactured by Takara in 
Dalian, China. The strains and plasmids utilized during 
the study were illustrated in Table  1. All of primers used 
in this study were listed in Table S1. The growth of E. coli 
cells was facilitated employing LB medium, which con -
sisted of 10 g/L tryptone, 5 g/L yeast extract, and 10 g/L 
NaCl. The cultivation of Cupriavidus necator  H16 was 
performed utilizing a specific growth medium, namely 
SOB medium. This medium consisted of the following 
components: 20 g/L tryptone, 5 g/L yeast extract, 0.5 g/L 
NaCl, 2.5 mM KCl, 10 mM MgCl 2, and 10 mM MgSO 4. 
In addition, 14.04 g/L K 2HPO4·3H2O, 5.24 g/L KH 2PO4, 
1  g/L NH 4Cl, 1  g/L yeast extract, 0.5  g/L NaCl, 1  g/L 
MgSO4, 3 g/L NaHCO3, 50 mg/L biotin, 10 mg/L vitamin 
B12, 15 g/L fatty acids or oil were used for CO 2 fixation 
and succinate production. Chloramphenicol (50  mg/L) 
and ampicillin (100 mg/L) were used where suitable.
Construction of plasmids
Molecular cloning was conducted employing typical pro -
tocols [20]. The genes encoding AccBC from E. coli (No. 
CAQ32718.1 and CAQ33581.1) and PCS from Chloro-
flexus aurantacus  (No. AAL47820.2) were cloned into 
pBBR1MCS-1 vector between KpnI and SacI sites. The 
accB and accC genes were not optimized for codons dur -
ing amplification, while the pcs gene was optimized for 
codons through BGI Beijing (China) during synthesis. 
The accB and accC genes share the same lac promoter. 
The accB gene used the RBS provided by the vector, while 
accC gene used the original RBS of the gene. The pcs 
gene used the lac promoter and RBS provided by the vec-
tor. The pBBR1MCS-1 vector carries a chloramphenicol 
resistance gene. The genes encoding MCR from Chloro-
flexus aurantacus (No. AAS20429.1), PCC from Bacillus 
subtilis (No. CAB14323.2), SucCD (No. CAQ31193.1 and 
CAQ31194.1) from E. coli , and MmcEM from Chloro-
flexus aurantacus  (No. ACL23899.1 and ACM54095.1) 
were cloned into pBBR1MCS-4 vector between KpnI and 
XbaI sites. The pcc gene used the lac promoter and RBS 
provided by the vector and it was optimized for codons 
through BGI during synthesis. The mcr gene was divided 
into mcrN and mcrC. mcrN  encoded 1-549 amino acids 
of MCR protein and mcrC encoded 550–1219 amino 
acids of MCR protein. The mcrC gene used the lac pro-
moter and the mcrN gene used the P lac P2 −51 promoter. 
Both mcrN and mcrC were optimized for codons through 
BGI during synthesis. The mmcEM and sucCD genes 
share the same lac promoter. The sucCD genes were not 
optimized for codons during amplification, while the 
mmcEM genes were optimized for codons through BGI 
during synthesis. The pBBR1MCS-4 vector carries the 
ampicillin resistance gene. In addition, the accB gene 
was used to express the BCCP domain of propionyl-CoA 
carboxylase. The accC gene was used to express the BC 
domain of propionyl-CoA carboxylase. The pcc gene was 
used to express the CT domain of propionyl-CoA car -
boxylase. After the expression of the above three genes, 
a complete propionyl-CoA carboxylase will be formed 
[13]. The genes encoding ADK from Bacillus licheni -
formis (No. AOP13161.1), Vhb from Vitreoscilla sp. C1  
(No. AAA75506.1) or PtxD from Stutzerimonas stutzeri  
(No. QGZ31571.1) were cloned into pBBR1MCS-1 vec -
tor between SalI and HindIII sites, respectively. The 
above gene was optimized for codons through BGI 
Page 5 of 11

during synthesis. The genes encoding Pos5 from Sac-
charomyces cerevisiae  (No. DAA11247.1), PntAB from 
E. coli  (No. CAA0088984.1 and CAA0088981.1) or yfjB 
from Bacillus subtilis  (No. AGG60168.1) were cloned 
into pBBR1MCS-1 vector between BamHI and SpeI sites, 
respectively. The above gene was optimized for codons 
through BGI during synthesis.
Isotope labeling detection and succinate fermentation 
production
In order to confirm the practicability of CO 2 fixation 
pathway, the engineered strain was cultured in 2  L fer -
mentor and the products were detected by Mass spec -
trometry. The fermentor contained 1  L growth medium 
(14.04  g/L K 2HPO4·3H2O, 5.24  g/L KH 2PO4, 1  g/L 
MgSO4, 1  g/L NH4Cl, 1  g/L yeast extract, 0.5  g/L NaCl, 
20  g/L palmitic acid, pH 7.0). Throughout the proce -
dure of fermentation, the temperature was controlled at 
30 °C and the pH was effectively regulated at a value of 
7.0 by means of automated supplementation of 10% (v/v) 
ammonia water, while the stirring rate was established 
at 400  rpm. Antifoam was employed to avoid frothing 
if required. Following a fermentation period of 6  h, the 
culture was supplemented with 100 µM IPTG, 3  g/L 
NaH13CO3, 50  mg/L biotin, and 10  mg/L vitamin B12. 
A solution containing 50 mg/L biotin and NaHCO 3 was 
added as a supplement every 12  h and antibiotics were 
added every 24 h. The fermentation procedure was con -
ducted for a duration of 48 h. In succinate fermentation 
production, NaH13CO3 was replaced by NaHCO3.
In the detection of isotope experimental results, the 
samples underwent an initial filtration process using 
a 0.22  μm syringe filter. The purification of succinate in 
the culture supernatant was conducted using a Waters 
2545 Preparative HPLC system, which was equipped 
with an Xterra Prep RP18 (Ireland) column measuring 
7.8 × 150 mm. The eluent utilized in this experiment was 
ultrapure water, which was delivered at a flow rate of 3

Results and discussion
Construction of the 3HP bypass pathway in Cupriavidus 
necator H16
Through a portion of 3HP cycle, one molecule of ace -
tyl-CoA can be converted into one molecule of succi -
nate, accompanied by the fixation of two molecules of 
CO2. In this pathway, the β-oxidation of fatty acids in 
Cupriavidus necator  H16 can generate acetyl-CoA with -
out carbon loss. The first step in the process involves 
the carboxylation of Acetyl-CoA by the enzyme Ace -
tyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC), resulting in the produc -
tion of malonyl-CoA. Subsequently, malonyl-CoA is 
transformed into 3-hydroxypropionate by the action of 
malonyl-CoA reductase (MCR). Subsequently, the con -
version of 3-hydroxypropionate into propionyl-CoA 
is facilitated by the enzyme propionyl-CoA synthase 
(PCS). The carboxylation of propionyl-CoA can be cata -
lyzed by the enzyme propionyl-CoA carboxylase (PCC), 
resulting in the formation of (S)-methylmalonyl-CoA. 
Subsequently, the enzymatic reactions catalyzed by 
methylmalonyl-CoA epimerase (MmcE) and methyl -
malonyl-CoA mutase (MmcM) facilitate the conversion 
of (S)-methylmalonyl-CoA to succinyl-CoA. At last, the 
catalyzation of succinyl-CoA into the desired end prod -
uct, succinate, is facilitated by the enzyme succinyl-CoA 
synthetase (SucCD) (Fig.  1B). Previous studies have 
found that MCR can be divided into two functional 
parts: MCR-N and MCR-C, and their combined cata -
lytic activity is greater than that of wild-type MCR [ 21]. 
Therefore, this study also split MCR. MCR-N contains 
1-549 amino acids of MCR and MCR-C contains 550–
1219 amino acids of MCR. Using directed evolution 
and other methods, researchers found that the activity 
of MCR 550 − 1219(N940V K1106W S1114R)  and PCC (N220I I391T)  
mutants were higher than that of wild-type proteins [ 13, 
22]. Therefore, in order to achieve the highest catalytic 
efficiency, this study also introduced the above-men -
tioned mutants in this portion of 3HP cycle. In general, 
we cloned related genes to establish a succinate biosyn -
thetic route in Cupriavidus necator  H16, which incor -
porates two CO2 fixation reactions, yielding strain SA02. 
The protein expression result of engineering bacteria 
can be found in Fig S1. The target proteins can all be 
expressed normally.
After the construction of the engineering strain was 
completed, we cultured it in a 2  L bioreactor for 48  h 
and measured the product concentration. We found that 
the engineering strain SA02 accumulated a certain con -
centration of succinate, which was higher than the con -
centration accumulated by the wild-type C. necator  H16 
(data not show). This suggests that the introduction of 
the 3HP bypass pathway may be the direct cause of the 
increase in succinate production. Therefore, in order to 
further verify whether the 3HP bypass pathway in C. 
necator H16 can function, we conducted isotope labeling 
experiments for further verification.
Validation of succinate biosynthesis coupling two CO2 
fixation reactions
Succinate is the key metabolite of the tricarboxylic acid 
(TCA) cycle, and it can also be created depending on 
PEP carboxylation, causing one CO2 molecule to be fixed 
and resulting in the production of one molecule of suc -
cinate. But in this work, two CO 2 molecules can be fixed 
to synthesize one molecule of succinate (Figs.  1 and 2A 
and A). Thus, to differentiate whether the succinate is 
created through the heterologous mechanism we built, 
stable isotope labeling experiments were performed. The 
Cupriavidus necator  H16 wild-type and SA02 strains 
were cultivated under aerobic conditions in a medium 
that was treated with either NaH 13CO3 or NaH 12CO3. 
Following the fermentation process, the succinate com -
pound underwent purification by preparative HPLC and 
further analysis was conducted employing a mass spec -
trometer operating in the negative-ion mode. Succinate, 
a compound with a molecular weight of 118 g/mol, will 
have a m/z value of 117 in the negative-ion mode, assum-
ing the absence of a 13C atom. The m/z value of 118 
suggests the presence of a single 13C atom inside the suc-
cinate molecule. This incorporation is likely achieved by 
the process of PEP carboxylation during synthesis. The 
m/z value of 119 indicates the presence of two 13C atoms 
in the succinate molecule, indicating its synthesis via 
our specific mechanism. In the negative-ion mode, the 
natural abundance of succinate with m/z values of 118 
and 119 was observed to be 4.6% and 0.9%, respectively. 
According to the findings presented in Fig.  2, it can be

observed that when Cupriavidus necator  H16 was pro -
vided with NaH 13CO3, succinate with a m/z of 118 and 
119 established approximately 5.5 ± 0.8% and 0.9 ± 0.3% 
respectively (Fig.  2B and C-I). These results suggest that, 
under the specified conditions, most of the succinate 
production by the Cupriavidus necator H16 strain occurs 
through the TCA cycle, while a smaller proportion is 
derived from PEP carboxylation. When the recombinant 
strain SA02 was supplemented with NaH 12CO3, suc -
cinate distribution with different m/z was comparable 
to the natural abundance (Fig.  2B and C-II). When the 
SA02 strain was treated with NaH 13CO3, there was a 
significant rise in the concentration of succinate with a 
m/z of 119, reaching 34.1 ± 2.1% (Fig. 2B and C-III). This 
finding provides evidence that the pathway implemented 
in this study is capable of synthesizing succinate from 
acetyl-CoA through two CO 2 fixation reactions. In con -
trast to succinic acid generation by the carboxylation of 
PEP or pyruvate, this particular mechanism exhibited a 
greater CO2 fixation efficacy. In addition, the proportion 
of succinate with m/z of 118 has also shown an increase, 
reaching around 20%. This result is unexpected. It may 
suggest that due to the introduction of 3HP bypass, the 
metabolic flow distribution of engineering bacteria has 
changed, leading to the generation of some succinate 
through PEP or pyruvate carboxylation.
Effect of ATP regulation strategy on succinate production
In the above carbon fixation pathway, one molecule of 
acetyl-CoA can be converted into one molecule of suc -
cinate with two molecules of CO 2 fixation at the expense 
of two ATP molecules and three NADPH molecules. In 
addition, ATP functions as one of the most important 
driving forces, becoming a limiting factor for CO 2 fixa -
tion. In this part, we adopted different ATP regulation 
strategies for enhancing succinate production, including 
regulating the O2 supply, optimizing the ADP supply, and 
altering NADH availability. Thus, different ATP regula -
tion systems were constructed based on the introduction 
of Vitreoscilla hemoglobin, adenylate kinase, and phos -
phite dehydrogenase combined with the overexpression 
of the carbon fixation pathway. Vitreoscilla hemoglobin

encoded by the vhb gene can bind O 2 at a low extracel -
lular O 2 concentration, and supply it to the respiratory 
chain by direct interaction with the terminal respira -
tory cytochrome, which could facilitate O 2 transfer and 
improve ATP supply [23]. The ptxD gene, which encodes 
phosphite dehydrogenase, is capable of catalyzing the 
oxidation of hydrogen phosphonate (phosphite) to phos -
phate in a nearly irreversible manner while reducing 
NAD+ to NADH. Intracellular NADH is the most impor-
tant electron donor in the oxidative phosphorylation pro-
cess. Enhancing NADH supply is also an efficient way to 
control intracellular ATP levels [ 24]. Furthermore, ADP 
is the direct substrate for ATP biosynthesis, and enhanc -
ing ADP supply is another effective way of increasing 
ATP production. AMP is the substrate for ADP syn -
thesis, and adenylate kinase encoded by adk gene could 
catalyze the conversion of AMP to ADP [ 25]. Adk, vhb, 
and ptxD genes were transformed into SA02 strain to 
generate strains SA03, SA04, and SA05, respectively. It 
should be noted that, for the cultivation of strain SA05, 
15 mM phosphite was added to the medium. As shown 
in Fig.  3, in conditions of aerobic fed-batch in 2  L bio -
reactor, each ATP regulation approach effected a rise of 
succinate production in diverse degrees. Among them, 
SA03 strain presented the maximum succinate produc -
tion of 2.07 g/L, representing a 48.9% increase compared 
to SA02 strain ( P < 0.01). It demonstrated that ADK is a 
good choice for enhancing succinate biosynthesis from 
ATP regulation strategy.
Effect of NADPH regulation strategy on succinate 
production
Except for ATP , NADPH is another key factor for suc -
cinate production in this work. During fatty acid beta-
oxidation, acetyl-CoA is produced as the direct substrate 
for succinate biosynthesis and NAD + is metabolized 
to NADH at the same time [ 14, 18]. Consequently, how 
to direct the phosphorylation of NADH to NADPH is a 
potential way to increase NADPH regeneration [ 14]. In 
this part, we adopted three different NADPH regulation 
strategies for enhancing succinate production, includ -
ing NADP + transhydrogenase (PntAB; EC 1.6.1.2), 
NADH kinases (Pos5p; EC 2.7.1.86), and NAD + kinase 
(YfjB; EC 2.7.1.23). Three enzymes use different ways 
for NADPH regeneration. PntAB can catalyze H + trans-
fer from NADH to NADP +, producing NADPH. Pos5p 
has a high affinity for NADH and could catalyze NADH 
phosphorylation to produce NADPH. YfjB could catalyze 
ATP-dependent phosphorylation of NAD + to produce 
NADP+, which is the direct substrate of NADPH. PntAB, 
Pos5p, and YfjB genes were transformed into SA03 strain 
to generate strains SA09, SA10, and SA11, respectively. 
As shown in Fig.  4, in conditions of aerobic fed-batch 
in a 2  L bioreactor, each NADPH regulation strategy 
affected a rise in succinate creation to a different degree. 
Among them, the SA10 strain exhibited the most suc -
cinate production, reaching a concentration of 3.2  g/L. 
This is a notable 54.6% rise when compared to the suc -
cinate production of the SA03 strain ( P < 0.001). These 
outcomes verified the significance of NADPH supply and 
demonstrated that Pos5p is a good choice for succinate 
production.
Effect of metabolic burden and carbon sources on 
succinate production
The biosynthesis of succinate with two carbon fixation 
reactions in this study involves multiple enzymes. Over -
expression of multiple enzymes can increase the meta -
bolic burden of engineering bacteria. Metabolic burden 
refers to the protein cost of expressing recombinant 
enzymes and it will negatively affect the efficiency of bio -
synthesis. One strategy to reduce metabolic burden is to 
replace overexpressed exogenous genes with endogenous 
genes. Due to the similarity in function of endogenous 
genes with mmcEM or sucCD, attempts were made to 
replace these two overexpressed genes with endogenous 
genes to reduce the host’s metabolic burden. We tested 
the individual omission of each gene and the omission of 
both. As shown in Fig.  5A, under aerobic fed-batch con -
ditions in a 2  L bioreactor, reducing metabolic burden

has a positive impact on increasing succinate produc -
tion. Among them, SA13 strain which not overexpressed 
sucCD presented the highest succinate production of 
3.6  g/L, an increase of 12.5% from the SA10 strain and 
159% from the starting SA02 strain. It means managing 
the metabolic burden is useful for product biosynthesis.
Next, we evaluated the effects of yeast extract pre -
sented in the medium on succinate production. We mea -
sured the produced succinate from cultivation with SA13 
strain grown on 1 g/L yeast extract supplemented media 
but without any fatty acids. As shown in Fig S2, the suc-
cinate production in the control group was only 0.2 g/L, 
which is only about 5.6% of the experimental group with 
added fatty acids. This indicates that when fatty acids 
were added to the culture medium, the vast majority of 
succinate (more than 94%) was obtained through the 
conversion of fatty acids. We also evaluated the effects 
of different carbon sources on succinate production of 
the SA13 strain. Palmitic acid, stearic acid, oleic acid, 
soybean oil, and palm oil were used as raw materials for 
the production of succinate at 2  L bioreactors. In order 
to make better use of soybean oil and palm oil, 20 mg/L 
lipase was added every 12  h during the fermentation. 
When using different carbon sources, the yield of suc -
cinate does not differ significantly, with soybean oil 
being the carbon source that slightly increases the yield 
(Fig.  5B). These results indicated the possibility of pro -
ducing succinate using different fatty acids as carbon 
sources, and these raw materials (especially cheap oils) 
provide competitiveness for the low-cost biosynthesis of 
succinate with two carbon fixation reactions.

This new succinate pathway has made some progress 
but still has some unresolved issues. As mentioned, only 
3.6  g/L succinate was produced with a yield of 0.24  g/g 
fatty acid at a 2  L bioreactor. Compared with the theo -
retical yield of 2.37 g/g fatty acid, the actual yield is only 
10.12% of the theoretical yield, and there is still a lot of 
room for improvement. Possible reasons for the low yield 
are multiple, such as the presence of rate-limiting steps in 
metabolic pathways, difficulties in substrate utilization, 
and imbalanced enzyme expression in this multi-enzyme 
pathway. Therefore, some optimization strategies can be 
used in the future to further improve the yield. For exam-
ple, we can choose to conduct metabolomics analysis 
and metabolic flux analysis. This can help us determine 
the rate-limiting steps of this pathway and understand 
the metabolic flux of 3HP bypass and other acetyl-CoA 
assimilation routes. It can also help us understand the 
bottlenecks in the synthesis process of intracellular 
cofactors, such as ATP or NADPH. It will provide guid -
ance for further optimization of engineering strains. Fur -
thermore, fatty acids, serving as carbon sources, have low 
solubility in fermentation broth. It will seriously affect the 
utilization of fatty acids and affect the production of suc -
cinate. It also makes it difficult to measure the biomass 
accumulation data in this work. One solution is to add 
surfactants to the fermentation medium to further pro -
mote the utilization of fatty acids and use the plate count-
ing method to calculate biomass accumulation data. In 
addition, this work involves multiple proteins. From the 
protein expression results of engineering bacteria (figure 
S1), the protein expression is imbalanced. The imbalance 
of enzyme expression levels can also affect the synthesis 
efficiency of products [ 21]. Some solutions include RBS 
engineering or replacing the promoter. Except for the 
methods introduced in this work, there are also some 
other promising solutions to improve the supply of ATP 
and NADPH, such as powering bacteria or optimizing 
metabolic pathways [26].
Conclusion
This study constructed and optimized a succinate bio -
synthetic pathway with double CO 2 fixation reactions 
in recombinant C. necator  H16 utilizing fatty acids as 
carbon sources. This work possesses advantages in sev -
eral aspects: (1) This pathway has high carbon fixation 
efficiency. One molecule of succinate is produced from 
a single acetyl-CoA molecule and two CO 2 molecules. 
It means that 50% of the carbon atoms in succinate are 
generated from CO2, which is twice that of the traditional 
succinate biosynthesis, depending on the PEP or pyruvate 
carboxylation. (2) Using fatty acid as raw material avoids 
carbon loss during acetyl-CoA and succinate production. 
Previous work used glucose as a carbon source, leading 
to CO2 release in the reaction of pyruvate to acetyl-CoA 
(the precursor of succinate in this pathway) [ 13]. This 
study uses fatty acids as raw material, which not only 
does not cause carbon loss in its β-oxidation, but also has 
a high yield of acetyl-CoA (for example, one molecule of 
palmitic acid can produce 8 molecules of acetyl-CoA). (3) 
Developed effective ATP and NADPH regulation strate -
gies. Through the screening, this study proved ADK and 
Pos5p were good choices for ATP and NADPH depen -
dent pathway in C. necator  H16. Meanwhile, it also pro -
vides the solution for the utilization of waste oils.
