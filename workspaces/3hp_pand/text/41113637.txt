Introduction: Vitamin B12 (B12) is an essential cofactor for key metabolic processes 
in most living organisms, yet only certain bacteria can synthesize it de novo. 
Common forms of B 12 include adenosylcobalamin (AdoCbl), methylcobalamin 
(MeCbl) and cyanocobalamin (CNCbl). This study presents the B 12 production 
capability of an extremophile— Ectopseudomonas alcaliphila  MSJ19, and a 
multilevel evaluation of bioactivity of various B12 forms.
Methods: B 12 extracted from Ectopseudomonas alcaliphila MSJ19 was initially 
analyzed by bioassay and LC–MS to confirm the presence of natural B 12 forms, 
followed by in vitro enzyme activity assays with glycerol dehydratase (GD) and diol 
dehydratase (DD). The functionality of various B12 forms on these enzymes was further 
evaluated using in-silico molecular docking studies. The bioactivity at the in vivo level 
was assessed by introducing a coenzyme B12-dependent 3-hydroxypropionic acid 
(3-HP) biosynthetic pathway in E. coli W and Ectopseudomonas alcaliphila MSJ19 
for their ability to transform glycerol into 3-HP.
Results: Bioassay and LC–MS analysis confirmed the presence of ~7 μg/g cdw B12 
in the processed extract and specific precursor-product ion transitions, indicated 
the production of natural B12 forms. To functionally validate the bioactivity of the 
crude B12 extract, the coenzyme B12-dependent 3-HP biosynthesis pathway was 
employed in recombinant E. coli W. Supplementation with different B 12 forms 
revealed a hierarchical GD and DD activity (AdoCbl > MeCbl > CNCbl) and a 
dose-dependent increase in 3-HP production, with an optimal threshold around 
500 nM. The conformational specificity of AdoCbl and competitive inhibition of 
CNCbl and MeCbl were supported by molecular docking of all 3 B12 forms with 
GD and DD. Notably, crude B 12 extract at 0.35 nM yielded 5.9 mM 3-HP titer, 
closely matching the 7.8 mM obtained with AdoCbl, confirming its bioactive 
equivalence. Furthermore, recombinant Ectopseudomonas alcaliphila MSJ19 
(EaMr) harboring the 3-HP pathway produced up to 3.3 mM 3-HP without external 
B12 supplementation, highlighting innate capability of the host to produce and 
utilize bioactive B12 in vivo.
Discussion: Collectively— in  vitro, in silico and in  vivo approaches establish a 
functional framework for certifying B 12 bioactivity and demonstrating EaM as a 
potent chassis for production of value-added chemicals.

1 Introduction
Vitamin B 12 (B 12) is a unique cobalt-containing tetrapyrrole 
cofactor essential for diverse metabolic processes in prokaryotes and 
eukaryotes ( Spataru, 2024 ). Clinically, B 12 holds significant 
importance, as its deficiency is prevalent among all age groups and 
linked to pernicious anemia and several neurological diseases 
(Niklewicz et  al., 2023 ). Despite its critical role in most living 
organisms, only bacteria are capable of synthesizing it de novo in two 
biologically active forms, such as adenosylcobalamin (AdoCbl) and 
methylcobalamin (MeCbl). Due to very low thermostability and high 
photosensitivity, these natural forms are often chemically modified 
into a stable cyanocobalamin (CNCbl) form. Hydroxocobalamin is 
another commonly found B12 form; however, its applications aren’t 
widespread compared to others. Among these, MeCbl acts as a 
cofactor only for methionine synthase (MS) in mammals and bacteria. 
AdoCbl, on the other hand, supports a broad range of coenzyme B12-
dependent enzymes known as isomerases, which include mutases, 
eliminases, and amino mutases. Methyl malonyl-CoA mutase 
(MMUC) is a well-recognized coenzyme B12-dependent enzyme in 
humans, while other enzymes have been identified in bacteria, 
including β-lysine-5,6-aminomutase (LAM), 2-methylene glutarate 
mutase (MGM), diol dehydratase (DD), D-ornithine-4,5-
aminomutase (OAM), ethanolamine ammonia lyase (EAL), glutamate 
mutase (GM), glycerol dehydratase (GD), isobutyryl-CoA mutase 
(IM), and ribonucleoside triphosphate reductase (RTPR) (Montoya 
and Escobar-Briones, 2025). Several of these have been characterized 
well, in which two isofunctional enzymes—glycerol dehydratase and 
diol dehydratase are of particular interest in this study, due to their 
role beyond bacterial metabolism, as catalysts for platform chemical 
production such as 1,3-propanediol, 3-hydroxypropionic acid, 
1-propanol and butanone ( Madavi et  al., 2024 ; Brown, 2005 ). 
Generally, coenzyme B12-dependent enzymes catalyze intramolecular 
1,2—rearrangements mediated through the 5′-deoxyadenosyl radical 
of coenzyme. Substrate binding to the enzymes generates the active 
radical by homolytic cleavage of the Co-C bond. This highlights the 
role of active B 12 forms in mediating such radical-based catalysis 
(Brunold, 2005).
Over the years, a wide range of B 12 quantification and 
characterization methods have been developed including: 
Microbiological assay, High-performance liquid chromatography 
(HPLC)—Diode Array Detector (DAD), Liquid chromatography—
Mass Spectrometer (LC–MS), UV–vis spectrometry, Raman 
scattering, atomic absorption spectrometry, Immunoassay, 
Fluorescence detection, chemiluminescence, capillary electrophoresis, 
surface plasmon resonance and induced coupled plasma-MS 
(ICP-MS) (Y ang et al., 2024; Trad et al., 2025; Guo et al., 2024; Kansay 
et al., 2024; Fan et al., 2025). These techniques have been instrumental 
in analyzing B 12 from various samples such as pharmaceutical, 
nutraceutical, and food products, bacterial cultures, serum, seaweeds, 
algae and mushrooms. Common challenges encountered in B 12 
quantification are low B12 concentration in samples often below the 
limit of detection (LOD) of many methods, stability and sensitivity 
factors, sample matrix interference, complexity of extraction, sample 
pretreatment and analytical procedures, and co-detection of B 12 
analogs like cobinamide, cobamide, cobyric acid and pseudo-B 12 
(Santos et al., 2024; Lu et al., 2025; Konings et al., 2024; Deptula et al., 
2017). B12 analogs are majorly found in bacterial fermentation extracts, 
hence sample pretreatment steps like solid phase extraction (SPE) and 
immunoaffinity purification, along with LC–MS, were beneficial in 
distinguishing bioactive B 12 forms from B 12 analogs. Though 
chromatographic methods can distinguish and quantify active B 12 
forms, they offer little insight into the biological functionality of the 
B12 present (Xie et al., 2019 ; Chamlagain et al., 2024; Koseki et al., 
2023). In contrast, bioactivity assay of B12 extracts can be obtained 
only through the measurement of biological output such as cell 
growth, protein expression, enzyme activity and biochemical 
production. Conventional microbiological assay using Lactobacillus 
leichmannii and auxotrophic mutants of Salmonella typhimurium, and 
Escherichia coli serve as perfect examples for both quantification and 
bioactivity evaluation of B12 (Raux et al., 1996; Bhushan et al., 2016). 
In addition, recent developments on PCR-based strategies provide 
confirmation for B12 production on a genotypic level ( Venkatesan 
et al., 2024). Y et they fail to distinguish various forms of B12 and are 
prone to false positives by B 12 analogs and sample matrix, thus 
requiring extensive sample pretreatment (Kong et al., 2017; Li et al., 
2017). Each B12 quantification method has its pros and cons; most 
importantly, this study does not aim to replace or challenge well-
established B12 analytical methods. Rather, it focuses on the lacuna in 
evaluating the bioactivity of various forms of B 12 from a natural 
producer in terms of functional biological output.
This work aims to analyze the bioactivity of crude B12 extracted 
from a novel extremophilic B 12 producer. Through confirming the 
production of natural B12 forms by Ectopseudomonas alcaliphila MSJ19 
(EaM), the study navigates toward in  vitro, in silico and in  vivo 
approaches to evaluate B12 bioactivity and shed light on the effect of 
various B 12 forms on bioactivity. The outcomes provide valuable 
insights into the functionalities of B12 from natural producers and the 
significance of B 12 dose and forms in clinical and industrial 
applications. The developed framework to functionally characterize 
B12 is intended to trigger more research focus toward the development 
of high-throughput biological output-based B12 quantification. Finally, 
the host’s capability to produce biologically active B 12 has been 
channeled toward 3-hydroxypropionic acid production in E. coli W 
and EaM by metabolic engineering approaches. Ectopseudomonas 
alcaliphila MSJ19 is an extremophile with psychrophilic (growth at 
4–40 °C) and alkaliphilic (optimal pH 9–10) properties. To our 
knowledge, this represents the first report evaluating B12 bioactivity 
from an extremophilic strain (Venkatesan et al., 2024; Yumoto et al., 
2001). The alkaliphilic nature provides revolutionary bioprocess 
advantages such as pH-based bio-containment that prevents 
mesophilic contamination, elimination of complex buffering systems 
and potential compatibility with non-sterile fermentation 
infrastructure (Zeng et al., 2023; Wernick et al., 2016). Thus, providing 
a scope for Ectopseudomonas alcaliphila MSJ19 as a potent microbial 
chassis for the sustainable production of value-added biochemicals.
2 Materials and methods
2.1 Chemicals, strains, and plasmids
All chemicals, reagents and media were correspondingly 
purchased from SRL-India, Sigma Aldrich, TCI chemicals and 
Himedia. Y east alcohol dehydrogenase (yADH) was purchased from 
Sigma-Aldrich. Ectopseudomonas alcaliphila MSJ19 was isolated in 
Venkatesan et al. 10.3389/fmicb.2025.1654548
Frontiers in Microbiology 03 frontiersin.org
our previous study, and its 16S rRNA sequence has been deposited in 
GenBank (ID: PX397011). Plasmid pDK7 (p15a)/pddCDE, gdrAB was 
developed by amplification of pddCDE genes from genomic DNA 
isolated from Klebsiella pneumoniae 109 and subsequently cloned into 
KpnI and HindIII restriction sites of pDK7 (p15a)/dhaB123, gdrAB 
plasmid. The plasmids were transformed into appropriate hosts 
following the protocol adopted from (Zhou et al., 2013). All strains, 
plasmids and primers used in this study are listed in Table 1.
2.2 Shake flask production of vitamin B12 by 
Ectopseudomonas alcaliphila MSJ19
Overnight lysogeny broth (LB) EaM culture was pre-cultured in LB 
medium until mid-late log phase of growth. Subsequently, 0.1 OD600 of 
exponentially grown cells was reinoculated appropriately in LB 
production medium containing precursors: CoCl2 (5 mg/L), DMBI 
(75 mg/L), and Betaine (1 g/L) and incubated under aerobic conditions 
at 37 °C, 200 rpm. Wild-type E. coli W were cultivated under similar 
conditions to serve as a negative control wherever appropriate in this 
study. Cell growth was measured at regular intervals by a UV–Vis 
spectrophotometer, and after 18 h, cells were harvested for B12 extraction 
(4,500 rpm, 15 min). One OD600 corresponds to 0.33 g (±0.05 g) of dried 
cell mass per liter (Arasu et al., 2013).
2.3 Extraction and quantification of B12
Cells were washed twice with 100 mM potassium phosphate 
buffer (pH 7.0) and resuspended in the same buffer for B12 extraction 
under ice with minimal light exposure. Cell concentration was 
measured before and after lysis. Cells were lysed by ultrasonication at 
30% amplitude for 6 min with a 10-s ON/OFF cycle (VCX 130, Sonics; 
20 kHz), centrifuged (4,500 rpm, 10 min), supernatant filtered 
through a 0.22 μm syringe filter and used as crude B 12 extract for 
further analysis.
For B12 quantification by bioassay, the protocol mentioned in our 
previously published study was followed exactly (Venkatesan et al., 
2024). To convert natural B12 forms into the more stable CNCbl form, 
0.1% w/v NaCN was added to the crude B12 extract, and after 5 min 
incubation (37°C), the mixture was autoclaved (121 °C, 15 min) and 
cooled on ice. The samples were centrifuged (4,500 rpm, 20 min) and 
the supernatant was passed through a 0.22 μm syringe filter prior to 
LC–MS analysis. The LC–MS analysis was performed for both crude 
B12 extract and cyano-converted extract, using a Waters TQD LC–MS/
MS system equipped with a Kinetex (2.6 μm, XB C18 Column, 2.1 × 
100 mm). 20 mM ammonium formate in water (Mobile Phase A) and 
methanol (Mobile Phase B) were used for sample elution under the 
following linear gradient: 90% mobile phase A for 0–2 min, 90% 
mobile phase A for 2–4 min, 10% mobile phase A for 4–5 min, 90% 
mobile phase A for 5–7 min. The flow rate was maintained at 0.3 mL/
min, the column temperature was set to 35 °C, and the injection 
volume was 10 μL. Mass spectrometry was conducted in positive 
electrospray ionization (ESI) mode with a source temperature of 
140°C, desolvation temperature of 300 °C, cone gas flow of 10 L/h and 
desolvation gas flow of 1,000 L/h. The capillary voltage was set at 26 V , 
and the cone voltage was 35 V . The quantification of CNCbl was 
performed using multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) transitions, 
monitoring the precursor ion at m/z 678.5 and the product ions at m/z 
147.0 and 358.9, with collision energies of 34 eV and 24 eV , 
respectively (Stumpf et al., 2024; Kahoun et al., 2022). This targeted 
MRM setting was chosen to achieve high specificity and sensitivity for

CNCbl, while avoiding cross-detection of other B12 forms in crude 
extracts (Reddy KotamReddy et al., 2023). The same LC–MS method 
was also adopted for crude B12 extracts.
2.4 Enzyme activity assay
The modified M9 medium used for shake flask studies in EcW GD 
and EcW DD contained: MgSO4·7H2O, 0.5 g/L; NaCl, 1.0 g/L; NH4Cl, 
1.0 g/L; yeast extract, 1 g/L; glycerol, 100 mM; potassium phosphate 
buffer (pH 7.0), 100 mM; kanamycin 50 mg/L; and chloramphenicol 
25 mg/L. Unless stated otherwise, LB medium and the same modified 
M9 medium with appropriate antibiotics were used for primary 
inoculum and secondary inoculum, respectively. Shake flask 
cultivation was carried out with a working volume of 50 mL culture 
with an inoculum of 0.1 OD600 in a 250 mL Erlenmeyer flask at 37°C, 
250 rpm under aerobic conditions. For enzyme production, the 
cultures were induced at 0.6 ± 0.05 OD600 with 0.5 mM IPTG. After 
6 h incubation, cells were harvested (5,000 rpm, 15 min) and washed 
once with 20 mM potassium phosphate buffer. Subsequently, cells 
were resuspended in the same buffer and subjected to ultrasonication 
under ice at 30% amplitude for 4 min with a 10-s ON/OFF cycle. The 
obtained lysate was centrifuged (13,000  rpm, 30 min), and the 
supernatant was collected to measure total protein concentration (by 
the Bradford method), glycerol dehydratase (GD) and diol dehydratase 
(DD) activity, respectively.
GD activity was measured by following the protocol developed by 
Sankaranarayanan et al. (2017), and the same method was employed 
to measure DD activity. Briefly, the substrate mixture (~1.8 mL), 
containing 20 mM potassium phosphate buffer (pH 8.0), 3 mM MgCl2 
and 40 mM 1,2-PDO, was placed in a 1-cm path length 
spectrophotometer cuvette. B12 solution (100 μL) was added to this 
assay mixture, containing 0.15 mM NADH and 1.5 mM ATP . B12 
concentration and type were varied individually to study their effects. 
Then, the coupling enzyme (40 μL) yADH (12 U/mL) was added 
using an air-tight gas chromatography syringe, and the cuvette was 
incubated for 3 min in a water bath at 37 °C. The enzymatic reaction 
was initiated by injecting 50 μL of crude GD or crude DD enzyme 
solution, appropriately (typically <0.03 U/mL). The NADH 
concentration was determined at 340 nm with the extinction 
coefficient (ε340) of 6.22 mM−1 cm−1 on a UV spectrophotometer. One 
unit of GD or DD activity was defined as the amount of enzyme 
required to convert 1 μmol of 1,2-PDO to propionaldehyde per 
minute under given assay conditions.
2.5 Molecular docking of various B12 forms 
with GD and DD
Molecular docking was performed between each B 12 form—
AdoCbl, CNCbl, MeCbl and the active sites of GD and DD. High-
resolution crystal structures of GD (PDB ID: 1IWP) and DD (PDB 
ID: 1DIO) were retrieved from the protein data bank (PDB) 
(Y amanishi et al., 2002; Shibata et al., 1999). The crystal structures 
were refined by eliminating water molecules and ligands using 
PyMOL software (version 3.1.3). Refined proteins were subsequently 
processed using Autodock tools (v 1.5.7) by setting grid parameters 
for both GD and DD based on reference active site coordinates 
reported already (Y amanishi et al., 2002; Masuda et al., 2000 ). 3D 
structure of all the ligand molecules AdoCbl, CNCbl, and MeCbl were 
procured from protein structures (PDB ID: 5C8A, 5NP4, 3SC0) 
co-crystalized with respective ligands. Each B12 ligand was assigned its 
respective charges and docked into the aforementioned active site 
grid. Docked conformations exhibiting higher binding and similar 
interactions with key active site residues were considered for 
further evaluation.
2.6 Shake flask 3-HP production in EcW GD 
and EcW DD
Shake flask 3-HP production with the respective host was carried 
out aerobically using the same modified M9 medium (50 mL) with a 
starting inoculum of 0.1 OD600 in a 250-ml Erlenmeyer flask incubated 
at 37°C, 250 rpm. The cultures were induced at 0.6 ± 0.05 OD600 with 
0.1 mM IPTG and supplemented with various forms and 
concentrations of B12, respectively, at 3, 6, 9, and 12 h of cultivation. 
The details on B 12 form and concentration supplemented for each 
shake flask experiment were furnished in Supplementary Table  1. 
Samples were collected periodically to determine the cell mass, 
residual substrate and metabolites. Briefly, the collected culture 
samples were centrifuged (10,000 rpm, 10 min), then the supernatant 
was diluted appropriately and filtered using a 0.22 μm PVDF 
membrane filter (Millipore). Then the samples were passed through 
an HPLC system equipped with an Aminex HPX-87H column 
(300 mm × 7.8 mm, Bio-Rad, United States) maintained at 65°C. The 
mobile phase consisted of 2.5 mM H2SO4 with a flow rate of 0.5 mL/
min, and metabolite concentrations were analyzed using a Refractive 
Index Detector (RID) and a Photo-diode array detector (PDA) (Ravi 
and Sankaranarayanan, 2024).
2.7 Shake flask 3-HP production in 
recombinant Ectopseudomonas alcaliphila 
MSJ19 (EaMr)
Shake flask cultivation of the EaMr for 3-HP production was 
carried out in the same B12 production medium with the addition of 
Kanamycin (30 mg/L). The cultivation was carried out aerobically at 
37°C, 200 rpm, with an initial cell concentration of 0.1 OD600. 100 mM 
of glycerol (carbon source for 3-HP production) was added when the 
cell concentration reached 0.7 ~ 1 OD600. The samples were withdrawn 
periodically to determine the cell mass, glycerol, 3-HP and 
other metabolites.
3 Results
3.1 Production of natural forms of B12 by 
Ectopseudomonas alcaliphila MSJ19
Consistent with our previous study, the B 12 levels of 
Ectopseudomonas alcaliphila MSJ19 ( EaM) quantified by bioassay 
were 7.18 μg/g cdw (Venkatesan et al., 2024). To validate B12 forms, 
LC–MS analysis was performed for: (a) crude B12 extract, (b) cyano-
converted B12 extract, and (c) crude B12 extract spiked with 0.5 μM 
Venkatesan et al. 10.3389/fmicb.2025.1654548
Frontiers in Microbiology 05 frontiersin.org
each of standard AdoCbl and MeCbl (Figure 1). A distinct peak at RT 
4.32 min was observed for cyano-converted B12 extract corresponding 
to MRM transitions m/z 147.0 and 358.9, matching precisely with the 
standard CNCbl profile. These transitions were selected based on their 
high sensitivity and specificity for CNCbl quantification. The 
concentration of B12 was quantified as 6.93 μg/g cdw. In contrast, no 
corresponding peaks were observed at RT 4.3 min for either the crude 
extract or the spiked crude extract, indicating that CNCbl was not 
natively present in the bacterial extract. These results collectively 
support that EaM produces only the natural (coenzyme) forms of 
B12—namely, MeCbl and AdoCbl—which are not detected in this LC–
MS method due to their distinct transition requirements (such as m/z 
685.6 and 665.6, respectively) (Heal et al., 2014). By providing a clear 
distinction between the presence of natural and non-natural forms of 
B12, the present strategy offers a streamlined and scalable framework 
for both qualitative and quantitative assessment of B12 production in 
industrially relevant microbial strains.
3.2 In-vitro bioactivity evaluation of crude 
B12 extract
Glycerol dehydratase (GD) and diol dehydratase (DD) are 
isofunctional, coenzyme B 12-dependent enzymes, whose 
characteristics and in vitro assays have been well studied (Toraya et al., 
2022; Nasir et al., 2020). These enzymes are known to be catalytically 
active only in the presence of AdoCbl with varying degrees of 
sensitivity (Marsh and Meléndez, 2012; Toraya et al., 1979). While 
other B12 forms, such as MeCbl and CNCbl, are often reported as 
competitive inhibitors (Poppe and Rétey, 1997; Toraya and Ishida, 
1991). These features make GD and DD valuable in vitro tools for 
evaluating the functional bioactivity of B12 from bacterial extracts.
Generally, activity assays for these isofunctional enzymes are 
performed at a saturated coenzyme B 12 concentration of around 
10–20 μM (Kumar et al., 2016; Wei et al., 2014). However, due to the 
low concentration of crude B 12 used for this study (0.35 nM), a 
preliminary investigation was carried out to study the effect of 
AdoCbl concentration on GD and DD activity. Maximal activities 
were observed at 15 μM AdoCbl, yielding 14.32 U/mg for GD and 
6.79 U/mg for DD. At 0.35 nM, the enzyme activity dropped to 
0.32 U/mg for GD, while no significant activity was observed for 
DD (Figure 2A). The difference in activities between GD and DD 
correlates with their known kinetic parameters, specifically the 
reported Km values of GD (~ 8 nM to 20 nM) and DD (~ 0.7 μM) 
from Klebsiella sp. ( Y amanishi et  al., 2002; Wang et  al., 2007 ). 
According to previous reports, GD attained 95% of its maximum 
activity and DD only 4% at 120 nM AdoCbl (Y amada et al., 2004). 
Relatively, the current study shows that GD and DD attained 81% 
and 7% of their respective maximum activities at 100 nM AdoCbl, 
confirming the accuracy of the assay and reinforcing AdoCbl 
sensitivity among the enzymes. As anticipated, no significant 
enzyme activity was observed when the assay was performed with 
CNCbl and MeCbl, even at 15 μM, the saturated concentration used 
for AdoCbl (Figure 2B). The missing 5′-deoxyadenosyl radical upon 
binding of CNCbl and MeCbl to the enzyme is expected to be the 
sole reason for their inability to support GD and DD activity 
(Toraya, 2000; Bucher et al., 2012). Previous reports support this by 
showing that MeCbl and CNCbl act as competitive inhibitors for 
DD (Ki of 0.73 μM and 1.8 μM, respectively) ( Toraya et al., 1977) 
and CNCbl for GD ( Ki = 21.6 nM) ( Poppe and Rétey, 1997 ). 
Notably, with 0.35 nM of crude B 12 extract, the GD activity 
measured was 0.21 U/mg, which was slightly lower than 0.32 U/mg 
obtained with standard AdoCbl at the same concentration. While 
this suggests that the crude B 12 extract predominantly contains 
AdoCbl, it confirms that EaM has dominantly produced AdoCbl; 
the lower activity could likely be  due to the presence of some 
MeCbl, which may exert competitive inhibition. However, further 
studies are required to confirm this hypothesis. These results 
collectively demonstrate that the B 12 produced by Ectopseudomonas 
alcaliphila MSJ19 is functionally bioactive, with in  vitro-based 
assays providing indirect but reliable confirmation of AdoCbl as the 
dominant form in the crude extract.
3.3 In silico prediction of various B12 forms 
reactive specificity with GD and DD
To complement the differential catalytic activity of B12 forms on a 
structural basis, molecular docking was performed between three B12 
ligands—AdoCbl, CNCbl, and MeCbl—and the known crystal 
structures of GD and DD. A total of six docking combinations were 
generated, and a complete summary of interactions and H-bond 
distances for each docking conformation is provided in 
Supplementary Table 2. Based on previous crystallographic studies, 12 
key active site residues were defined for GD (Y amanishi et al., 2002) 
and 7 for DD (Masuda et al., 2000) to assess the binding capability of 
ligands within the functionally active site.
In GD, AdoCbl exhibited the most favorable binding conformation 
for catalytic function, forming hydrogen bonds with five active site 
residues (SER122, THR104, SER225, THR173, LYS102) and a binding 
energy of −3.93 kcal/mol (Figures 3A1,D1). These interactions span 
both the corrin ring and adenosyl moiety, positioning the ligand in a 
favorable conformation for Co-C homolysis and radical exchange. 
CNCbl exhibited a significantly lower binding energy ( −14.5 kcal/
mol) and formed four interactions with active site residues (SER122, 
ASP235, ALA124, THR173) ( Figures  3B1,E1). While such tight 
binding reflects higher affinity, the absence of the adenine moiety 
blocks its catalytic ability and complements its role as a competitive 
inhibitor. MeCbl also interacted only with one active residue 
(SER122) and an intermediate binding energy ( −5.81 kcal/mol) 
(Figures 3C1,F1), further reflecting its non-catalytic but potentially 
competitive inhibitory role.
In DD, AdoCbl again exhibited the highest number of active 
site interactions, yet fewer than in GD. Only two out of six 
interactions matched with key active side residues (THR172, 
SER301) following an intermediate binding energy ( −7.23 kcal/
mol) (Figures 3A2 ,D2). This observation aligns with the in vitro 
enzyme activity assay, where DD activity expressed a higher Km 
than GD, thus justifying the lower specificity of AdoCbl with 
DD. CNCbl had only one matching residue (THR172) among five 
interactions with a lower binding energy ( −12.9 kcal/mol) 
(Figures 3B2 ,E2). MeCbl had only one matching residue (SER224) 
among its two interactions with a higher binding energy 
(−6.99 kcal/mol) among all 3 B 12 forms with DD ( Figures 3C2 ,F2). 
These binding predictions reflect the inferiority of B 12-driven 
catalysis with DD as compared to GD.

Importantly, these findings elucidate the conserved structural and 
functional preference of GD and DD for AdoCbl. Evidently, 
comparison of available crystal structures and docking combinations 
of this study has shown that CNCbl and MeCbl are also capable of 
binding within the active site, but they lack the adenine moiety 
necessary to trigger Co-C bond homolysis and substrate 
rearrangements (Shibata et al., 2018). Hence, the adenine moiety not 
only acts as a radical initiator, but also participates in key interactions

to position the cofactor in an appropriate spatial conformation for 
catalytic activity. Therefore, the in-silico findings support the in vitro 
enzymatic assay, confirming that only AdoCbl positions itself in a 
catalytically active conformation in both GD and DD in a conserved 
manner. Meanwhile, CNCbl and MeCbl are capable of competitive 
inhibition due to their catalytically inactive binding conformation.
3.4 In-vivo bioactivity evaluation of crude 
B12 extract
In the two-step catalytic pathway for 3-HP production, Coenzyme 
B12 (AdoCbl) serves as an essential cofactor for glycerol dehydratase 
(Kumar et al., 2012). Therefore, 3-HP production can act as a reliable 
qualitative metric for assessment of B12 bioactivity, offering a more 
meaningful output than conventional microbiological assay. To 
evaluate this, EcW GD and EcW DD were supplemented individually 
with AdoCbl, MeCbl, and CNCbl for 3-HP production. Among these, 
AdoCbl yielded the highest 3-HP production in EcW GD, confirming 
it as the most effective cofactor for GD activity. Whereas MeCbl 
resulted in only 63% of this maximum, and CNCbl only 36%. A 
similar trend was observed for EcW DD, yet its maximum 3-HP titre 
was only 52% of that achieved with EcW GD. Such a low 3-HP titre of 
DD in this expression system is obvious due to the following well-
documented reasons: (i) 1,2-PDO is the preferred substrate for DD 
over glycerol (Sauvageot et al., 2002), (ii) absence of diol dehydratase 
reactivase in this expression system, making DD prone to suicide 
inactivation like GD in the presence of glycerol (Bilić et al., 2019), (iii) 
gdrAB is known to be ineffective in reactivating DD (Kajiura et al., 
2007), and (iv) less B12 specificity of DD as observed in enzyme activity 
analysis (Poppe and Rétey, 1997). These results further demonstrate a 
substantial decline in GD and DD activity with synthetic B12 forms 
and justify the functional superiority of the natural B12 forms.
Notably, the modest 3-HP production with CNCbl suggests that 
E. coli may possess intrinsic metabolic mechanisms to convert CNCbl 
into biologically active forms, analogous to human metabolic 
pathways (Kelly, 1997). However, the relatively low 3-HP titer (70% 
lower than AdoCbl) indicates that this intracellular conversion is likely 
rate-limiting. The difference in 3-HP production between MeCbl and 
CNCbl also reflects the metabolic complexity of their respective 
conversion process, as CNCbl conversion is mediated by a four-step 
enzymatic process, while MeCbl requires only a single step ( Rizzo 
et al., 2016).
While earlier studies typically employed 2000 nM AdoCbl for 
optimal 3-HP production in E. coli ( Nguyen-Vo et  al., 2019), the 
concentration of crude B 12 extract used is comparatively less 
(0.35 nM). Therefore, this study also evaluated the effect of B 12 
concentration on 3-HP production across a wide range (0.35–
2,000 nM) for each B 12 form ( Figures  4A,B). Interestingly, B 12 
concentration had a significant effect on 3-HP production, similar to 
the enzyme activity. Remarkably, the highest 3-HP titer of 50.2 mM 
was observed at 500 nM AdoCbl for EcW GD, beyond which no 
significant increase in titre could be  observed. The optimal 3-HP 
production at 500 nM reflects seamlessly with the V max of GD, 
embarking on the critical impact of B12 on the rate-limiting step of the 
3-HP catalytic pathway. The 3-HP production titer (41.5 mM) with 
2 μM AdoCbl was also consistent with previous reports 
(Sankaranarayanan et al., 2017). Similar trends were observed for 
other B12 forms. Owing to the higher Km of DD, 3-HP production was 
maximal (26.2 mM) only at 2,000 nM and suggesting that further 
increase in B12 may still enhance activity (typically close to the Vmax of 
DD (>7 μM)).
Of particular interest, crude B12 extract at 0.35 nM supported a 
3-HP titre of 5.9 mM in EcW GD—closely matching the 7.8 mM titer 
at 0.35 nM AdoCbl. This confirms the presence of active B12 forms in 
the extract. The marginal difference could be attributed to the presence 
of some MeCbl in the extract, as only the total B12 concentration was 
quantified. Consistently, MeCbl at 0.35 nM attained a lower 3-HP titer 
of 4.2 mM. In contrast, no measurable 3-HP production was observed 
at 0.35 nM cyano-converted extract, despite a very low 3-HP titer of 
FIGURE 4

1.1 mM at 0.35 nM CNCbl. This suggests potential interference from 
matrix effects during conversion (Nakos et al., 2017) or simply the 
titre falling to the limit of detection (LOD = 0.8–1.0 mM). As 
expected, no 3-HP production was observed in the negative control 
with E. coli W extract, thus justifying that any potential impurities in 
crude bacterial extracts do not affect 3-HP production. These findings 
reinforce the presence of a biologically active form of B 12 in crude 
extract, and the chemical conversion process has led to a non-natural/
synthetic B12 form, which obviously has led to a decrease in or no 
3-HP production. Collectively, these results strongly establish the 
utility of 3-HP production as an in  vivo functional assay for B 12 
bioactivity. Building on these findings, the next section validates the 
in vivo B12 bioactivity using recombinant Ectopseudomonas alcaliphila 
MSJ19 itself.
3.5 Assessment of the 3-HP production 
capability of EaMr
To evaluate the in vivo bioactivity of endogenously produced B12, 
Ectopseudomonas alcaliphila MSJ19 was engineered to express the 
3-HP biosynthetic pathway via plasmid pUCPK harboring dhaB123, 
gdrAB, and KGSADH. Shake flask cultivation was performed with and 
without an exogenous supply of 2 μM AdoCbl, thereby ensuring that 
any observed 3-HP production is solely dependent on the host’s innate 
B12 biosynthesis capability. Correspondingly, EaMr produced a 
maximum 3-HP titre of 3.2 mM without external B12, indicating the 
endogenous production of coenzyme B12 was sufficient to activate GD 
and enable 3-HP biosynthesis ( Figure 5A). As expected, no 3-HP 
production was observed in control flasks without glycerol 
supplementation (data not shown), confirming that 3-HP originated 
exclusively from glycerol metabolism and not from medium 
components or endogenous carbon sources. 3-HP production was 
improved (9.5 mM) under B12 supplementation, indicating that 3-HP 
flux can be  further enhanced through B 12 supplementation 
(Figure 5B). In addition, glycerol consumption and 3-HP production 
were relatively low in either case compared to EcW GD. This could 
be presumed due to intrinsic regulatory barriers, such as the presence 
of transcriptional repressors in the host’s native glycerol catabolic 
pathway and/or limited compatibility between the heterologous 
plasmid system and the host transcriptional or translational 
machinery (Thi Nguyen et  al., 2021; Prieto-de Lima et  al., 2024 ). 
Although elucidating these factors was beyond the scope of this study, 
the results clearly establish the functional bioavailability of naturally 
synthesized B 12 in EaMr. These findings not only validate 
Ectopseudomonas alcaliphila MSJ19 as a biologically competent B12 
producer but also highlight its potential as a versatile microbial chassis 
for value-added chemical production beyond vitamin B12.
4 Discussion
Vitamin B12 is structurally complex and exists in several natural 
and synthetic forms. Among them, only AdoCbl and MeCbl are 
biologically active, serving as cofactors in radical-based and methyl-
transfer enzymatic reactions, respectively. Bacteria are the sole 
workhorses for industrial scale production of this essential vitamin; 
however, they can produce inactive B12 analogs (Thirupathaiah et al., 
2012). Therefore, assessing the bioactivity of B12 rather than relying 
only on total B 12 quantification is essential to grade its functional 
bioavailability. Recent advancements in chromatographic and 
immunoassay methods have played a significant role in classifying the 
forms of B12 (Möller et al., 2022; Balabanova et al., 2022). However, 
studies are limited in evaluating the activity of crude extracts of 
natural B12 producers using a valid biological output ( Chamlagain 
et  al., 2021). This study details a biologically integrated workflow 
combining in vitro, in silico and in vivo approaches to uncover the 
potential of active forms of B12 produced by a novel extremophilic 
strain (EaM).
Initially, conventional bioassay using Salmonella typhimurium 
ΔmetE ΔcbiB and LC–MS were valuable in confirming the production 
of natural form (AdoCbl & MeCbl) of B 12 (~7 μg/g cdw) by 
Ectopseudomonas alcaliphila MSJ19. The establishment of enzymatic 
assay methods for coenzyme B12-dependent enzymes such as GD and

biological replicates.

DD paved a plausible approach to further study the bioactivity of crude 
B12 extract. The coupled enzymatic method to measure GD activity also 
stood reliable for DD activity measurement, particularly due to its 
increased substrate preference to 1,2-PDO ( Toraya et  al., 2022 ). 
Substrate binding to the holoenzyme triggers Co-C bond homolysis, 
leading to the formation of cob(II)alamin and 5′-deoxyadenosyl radical. 
Theoretically, this radical is essential to mediate 1,2-rearrangements in 
the substrate during enzyme catalysis (Giedyk et al., 2015). Justifiable to 
this, both GD and DD were capable of product formation only in the 
presence of AdoCbl, while no notable enzyme activity was observed for 
CNCbl and MeCbl even at very high concentrations (15 μM) due to 
their inability to form an adenosyl radical.
Interestingly, GD activity with 0.35 nM crude extract was nearly 
equivalent to that of standard AdoCbl, confirming the dominant 
presence of AdoCbl in the crude extract. The lack of DD activity with 
crude extract is attributed to its higher Km of ~0.8 μM for AdoCbl, 
further validating the reliability of such enzyme activity assays to 
confirm B12 bioactivity. Despite the non-catalytic activity of other B12 
forms, they play a larger role as competitive inhibitors, and it is to 
be realized that their presence in sample extracts tends to underestimate 
the bioactivity of actual AdoCbl present. The potential inhibitory 
effects of other B12 forms were supported by molecular docking, which 
revealed comparable binding energies across all B12 forms, suggesting 
competitive inhibition. Thus, in vitro assays combined with in silico 
insights reinforce the fact that B12 bioactivity is not defined by binding 
affinity alone, but also by the ability to support 5 ′-deoxyadenosyl 
radical generation and substrate rearrangements.
Transitioning toward the applicability of the coenzyme B 12-
dependent 3-HP production pathway in recombinant E. coli as an 
in  vivo model system for B 12 bioactivity enlightened the fate of 
other B12 forms beyond competitive inhibition. Contrarily, 3-HP 
production in recombinant E. coli  was observed under 
supplementation of all 3 B 12 forms individually with varying 
degrees (AdoCbl > MeCbl > CNCbl). Although in vitro enzyme 
assay and in silico models have strongly backed the competitive 
nature of other B 12 forms on GD and DD, this discrepancy likely 
arises from the host’s intracellular B 12 salvage and conversion 
mechanisms, enabling conversion of other B 12 forms into AdoCbl. 
Haptocorrin-based B 12 binding, absorption by intrinsic factors, 
innate mechanisms to convert various B 12 forms into a metabolically 
active form and bioavailability were well documented in humans 
(Vincenti et al., 2021 ). While such B12 conversion mechanisms were 
very scarcely reported in bacterial systems ( Reynolds et al., 1980 ), 
this study is the first of its kind to report their impact on coenzyme 
B12-dependent platform chemical synthesis. Future work should 
investigate the regulation of these conversion mechanisms and 
their fine-tuning to improve the flux of AdoCbl for platform 
chemical production.
A concentration-dependent variation in 3-HP titre across B 12 
forms, paralleled GD and DD enzymatic activity trends. These 
outcomes not only validate the presence of natural B 12 form in 
Ectopseudomonas alcaliphila MSJ19 extract but also demonstrate that 
AdoCbl is indispensable for GD/DD—mediated bioconversion. 
Furthermore, the distinct functional differences between natural and 
synthetic B12 forms, along with the concentration thresholds observed, 
provide the groundwork for future studies to develop a quantitative 
enzyme-based assay for B 12. These insights also offer a valuable 
framework for optimizing 3-HP production.
Finally, recombinant expression of the 3-HP pathway in 
Ectopseudomonas alcaliphila  MSJ19 confirms that the host’s 
endogenously synthesized B 12 is not only biologically active but 
also sufficient to support product formation without external B 12 
supply. This approach effectively bypasses the tedious processes 
for B 12 extraction, purification and quantification, which often 
suffer from factors like sample instability, interference from 
analogs, and the need for advanced instrumentation ( Avrămia 
et al., 2024 ; Pakeeza et al., 2024 ). To our knowledge, this is the first 
instance to report 3-HP production in an extremophilic 
Ectopseudomonas  strain without an exogenous supply of B 12. This 
acts as a beacon for future avenues to improve B 12 production in 
this host and explore its possibilities as a reliable and efficient 
non-model microbial chassis for other value-added 
chemicals production.
5 Conclusion
This study presented a comprehensive multifaceted approach to 
evaluate the bioactivity of B12 from a natural producer. In vitro and in 
silico investigations have shed light on the specificity of GD and DD 
toward AdoCbl and revealed the competitive inhibitory effects of 
other B 12 forms, likely due to the absence of the essential 
5′-deoxyadenosyl radical. An in  vivo approach to evaluate B 12 
bioactivity has further uncovered the effect of bacterial innate 
metabolic capability to convert various B12 forms into the catalytically 
active form. Crude B 12 extract from Ectopseudomonas alcaliphila 
MSJ19 demonstrated 66% of the enzyme activity and 76% of 3-HP 
production compared to standard AdoCbl, reinforcing its high 
bioactive potential. Finally, the extremophilic host was able to produce 
3.2 mM 3-HP without external B 12 supplementation, validating its 
endogenous B12 biosynthetic capability and eliminating the need for 
complex B12 extraction procedures. This positions Ectopseudomonas 
alcaliphila MSJ19 as a promising microbial chassis not only for 
sustainable B12 production but also for broader application in the 
production of value-added chemicals. Overall, the study offers a 
scalable, biologically relevant pipeline to assess B12 bioactivity across 
microbial systems and diverse sample sources. Thus, it provides both 
methodological innovation and foundational insights for metabolic 
engineering of coenzyme B12-dependent pathways.
