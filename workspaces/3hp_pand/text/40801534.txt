ABSTRACT Methylorubrum extorquens  AM1, a native formate-utilizing bacterium, has 
exhibited limited capacity to tolerate formate. In this study, we employed an adaptive 
laboratory evolution (ALE) strategy to develop an evolved strain FT3 derived from M. 
extorquens AM1, with enhanced formate tolerance. When cultivated with a mixture 
of carbon sources containing 90 mM formate and 30 mM methanol, the FT3 strain 
exhibited 5.3 times higher optical density (OD 600) compared to the parental strain. 
FT3 strain was shown to efficiently utilize both methanol and formate in experiments 
using 13C-labeled carbon sources. Furthermore, the mechanism underlying the enhanced 
formate tolerance in FT3 strain was investigated through a combination of DNA 
re-sequencing, transcriptome analysis, and ALE-inspired gene manipulation experiments. 
The FT3 strain was identified as a hypermutant, and its enhanced formate tolerance was 
attributed to increased formate transport, an improved methanol oxidation pathway, 
and enhanced formate oxidation and assimilation pathways. In addition, gene overex­
pression experiments indicated the involvement of genes META1_0287*, META1_3027, 
META1_3028, META1_3029, META1_1261, META1_1418, and META1_2965 in formate 
tolerance. Notably, the addition of formate resulted in a significant improvement in the 
generation of NADH and NADPH in the FT3 strain. Moreover, using the FT3 strain as 
a chassis, an improved 3-hydroxypropionic acid (3-HP) production of 2.47 g/L through 
fed-batch fermentation was achieved. This study provides an important foundation for 
further engineering of the evolved M. extorquens  strain as an efficient platform for the 
co-utilization of methanol and formate in the production of reduced chemicals.
IMPORTANCE In the present study, we successfully obtained an evolved strain FT3 
derived from M. extorquens AM1 with high formate tolerance using the ALE strategy. 
The FT3 strain was identified as a hypermutant, with its enhanced formate tolerance 
attributed to increased formate transport, an improved methanol oxidation pathway, 
and enhanced formate oxidation and assimilation pathways. Through transcriptome 
analysis and ALE-inspired gene manipulation experiments, we identified several genes 
that contribute to the FT3 strain’s tolerance to formate. The enhanced levels of reducing 
equivalents and the increased tolerance to 3-HP make FT3 a suitable chassis for 3-HP 
production, achieving an improved yield of 2.47 g/L through fed-batch fermentation. 
This study provides an important foundation for further engineering of the evolved M. 
extorquens strain as an efficient platform for the co-utilization of methanol and formate 
in the production of reduced chemicals.

urrently, fossil fuels and sugar-based raw materials are still the main sources used to 
produce value-added chemicals, which not only compete with human consumption 
but also threaten food security ( 1, 2). In addition, the extensive use of fossils has led to 
energy shortages and the emission of greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide (CO 2), 
which has spurred global concerns. Therefore, there is an urgency to develop green and 
sustainable approaches to access chemical production, rather than relying on fossil fuels 
and sugars ( 1, 2). Among the methods, the electrochemical reduction of CO 2 to formate 
is a promising avenue of research ( 3–6). Formate has become a mediator between the 
physico-chemical and biological realms, as it can serve as the sole carbon and energy 
source for microbial growth ( 2). Furthermore, formate has emerged as an alternative 
feedstock for microbial fermentation due to its relatively low cost, high abundance, and 
high solubility (3, 4, 7).
Native formatotrophic microbes employ two different strategies to grow on formate. 
In the first strategy, the reducing equivalents generated from the oxidation of formate 
support carbon fixation through the Calvin-Benson-Bassham cycle and promote cell 
growth, which has been identified in Cupriavidus necator  and Paracoccus denitrificans 
(8–10). The second strategy involves the direct condensation of formate with tetrahydro­
folate (THF), catalyzed by formate-tetrahydrofolate ligase. This leads to the production of 
the intermediate formyl-THF, which serves as a precursor for several pathways, includ­
ing the reductive acetyl-CoA pathway (also known as the Wood-Ljungdahl pathway), 
the serine cycle, and the reductive glycine pathway ( 10–15). The application of native 
formate-utilizing microbes is currently constrained by a number of factors, including 
their slow growth and low titer and yield of the chemical production ( 7, 16–18). To 
address these issues and render formate a more feasible carbon source in biorefinery 
applications, the adaptive laboratory evolution (ALE) has been conducted with native 
formate-utilizing microbes, such as Thermococcus onnurineus  and C. necator  (19, 20). 
This approach has resulted in a notable enhancement in the tolerance and utilization 
of formate by the evolved microbes. More recently, the formate assimilation pathways 
have been introduced into traditional industrial microorganisms, such as Escherichia 
coli and yeast, thereby creating the synthetic formatotrophic microbes ( 21–26). The 
combination of ALE technology with synthetic formatotrophic microbes has demonstra­
ted the enhanced formate tolerance and utilization ( 21, 23, 25, 26). However, the growth 
of synthetic microbes generally requires the utilization of other carbon sources, with a 
notable reduction in efficiency compared to traditional carbon sources (21–26).
Methylorubrum extorquens AM1 (also known as Methylobacterium extorquens AM1) is 
a representative of methylotrophs capable of utilizing one-carbon compounds (such as 
methanol and formate) as their carbon and energy source ( 13). Formate, the oxidative 
product of methanol, is an important branch point intermediate in methylotrophic 
metabolism as it can either be oxidized to CO 2 to generate reducing equivalents or 
be condensed with THF to be assimilated through the serine cycle ( 27, 28). It has been 
observed that the addition of formate as a supplemental source significantly increases 
the reducing equivalents and enhances the production of chemicals such as mevalo­
nate, poly-3-hydroxybutyrate, and polyhydroxyalkanoates in M. extorquens  AM1 or its 
derivative strains (28–31). Nevertheless, despite being a native formatotroph, it has been 
demonstrated that a severe reduction in growth occurs when the formate concentration 
is increased to more than 20 mM ( Fig. S1), which is significantly lower than the standard 
cultivation concentration of methanol (i.e., 120 mM). Such a low tolerance to formate 
restricts the potential for the use of high concentrations of formate in the bioprocess of 
M. extorquens AM1.
In this study, we employed the ALE method to obtain an evolved M. extorquens 
strain that exhibited tolerance to and assimilation of high concentrations of formate. 
Subsequently, we investigated the underlying mechanisms of formate tolerance through 
a combination of DNA re-sequencing, transcriptome analysis, and ALE-inspired gene 
manipulation experiments. Moreover, in comparison to the native M. extorquens 
AM1 host chassis, the production of 3-hydroxypropionic acid (3-HP) was significantly

increased in the evolved strain using the combined methanol and formate carbon 
sources. The present study highlighted the potential of the evolved M. extorquens strain 
with enhanced formate tolerance in the production of reduced chemicals.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Strains, media, and culture conditions
The plasmids and strains used and generated in this study are listed in Table 1 . All 
E. coli  strains were grown on Luria-Bertani (LB) agar or liquid medium with appropri­
ate antibiotics at 37°C. The final concentrations of antibiotics used in this study were 
20 µg/mL tetracycline (Tet), 25 µg/mL kanamycin (Km), and 80 µg/ml apramycin (Apr). 
Unless otherwise stated, all chemicals used in the culture medium were purchased from 
Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, USA).
Analysis of growth and biomass
M. extorquens  AM1 and its derivative strains were first cultivated as seed cultures in 
test tubes according to previously described methods. The seed cultures were then 
transferred to 250 mL flasks containing 50 mL of Hypho minimal medium with different 
carbon sources ( 34). Unless otherwise noted, 120 mM methanol or 150 mM methanol 
was used as the sole carbon source. For cultivating the M. extorquens FT3 with different 
carbon sources, 34 mM ethanol, 5 mM acetate, 68 mM 1,2-propanediol, or 36 mM 
pyruvate was used as the sole carbon source. To investigate the tolerance of the FT3 
strain to 3-HP or formaldehyde, the M. extorquens  FT3 strains were first cultivated with 
120 mM methanol to an optical density at 600 nm (OD 600) of 0.8. Then, 3-HP was 
added at final concentrations of 100 mg/L, 200 mg/L, 500 mg/L, and 1,000 mg/L, while 
formaldehyde was added at final concentrations of 2.5 mM, 5 mM, 7.5 mM, 10 mM, 
and 12.5 mM. For investigating the derivative strains with overexpressing genes, these 
strains were cultivated with 120 mM methanol and 10 mM, 15 mM, or 20 mM formate, 
respectively.
All the tubes or flasks were incubated on a rotary shaker at 200 rpm and 30°C with 
an initial OD 600 of approximately 0.02. A 0.5 mL sample was taken at each time point 
for OD 600 measurement using a UV-visible spectrophotometer (Genesys10S, CA, USA). 
The specific growth rates were calculated by fitting an exponential growth model using 
Curve Fitter software ( 35). The presented specific growth rates represent the mean plus 
standard deviations calculated from triplicate biological replicates.
ALE of M. extorquens AM1
The ALE of the M. extorquens  AM1 strain ( celAB deleted) was conducted using Hypho 
medium at 30°C. One colony of M. extorquens  AM1ΔcelAB strain was initially inoculated 
into the flask for cultivation on medium with 90 mM methanol and 30 mM sodium 
formate, with four parallel cultures prepared. ALE was then conducted through serial 
transfer every 48 hours. After 10 passages of ALE (approximately 10th generation), the 
maximum biomass of the AM1 strain gradually increased from an OD600 of 0.2 to 1.2. The 
microbial dilutions were then plated on solid media containing methanol and sodium 
formate as the carbon sources. Three individual colonies were selected from each plate, 
resulting in a total of 12 colonies for further subculture. During the subculture process, 
the methanol concentration in the medium was gradually decreased from 90 mM to 
30 mM, while the concentration of sodium formate was increased from 30 mM to 90 mM. 
For each adjustment, 5 mM of sodium formate was added, and 5 mM of methanol 
was removed. This adjustment was continued until the OD 600 value of each subculture 
became stable. At the 30th, 90th, 150th, 250th, and 300th generation (corresponding 
to 15th, 25th, 35th, 55th, and 70th passages, respectively), the maximum OD 600 and 
formate uptake rates were measured, respectively. After 300 generations, the 12 evolved 
lineages showed significant growth on medium containing 90 mM sodium formate and

30 mM methanol. Then the strains from the 12 evolved lineages were plated on solid 
media containing 90 mM sodium formate and 30 mM methanol. Based on morphology, 
one large colony was selected for each evolved lineage and further evaluated for specific 
growth rate under cultivation with either 90 mM sodium formate and 30 mM methanol 
or 120 mM formate.
Measurement of methanol, formate, and 3-HP concentrations in the culture 
medium
To determine the concentrations of methanol, sodium formate, and 3-HP in the culture 
medium or fermentation broth, a subculture of 800 µL was harvested and centrifuged at 
13,000 rpm for 10 min at 4°C. The resulting supernatant was then filtered using a 0.22 µm 
membrane and subjected to high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis as 
described previously ( 36). The HPLC analysis was performed on Wooking K2025 (China) 
equipped with a PDA (K2025DAD, Wooking Corporation, China) and a refractive index 
detector (RID-20A, Shimadzu Corporation, Japan). The analytical procedures were as 
follows: the mobile phase sample volume was 30 µL, with a flow rate of 0.6 mL/min. The 
column temperature was maintained at 65°C and the detector temperature at 35°C.
Measurement of carotenoids from the evolved strain M. extorquens FT3
M. extorquens FT3 was cultivated in Hypho medium containing either 120 mM methanol, 
90 mM methanol and 30 mM formate, or 60 mM methanol and 60 mM formate. Three 
replicates were prepared for each culture condition. After a cultivation period of 4 days, 
the broths were centrifuged at 8,000 × g for 3 min. The resulting pellets were then 
extracted and analyzed according to the method described previously (34).
Determination of 13C-labeled amino acids in the M. extorquens FT3 strain
For the 13C labeling assay, the evolved strain FT3 was cultivated using two different 
carbon sources: 90 mM 13C-labeled sodium formate and 30 mM methanol, and 90 mM 
sodium formate and 30 mM 13C methanol. When the FT3 strain reached an OD 600 of 
0.6, the cells were collected from a 20 mL culture using a percolator with a 0.22 µm 
filter membrane. Protein extraction was performed as previously described with slight 
modifications (37, 38). The collected cells were rapidly frozen using liquid nitrogen and 
then dried in a lyophilizer for 12 hours. 20 mL of boiling water was then added and 
incubated in a water bath at 100°C for 10 min, vortexing three times for approximately 
5 seconds each time. Next, the proteins were precipitated at 0°C for 20 minutes and 
centrifuged twice at 5,000 rpm for 20 min at 4°C. The supernatant was discarded, and 
the cell pellet was hydrolyzed by using 1 mL of 6 M HCl at 105°C for 24 hours. HCl 
was removed using a nitrogen blower, and the hydrolyzed samples were re-dissolved 
in 500 µL of ddH 2O and filtered through a 0.22 µm membrane. For derivatization, 50 
µL of solvent was evaporated and re-dissolved in 50 µL of 25 mg/mL methoxylamine 
hydrochloride in pyridine was added to the samples, which were incubated at 60°C for 30 
minutes and vortexed occasionally. Then, 50 µL of N-methyl-N-trimethylsilyltrifluoroace-
tamide was added, and the samples were incubated at 30°C for an additional 90 minutes. 
After the derivatization reactions, the samples were centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 10 min, 
and the supernatant was subjected to GC-MS. The derivatized amino acid samples 
were analyzed by GC/Q-TOF-MS with an Agilent 5975B/6890N gas chromatography-mass 
spectrometer equipped with an HP-5MS (30 m × 0.25 mm×0.25 µm) chromatographic 
column. The carrier gas used was ultra-high-pressure pure helium, with a flow rate of 
1 mL/min. The injection volume was set at 1 µL in the no-shunt mode. The injection port 
and transfer tube temperatures were kept at 280°C. The temperature gradient for the 
column was as follows: starting at 60°C for 0.25 minutes, with an increase of 5 °C/min 
until reaching 280°C, and holding this temperature for 10 minutes. Mass spectra of amino 
acids were in the mass range of 50–650 m/z at an acquisition rate of 5 spectra/s. The 
ion source temperature was set at 230°C. Finally, the resulting data from the chromato­
graphic mass spectra were analyzed using GC-MS analytical software.

Whole-genome sequencing of the M. extorquens FT3 strain
Genomic DNA was extracted from the evolved strain FT3 using the Wizard Genomic DNA 
Purification Kit (Promega (Beijing) Biotech Co., China). The genomic DNA sequencing was 
performed by Novogene (Tianjing, China) using the PacBio RS II platform. The process 
followed Novogene’s standardized protocols.
Transcriptome analysis
The M. extorquens  AM1 ΔcelAB strain was cultivated on medium with 150 mM metha­
nol as the carbon source. The M. extorquens  FT3 strain was cultivated with medium 
containing either 150 mM methanol or a combination of 120 mM methanol and 30 mM 
formate. Three parallels were prepared for each sample. Cells were collected during the 
middle exponential phase by centrifugation at 4°C for RNA isolation. RNA preparation, 
library construction, and RNA sequencing were conducted by Novogene (Tianjin, China). 
The quality of raw sequence reads was evaluated using the FASTQC software (v.0.10.1). 
Low-quality reads and bases from both ends of raw Illumina reads were removed 
and trimmed using the NGSQC Toolkit (v.2.3.3). BWA alignment software (v.0.7.17) was 
used to align the high-quality reads against the M. extorquens  AM1 reference genome. 
SAM tools software (v.1.9) was used to sort and index the mapping results. Raw read 
counts from the resulting BAM files were obtained using HTSeq software (v.0.11.2). 
The raw-count table was further processed using the DESeq function of the DESeq2
package (v.1.18.1) to obtain gene expression data. Genes with a false discovery rate (FDR) 
P-value < 0.05 and log 2 (fold change) >0.5 or < −0.5 were considered to be differentially 
expressed. Pearson’s linear correlation coefficients between variables were calculated 
using the R package “stats” and plotted using “corrplot. ”
Measurement of NADH and NADPH
The M. extorquens  AM1 ΔcelAB strain was cultivated on medium with 120 mM metha­
nol as the carbon source. The M. extorquens  FT3 strain was cultivated with medium 
containing either 120 mM methanol or a combination of 90 mM methanol and 30 mM 
formate. Three parallels were prepared for each sample. When the strains reached 
an OD 600 of approximately 0.6, 10 mL of cells were collected by centrifugation to 
measure the intracellular concentrations of NADH and NADPH. The collected samples 
were immediately quenched with liquid nitrogen and then dried using a freeze -dryer
at −45°C. NADH and NADPH were extracted, and the concentrations were determined 
as previously described with minor revisions ( 39, 40). Briefly, 1 mL of buffer (300 mM 
KOH, 1% Triton X-100) was added to the samples, followed by incubation in a water 
bath at 85°C for 3 minutes with occasional shaking. The samples were then cooled on 
ice for an additional 3 minutes and centrifuged at 6,000 rpm for 10 minutes at 4°C. 
The supernatant was transferred to a new tube, and the pH was adjusted to 10 with 
potassium perchlorate. After centrifugation at 14,000 rpm for 15 minutes, the superna­
tant was subjected to HPLC analysis. The analyses of NADH and NADPH were performed 
on HPLC equipped with a NovaPac C18 RP column (3.9 × 150 mm, 60 Å, 4 µm, Waters) 
with elution gradient conditions as follows: 0–4 min, 100% mobile phase A; 4–18 min, 
0%–30% mobile phase B; 18–23 min, 30%–100% mobile phase B; 23–25 min, 100% 
mobile phase B; 25–26 min, 100% mobile phase A; 26–50 min, 100% mobile phase A.
Gene overexpression and gene mutation in M. extorquens AM1
The plasmid of pCM80 was used for gene overexpression in the M. extorquens strains. The 
targeted genes were amplified from the genomic DNA of the M. extorquens  strains by 
PCR using the corresponding primers. The PCR products were inserted into the pCM80 
plasmid under the control of the PmxaF promoter using the ClonExpress II One Step 
Cloning Kit (Vazyme Biotech, China). The resulting plasmids were introduced into the 
M. extorquens  strains by electroporation. The M. extorquens  AM1 ΔcelAB strain and SNP 
mutant strains were obtained from the M. extorquens strains using previously described

methods (34). The genotypes of the M. extorquens derivatives were verified by PCR and 
DNA sequencing.
Determining the activities of FDH
The 50 mL of the M. extorquens  AM1 ΔcelAB and M. extorquens  FT3 strains was, respec­
tively, collected by centrifugation when the OD 600 reached 0.8. The cells were washed 
twice, resuspended in 50 mM Tricine-KOH buffer (pH 7.0), and lysed using a French 
pressure cell at 1.2 × 10 8 Pa. After centrifugation for 10 min at 12,000 × g, the superna­
tants were transferred to a new tube, and the final volume was adjusted to 7 mL with 
50 mM Tricine-KOH buffer (pH 7.0). The protein concentration in the crude extract was 
determined using the BCA Protein Assay Kit (Sangon Biotech., China). The measurements 
were performed at room temperature. The reaction system containing 0.5 mM NAD + 
and 1 mg/mL crude extract proteins was used to assay the FDH activity. The formate 
dehydrogenase activity was determined as described previously ( 41). Enzyme assays 
were performed in triplicate.
Determination of the promoter strength using XylE-based experiments
The promoter strengths were determined using XylE-based experiments. The PmxaF and 
Pfdh2 promoters were amplified from the genomic DNA of the M. extorquens AM1 ΔcelAB 
strain, and the PmxaF* and Pfdh2* promoters with SNP mutations were amplified from the 
genomic DNA of the M. extorquens FT3 strain. The PCR fragments were inserted into the 
pCM130 vector to control the expression of xylE. The resulting plasmids were separately 
introduced into M. extorquens AM1. These M. extorquens AM1 strains were cultivated on 
medium containing 120 mM methanol, and the cells were collected when the OD 600 
reached 0.8. The cells were lysed using the One-Shot Press (Constant Systems Cell 
Disruptor, Constant Systems, UK). The debris was discarded by centrifugation, and the 
supernatant was used to detect catechol dioxygenase activity as described previously 
(41). The reaction system, containing 5 mM catechol and 4 mg/mL crude extract proteins, 
was used for the assay of catechol dioxygenase activity. Enzyme assays were performed 
in triplicate.
Fed-batch fermentation of M. extorquens FT3::pCM80-Apr-mcr
The 3-HP synthetic operon was amplified from the plasmid of pYM07 and then inserted 
into pCM80-Apr to generate the plasmid pCM80-Apr-mcr. The plasmid pCM80-Apr-mcr 
was further introduced into the M. extorquens  FT3 strain to generate the M. extorquens 
FT3::pCM80-Apr-mcr strain. The strain M. extorquens  FT3::pCM80-Apr-mcr was initially 
cultivated as a seed culture in a 500 mL flask. When the culture reached an OD 600 of 
approximately 1.0, it was transferred to a 3 L fermenter containing 1.7 L of Choi3 medium 
(5,370 mg/L Na 2HPO4·12H2O, 1305 mg/L KH 2PO4, 450 mg/L MgSO 4·7H2O, 250 mg/L 
(NH4)2SO4, 10 mg/L Na 2EDTA, 1 mg/L FeSO 4·7H2O, 1.4 mg/L CaCl 2·2H2O, 1 mg/L 
MnCl2·4H2O, 0.2 mg/L Na 2MoO4·2H2O, 0.3 mg/L CuSO 4·5H2O, 3.2 mg/L CoCl 2·6H2O, 
4.4 mg/L ZnSO 4·7H2O). The initial fermentation conditions included a temperature of 
30℃, a stirring speed of 500 rpm, and a ventilation rate of 1 L/min. The aeration rate 
(ranging from 1 to 3 L/min) and the stirring speed (ranging from 500 to 800 rpm) were 
adjusted based on the dissolved oxygen level to maintain it above 20%. The initial 
concentration of methanol was 120 mM, while the concentration of sodium formate 
was 21.2 mM. Methanol concentration was monitored using a methanol electrode, and 
the concentration of formate was kept within the range of 8 to 12.7 mM. During the 
fermentation, the pH value was maintained at 6.9 by adding 1M sodium hydroxide for 
about 40 hours. The nitrogen concentration was maintained at 1 to 2 g/L by adding 
ammonium sulfate. After 40 hours, measurements were taken every 6 hours to deter­
mine the OD600, methanol and formate consumption, dry cell weight, and 3-HP titer.

RESULTS
Generating the evolved strains with enhanced tolerance to formate using 
ALE
ALE was employed to evolve M. extorquens AM1 to achieve tolerance to a high concen­
tration of formate. The growth of M. extorquens AM1 is severely inhibited when formate is 
present at concentrations up to 15 mM as the sole carbon source. Consequently, during 
the ALE process, methanol is used as an additional carbon source. M. extorquens  AM1 
ΔcelAB (this deletion can prevent cell aggregation in laboratory cultures) ( 42) was first 
cultivated on 90 mM methanol and 30 mM formate. ALE was then carried out through 
serial transfer every 48 hours. After 10 passages of ALE, the maximum biomass of M. 
extorquens AM1ΔcelAB gradually increased from the optical density (OD 600) value of 0.2 
to 1.2. In subsequent passages, the concentration of formate incrementally increased 
and the concentration of methanol decreased accordingly ( Fig. 1A ). Eventually, the 
evolved strains were able to grow on the medium containing 30 mM methanol and 
90 mM formate, reaching a maximum OD600 of 1.12, which was 5.3 times higher than the 
parental M. extorquens  AM1 ΔcelAB strain ( Fig. 1B). The maximum biomass and formate 
consumption rate of the evolved strains at the 30th, 90th, 150th, 250th, and 300th 
generations were measured by cultivating with 30 mM methanol and 90 mM formate, 
respectively (Fig. 1B and C ). A comparison of the formate consumption rates at the 30th 
and 300th generations revealed an increase from 1.98 mM .h −1 to 3.52 mM .h −1 (Fig. 1C). 
The evolved strains at the 300th generation exhibited a significantly enhanced level of 
biomass and formate consumption rate compared to the parental strain when grown on 
30 mM methanol and 90 mM formate. Therefore, each colony of the evolved strains was
isolated at the 300th generation, and 12 individual colonies (named as the FT1 strain to 
the FT12 strain) were selected for evaluation by cultivating them with 30 mM methanol 
and 90 mM formate, as well as with 120 mM formate.
Among the 12 colonies, the evolved strain FT3 strain exhibited the best performance 
when cultivated on a medium containing either a mixture of 30 mM methanol and 
90 mM formate or only 120 mM formate ( Fig. 1D; Fig. S2). When a mixture of formate 
and methanol was used as the carbon sources, the FT3 strain completely exhausted 
the 30 mM formate within 48 hours, whereas the parental M. extorquens  AM1 ΔcelAB 
strain exhibited a significantly lower consumption rate, with only 30% of the formate 
consumed ( Fig. 1E). The FT3 strain achieved a maximum OD 600 of 0.35 when 120 mM 
formate was used as the sole carbon source, which was approximately three times higher 
than that of the M. extorquens  AM1 ΔcelAB strain ( Fig. 1D). Moreover, when cultivated 
on a medium with methanol as the sole carbon source, the FT3 strain and the M. 
extorquens AM1 ΔcelAB strain exhibited similar biomass accumulation, but the FT3 strain 
displayed a specific growth rate of 0.14 h −1, which was 28% higher than that of the M. 
extorquens AM1 ΔcelAB strain (Fig. 1F). Notably, when cultivated with 120 mM methanol, 
the FT3 strain displayed a darker pink color compared to the M. extorquens AM1 ΔcelAB 
strain ( Fig. S3 ), indicating enhanced synthesis of C 30 carotenoid pigment in the cell 
membrane of the FT3 strain. In addition, when comparing to the carotenoids in the FT3 
strain cultivated with 120 mM methanol as the sole carbon source, the amounts of C 30 
carotenoids in the FT3 strain grown with 90 mM methanol and 30 mM formate, or 60 mM 
methanol and 60 mM formate, increased to 1.86-fold and 2.72-fold, respectively ( Fig. 
S4). This finding indicated that increasing the formate concentration could enhance the 
synthesis of C30 carotenoids in the FT3 strain.
Next, we investigated whether the FT3 strain also performed well when exposed to 
other weak organic acids and alcohols. As shown in Fig. 2, the specific growth rates of 
the FT3 strain when cultivated with 34 mM ethanol, 68 mM 1,2-propanediol, and 36 mM 
pyruvate were 0.111 h −1, 0.072 h −1, and 0.175 h −1, respectively. These rates were 1.98-, 
1.5-, and 2.92-fold higher than those observed for the M. extorquens AM1 ΔcelAB strain. 
The maximum OD 600 of the FT3 strain increased by 37.5% and 42.9% when cultivated 
with ethanol and 1,2-propanediol, respectively (Fig. 2; Fig. S5).

Analyzing the 13C-labeled amino acids in the FT3 strain
To assess the incorporation of formate and methanol into cellular biomass by the FT3 
strain, 13C-labeled method was conducted to analyze the proteinogenic amino acids. 
The FT3 strain was cultivated on media containing two different 13C-labeled carbon 
sources: (i) 30 mM 13C-methanol and 90 mM 12C-formate or (ii) 30 mM 12C-methanol and 
90 mM 13C-formate. When the FT3 strain was grown to an OD 600 value of about 0.6, 
the cells were harvested and subjected to hydrolysis for GC-MS analysis ( Fig. S6). All 10 
detected proteinogenic amino acids, belonging to four groups, were 13C-labeled. These 
included glycine, alanine, serine, glutamate, proline, aspartate, valine, threonine, leucine, 
and isoleucine (Fig. 3). The average carbon labeling ratio of 10 proteinogenic amino acids 
when cultured with 30 mM 13C-methanol and 90 mM 12C-formate ranged from 10.1% 
to 33.7%, which was consistent with the ratio (25%) of 13C-labeled carbon source. When 
cultivated with 30 mM 12C-methanol and 90 mM 13C-formate, the labeled ratios of these 
amino acids were found to range from 59.4% to 67.5%, which was also in line with the 
ratio (75%) of labeled carbon source. Overall, these results suggested that the FT3 strain 
was capable of effectively co-utilizing formate and methanol.
Identification of the FT3 strain as a hypermutant strain with a considerable 
impact on the metabolic pathways
To uncover the mechanism of the increased tolerance and assimilation of formate, a 
comprehensive genomic and transcriptomic analysis was conducted on the FT3 strain. 
The genomic data indicated that the FT3 strain exhibited hypermutations, a trait that was 
different from the previously evolved strains derived from M. extorquens AM1 by ALE (43–
46). A total of 5,551 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were identified in the 
coding sequence (CDS) regions of 459 genes, and 2,053 intergenic mutations and 31

insertion/deletion (Indel) mutations were identified in the genome of the FT3 strain 
(Data set S1). In addition to the proteins with unknown function, proteins with SNPs were 
classified into various pathways, including gluconeogenesis, oxidative phosphorylation, 
the serine cycle, the ethylmalonyl-CoA pathway (i.e., glyoxylate regeneration pathway), 
DNA replication and repair, secondary metabolism, amino acid metabolism, transporters, 
and enzymes involved in co-factor biosynthesis ( Data set S1). The hypermutant property 
of the FT3 strain can be attributed to mutations in the DNA repair and DNA replication 
systems (Data set S1).

These SNPs, occurring within or in the intergenic regions of genes , exhibited 
significant impact on gene transcription. When the FT3 strain was cultivated on 150 mM 
methanol as the sole carbon source, a notable alteration in the transcription profile 
of the FT3 strain was observed in comparison to the M. extorquens  AM1. Our findings 
revealed that 244 genes were upregulated and 2,430 genes were downregulated in the 
FT3 strain ( Fig. S7 ). In the presence of 30 mM formate, the FT3 strain was found to 
exhibit only 244 upregulated genes and 90 downregulated genes ( Fig. S8). It has been 
demonstrated that the majority of mutations are neutral, with only a small number 
conferring a beneficial allele ( 47). Consequently, identifying the pivotal genes involved 
in formate tolerance represented a substantial challenge. In this study, we employed the 
genomic and transcriptomic data to narrow down a list of candidate genes that were 
likely to be involved in formate tolerance and assimilation by identifying those that are in 
the central metabolic pathways.
Mutation of the FocA homologue META1_0287 enhanced the transport of 
formate
A high concentration of formate can inhibit proton transfer across the cell membrane, 
which leads to the inhibition of ATP generation and consequently, the toxicity of 
cells ( 48, 49). To detoxify high concentrations of formate, it is necessary for formate 
to be transported into the cell and subsequently assimilated by the FT3 strain. The 
nitrate-formate transporter FocA and oxalate:formate antiporter have been reported 
to be capable of transporting formate into the cell ( 50, 51). Mutations have also 
been observed in the FocA homologue protein META1_0287 (E5Q) and the oxalate:for­
mate antiporter META1_0992 in the FT3 strain ( Data set S1 ). The transcription level 
of META1_0992 was considerably lower than that of META1_0287 when the FT3 strain
was cultivated with 150 mM methanol. The transcriptional level of META1_0287 in 
the FT3 strain was observed to significantly increase to 3.41-fold in the presence of 
30 mM formate ( Fig. 4 ; Data set S2 ). Based on these findings, it was hypothesized 
that FocA homolog META1_0287 was responsible for the transport of formate into the 
cell in the FT3 strain. To test this hypothesis, the native META1_0287 and its mutated 
META1_0287* were overexpressed in the M. extorquens  AM1 strain. Subsequently, the 
strains were cultivated on the medium with 120 mM methanol as the sole carbon 
source. The strain AM1::pCM80-0287* exhibited a similar specific growth rate to the 
control strain AM1::pCM80, which was slightly higher than the specific growth rate of 
the AM1::pCM80-0287 strain ( Fig. 5A ). The addition of 10 mM formate resulted in a 
shorter lag phase (30 hours) for the strain AM1::pCM80-0287* compared to both the 
strain AM1::pCM80 (60 hours) and the strain AM1::pCM80-0287 (60 hours) ( Fig. 5A ). 
Moreover, the strain AM1::pCM80-0287* reached a maximum OD 600 value of 1.78, which 
was significantly higher than that of the strain AM1::pCM80-0287 and AM1::pCM80 ( Fig. 
5A). These results indicated that the E5Q mutation in the N-terminal of FocA homolog 
META1_0287* played a crucial role in formate tolerance. It has been demonstrated that 
FocA is capable of transporting formate in a pH-dependent manner, with the ability to 
transport formate in both protonated and neutralized forms (52). The presence of 10 mM 
sodium formate resulted in a pH increase from 7.27 to 8.15 within the first 25 hours ( Fig. 
S9), suggesting that formate was transported into the cell in its protonated formic acid 
state, as previously reported (52).
Metabolic pathway of methanol oxidation to formate was significantly affected
The metabolic pathway of methanol oxidation to formate was found to be significantly 
affected. A number of mutations were identified in several regions, including the CDS 
region of the methanol dehydrogenase system MxaS (L135P) and MxcQ (G21K), the PQQ 
synthase PqqCD (I219M), and the formyltransferase/hydrolase complex Fhc (L204F) ( Fig. 
4). Moreover, an intergenic SNP mutation, T 159 to C159, located 159 base pairs upstream 
of the methanol dehydrogenase gene mxaF was found ( Fig. 4). The XylE-based experi­
ment demonstrated that the T 159 to C 159 mutation resulted in a 60% increase in the 
Full-Length Text Applied and Environmental Microbiology
September 2025  Volume 91  Issue 9 10.1128/aem.02560-24 12
promoter strength of mxaF (Fig. 5B ). However, the engineered strain AM1-MxaF* 
harboring C 159 mutation showed no enhancement on formate tolerance ( Fig. S10 ), 
suggesting this mutation may not be related to formate tolerance or formate utilization. 
In comparison to the M. extorquens AM1 grown on 150 mM methanol, the transcriptomic 
data indicated that the transcription of the majority of genes involved in this process in 
the FT3 strain was enhanced, particularly mxaFJGI, mxaD, and pqqA. This suggested an 
increased conversion of methanol to formaldehyde ( Fig. 4; Data set S2 ). However, when 
exposed to 30 mM formate, the transcriptional levels of fae and fhcA were significantly 
downregulated to 0.75- and 0.81-fold, indicating a decreased conversion of

represented in black indicate the fold change in the gene transcription of the FT3 strain compared to the parental M. extorquens  AM1 ΔcelAB strain, which

the presence of 120 mM methanol and 30 mM formate is shown with the data in blue. The data were presented as the average of three replicates. Significant 
differentially expressed genes were defined as having a (FDR) *P <0.05 and **P <0.01.

formaldehyde to formate ( Fig. 4 ). The cultivation of the FT3 strain resulted in the 
increased absorption of formate by the mutated FocA homologue META1_0287* and an 
increase in the cellular formate concentration. Consequently, the conversion of formalde­
hyde to formate was decreased, thereby alleviating the formate stress. The enhanced 
conversion from methanol to formaldehyde and the decreased conversion from 
formaldehyde to formate led to an increased concentration of formaldehyde, suggesting 
that the FT3 strain could exhibit a higher tolerance to formaldehyde. Further investiga­
tion into formaldehyde tolerance also demonstrated that the FT3 strain exhibited 
tolerance up to 10 mM formaldehyde, whereas the M. extorquens  AM1 ΔcelAB strain 
showed tolerance up to 7.5 mM formaldehyde (Fig. S11).
Pathways related to formate metabolism were notably impacted in the FT3 
strain
Formate can be converted to CO 2 or be assimilated into the cell through the 
serine cycle coupled to the ethylmalonyl-CoA pathway. The mutations involved in 
the formate assimilation pathways included the CDS regions of β-ketothiolase PhaA 
(Q168E), methylmalonyl-CoA mutase McmA (N703K), and succinyl-CoA/methylmalonyl-
CoA mutase accessory protein MeaB (L11V). Moreover, the intergenic SNPs were 
observed in the serine hydroxymethyltransferase gene glyA (G205 to A 205), malyl-CoA

120 mM methanol (M) or 90 mM formate (F) in combination with 30 mM methanol (M). The data were presented as the average of three replicates, with standard 
deviations indicated as error bars. Statistical analysis was performed using a two-tailed Student’s t-test (**P < 0.01; ***P < 0.001).

thioesterase gene mclA (G190 to A 190), and fumarase gene fumC (T230 to C 230) ( Fig. 4). 
Transcriptomic data further revealed that most of the genes involved in the formate 
assimilation pathways exhibited enhanced transcription in the FT3 strain grown on 
150 mM methanol, especially for ftfL, glyA, and mtkAB (Fig. 4 ), which are three key 
enzymes involved in the formate assimilation pathway ( 53). These genes were upregula­
ted to 1.73-, 1.36-, and 1.64-fold, respectively ( Fig. 4). Concerning the oxidation of the 
formate pathway, it was observed that SNP mutations occurred in the CDS region of 
the FDH genes of fdh4A (R98H and S142G) and fdh1B (S36A), as well as in the inter­
genic region of the fdh2CBAD operon (Fig. 4). Subsequently, the XylE-based experiments 
demonstrated that the G 136 to T136 mutation located upstream of the fdh2CBAD operon 
had no influence on promoter strength, which was consistent with the transcriptomic 
data ( Fig. S12 ). Notably, the transcription levels of fdh1A, fdh1B, fdh3A, fdh3B, and 
fdh3C in the FT3 strain grown on methanol were all downregulated significantly, with 
expression levels reduced to 0.26-, 0.22-, 0.61-, 0.66-, and 0.63-fold, respectively ( Fig. 
4). In the presence of 30 mM formate, the transcription levels of fdh1B, fdh2A, fdh2B, 
fdh2D, fdh3A, fdh3B, and fdh3C in the FT3 strain were upregulated significantly, whereas 
only fdh4A and fdh4B were downregulated to 0.42- and 0.43-fold, respectively ( Fig. 4). 
Given the enhanced transcription of most of the FDH genes, we investigated whether 
the activity of FDH in the FT3 strain was also elevated. When compared to M. extorquens 
AM1 cultivated with 120 mM methanol, the specific activity of FDH in the FT3 strain 
cultivated with 90 mM methanol and 30 mM formate was 4.75 times higher than that 
in M. extorquens AM1 ( Fig. 5C). As there were no significant changes in the transcription 
levels of the genes involved in the formate assimilation pathway in the presence of 
30 mM formate, we speculated that the enhanced conversion of formate to CO 2 resulted 
in increased carbon loss. This was supported by the previous observation that the 
maximum biomass of the FT3 strain was substantially decreased when cultivated on 
90 mM formate and 30 mM methanol (Fig. 1D).
Interestingly, when exposed to 30 mM formate, two genes coding carbonate 
dehydratases META1_3028 and META1_1418, involved in reversible hydration of dissolved 
CO2 into carbonic acid, showed significant upregulation ( Fig. 4). Therefore, we hypothe­
sized that the FT3 strain utilized these two carbonate dehydratases to facilitate the 
dissolution of CO 2 within the cell, whereby bicarbonate was formed. This can then be 
catalyzed by PEP carboxylase Ppc or propionyl-CoA carboxylase PccAB to synthesize 
oxaloacetate or methylmalonyl-CoA (Fig. 4). Furthermore, the cultivation of the FT3 strain 
in flasks sealed with either parafilm or a rubber plug demonstrated that, compared to 
the flask sealed with parafilm, the growth rate and maximum biomass of the FT3 strain 
increased by 11% and 21.4%, respectively, in flasks sealed with a rubber plug when 
30 mM formate and 90 mM methanol were used as the carbon sources ( Fig. 5D). When 
methanol was used as the sole carbon source, no difference was observed in the FT3 
strain cultivated with flasks sealed with either parafilm or a rubber plug ( Fig. S13). These 
results indicated that the emission of CO 2 from the flask can be prevented by a rubber 
plug, which can be readily dissolved in the cell by enhanced carbonate dehydratase and 
subsequently utilized for intermediate synthesis, thereby improving biomass production.
The enhanced formate oxidation pathway could result in a high production of NADH, 
which could subsequently be converted to NADPH by the membrane-bound NADH/
NADPH transhydrogenase. The mutations were observed in the transhydrogenases PntA 
(I12T) and PntB (D288G) ( Fig. 4). When exposed to 30 mM formate, pntB was found to 
be upregulated to 1.29-fold ( Fig. 4 ). Furthermore, we analyzed the pools of reducing 
equivalents in the FT3 strain. When the FT3 strain was cultivated with 120 mM methanol 
as the sole carbon source, the concentrations of NADH and NADPH were slightly lower 
than those of the M. extorquens  AM1 ΔcelAB strain ( Fig. 5E ). However, when the FT3 
strain was cultivated in the presence of 30 mM formate, the concentrations of NADH 
and NADPH increased to 3.04-fold and 2.54-fold, respectively, in comparison with that 
grown on 120 mM methanol ( Fig. 5E ). Moreover, the concentrations of NADH and 
NADPH in the FT3 strain cultivated with 30 mM formate and 90 mM methanol were 
Full-Length Text Applied and Environmental Microbiology
September 2025  Volume 91  Issue 9 10.1128/aem.02560-24 15
found to be 2.29-fold and 2.35-fold higher, respectively, than those observed in the M. 
extorquens AM1 ΔcelAB strain grown on methanol ( Fig. 5E). These results suggested that 
the production of reduced equivalents was improved in the FT3 strain with the addition 
of formate.
Assessing the genes that conferred tolerance to formate by using an ALE-
inspired overexpression method
Among the top 20 significantly upregulated genes in the FT3 strain in the presence 
of 30 mM formate, two carbonate dehydratase genes ( META1_3028 and META1_1418), 
a transporter gene META1_3027, an RNA polymerase sigma factor ( META1_1261), 
and a transmembrane anti-sigma factor ( META1_1260) were observed ( Data set S2 ), 
which were found to be upregulated to 85.9-, 12.0-, 82.2-, 18.4-, and 32.6-fold, 
respectively. Furthermore, five hypothetical protein genes META1_3029, META1_3458, 
META1_2965, META1_2964,  and META1_0394 were upregulated to 90.3-, 222.7-, 49.8-, 
95.0-, and 7.5-fold, respectively. These genes were then overexpressed in M. extorquens 
AM1, respectively. Derivative strains with overexpression of META1_3027, META1_3028, 
META1_3029, META1_1261, and META1_1418 demonstrated enhanced growth in the 
presence of 10 mM formate compared to the M. extorquens  AM1 strain with empty 
plasmid pCM80, indicating their involvement in formate tolerance ( Table 2 ; Fig. 6 ). 
The strain AM1::pCM80-1261 displayed a maximum OD 600 value of 2.32, followed by 
AM1::pCM80-3027 (OD 600 = 2.08), and AM1::pCM80-3029 (OD 600 = 2.06) ( Table 2 ). 
Compared to the strains with overexpression of a single gene, the superior performance 
of the FT3 strain at elevated formate levels suggested that the capacity to tolerate high 
levels of formate was conferred by the action of multiple genes.
The genes META1_3027 and META1_3028 are assembled as an operon in the genome, 
as are the genes META1_1261 and META1_1260. Based on the results of the over­
expression of individual gene, then, these two operons were further co-expressed 
in M. extorquens  AM1 ( Fig. 6E and F ). The strain AM1::pCM80-1261-1260 failed to 
improve growth in the medium containing 10 mM formate compared to the overex­
pression of the individual gene META1_1261, suggesting that this operon may not 
be involved in formate tolerance ( Fig. 6F ). The specific growth rate of the strain 
AM1::pCM80-3028-3027 was 0.154 h −1 in the presence of 10 mM formate, which was 
higher than that of the strain AM1::pCM80-3028 or AM1::pCM80-3027 ( Fig. 6E; Table 2). 
This indicated that the overexpression of this operon exhibited better performance at 
high concentrations of formate. Furthermore, the native promoter of the META1_3027 
and META1_3028 operon was replaced with the strong promoter Pmxaf to initiate the 
expression. The engineered strain M. extorquens  AM1-PmxaF-3028-3027 demonstrated 
tolerance to 15 mM formate, showing a specific growth rate value of 0.073 h −1 and a 
maximum OD600 value of 1.93 (Fig. 6G). The gene META1_3029 is adjacent to META1_3027 
and META1_3028 (Fig. S14 ), and overexpression of this gene was shown to enhance

tolerance to formate ( Fig. 6B). Consequently, the genes META1_3027, META1_3028, and 
META1_3029 as an artificial operon were overexpressed in M. extorquens  AM1. The 
strain AM1::pCM80-3028-3027-3029 was found to be able to grow on the medium 
containing 15 mM formate, exhibiting a specific growth rate of 0.093 h −1 and reaching 
a maximum OD 600 value of 1.40 ( Fig. 6H). Notably, in the presence of 20 mM formate, 
the AM1::pCM80-3028-3027-3029 exhibited a specific growth rate of 0.07 h −1 and a 
maximum OD 600 value of 0.93 ( Table 2 ). The results obtained from the combination 
of overexpressing the transporter gene META1_3027, the carbonate dehydratase gene 
META1_3028, and the hypothetical protein gene META1_3029 demonstrated a synergistic 
effect, suggesting that these three genes were likely involved in formate tolerance and 
utilization.

FT3 strain as a chassis with mixed methanol and formate to produce reduced 
chemicals of 3-HP
Previously, M. extorquens AM1 was identified as a chassis capable of producing reduced 
chemicals of 3-HP with methanol as the sole carbon source ( 33, 36, 40). In the present 
study, a comparison of the M. extorquens  AM1 strain and the FT3 strain revealed that 
the latter exhibited better tolerance to 3-HP . When exposed to 1,000 mg/L 3-HP , the 
growth rate of the FT3 strain was 0.120 h −1, representing a 1.48-fold higher rate than 
M. extorquens AM1 ( Fig. 7A). Based on the better tolerance to 3-HP and increased pools 
of reducing equivalents in the FT3 strain in the presence of formate, we speculated 
that the FT3 strain was a more suitable chassis for the production of 3-HP . The plasmid 
pCM80-Apr-mcr containing a 3-HP synthetic pathway was introduced into the FT3 strain, 
generating the FT3::pCM80-Apr-mcr strain. The production of 3-HP was quantified when 
the FT3 strain was grown on a mixture of carbon sources with varying ratios of methanol 
to formate. Methanol was used as the sole carbon source, serving as the control. The 
addition of formate at concentrations within the range of 22.5 mM to 60 mM (i.e., a

average of three replicates, with standard deviations indicated as error bars. Statistical analysis was performed using a two-tailed Student’s t-test (* P < 0.05; **P <

reduction in the methanol to formate ratio from 85% to 70%) resulted in a continuous 
increase in 3-HP titer, reaching a range of 110 mg/L to 175 mg/L in flask culture ( Fig. 
7B). The highest titer of 175 mg/L was achieved when the FT3::pCM80-Apr-mcr strain 
was cultivated with 45 mM formate and 105 mM methanol. This titer was significantly 
elevated in comparison to the methanol, which served as the sole carbon source 
(Fig. 7B). Furthermore, fed-batch fermentation was conducted in a 3L biofermentor by 
using mixed carbon sources of methanol (0.3%, wt/vol) and formate (in the range of 
8–12.7 mM). As shown in Fig. 7C , following a cultivation of 98 hours, the maximum 
biomass of the FT3::pCM80-Apr-mcr strain reached 38.9 g/L. After 109 hours of cultiva­
tion, the maximum titer of 3-HP was up to 2.47 g/L. This titer was approximately 14-fold 
higher than the highest titer obtained by shake-flask cultivation and also exceeded 
our previously reported production in the engineered M. extorquens  AM1 strain ( 40). 
The current yield and productivity of 3-HP remain relatively low. Engineering of the 
one-carbon assimilation pathway will be required to further increase the one-carbon 
flow to the target product (40).
DISCUSSION
Formate can be electrochemically converted from CO 2 and represents a promising 
feedstock for biorefinery applications (3–7). Over the past decade, considerable research 
has been conducted to utilize formate as a carbon source for the production of high-
value chemicals ( 15, 28–31, 54). In this study, the ALE strategy was employed to obtain 
an evolved strain FT3 derived from M. extorquens  AM1, which demonstrated enhanced 
tolerance and assimilation of high concentrations of formate. Furthermore, this strain 
was proven to be a more effective chassis for producing 3-HP through the utilization of a 
combined methanol and formate as the carbon sources.
ALE is a frequently utilized methodology for the evolution of M. extorquens AM1 with 
new properties ( 43–46, 55). Typically, these evolved strains exhibit a few SNP mutations 
(43–46, 55). For example, an engineered strain with modified central metabolism that 
employs glutathione as a formaldehyde transporter, instead of the H 4MPT pathway, 
demonstrates four SNP mutations ( 44). Similarly, an evolved strain with high tolerance 
to butanol concentration exhibits only one SNP mutation ( 45). However, this study 
revealed that the evolved strain FT3, which was identified for its tolerance to high 
formate concentration, displayed the hypermutant phenomenon. To our knowledge, this 
represents the first report of hypermutations occurring in M. extorquens  AM1. Genome 
re-sequencing indicated that these hypermutations may be attributed to mutations 
in enzymes responsible for DNA repair and DNA synthesis systems. Hypermutability 
facilitates enhanced ALE fitness and allows for significant advancements across the 
fitness landscape by providing a diverse range of mutations with complex epistatic 
interactions ( 56, 57). However, the hypermutant strains could exhibit disadvantages 
regarding genome stability and adaptive potential. Further evaluation is required to 
ascertain whether the FT3 strain may continue to evolve as a result of mutations present 
in the DNA repair and replication systems. In the FT3 strain, the majority of mutations 
were classified as neutral, while a limited number were identified as beneficial alleles. 
Accordingly, the present study was primarily concerned with investigating the mutations 
involved in methanol and formate oxidation, formate transport, formate assimilation, 
and adjacent pathways. Based on the genomic and transcriptomic data, a number of 
genes were selected for further characterization through ALE-inspired gene manipula­
tion experiments. The results indicated that the high formate tolerance observed in the 
FT3 strain was attributed to the action of multiple genes. The subsequent discussion is 
presented below.
The mutation of FocA has been demonstrated to be important for formate toler­
ance ( 20). In the present study, it was observed that the mutated FocA homologue 
protein META1_0287 conferred tolerance to formate in the FT3 strain by increasing the 
uptake of formate into the cell. Subsequently, the cellular formate can enter either 
the formate oxidation pathway or the assimilation pathway. Previous studies have 
Full-Length Text Applied and Environmental Microbiology
September 2025  Volume 91  Issue 9 10.1128/aem.02560-24 19
demonstrated that enhancing either the formate assimilation pathway, such as through 
the overexpression of the ftfL gene, or the formate oxidation pathway, such as through 
the overexpression or upregulation of the fdh gene, can improve formate tolerance 
(21, 24, 29, 30, 58–60). This study demonstrated that the formate oxidation pathway 
played a more important role in conferring tolerance to formate in the FT3 strain, 
as evidenced by the significant enhancement of formate dehydrogenase activity ( Fig. 
5C), while the transcription of key genes involved in the formate assimilation pathway 
remained unaltered in the presence of formate ( Fig. 4). The addition of formate has been 
demonstrated to significantly enhance the level of reduced equivalents in M. extorquens 
AM1 ( 28). Furthermore, this study revealed that the FT3 strain exhibited an increased 
level of NADH and NADPH when exposed to 30 mM formate ( Fig. 5E). It was postulated 
that the enhanced oxidation of formate resulted in the generation of a greater number 
of NADH, which could be further converted to NADPH by the PntAB enzyme to form 
NADPH. In synthetic formatotrophic bacteria that harbor the reductive glycine pathway, 
it has been demonstrated that enhancing the conversion of NADH to NADPH by PntAB 
is an important factor for growth on formate ( 24). It would be beneficial to investigate 
whether the mutation of PntAB in the FT3 strain plays a similar role in formate tolerance 
and assimilation.
The enhanced formate dehydrogenase activities resulted in a faster conversion of 
formate to CO2, a portion of which can be mobilized by the two carbonate dehydratases, 
META1_3028 and META1_1418, to form bicarbonate and a proton that can be used as 
an intermediate for regulating cellular pH. The direction of formate transportation by 
FocA is regulated by intracellular pH ( 52). It was therefore postulated that the cellular 
pH affected by these two carbonate dehydratases may be related to the transportation 
of formate directed by the mutated FocA homolog META1_0287*. This may explain why 
the carbonate dehydratases META1_3028 and META1_1418 were observed to exhibit 
formate tolerance ( Fig. 6A and D ). On the other hand, the bicarbonate converted 
from CO 2 within the cell can be catalyzed by Ppc or PccAB to produce correspond­
ing metabolites, oxaloacetate or methylmalonyl-CoA. Indeed, enhanced biomass was 
observed when the FT3 strain was cultivated with 30 mM formate in flasks sealed 
with a rubber plug ( Fig. 5D ), suggesting that blocking CO 2 emission can improve 
biomass accumulation. The FT3 strain displayed an improved growth when cultivated 
with 120 mM formate as the sole carbon source, although the maximum OD 600 value 
remained low ( Fig. 1D). It can therefore be posited that enhancing the concentration of 
CO2 and enhancing the CO2 fixation may prove an effective way to improve the biomass 
accumulation in the FT3 strain cultivated with formate as the sole carbon source. It 
has previously been demonstrated that the synthetic formatotrophs are capable of 
achieving enhanced growth when formate and a high concentration of CO 2 or bicarbon­
ate are utilized ( 22, 24). This study presents an additional strategy to modify the native 
formatotrophs to promote growth in high concentrations of formate.
It has been demonstrated that alterations in the composition of the cell membrane 
are crucial for improving resistance to various abiotic stresses ( 61). Hopanoids and C 30 
carotenoids are integral components of the cell membrane in M. extorquens  AM1 ( 62). 
Notably, hopanoids play a pivotal role in maintaining the stability and permeability 
of the cell membrane ( 62). Strains deficient in hopanoids exhibit increased membrane 
permeability, resulting in poor growth ( 63). Recent research has also demonstrated that 
reduced membrane permeability and altered membrane composition are important for 
formaldehyde-acclimated M. extorquens  strains ( 64). In this study, exposure of the FT3 
strain to formate increased the quantity of C 30 carotenoid pigments. The transcriptomic 
data indicated that the transcriptional levels of META1_1817, which is involved in the 
synthesis of the precursor squalene, as well as META1_3665, META1_3670, META1_3663, 
and META1_3664, which are involved in the post-modification pathway of carotenoid 
pigment synthesis ( 62, 65), showed an increase in the presence of 30 mM formate ( Fig. 
S15; Data set S2 ). This finding corresponds with the enhanced C30 terpenoid synthe­
sis ( Fig. S3 ). In M. extorquens  AM1, hopanoids share the common precursor squalene 
Full-Length Text Applied and Environmental Microbiology

with the C 30 carotenoid pigments. Notably, the transcription of the squalene-hopene 
cyclase gene shc (META1_1818), a critical enzyme responsible for hopanoid synthesis, was 
approximately three times higher in the FT3 strain than in the M. extorquens AM1 ΔcelAB 
strain cultivated solely with methanol ( Fig. S15 ; Data set S2 ). Given the significantly 
increased transcription of shc in the FT3 strain, it is reasonable to propose that hopanoid 
synthesis has also increased in the FT3 strain, potentially influencing the permeability of 
the cell membrane to adapt to environmental conditions, which may be related to the 
enhanced formate tolerance.
In Cupriavidus necator  H16, the deletion of the transcriptional regulator PhcA has 
been shown to result in reduced expression of several operons, thereby enhancing 
growth on formate ( 19). Based on this observation, we hypothesized that alterations in 
the expression of certain operons in the FT3 strain would improve the formate toler­
ance. It is well established that sigma factors are involved in genome-wide regulatory 
processes. In our research, we found a significant increase in the transcription level 
of the sigma factor META1_1261 in the FT3 strain, indicating its potential role as a 
regulator of key genes associated with formate tolerance. Indeed, overexpression of the 
META1_1261 gene was found to enhance formate tolerance ( Fig. 6F). META1_1261 and 
the anti-sigma factor META1_1260 were identified as components of an operon. However, 
overexpression of this operon resulted in poor growth in the medium containing 10 mM 
formate compared to the overexpression of individual gene META1_1261 (Fig. 6F). This 
implies that the anti-sigma factor META1_1260 within the operon impairs the function of 
META1_1261. These results suggest that FT3 may have a complex regulatory network 
involved in formate tolerance. Transporters have been shown to relate to formate 
tolerance; for example, an A269T SNP mutation in the bicarbonate transporter SO_3578 
enables it to transport formate, conferring Shewanella oneidensis  with tolerance to 
100 mM formate ( 66). In this study, we observed that overexpression of the sulfate 
transporter META1_3027 can also enhance tolerance to formate ( Fig. 6C ), although 
whether META1_3027 is involved in formate transportation requires further investiga­
tion. In addition, upon exposure to formate, certain genes with unknown functions, 
such as META1_3029, exhibited high levels of transcription and have been confirmed to 
enhance formate tolerance, which warrants further investigation in the future.
Conclusion
In this study, an evolved FT3 strain derived from M. extorquens  AM1, exhibiting a high 
tolerance to formate, was obtained through the application of the ALE strategy. Further 
feeding experiments with 13C-labeled one-carbon sources demonstrated that the FT3 
strain was capable of effectively utilizing methanol and formate. In contrast to previ­
ously reported evolved strains of M. extorquens AM1, the FT3 strain exhibited hypermu­
tations. Furthermore, a combination of DNA re-sequencing, transcriptome analysis, and 
ALE-inspired gene manipulation was employed to investigate the potential mechanism 
of formate tolerance. The elevated tolerance to high concentrations of formate was 
attributed to alterations in metabolic pathways, including those involved in the transport 
of formate, methanol oxidation, formate oxidation, and assimilation pathways. The FT3 
strain, which exhibited a significantly increased synthesis of reducing equivalents in the 
presence of formate and enhanced 3-HP tolerance, was deemed an appropriate chassis 
for the production of reduced chemicals of 3-HP . A 3-HP titer of 2.47 g/L was attained 
through fed-batch fermentation by utilizing the combined carbon sources of methanol 
and formate.
