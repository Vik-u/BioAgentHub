ABSTRACT
Saccharomyces cerevisiaeis an important model eu-
karyotic microorganism and widely applied in fun-
damental research and the production of various
chemicals. Its ability to efﬁciently and precisely con-
trol the expression of multiple genes is valuable
for metabolic engineering. The clustered regularly
interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-
mediated regulation enables complex gene expres-
sion programming; however, the regulation efﬁ-
ciency is often limited by the efﬁciency of pertinent
regulators. Here, we developed CRISPR-mediated
protein-tagging signal ampliﬁcation system for si-
multaneous multiplexed gene activation and repres-
sion in
S. cerevisiae.By introducing protein scaffolds
(SPY and SunTag systems) to recruit multiple copies
of regulators to different nuclease-deﬁcient CRISPR
proteins and design optimization, our system am-
pliﬁed gene regulation efﬁciency signiﬁcantly. The
gene activation and repression efﬁciencies reached
as high as 34.9-fold and 95%, respectively, being
3.8- and 8.6-fold higher than those observed on the
direct fusion of regulators with nuclease-deﬁcient
CRISPR proteins, respectively. We then applied the
orthogonal bifunctional CRISPR-mediated transcrip-
tional regulation system to regulate the expression of
genes associated with 3-hydroxypropanoic acid pro-
duction to deduce that CRISPR-associated regulator
recruiting systems represent a robust method for si-
multaneously regulating multiple genes and rewiring
metabolic pathways.
INTRODUCTION
Saccharomycescerevisiae is a prominent cell factory for in-
dustrial applications (1,2). Gene expression regulation in a
precise, robust manner is essential for diverse cellular pro-
cesses. In metabolic engineering, accurately regulating the
expression of key metabolic pathway-associated genes is
pivotal. For gene regulation, the gene editing system in-
volving clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic
repeats(CRISPRs)hasbeenadaptedbytargetingnuclease-
deficient CRISPR proteins to the transcription regulation
region (3). CRISPR activation (CRISPRa) or interference
(CRISPRi) can be achieved by fusing nuclease-deficient
CRISPRproteins,suchasnuclease-deficientCas9(dCas9),
withactivationorrepressiondomains,respectively.Theeas-
ily programmable single guide RNA (gRNAs) endows this
CRISPR-mediatedsystemtheabilitytotargetalmosttoany
region of the genome with high efficiency and specificity.
When coupled with gRNAs libraries, CRISPR-mediated
systems can prove to be a valuable tool for genome-wide
studies of gene regulation.
Several CRISPRa/i systems have been developed to
date. Direct fusion of the effector protein with activation
or repression domains is a frequently used approach for
CRISPR regulation. Various transcription repressors, such
asmyc-associatedfactorX-interactingprotein1(Mxi1)and
the Kr¨uppel-associated box domain of Kox1 (4), have been
reported to be fused with dCas9 for CRISPRi. Similarly,
the fusion of activation proteins, such as virion protein 64
(VP64) and p65 can enhance gene expression when target-
ingdCas9totheregionsincloseproximitytothepromoter
(4,5).
The fusion of only one transcription effector often can-
not achieve efficient transcriptional regulation; thus, to in-
creasetheeffectivenessoftranscriptionalregulation,hybrid
transcription effectors with several activation or repression
domains have been designed. The hybrid tripartite activa-
tor, VP64-p65-Rta (VPR) was designed to fuse with dCas9
and the RNA expression was shown to be 22- to 320-fold
greater than dCas9-VP64 in mammalian cells (6). A study
tested variants of several repressor domains in yeast, and a
tripartite repression domain engineered with TUP1, MIG1
and UME6 also amplified the repression effect by 5-fold
(7–10). However, the number of direct fusion proteins re-
mains limited, which restricts the regulation efficiency. In
general, transcription initiation occurs via a series of se-
quential steps involving the coordinated action of several

cruiting more transcription effectors to the promoter re-
gion can potentially increase transcriptional activation or
repression.Forthispurpose,thedevelopmentoftools,such
as RNA (12,13) or protein scaffolds (14,15), has been re-
ported.Forexample,theproteinscaffoldSunTagwascom-
bined the dCas9 system to recruit multiple VP64 activator
for the activation signal amplification. Such systems have
been mainly developed in mammalian cells and also in a
fewotherspecies( 16,17).Despitetheimportanceof S.cere-
visiaeasakeymodelorganismandamicrobialcellfactory,
a comprehensive protein scaffold-mediated CRISPR regu-
lationsystemshavenotbeenreported .Inaddition,onlysin-
gle direction of regulation was reported using protein scaf-
folds,detailedcharacterizationofproteinscaffold-mediated
CRISPR system for simultaneous gene repression and ac-
tivation, which is crucial for multiplexed gene regulation,
particularly inS.cerevisiae, is much needed.
Herein, we constructed two protein scaffold-mediated
signalamplificationsystems,namelySPYandSunTag,and
combined them with different nuclease-deficient CRISPR
proteins, dCas9 and dCpf1, respectively, to establish a si-
multaneous gene activation and repression system inS.
cerevisiae. The SunTag system (14), consists of multiple
copies of the 19 residues GCN4 peptide and a single-chain
variable fragment (scFv) of the anti-GCN4 antibody as
a tag. It has been combined with CRISPR for base edit-
ing and gene regulation as well as to induce methylation
and demethylation in mammalian and plant cells (18–22).
The peptide chains can recruit multiple copies of tagged
proteins for signal amplification. In addition, we expressed
SpyCatcher/SpyTag inS.cerevisiae and determined its ca-
pability to recruit effectors. SpyTag (13 residues peptide)
and SpyCatcher (the 116 residues complementary domain)
are constructed by splitting the CnaB2 domain from the
fibronectin-binding protein FbaB fromStreptococcus pyo-
genes, and they can spontaneously reconstitute to form a
covalent isopeptide bond under mild physiological condi-
tions when simply mixed (23,24). The SpyTag/SpyCatcher
system has been widely used for protein assembly (25), but
it has not been applied as yet for signal amplification in
S.cerevisiae.OurCRISPR-mediatedprotein-taggingsignal
amplification systems system was systematically optimized
by engineering transcription effectors and peptide arrays.
In comparison with the direct fusion of dCas9 with tran-
scription effectors, this refined system showed much better
activationandrepressionefficiency.Moreover,weusedthis
system to simultaneously regulate multiple gene targets in
a metabolic pathway to improve 3-hydroxypropanoic acid
(3-HP) production.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Strains and cultivation conditions
Escherichia colistrains Trans5/H9251and Trans2-Blue (Beijing
TransGene Biotech, CO., LTD, China), which was used
for constructing and propagating plasmids, were grown in
Luria–Bertani media (10 g/l NaCl, 10 g/l tryptone, and 5
g/l yeast extract) supplemented with 100 mg/
l ampicillin
at 37◦C. S. cerevisiaeCEN.PK2-1C was used as the initial
strain for CRISPR regulation system construction and 3-
HPproduction.YeaststrainswerecultivatedinYPDmedia
containing 1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, and 2% glucose,
and recombinantstrains weregrown on syntheticcomplete
(SC) dropout media comprising 0.5% ammonium sulfate,
0.17% yeast nitrogen base (BBI Life Science Corporation,
China),completesupplementmixture(withouturacil,histi-
dine, or leucine) (Sunrise Science Products, United States),
and 2% glucose. For selection, 250 mg/lh y g r o m y c i nB
(HygB, Beijing DingGuo Changsheng Biotechnology Co.,
Ltd, China) was used.
Plasmids and strain constructions
Featuresofnuclease-deficientCRISPRproteinswerelisted
inSupplementaryTableS1.AllrecombinantandgRNAor
crRNAplasmidsarelistedinSupplementaryTablesS2and
S3, respectively. Primers used for gene amplification and
gRNA/crRNA construction were synthesized by GeneWiz
(Tianjin, China). Recombinant plasmids were constructed
by traditional restriction digestion/ligation or the Gibson
assembly method, and gRNA/crRNA plasmids were con-
structed using the Golden Gate assembly approach (26).
Phanta Max Super-Fidelity DNA Polymerase was pur-
chased from Vazyme Biotech Co. Ltd. (Nanjing, China).
Restriction enzymes, T4 ligase, and Gibson reagent kits
were obtained from Thermo Scientific (Waltham, MA).
Yeast strains were transformed using the LiAc method; re-
combinant strains are listed in Supplementary Table S4.
For reporter gene expression, the integration plas-
mid pRS304-LEU2-GFP, comprising theLEU2promoter,
eGFP gene, andPGK1 terminator, was constructed using
the Gibson assembly method. To assess the repression and
activation efficiency of CRISPR system to other promot-
ers, theLEU2promoter was replaced to weak or inducible
promoters GAL7p, HED3p, CYC1p and RNR2p and the
strong promoters HHF2p, PGK1p, ENO2p and ENO1p
fromKluyveromyceslactis,respectively.Theplasmidstrains
were then linearized and integrated into theTRP1locus of
CEN.PK2-1C.
dCas9 was obtained in PCR reaction using the plas-
mid pTPGI-dCas9 as a template (27). The transcriptional
regulatory domains Med2 (full length), Med2t (156–258
fused with 380–431aa), MIG1(481–504aa), and TUP1(73–
129aa) were amplified from the genome of CEN.PK2-1C.
Codon-optimized dCpf1, VPR,a n dMxi1 were synthe-
sizedbyGenScript(Nanjing,China).ToconstructpIYC04-
dCas9-Med2 and pIYC04-dCpf1-MIG1, activator or re-
pressor encoding gene was fused to dCas9 or dCpf1 by
GSGSGSGS or GSSKLGGSGGS linker, respectively, and
thenassembledtoyeast2 /H9262plasmidpIYC04underthecon-

MIG1fragmentofpIYC04-dCpf1-MIG1wasthenreplaced
by BamHI/SalI digestion to construct dCas9 and dCpf1,
respectively, with different transcriptional regulatory do-
mains.ToconstructpIYC04-NLS-dCas9 /dCpf1-2× NLS-

The plasmid pSH42H, comprisingSNR52p, gRNA and
crRNAscaffoldsequences,and SUP4t,wasusedtoexpress
gRNA and crRNA, respectively. The plasmids were con-
structedbyinversePCRusingpSH424( 28)asthetemplate
and primers containing a 20-bp sgRNA sequence. To con-
struct multiple gRNA and crRNA arrays plasmids, indi-
vidual gRNA and crRNA arrays were amplified and then
assembled to pSH42H using the Golden Gate assembly
methodthrough BsaIdigestionandligation.dCas9 /dCpf1-
and gRNA/crRNA-containing plasmids were transformed

To construct strains with malonyl-CoA sensing cir-
cuits, pJfapO-fapR (29) comprising the GAL1p(7)fapO
promoter,eGFP, PGK1 terminator, andTEF1 promoter-
fapR, was transformed into yeast. Further, to construct
strains with the ability to produce 3-HP, the gene encoding
malonyl-CoA reductase (MCR) fromChloroflexus auran-
tiacus was cloned into the 2/H9262plasmid pYX424 under the
control of theTEF1promoter andCYC1terminator using
BamHI/EcoR1digestionandligation,followedbytransfor-
mation into yeast.
gRNA design
gRNAs were designed using the Benchling website (https:
//benchling.com). As previously reported (13,30), the high-
estlevelsofactivationwereachievedbytargetingthe ∼200-
bp region upstream of the transcription starting site (TSS)
for CRISPRa. Futher, the effect was the most prominent
between the TSS and 200-bp region upstream of the TSS
for CRISPRi, and gRNAs targeting either the template or
non-template DNA strand for the promoter region were
designed. For dCpf1, minimal off-target effect, and higher
score and distribution of targeting sites were considered.

RESULTS
Evaluation of the activation domain for CRISPR activation
Activator strength is the most important factor affecting
the activation. To evaluate transcription activator perfor-
mance,GFPdrivenbythe LEU2promoterwasinsertedinto
the TRP1locus. VP64-p65-Rta, a tripartite activator VPR
system, is a frequently used for CRISPR transcription hy-
brid activator and the activation efficiency was shown to
be better than VP64 (6). In our previous study, we found
that the subunit of the RNA polymerase II mediator com-
plex Med2 could also activate gene expression and that the
activation efficiency was higher than that of VPR and en-
dogenousactivatorGal4onfusionwithaprokaryotictran-
scription factor in S. cerevisiae(32). We therefore fused
VPR, Med2, and truncated Med2 (aa156–258 + aa380–
431, dMed2), which only contains the activation domain
of Med2 (33), with dCas9 from Streptococcus pyogenes,
followed by comparison of activation efficiencies (Figure
1A). We found that dCas9-VPR activated the expression
by 2.1-fold, and dCas9-dMed2 showed similar activation
efficiency. Further, dCas9-Med2 demonstrated the high-
est activation efficiency; dCas9-Med2 activated the expres-
sion by 2.8-fold, which was 29.5% higher than that shown
by dCas9-VPR (Figure1A). These findings indicated that
Med2indeedshowedbetteractivationefficiencythanVPR.
Creation of protein scaffolds to enhance CRISPR-mediated
activation
Gene transcription level is strongly regulated by the copy
numberoftranscriptionfactorsthatisrecruitedtothepro-
moters (11,34). To assess the effect of recruiting multiple
copies of transcriptional regulators, two protein scaffolds
SunTagandSPYsystemswereintroducedintheCRISPRa
system.TheSunTagsystem( 14),consistsof10or24copies
ofthe19residueGCN4peptideandasingle-chainvariable
fragment (scFv) of the anti-GCN4 antibody as a tag.
The GCN4 peptide were fused with dCas9 via a
GGGSGGGS linker (Figure1B). For efficient nuclear im-
port, one SV40 nuclear localization signal (NLS) was in-
serted in the N-terminal of dCas9 and two NLSs were in-
serted in the N-terminal of SunTag, similar to a previously
reported design (14). dCas9-SunTag could recruit multiple
scFv-Med2 fusion proteins via antigen–antibody interac-
tions. On activation efficiency assessment, we found that
dCas9-Med2 activated the expression ofGFP driven by
the LEU2promoter by 2.8-fold, whereas dCas9-10× Sun-
Tag and dCas9-24× SunTag activated the expression by
4.2- and 3.6-fold, respectively, with these values being 46%
and 27% higher than that shown by dCas9-Med2, respec-
tively.ThesedatavalidatedthattheSunTagsystemwasable
to successfully amplify activation efficiency (Figure1B).
However, the activation efficiency of dCas9-24xSunTag ap-
peared to be lower than that of dCas9-10xSunTag. Sim-
ilar to our work, a previous study reported that dCas9-
10xSunTag was shown to have a similar maximal activa-
tion in gene expression compared with dCas9-24xSunTag
(14). Herein, although dCas9-SunTag-Med2 system ampli-
fied the activation, comparing with dCas9-Med2, the im-
provement is not very significant.
We then evaluated whether Spycatcher/Spytag can func-
tion in the CRISPR regulation system. Considering that
the application of Spycatcher/
Spytag in S. cerevisiaehas
not been previously reported, we first determined the ef-
fect of Spycatcher/Spytag. The dCas9 was fused with
SpyTag via a GGSGSGLQ linker (Figure1C). One and
two SV40 nuclear localization signal (NLS) was inserted
in the N-terminal of dCas9 and SpyTag, respectively, to
ensure efficient nuclear import. 2, 4 or 6 copies of re-
peated SpyTag were fused with dCas9 and Med2 was
fused with SpyCatcher. We found that dCas9-SPY acti-
vated the expression ofGFP by 6.9-, 6.4- and 7.9-fold, re-
spectively. In comparison with dCas9-Med2, the activation
efficiency of dCas9-6× SPY was 3.3-fold higher (Figure
1C). These results were consistent with the flow cytom-
etry data (Figure1D). These findings demonstrated that
both SunTag and Spycatcher/Spytag amplified the activa-
tion efficiency of CRISPR-mediated gene expression, and
the Spycatcher/Spytag system was more effective than the
SunTag system.
To demonstrate the applicability of Spycatcher/Spytag
(Figure 2A), we then investigated the activation efficiency
onGAL7,HED1 andCYC1promoters.dCas9-2× SPYor
dCas9-6 × SPY was found to activate gene expression by
34.9-,20.7-,and3.6-fold,respectively,andthesevalueswere
3.8-, 4.4- and 4.1-fold higher than those shown by dCas9-
Med2,respectively(Figure 2B–D).Thetranscriptionallevel
was also correlated with the change of fluorescence (Figure
2E).ThedCas9-2 × SPYanddCas9-6 × SPYsystemsthus
exhibitedgoodactivationefficienciesaswellasapplicability
with different promoters.
dCas9-mediated repression signal amplification system
Basis the aforementioned results, we subsequently con-
structed a CRISPRi signal amplification system. As Sp-
Cas9 has been well characterized in yeast (7), we compared
the transcription repression efficiency of dCas9-TUP1 (do-
mainofTUP1,73–129aa)anddCas9 /TUP1combinedthe
Spytag/Spycatcher or SunTag system. The yeast general
repressor protein TUP1 represses transcription by form-
ing a complex with Ssn6; the Ssn6–Tup1 complex is re-
gardedasaglobalrepressorconsideringitsabilitytorepress
multiple families of genes (7,35,36). With theHHF2 pro-
moter,weobservedthatdCas9-TUP1repressedtheexpres-
sion by only 38%, and both the CRISPRi signal amplifica-
tionsystemsshowedhigherrepressionabilitiesthandCas9-
TUP1. dCas9-24× SunTag and dCas9-6× SPY showed
better repression efficiency, repressingGFP expression by
73% and 63%, respectively, being 2.2- and 1.6-fold higher
than that shown by dCas9-TUP1 (Figure3
). These results
indicatedboththeCRISPR-mediatedSunTagandSPYsys-
temsachievedbetterrepressionthandCas9-TUP1,withthe
24× SunTagsystemshowingthebestrepressioneffect.The
dCas9-SunTag system also worked effectively with other
promoters (e.g.PGK) (Supplementary Figure S1).

Construction of an efficient orthogonal bifunctional
CRISPR-mediated transcriptional regulation system
To develop an orthogonal bifunctional CRISPR-mediated
transcriptional regulation system, nuclease-deficient
CRISPR proteins that can recognize different PAM
sequences are required. dCpf1 from Lachnospiraceae
bacterium ND2006, favoring 5
′-TTTV-3′ PAM sequences
(dCpf1),hasbeencharacterized( 37)andusedforCRISPR
regulation or genome editing inS. cerevisiae(38,39). We
thus chose dCpf1 to construct an orthogonal bifunctional
CRISPR-mediated transcriptional regulation system.
ConsideringthehighactivationefficiencyshownbydCas9-
SPY, we built a gene repression system orthogonal to
dCas9-SPY. dCpf1-SunTag-TUP1 was constructed and
its inhibitory effect was determined. However, although
the repression efficiency of dCpf1-10 × SunTag-TUP1
and dCpf1-24 × SunTag-TUP1 were higher than that of
dCpf1-TUP1, only 43% and 44% repression was achieved,
respectively (Supplementary Figure S2), and flow cytom-
etry results also confirmed the differences of repression
efficiency of dCpf1-TUP1, dCpf1-10× SunTag-TUP1 and
dCpf1-24 × SunTag-TUP1 is not very big (Supplementary
Figure S3). To improve repression efficiency, we evaluated
and compared the inhibitory effects of the repression
domains of TUP1, Mxi1 and MIG1 (4,7,40). dCpf1-Mix1
and dCpf1-MIG1 showed better repression efficiency than
dCpf1-TUP1,whichisconsistentwithpreviousfindings( 4)
and both downregulatedGFPexpression by approximately
50% for HHF2 promoter (Figure 4A). The repression
ratio of dCpf1-MIG1 can reach to 70% when targeting
to ENO2 promoter (Supplementary Figure S4). We then
selected MIG1 as the repression domain to establish a
repressor recruiting system. Relative to dCpf1-MIG1,
dCpf1-10× SunTaganddCpf1-24 × SunTagshowedmuch
higher inhibition ofGFP expression, reaching up to 77%
and 76%, respectively (Figure4B). Flow cytometry results
showed similar trend (Figure4C). We also examined the
repression of GFP expression driven by the ENO2 and
ENO1 promoters fromKluyveromyces lactis(Figure 5A–
C). The repression efficiency can reach to 95% and 86%,
respectively, using dCpf1-24× SunTag-MIG1, being 7.9-
and2-foldhigherthanthatshownbydCpf1-MIG1,respec-
tively (Figure5B and C). The transcriptional level was also
down-regulatedsignificantlybydCpf1-24 × SunTag-MIG1
and it is correlated with the change of fluorescence (Figure
5D). These findings demonstrated that highly efficient
repression could be achieved by dCpf1-24× SunTag.
ToverifytheorthogonalityofthetwoCRISPR-mediated
systems, a strain containing two reporter proteins was con-
structed: eGFP driven by theHHF2 promoter and
mKate
driven by theLEU2promoter were inserted into theTRP1
andLEU2locus, respectively. The dCas9-SPY- and dCpf1-
SunTag-containing plasmids were then transformed into
the strain to simultaneously regulatemKate and eGFPex-
pression.mKateexpressionwasupregulatedby3.2-foldand
eGFP expression was downregulated by 69%, comparable
the single CRISPR-mediated system (Supplementary Fig-
ureS5).ThisindicatedthatthetwoCRISPR-mediatedsys-
tems were orthogonal, with no crosstalk between them.
Combinatorial regulation of 3-HP production using
CRISPRa/i signal amplification systems
To detect CRISPRa/i orthogonality and application, as
a proof-of-concept study, we used CRISPRa/i signal am-
plification systems to regulate the metabolic pathway re-
sponsible for 3-HP production. 3-HP, a non-chiral, opti-
cally inactive, three-carbon molecule, is one of the top 12
value-addedchemicalsfrombiomassselectedbytheUSDe-
partment of Energy (41). 3-HP is produced from glucose
with malonyl-CoA as an intermediate via the catalysis of

CoA carboxylase (Acc1) and is essentially used for fatty
acid synthesis. Malonyl-CoA availability directly affects 3-
HP production; therefore, it is important to increase the
synthesis of malonyl-CoA and decrease its consumption
in the cytoplasm.ACC1 overexpression can evidently in-
crease 3-HP production (43). Furthermore, the fatty acid
synthetase system (FAS1/FAS2) catalyzes the synthesis of
long-chain saturated fatty acids using malonyl-CoA as a
substrate (44,45). Therefore, we first chose these genes as
targetsforCRISPRregulation.Inadditionto3-HPproduc-
tion, we detected malonyl-CoA availability using our pre-
viously constructed malonyl-CoA biosensor (fapO/fapR
system) to control eGFP expression (Figure 6A) (29).
FAS1/FAS2 repression increased malonyl-CoA availabil-
ity. Individually repressingFAS1 or FAS2 using dCpf1-
SunTag-TUP1, the fluorescence intensity was observed to
increaseby24.1-and30.0-fold,respectively.Simultaneously
repressing FAS1and FAS2enhanced the fluorescence in-
tensity by 33.0-fold, whereas only 2.6-fold increase in the
fluorescence intensity was detected on using dCpf1-TUP1
to inhibitFAS1and FAS2(Figure 6B). In comparison to
usingdCas9-Med2foractivating ACC1expression,dCas9-
6 × SPY showed better activation efficiency, as the fluores-
cence intensity of the malonyl-CoA biosensor was 2.2-fold
higherthanthatinthedCas9-Med2strain(Figure 6C).Fur-

dCpf1-24 × SunTag-TUP1 was used to repressFAS1and
FAS2, which was 35% higher than the improvement ob-
served on using dCpf1-TUP1 (Figure6D). We found that
therepressionof FAS1/FAS2bydCpf1-SunTag-MIG1pro-
duces a higher level of 3-HP than dCpf1-SunTag-TUP1,
but it decreased the growth significantly (Supplementary
Figure S6). Considering that significant downregulation of
FAS1/FAS2have negative impact to cell growth, here we
used dCpf1-24 × SunTag-TUP1 forFAS1/FAS2 regula-
tion.
To determine if a combinatorial effect was achievable by
CRISPRa/i systems, simultaneous upregulation ofACC1
and downregulation ofFAS1 and FAS2 were performed
(SPY + SunTag) (Figure6C and D). Compared to when
onlyFAS1andFAS2expression was repressed, the fluores-
cence intensity of the malonyl-CoA biosensor was 1.1-fold
higher and 3-HP production level was further increased by
19%. In addition toACC1, FAS1and FAS2, we also per-
formed simultaneous regulationARG3gene. Arg3 is asso-
ciated with the biosynthesis of the arginine precursor cit-
rulline, and our recent study has reported that the deletion
of ARG3increased the accumulation of 3-HP (46). The re-
sults showed that combingFAS1, FAS2and ARG3 down-
regulationand ACC1upregulation,theproductionof3-HP
was further increased by 16%, demonstrated the advantage
of our CRISPR-based system (Supplementary Figure S7).
DISCUSSION
S. cerevisiaeis a very important microbial cell factory for
produce numerous chemicals (47,48). Although CRISPR
system has been developed for gene regulation in yeast
and high regulation levels have been achieved for some
specific promoters, the regulation efficiency remains rel-
atively low for many genes when using either single or
few activators or repressors. In the present study, we es-
tablishedtwoCRISPR-mediatedtranscriptionalregulation
systems that recruited multiple copies of regulators for effi-
cient transcription programming. Gene activation and re-
pression abilities were significantly increased irrespective
of the choice of promoters. Gene expression was activated
by as high as 34.9-fold and the repression efficiency as
much as 95%, with these values being 3.8- and 8.6-fold
higher than those observed on the direct fusion of regula-
tors with nuclease-deficient CRISPR proteins, respectively.
These data demonstrated that the CRISPR-mediated regu-
latorrecruitingsystemisapowerful,robusttooltoamplify
regulator efficiency.
SunTag in combination with CRISPR has been applied
for gene editing, gene regulation, DNA methylation or
demethylation, and RNA demethylation in mammalian
cells and plants ( 19–22
,49,50), its application in yeast
has not been reported. Moreover, orthogonal CRISPR-
mediated protein-tagging activation and repression sys-
tems have not been developed as yet. Although SPY has
been widely used for protein assembly (15,25), the effects
of different numbers of SpyCatcher/SpyTag for CRISPR-
mediated signal amplification remain to be determined.
HereintheSpyCatcher /SpyTagproteinscaffoldswereused
and systematically compared for CRISPR-mediated signal
amplification for the first time. We found that tag number
was not positively correlated with regulation efficiency. In
theSPYsystem,2and6copiesofrepeatedSpyCatcherwere
more effective than 4 copies, with the regulation efficiency
being much better than that of 10× or 24× SunTag. Be-
sides,intheSunTagsystem,10copiesoftheGCN4peptide
showed higher activation efficiency, while 24 copies of the
GCN4 peptide showed better gene repression ability. It is
still unclear how regulators that are recruited to the pro-
moterregioncanachievethehighestregulationlevel.Itap-
pears that the efficiency is affected by various factors, such
as promoter characteristics and location and binding affin-
ity of gRNA/crRNA. We also performed transcriptome
analysis to determine impact of this system on global gene
expression and found that the expression of a small num-
ber of endogenous genes were altered regardless whether
theycontaineddCas-TFsorCRISPR-basedsignalamplifi-
cationsystems(SupplementalFigures8,9andSupplemen-
talRNAseqData).WhenusingdifferentgRNA,thesignifi-
cantlychangedgeneswerealsochanged.Wespeculatedthat
this may be caused by off-targeting of the dCas proteins.
Previously,theactivationefficiencybasedondCas9-VPR
and the inhibition efficiency based on dCpf1-Mxi1 can
reach to 4.5∼12-fold and 75%∼95%, respectively, for dif-
ferent promoter inS. cerevisiae(7,38). Here, we compared
the regulation efficiency of transcription factors and cou-
pled the transcription factors with SPY and Sun Tag sys-
tems. The optimized dCas9-SPY and dCpf1-SunTag regu-
lation systems are able to achieve 3.6∼34.9-fold activation
andnear-completerepression,respectively,onpromotersof
different strengths. This suggests that the signal amplifica-
tionsystemwehaveconstructedfurtherrefinesthegenereg-
ulation tools inS. cerevisiae. As anticipated, different re-
pression or activation domains showed different repression
oractivationefficiencies,respectively.Ciurkot etal. recently
demonstrated that Mxi1 and MIG1 enabled better down-
regulationrelativetootherrepressiondomains( 37,38).Our
result was consistent with their finding, as even we found
thattherepressionefficiencyofMIG1andMxi1wasbetter
thanthatofTUP1.Inaddition,wefoundthatMed2showed
betteractivationefficiencythanVPR.Med2isacomponent
of the mediator complex, and its presence may result in the
recruitment of mediator and other core components of the
transcription machinery more directly, consequently lead-
ing to better activation efficiency. Based on the opmization
of transcription effectors, protein scaffolds, and CRISPR
proteins,aneffectiveorthogonalCRISPR-mediatedsystem
should comprise dCas9-SPY-Med2 for transcriptional ac-
tivation and dCpf1-SunTag-MIG1 for transcriptional in-
terference. Finally, as a proof-of-concept study, we demon-
strated that our orthogonal system was stably maintained
and that combinatorial regulation of 3-HP production was
achievable via orthologous regulation of gene expression.
To summarize, we developed and optimized two
CRISPR-mediated signal amplification systems inS. cere-
visiae, which showed good orthogonality and significantly
amplified regulatory signals. Then we assembled these two
CRISPR modules together and applied them to regulate
a metabolic pathway. This system considerably improved
gene regulation efficiency, and thus, we believe it should be
valuable for both metabolic engineering and fundamental
studies.
