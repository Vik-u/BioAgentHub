The carbonylative transformation of ethylene oxide (EO) into methyl 3-
hydroxypropionate (3-HPM) is a key process for the production of 1,3-
propanediol (1,3-PDO), which is currently viewed as one of the most
promising monomers and intermediates in polyester and pharmaceuticals
industry. In this work, a homogeneous reaction system using commercial
Co
2(CO)8 was ﬁrst studied for the carbonylation of EO to 3-HPM. The
catalytic behavior was related to the electronic environment of N on
aromatic rings of ligands, where N with rich electron density induced a
stronger coordination with Co center and higher EO transformation. A
reaction order of 2.1 with respect to EO and 0.3 with respect to CO was
unraveled based on the kinetics study. The 3-HPM yield reached 91.2% at only
40
°Cb yC o 2(CO)8 coordinated with 3-hydroxypyridine. However, Co-
containing colloid was formed during the reaction, causing the tough
separation and impossible recycling of samples. Concerning the sustainable
utilization, Co particles immobilized on pre-treated carbon nanotubes (Co/
CNT-C) were designedvia an in situreduced colloid method. It is remarkable
that unlike conventional Co/CNT, Co/CNT-C was highly selective toward the
transformation of EO to 3-HPM with a speciﬁc rate of 52.2 mmol· g
−1
Co · h−1,
displaying a similar atomic efﬁciency to that of coordinated Co2(CO)8. After
reaction, the supported Co/CNT-C catalyst could be easily separated from the
liquid reaction mixture, leading to a convenient cyclic utilization.

Introduction
Since the ring-opening carbonylation of epoxide in alcohol
solvent has high atomic economy, it is very attractive to prepare
downstream high value-added products using epoxide as the
reactant via catalytic technique (Ocampo and Dolbier, 2004).
Among the most commonly used epoxides, ethylene oxide (EO)
could be obtained as a petrochemical product in excess capacity
by industrial production. It also becomes a promising raw
material to produce methyl 3-hydroxypropionate (3-HPM)
through carbonylative conversion, with the subsequent
hydrogenation product 1,3-propanediol (1,3-PDO) as one of
the most expected industrial products for new polyester (PTT)
and medical intermediates (Lv et al., 2010; Rajendiran et al., 2018;
Wen et al., 2018; Xu and Wu, 2019). No matter how, the
industrial path for perspective 3-HPM and 1,3-PDO required
the key carbonylative transformation of EO with high efﬁciency
and selectivity, which was, however, greatly challenging until
current days.
In the past decades, carbonyl metallic salts have been used as
operatable homogeneous catalysts for carbonylation of epoxides.
In fact, researchers have reported in detail on the ring expansion
and ring-opening carbonylation of epoxides (Suresh et al., 2021).
However, complicated homogeneous reaction systems were
dominantly used with metastable metal carbonyls with
unsatisﬁed product yields. The early work of Lee and Alper
(2004) designed a new Co
2(CO)8/A(6,7-dihydro-5,8-
dimethyldibenzo [b,j]-1,10-phenanthroline)/PhCH 2Br catalyst
to synthesize aliphatic polyesters via alternating
copolymerization of propylene oxide and CO, with 55% yield
of atactic polyhydroxybutrate (PHB). While homogeneous
reactions were carried out using phosphorus ligands in the
carcinogenic benzene under 900 psi, Rowley et al. (2007 )
reported a special bimetallic [(CITPP)Al(THF)
2]+[Co(CO)4]−
catalyst efﬁcient in transforming epoxides to β-lactone and
subsequently succinic anhydrides via one-pot double
carbonylation. The rates of both epoxide and lactone
carbonylation were suggested independent of CO pressure and
are ﬁrst-order in the catalyst concentration. They also conﬁrmed
an opposite solvent effect for the different carbonylation
processes.
In fact, Lewis acids as a kind of special ligands coordinating
with metal centers were also frequently applied in the epoxide-
related reactions. Dunn et al. (2016) reported an improved
synthesis of poly (3-hydroxypropionate) (P3HP) from ethylene
oxide and CO through the intermediateβ-propiolactone. The
bimetallic [Lewis acid]+[Co(CO)4]− catalyst was conﬁrmed to be
suitable for an optimized carbonylation yield.Maruyama et al.
(2022) also reported a selective and quantitative
cyclodimerization of an epoxide with a carbonyl compound
by Lewis acid–catalyzed processes, where the ring opening of
EO was involved as theﬁrst step. In a recent work,Zhao et al.
(2021) used a series of N,P-ligand –cooperated
[LCo(CO)3]+[Co(CO)4]− to catalyze EO (hydromethoxy
carbonylation) into 3-HMP and proposed a cooperative
reaction mechanism by [Co(CO) 4]− and its counter cation
[LCo(CO)3]+ (L = Ph 2PN(iPr)PPh2). The yield of 3-HPM
largely depended on the type of ligands forming complexes
with Co2(CO)8, and the ion-pair complexes behaved more
excellently than the neutral ones.
No matter how, the research progress of Co-based
catalysts has stagnated in the past 5 years, and relevant
reports still focus on the carbonyl cobalt in a homogeneous
reaction system. Although the selectivity for 3-HPM is better,
the reaction condition is harsh and in need of thoughtful
operation due to CO dissociation and the oxidation of Co
0.
Co2(CO)8 used as a catalyst is metastable in air and needs to be
properly preserved during p reparation, storage, and
transportation. On the other hand, the separation process
is complex, and the homogeneous metal catalyst cannot be
fully recovered and reutilized in a simple way, which is not
conducive to the sustainable and recycling of resources.
Therefore, it is necessary t o develop a more stable and
durable catalyst system to replace Co
2(CO)8 in advance. In
addition, the reaction kinetics of carbonylation of EO to 3-
HPM lacks researches in depth and requires further
discussion.
Over the years, many studies have been carried out on the
carbonylation reaction via heterogeneous reactions, such as
hydroformylation of ole ﬁns and hydroesteri ﬁcation of
epoxides by supported noble metals ( Li et al., 2003a ; Li
et al., 2003b; Liu et al., 2009; Liu et al., 2013). Compared
with other supports, carbon materials have attracted more
attention because of their easilyc o n t r o l l e ds u r f a c es p e c i a l t y
and chemical structure. In a ddition to its outstanding
electronic conductivity, carbon materials also exhibit the
strong adsorption of CO with manually adjusted surface
acidity acting as Lewis acid and Brönsted acid (Kainulainen
et al., 1997), which possibly facilitated the immobilization of
Co centers as a potential substitution of coordinated
Co
2(CO)8.
In this work, Co 2(CO)8 was ﬁrst used to catalyze the
carbonylative transformation of EO to 3-HPM. The reaction
parameters including the dosages of reactants; the cooperated
ligands and CO pressure were optimized to understand the
chemical kinetics of EO carbonylation. In order to promote
separation efﬁciency and sustainable utilization, Co particles
supported by pre-treated carbon nanotubes (Co/CNT-C) were
synthesized via an in situ reduced colloid method. It is
necessary to mention that the Co/CNT-C sample was
selective toward the transformation of EO to 3-HPM with a
similar atomic efﬁciency to that of Co
2(CO)8 cooperated with
3-hydroxypyridine. The key factors for the enhanced catalytic
performances were interpreted by combining the initial
properties of Co/CNT by using the conventional
impregnation method.

Materials and experimental
methodology
Materials
Co2(CO)8, pyrazole, 3-hydroxypyridine, and other ligands
were purchased from Macklin (A.R.). Ethylene oxide (EO) in
tetrahydrofuran (THF) (3.0 mol/L) was purchased from Energy
Chemical Co., Ltd. Carbon monoxide with a purity of 99.99% was
commercially available and supplied by Shandong Dazhan Nano
Materials Co., Ltd. All other reagents were of analytical grade and
used as received.
Pre-treated carbon nanotubes (abbreviated as CNT) were
used as the supporting material and were preliminarily treated by
concentrated HNO
3 aqueous solution at 120°C for 2 h. The
treated CNT was washed with distilled water until the
solution was neutral and used as supporting materials after
drying overnight.
A solution of 20 wt% Co/CNT-C was synthesized by anin
situ reduced colloid method, and the process was as follows. A
certain amount of sodium lauryl sulfate (SDS), Co(NO
3)2·6H2O,
and oleic acid with a molar ratio of 10:100:1 were added in water
in the presence of 1 g CNT at room temperature. The Co mass
loading was kept at 20 wt%. After stirring for 30 min, fresh
NaBH
4 aqueous solution (1 mg/ml) was dropped into the
aforementioned mixture with a molar ratio of NaBH4 to Co2+
as 1:1. The sample powder was obtained after centrifugation,
washed, and dried at 90°C. The supported sample went through
two-step thermal treatment: calcination at 400°C in air for 3 h
and subsequently in H2/Ar (v/v = 20/50) at 350°C for 3 h and
denoted as Co/CNT-C. An additional Co/CNT-I reference was
prepared by incipient wetness impregnation method by
impregnating the treated CNT in the aqueous solution of
Co(NO
3)2 and aging for 16 h. The following synthesis process
(centrifugation, drying, and two-step thermal treatment) was
similar to that of Co/CNT-C.
Characterizations
Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was performed
using a FEI Tecnai G2 F30 electron microscope at an acceleration
voltage of 120 KV. Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR)
spectroscopy was carried out on a Bruker Vertex 80v FT-IR
spectrometer. The speciﬁc surface area and pore structure of the
samples were investigated using N
2 physical adsorption/
desorption at −196°C using an automatic volumetric sorption
analyzer (Quantachrome, Autosorb-iQ-C). X-ray diffraction
(XRD) was carried out on a Shimadzu 7000S diffractometer
with Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.5418 Å), with a scanning rate of 3
o/
min in range of 10o–80o. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS)
was operated on the ESCALAB ™ 250Xi (Thermo Fisher
Scientiﬁc, United States) using the X-ray excitation source of
Al Kα. The charge correction is based on C1s peak at 284.6 eV.
H2 temperature–programmed reduction (H2-TPR) was carried
out using Quantachrome ChemBET 3000 Chemisorber with the
gas ﬂow rate of 30 ml/min. The reduction process was carried out
by increasing the temperature from 50°C to 800°C at a heating
rate of 10°C/min.
Carbonylation of ethylene oxide
The carbonylative transformation of EO was carried out in a
50 ml stainless steel autoclave equipped with a magnetic stirrer,
temperature control system, and pressure sensing device. In a
typical experiment, a certain amount of Co
2(CO)8 and a ligand
were mixed with the methanol and EO solution in the autoclave.
The aforementioned operation was done in a homemade glove
box ﬁlled with N
2 to keep the Co2(CO)8 stable. The autoclave was
then tightened under N2 and purged with carbon monoxide three
times to evacuate the residual N2 in the reactor. Afterﬁlling the
autoclave with CO to a desired pressure, the mixture was heated
to a certain temperature (30 °C–100°C) under stirring at
800 rpm min−1. After maintaining the reaction for a certain
period of time, the reactor was cooled down to room
temperature and the CO gas was vented off in a fume hood.
The reaction mixture was homogeneous and transparent in red-
brown. All the catalyst was dissolved in the solution after
reaction. It is impossible to separate the catalyst from the
reaction mixture by centrifug ation. Herein, before further
analyzing the reaction mixture by GC, two independent
steps were necessary for the separation of catalyst and
products. First of all, the reaction mixture was treated
continuously by ﬂowing O
2 at room temperature for 2 h.
Purple deposition was observed after the oxidation
treatment, and the supernatant liquid became light orange.
In the second step, column chromatography was used. An
internal standard method was used for quantitative analysis
with toluene as the standard. The product mixture was analyzed
by gas chromatography using a GC (Agilent 7890B) equipped
with a hydrogen ﬂame ion detector (FID) and a capillary
c o l u m n H P - 5 ( 3 0m × 0 . 3 2m m × 0 . 2 5μm). Products were
also identiﬁed using a gas chromatography–mass spectrometer
(Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc Trace1300-ISQ LT, United States).
The conversion rate of EO and the selectivity of methyl 3-
hydroxypropionate (3-HPM) are calculated by the following
equations:
Conversion of EO/equals

where n0,EO represents the initial mole number of EO; nt,EO
represents the molar amount of EO after reaction for a certain
time t; and ni is the produced mole number ofi (product).

Results and discussion
Carbonylative transformation of ethylene
oxide
The carbonylative transformation of ethylene oxide (EO)
was catalyzed by using the cobalt catalyst in the presence of
CO. Methanol was used in excess as both solvent and reactant.
Compared with Co2(CO)8 as catalyst, inorganic salts such as
Co(OAc) 2 and Co(NO3)2 displayed poor EO conversion of
only 2.3% and 2.9% (Table 1, Entry 1–2), respectively. Also, no
methyl 3-hydroxypropionate (3-HPM) was detected in the
reaction mixture. The invalid catalytic performances of the
inorganic salts should be resulted from the failure
coordination between Co and the ligand ( Xu and Wu,
2019). If the Co
2(CO)8 w a su s e da st h ec a t a l y s t ,t h eE O
conversion easily reached 56.5% at 40 °Ci n6 M P aC O
pressure (Table 1, Entry 3) with 95.8% selectivity toward 3-
HPM, in the absence of any lig and. For better catalytic
activity, the in ﬂuences of ligands were studied at ﬁrst, as
listed in Table 1 (Entry 4 and 8–13). A variety of N-donor
ligand were used as doping ligands with Co 2(CO)8 for the
carbonylative transformation of EO. Among all the tested
ligands, 3-hydroxypyridine could be used as a most efﬁcient
one with 98.5% selectivity toward 3-HPM at 92.6% EO
conversion under only 40
°C.
In fact, Co2(CO)8 coordinated with the N-donor ligands to
form Co-centered complexes in different paths depending on the

speciﬁc electronic environment. Cobalt has an empty d-orbital
and is easily complexed with the ligand by lone pair electrons on
N. The nucleophilicity of a particular N atom in these ligands
determines their interaction with Co as well as the subsequent
catalytic performances. Compared to pyridine, the -OH group on
the pyridine ring of 3-hydroxypyridine resulted in rich electron
density on the aromatic ring due to p–π conjugated effect. The
lone pair electrons on N may accounts for a stronger interaction
between N and Co atoms in the complexes. The N-groups on
pyrazole and imidazole with theπ
6
5 structure are similar to that
on the pyridine ring, and the position of an additional−NH
group further inﬂuences the electronic environment on the
pyrrole ring. It can be revealed that the catalytic performances
of Co
2(CO)8 largely depended on the electronic environment of
N atoms on the aromatic rings. In fact, proton transfer between
cobalt carbonyl and the N-containing compounds was
commonly reported by researchers ( Kristjansdottir et al.,
1991). Zeng et al. (2021) also assumed that an acid –base
neutralization easily happened between the HCo(CO)
4 with 3-
hydroxypyridine. It was thus inferred that a positive interaction
may exist between the N-donor with rich electron density and the
Co center, correlated to the better EO transformation. The much
lower EO conversion via Co
2(CO)8 in the presence of 1,10-
phenanthroline may be caused by the steric hindrance to
coordinate with the Co center atoms. Triphenylphosphine was
also used as a typical P-donor for comparison, which was less
active and selective for 3-HPM compared to most of the N-donor
ligands. Liu et al. (2007)suggested that appropriate N-containing
compound easily interrupted the Co-Co bond in Co
2(CO)8 to
form the active Co (CO)−
4 anion. Other research work also
conﬁrmed that acidic compound generated from the
alcoholysis of carbonyl cobalt salt easily resulted in undesired
ethers. Herein, N-donor ligand, especially the 3-
hydroxypyridine, acted as base additives stabilized the catalyst
and partially neutralized the catalyst acidity, inhibiting the
etheriﬁcation by-products (Liu et al., 2006; Gorbunov et al.,
2019; Zeng et al., 2021).
Under such circumstance, transformation of EO was further
optimized by Co
2(CO)8 in the presence of 3-hydroxypyridine.
The experimental data suggested that the increase of CO pressure
under the same temperature correlated with very slightly
increases of EO conversion and 3-HPM selectivity (Table 1,
Entry 5–7). The EO conversion and product selectivity change
as a function of the Co/EO molar ratio was also studied, as shown
in Figure 1A. The EO conversion was only 2.4% with the Co/EO
ratio of 0.1/15, and most of the product was 1,2-dimethoxyethane
(selectivity > 99%) as a result of nucleophilic addition without
any participation of CO molecules (Kim et al., 2006). Both the EO
conversion and 3-HMP selectivity grew logarithmically along
with the Co/EO ratio. The EO conversion reached 92.6% with
98.5% 3-HPM selectivity at Co/EO of 1/15. Further increasing
the ratio of cobalt catalyst, the selectivity of 3-HPM decreased
while 1,2-dimethoxyethane (2.8%) was produced with trace
amount of 1,1-dimethoxyethane (1.0% selectivity), although
the EO conversion was maintained. It was suggested that CO
molecules could be inserted into the skeleton of carbon chains to
form 3-HPM only if the catalyst dosage kept in an appropriate
Co/EO range.
The inﬂuence of reaction temperature was also investigated,
as illustrated in Figure 1B. The EO conversion displayed a
FIGURE 1

reaction temperature. Reaction condition: 6 MPa CO for 4 h; Co/3-hydroxypyridine = 1:2; and Co/EO = 1/15, balanced with methanol, 1,1-C4H10O2:
1,1-Dimethoxyethane, and 1,2-C4H10O2:1,2-Dimethoxyethane.

parabolic trend with the temperature, and 84.6% EO could be
successfully transformed at only 30°C under 6 MPa CO with
96.8% selectivity toward 3-HPM. The catalytic performance
maximized at 40 °C, while the subsequent increasing of
temperature induced the steadily decease of both the EO
conversion and 3-HPM selectivity. The selectivity of by-
product 1,2-dimethoxyethane increased to 20.9% at 100
°C. At
lower temperature ( <60°C), the nucleophilic reaction was
facilitated between EO and MtOH with the increasing
temperature (Zeng et al., 2021 ). However, it is a common
sense that the catalytic performance increases until the kinetic
equilibrium, only if a stable catalyst, was in use (except for a
third-order reaction). Herein, it is inferred that the as-formed
complexes by Co
2(CO)8 and N-donor ligand may encounter
thermal decomposition under higher reaction temperature.
Kinetics of ethylene oxide carbonylation
To the best of our knowledge, few researches were reported
concerning the chemical kinetics for EO carbonylation, which is
essential to sufﬁciently understand the catalytic performances. In
order to understand the key reaction factors and the kinetics of
EO carbonylation, the concentration of EO changing as a
function of reaction time at different temperature was studied,
as shown inFigure 2A.
FIGURE 2

relationship betweenlnrEO and lnpCO for the EO carbonylation using Co2(CO)8. Reaction condition: 35°C–50°C, 6.0 MPa CO, 800 rpm for 4 h, Co/3-
hydroxypyridine = 1:2, and Co/EO = 0.2/15, balanced with 16 ml methanol, if not speciﬁed.
Frontiers inChemistry frontiersin.org06
Luo et al. 10.3389/fchem.2022.945028
The conversion of EO was kept at 10%–30% by adjusting the
conditions to make a precise estimation of the reaction order and
other kinetic parameters. The EO was steadily consumed during
the reaction and its concentration monotonously decreased with
the reaction time. A higher reaction temperature in the range of
35
°C–50°C resulted in the faster transformation of EO as
indicated by the lower EO concentration detected under the
same reaction time. The reaction data was subsequentlyﬁtted by
the zero-order,ﬁrst-order, and second-order reaction models in
Figure 2B and Supplementary Figure S1 (supporting
information). The corresponding R
2 and rate constant (kA) for
each linear relationship are listed inSupplementary Table S1.A
much higher R2 approaching 1 based on the experimental data
suggested the reaction order concerning EO was approximately
2. The reaction constant rapidly increased with the temperature,
conﬁrming the much accelerated reaction rate under higher
temperature in the range of 35 °C–50°C. For better
interpretation, the reaction rate equation can be written in
terms of EO concentration and CO pressure as Eq. 1. The
inﬂuences of methanol on the reaction rate could be ignored
in Eq. 1, since methanol is used as both reactant and solvent in
excessive quantity.
rEO /equals− dcEO
dt /equals kAcα
EOPβ
CO (1)
The parameter kA is the rate constant with respect to EO,
while α and β represent the reaction orders with respect to EO
and CO. To obtain the reaction order of EO (α), CO pressure was
kept sufﬁcient and consistent at 6.0 MPa. Herein, the term
concerning the CO pressure ( Pβ
CO) can be viewed as a
constant value during the reaction. The simpliﬁed Eq. 2 can
be expressed as follows:
rEO /equals kAcα
EOPβ
CO /equals Kcα
EO (2)
lnrEO /equals lnK + αlncEO (3)
The reaction order (α) in terms of EO was thus obtained by
the slope of a linear relationship between the logarithm of EO
concentration and the logarithm of the reaction rate (Figure 2C).
The mathematics ﬁtting result suggested an apparent reaction
order of 2.1 with respect to EO, further conﬁrming the previous
ﬁtting results.
rCO /equals kCOcα
EOPβ
CO /equals K′ Pβ
CO (4)
lnrCO /equals ln K′ + βlnpCO (5)
The reaction order (β) in terms of CO can be detected based
on Eqs 4 ,5 under low EO conversion (super ﬂuous EO
concentration with nearly consistent quantity during reaction).
As revealed by the slope oflnr
CO vs. lnpCO in Figure 2D, the
reaction order with respect to CO was 0.3. The low reaction order
of CO suggested the weak dependency of the reaction rate with
CO pressure. The pressure of CO in process was found to have a
limited effect on the catalytic activity for carbonylation compared
with the EO concentration.Kramer et al. (2006)reported the
excellent production ofβ-lactones producedvia carbonylation at
only atmospheric CO pressure. Even for the CO inserting into the
cobalt-alkyl bond process, Church et al. (2006) reported an
independent reaction rate of CO pressure over the range
considered. These phenomena may account for the very slight
variation of EO conversion as the CO pressure changes (Table 1,
Entry 4–7).
According to the aforementioned investigation on kinetics,
the differential rate equation could be written in the following
form:
r
A /equals− dcA
dt /equals kAc2

The activation energy (Ea) of the catalytic system reﬂected
the necessary energy barrier to activate the reactant molecules
and can be viewed as a parameter describing the catalytic
efﬁciency ( Joshi et al., 2018 ; Nazimov et al., 2021 ).
According to the Arrhenius equation, the Ea based on
Co2(CO)8 using 3-hydroxypyridine as a ligand can be
estimated. The linear relationship between lnkA and the
reciprocal of T in K is shown in Supplementary Figure S2 .
The Ea value calculated by the slope of the Arrhenius curve is
62.9 kJ/mol. It is necessary to mention that such value was
occasionally similar to the reported energy barrier for
disproportionation of Co
2(CO)8 to [Co(MeOH)6][Co(Co)4]2
in methanol under carbonylation reactions ( Mirbach and
Mirbach, 1985 ). It is inferred that the formation of Co-
centered complex may become an indispensable course for
an efﬁcient EO transformation.
For better conﬁrmation, the solid catalysts before and after
reaction were characterized by FT-IR spectra. It has to be noted
that separation of the catalyst from the reaction mixture was
indeed a tough task before any other analysis of the products. The
cobalt complex was uniformly dissolved in the liquid and a
seemingly homogeneous solution was obtained after reaction,
where metal colloid was generated as conﬁrmed by the Tyndall
phenomenon (showing a characteristic light path) inFigure 3A.
Colloidal Co-containing particles may exist in the reaction
mixture.
It is impossible to separate the catalyst directly by
centrifugation or column chromatography. Herein, an
additional re-oxidation step was operated to recycle the
cobalt-containing composition. The fresh liquid after reaction
was subsequently treated by theﬂowing O
2 for 2 h continuously
to oxidize the Co colloid into Co-containing deposition
(Figure 3B). The TEM images of the transparent solution in
Figure 3A displayed the well dispersed particles as shown in
Figure 3B-I, indicating the as-formed Co colloidal particles
protected by organic compounds. The under-layer deposition
was also collected and tested by TEM and EDX analysis.
Amorphous CoO
x was detected as a main composition
(Figures 3B-II,C).

FT-IR spectra of the fresh mixture after reaction without and
with oxidation treatment were displayed inFigure 3D. Infrared
spectroscopy is one of most useful methods for characterizing the
presence of different bands. The dominant peaks of -OH
stretching and -CH deformation vibration at approximately
3,400 cm
−1 and 692 cm−1 were observed in all samples ( Li
et al., 2012; AlOmar et al., 2016). The adsorption peaks at
1,644 cm−1 and 1,724 cm−1 originated from the aromatic
skeleton vibration and the stretching vibration of the C=O
bond in the coordinated cobalt catalyst (Xie and Wan, 2018),
while the peak at 1,888 cm−1 suggests the presence of Co(CO)−
4
species, which disappeared rapidly after 1-h oxidation. After
oxidation, ]C-O = 1,050 cm−1 attributed to the C-O stretching
vibration (Qiu et al., 2021) became apparent while peak situated
at 1,888 cm −1 disappeared, con ﬁrming the possible
decomposition of Co (CO)−
4 species and the variation of
functional groups after oxidation and separation procedures.
No matter how, the high efﬁciency of Co2(CO)8 collaborated
with 3-hydroxypyridine happened at the expense of pseudo-
homogeneous reaction with untoward separation of the reaction
liquid. It makes the separation of the metal catalyst and the
recycle more difﬁcult to be operated with considerable cost,
which is also a big concern for the industrial production unit.
Research works focusing on the carbonylative transformation of
different chemical compounds by supported catalysts were also
studied in recent years. However, tough reaction conditions
including high temperature and pressure were requisite for
better EO conversion and 3-HPM selectivity. The leaching of
metal species was also one of the challenges during the liquid-
phase heterogeneous reactions. Considering thein situ formed
Co colloid within the reaction process as well as the potential
advantages of the easily controlled carbon surface, a speciﬁc
sample with cobalt active centers supported by CNT were herein
synthesized via an in situreduced Colloid method and denoted as
Co/CNT-C. A reference synthesized by conventional
Impregnation was also synthesized for comparison and
denoted as Co/CNT-I.
It is remarkable that compared to the poor EO conversion by
Co/CNT-I (7.2%), EO conversion of 33.7% could be reached
using Co/CNT-C by thein situreduced colloid method. The EO
conversion was 77.5% in the presence of Co
2(CO)8 with 3-
hydroxypyridine as co-catalyst at the same condition. The

selectivity toward 3-HPM was 92.5% by Co/CNT-C and slightly
higher than that using Co2(CO)8. Concerning the excessive Co
content used in the Co2(CO)8 system, the speciﬁc rate based on
per gram Co per hour was calculated, as displayed inFigure 4A.
The Co/CNT-I synthesized by conventional impregnation was
only 13.3 mmol· g−1
Co · h−1, while Co2(CO)8 and Co/CNT-C had
close speciﬁc rates. The speciﬁc rate by supported Co/CNT-C was
52.2 mmol.g−1
Co.h−1 and even higher than that by Co 2(CO)8
(49.6 mmol.g−1
Co.h−1). The better capacity to transform EO
molecules by supported Co/CNT-C in terms of the same
amount of Co centers could be disentangled. It has to be
mentioned that the Co/CNT-C after reaction could be
conveniently separated by centrifugation as illustrated in
Figure 4B. The up-layer liquid was transparent with very light
yellow, and colorless solution could be obtained and injected into
GC for precise analysis after simpleﬁltration. Meanwhile, the
reaction mixture using Co/CNT-I by conventional impregnation
method displayed a common metal leaching phenomenon as
revealed by the yellow solution inFigure 4C. The advantageous
stability of Co/CNT-C during reaction could be unraveled
preliminarily.
For better information, the FT-IR spectra of different Co/
CNT-C and precursors during the synthesis are studied in
Figure 5A to understanding the formation of surface
functional groups on these samples. Nitric acid–treated CNT
was used as the supporting material. The adsorption peak at
1,640 cm
−1 was ascribed to the aromatic skeleton vibration in the
main structure of CNT. After HNO3 treatment, large amount of
carboxyl species was generated as revealed by the C-O stretching
vibration and O-H deformation vibration at with adsorption
peak at 1,400 cm
−1. The deposition of Co particles caused the
obvious decreased ratio of the later adsorption peak, suggesting
the decreasing number of oxygenated groups during metal
loading. Our previous research con ﬁrmed the possible
consumption of surface oxygenated groups during tight metal
loading (Luo et al., 2017; Luo et al., 2020). After the two-step
thermal treatment, the adsorption peaks in the reduced Co/CNT-
C were further exhausted.
The N
2 adsorption–desorption curves of CNT and supported
Co/CNT (Figure 5B) displayed the typical type IV isotherms,
suggesting the maintained mesoporous structure after Co
loading. Compared with the initial surface area of CNT
(310.14 m
2/g), the surface areas of Co/CNT-I and Co/CNT-C
decreased to 221.8 and 204.6 m2/g, respectively. It could be
attributed to the blocking of pores during the loading and
growth of Co particles. Concerning the greatly differed
catalytic performances of Co/CNT-I and Co/CNT-C, the XRD
patterns in Figure 5C gave a clear evidence of the distinctive
structures by different synthesis. Large amount of Co and CoO
coexisted in Co/CNT-I, while both the diffraction peaks of Co
and CoO became broadened in the Co/CNT-C, suggesting the
smaller crystal sizes of Co-containing particles in such sample.
The TEM image of Co/CNT-C is displayed inSupplementary
Figure S3to understand the surface dispersion of Co. Co particles
existed as small black dots (Supplementary Figure S3A) on the
surface of CNT. There was not any clear aggregation of Co
particles. The HAADF-STEM EDX-elemental mapping of the
Co/CNT-C also suggested the high dispersion of Co species on
the detected area. It is also remarkable to note that Co
0 was more
readily enriched on the surface of Co/CNT-C and accounted for
44.3% of the total surface Co species by the Co 3d XPS core level
(Figure 5D ). In the Co/CNT-I reference, only 20.6% Co
0
dispersed on the surface. The much lower H2 consumption by
Co/CNT-C (2,500 μmol/g) than Co/CNT-I (3815 μmol/g)
during H 2-TPR ( Figure 5E ) further con ﬁrmed the
accumulation of oxidative Co species in the Co/CNT-I. The
combination results of XRD and XPS suggested a higher
dispersion of Co particles with more Co
0 sites exposed on the
surface, which may correlated with the faster reaction ratevia
Co/CNT-C samples as reported by many carbonylation research
works using supported metal catalysts (Xu et al., 2011; Zhang,
2012; Ibrahim and Denmark, 2018; Wang et al., 2021). The
Co/CNT-C was further tested as a recycle catalyst for the EO
carbonylation. After three reaction cycles, the conversion of EO
in Figure 5F were still kept at 27.4% with the stabilized high
selectivity of 3-HPM (92.1%). The discussion about Co/CNT-C
suggested that it is a stable catalyst with nice speciﬁc rate based on
the same Co atomic efﬁciency of Co2(CO)8 while avoiding the
costly and complicated separation/post-treatments based on the
metastable Co2(CO)8 system.
Conclusion
In this work, carbonylative transformation of EO was
investigated using commercial Co 2(CO)8 in a homogeneous
system to produce 3-HPM. The reaction parameters including
dosages of reactants, cooperated ligands, and CO pressure were
optimized to understand the chemical kinetics of EO
carbonylation. The reaction rate was interpreted as second-
order in EO concentration and less sensitive to the CO pressure.
However, Co-containing col loid was generated during the
reaction, causing the tough separation process before any
further chemical analysis. Concerning the impressive
separation and sustainable ut ilization problems caused by
the homogeneous reaction proc ess, colloidal Co particles
were directly supported on pre-oxidized CNT (Co/CNT-C)
via an in situ reduced colloid method. Greatly improved EO
conversion was observed via Co/CNT-C, if compared with
conventional Co catalyst. The better activity was ascribed to
the high dispersion of Co particles with good Co
0 surface
exposure and suitable amount of Co 3+ as Lewis acid sites.
The speciﬁcr a t eb a s e do np e rg r a mC op e rh o u rvia Co/
CNT-C was 52.2 mmol.g−1
Co.h−1, although the macroscopical
EO conversion still needs work in progress. The Co/CNT-C
sample was highly selective toward 3-HPM with selectivity of
Frontiers inChemistry frontiersin.org10
Luo et al. 10.3389/fchem.2022.945028
92.5% and a similar atomic ef ﬁciency to that of Co2(CO)8
cooperated with 3-hydroxypyr idine. Most important of all,
the immobilized Co particles on Co/CNT-C enabled the
facile separation and recycling for potential applications of
EO carbonylation.
