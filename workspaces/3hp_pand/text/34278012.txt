ABSTRACT  
Syngas, which contains large amount of CO
2 
as well as H
2 
and CO, can be convert to acetic acid chemically or 
biologically. Nowadays, acetic acid become a cost-effective nonfood-based carbon source for value-added 
biochemical production. In this study, acetic acid and CO
2 
were used as substrates for the biosynthesis of 3- 
hydroxypropionic acid (3-HP) in metabolically engineered Escherichia coli carrying heterogeneous acetyl-CoA 
carboxylase (Acc) from Corynebacterium glutamicum and codon-optimized malonyl-CoA reductase (MCR) from 
Chloro fl exus aurantiacus . Strategies of metabolic engineering included promoting glyoxylate shunt pathway, 
inhibiting fatty acid synthesis, dynamic regulating of TCA cycle, and enhancing the assimilation of acetic acid. 
The engineered strain LNY07(M*DA) accumulated 15.8 g/L of 3-HP with the yield of 0.71 g/g in 48 h by whole- 
cell biocatalysis. Then, syngas-derived acetic acid was used as substrate instead of pure acetic acid. The con -
centration of 3-HP reached 11.2 g/L with the yield of 0.55 g/g in LNY07(M*DA). The results could potentially 
contribute to the future development of an industrial bioprocess of 3-HP production from syngas-derived acetic 
acid.   
1. Introduction 
The rising concentration of carbon dioxide (CO
2
), mainly due to the 
accelerated consumption of fossil fuels and other human activities, has 
caused an increase in global temperatures [ 1 – 3 ]. With such environ -
mental concerns, there is growing interest focusing on upgrading CO
2 
waste into metabolites of interest through biotransformation pathways 
[ 4 , 5 ]. In order to reduce waste carbon streams emissions and transform 
them into value-added chemicals, the U.S. Department of Energy ’ s Of -
fice of Fossil Energy has selected eleven projects, which received about 
seventeen million dollars from federal funding, to utilize CO
2 
from 
various industrial processes as the mainly carbon source [ 6 ]. Bio-based 
synthesis of platform chemicals from low-cost and abundant feedstock 
has become more and more important with the gradual depletion of 
fossil fuels, the associated increasing feedstock costs and the rapid 
development of modern industry [ 7 ]. In the previous studies, acetic acid 
can be derived from the conversion of various one-carbon gases (CO, 
CO
2
, etc.) via microbial fermentation or electrosynthesis [ 8 – 10 ]. As a 
non-food based substrate, acetic acid is regarded as a quite promising 
carbon source instead of sugars, and there have been many studies on 
utilization and transformation of acetic acid into various value-added 
products such as succinate [ 11 ], itaconic acid [ 12 ], fatty acid [ 13 ], 
isopropanol [ 14 ], and so on. 
3-Hydroxypropionic acid (3-HP), which is composed of two func -
tional groups (carboxylic and hydroxyl) and can be easily transformed 
into other compounds (e.g., acrylic acid, acrylamide, 1,3-propanediol 
(PDO), and methacrylic acid) [ 15 ], is a widely used agent for organic 
synthesis [ 16 ]. Variety of metabolic pathways and microbes have been 
explored for 3-HP production, including malonyl-CoA pathway in 
Pseudomonas denitrificans [ 17 ], CoA-independent pathway in Klebsiella

pneumoniae [ 18 ], β -alanine pathway in Saccharomyces cerevisiae [ 19 ], 
malonyl-CoA pathway in Escherichia coli [ 20 ], and many other auto -
trophic or heterotrophic routes [ 21 ]. Among these processes, research 
on 3-HP production via malonyl-CoA route has been carried out in 
different chassis microorganisms model organisms, such as E. coli [ 22 ], 
S. cerevisiae [ 23 ], and Schizosaccharomyces pombe [ 24 ]. Production of 
3-HP through malonyl-CoA route, is suitable for most carbon sources, 
including acetic acid, due to the malonyl-CoA is a universal intermediate 
in cell metabolism [ 20 ]. 
Although acetic acid can be utilized by many microorganisms, its 
consumption rate is much slower than those of sugar utilization, and 
reduced cell growth is also showed [ 25 , 26 ]. In E. coli , the acetic acid can 
be firstly converted to acetyl-CoA via two pathways, which were cata -
lyzed by acetic acid kinase-phosphotransacetylase (AckA-Pta) or 
acetyl-CoA synthetase (Acs) ( Fig. 1 ) [ 27 ]. Acetyl-CoA is then converted 
to malonyl-CoA with CO
2 
fixation catalyzed by acetyl-CoA carboxylase 
(Acc). Since the majority of cellular malonyl-CoA is usually consumed to 
produce fatty acids [ 28 ], leaving only a small amount available for 3-HP 
production. Then, malonyl-CoA reductase (Mcr) was applied to redirect 
the malonyl-CoA flux away from fatty acid to 3-HP formation [ 20 ]. 
Furthermore, the biosynthesis of 3-HP from malonyl-CoA, catalyzed by 
Mcr, requires 2 mol of NAPDH [ 17 , 29 , 30 ]. 
In this work, a metabolic engineered E. coli carrying codon-optimized 
Mcr (N940V, K1106W and S1114R) from C. aurantiacus and Acc from 
Corynebacterium glutamicum was constructed to produce 3-HP via 
malonyl-CoA [ 20 ]. And to further increase 3-HP production, several 
engineering strategies were applied, including promoting glyoxylate 
shunt pathway by deletion of fadR , inhibiting fatty acid synthesis by 
overexpression of the native fabR , dynamic regulating of TCA cycle by 
controlling the expression of sdh . Finally, the utilization pathway of 
acetic acid was enhanced by replacing the promoter of ackA-pta . In this 
study, syngas-derived acetic acid, which was produced by the syngas 
fermentation of Moorella thermoacetica , was also used as the sole carbon 
source for 3-HP production by engineered E. coli strain. The titer and 
yield of 3-HP were similar as those of using chemically synthesized 
acetic acid as carbon source. The results indicated that the engineering 
system has high e ffi ciency for the biosynthesis of 3-HP from 
syngas-derived acetic acid with CO
2 
fixation.

2. Experimental section 
2.1. Strains and plasmids construction 
All the bacterial strains and plasmids used in the experiments are 
described in Table 1 , and all the primers used for amplification of 
different genes are listed in Table 2 . The temperature-sensitive P
R 
pro -
moter including repressor protein CI857, amplifying by PCR using 
pCP20 as template, was subtiluted for the native promoter of sdh . The 
native promotor of ackA-pta in strain BL27 was replaced by the modified 
trc promotor (P trc- mut, Table 2 ) [ 31 ]. Deletion of fadR gene and 
replacement of native promoter of sdh or ackA-pta based on E. coli BL27 
were created using the one-step inactivation method [ 32 ]. For the fadR 
gene deletion, the kanamycin resistance cassette flanked by FRT was 
amplified from pKD4 using primers with homologous arm for homolo -
gous recombination. 
The mcr gene from C. aurantiacus was codon-optimized and synthe -
sized by Sangon Biotech Co. Ltd.. To obtain the mutated mcr (N940V, 
K1106W and S1114R), three fragments was cloned from codon- 
optimized mcr by PCR with primers F- mcr -mut/R- mcr -mut, F – N940V 
(K1106W)/R – N940V(K1106W), and F – S1114R/R – S1114R respectively. 
These three fragments were combined by overlap PCR with primers F- 
mcr -mut/R – S1114R. Gene segments of dtsR1 and accBC from 
C. glutamicum were amplified by PCR and then overlapped together to 
form dstR1 - accBC . The ribosome binding sequence (AAGGAGATATACC) 
was added before the start codons of accBC and dtsR1 respectively. The 
mutated mcr gene was ligated to linear vector pET28a which was 
digested by Sac I and Sal I, yielding plasmid pET28a- mcr -mut. Then, the 
DNA fragments dstR1 - accBC was inserted into pET28a- mcr -mut to form 
the plasmid pET28a- mcr -mut- dstR1 - accBC (named as pET28a-M*DA). 
2.2. Culture medium and conditions 
Luria-Bertani (LB) medium (per liter: 10 g tryptone, 5 g yeast extract, 
10 g sodium chloride) was used for strains construction and plasmids 
ampli fi cation. During strain and plasmid construction, the strains with 
the temperature-sensitive plasmids pKD46 and pCP20 were incubated at 
30 
◦
C or 42

C, other strains were usually grown at 37 
◦
C. 
For fermentation in flasks, a single colony from the freshly grown 
plate was inoculated into 3 mL of LB media and cultured at 37 
◦
C and 
220 rpm for 8 h 500 μ L of the preculture was added to 50 mL of LB media 
in a 250-mL flask, in which the cells were incubated under the same 
conditions for 8 h. For shake flask fermentation, the secondary pre -
culture was inoculated (2% v/v) into a 250- mL flask containing 50 mL 
of fermentation medium and incubated at 37 
◦
C (when the native pro -
moter of sdh is replaced with the temperature-sensitive promoter, the 
culture temperature was 39 
◦
C) and 220 rpm until induction. The 
fermentation medium was prepared by supplementing the minimal M9 
medium with 10 g/L of ammonium acetate and 5 g/L of yeast extract.

mass flow controller and pH was controlled at around 6 by addition of 
5 N NaOH or HCl. Prepared media (excluding cysteine), sterilized and 
then added into the reactor, was purged with oxygen-free nitrogen 
overnight. The cells were grown on syngas mixture with a total gas flow 
rate of 100 sccm (standard cubic centimeters per minute). A cysteine 
solution was added to remove dissolved oxygen in the medium for 
anaerobic growth conditions, and the bioreactor was inoculated with 
5% v/v. 
2.4. Whole-cell bioconversion for 3-HP production 
The whole-cell fermentation experiments were performed using the 
concentrated genetically engineered E. coli strain LNY07(M*DA). In the 
whole-cell bioconversion experiments (40 OD

), the preculture and 
culture conditions were the same as that of the previous shake-flask 
fermentation. The cells were harvested after 25 h cultivation (mid-log 
phase of growth) by centrifugation at 5500 rpm and 4

3. Results and discussion 
3.1. Effect of push-and-pull strategy on 3-HP accumulation 
The push-and-pull strategy for metabolic engineering was applied in 
this study. As mentioned previously, there are generally two pathways to 
deplete acetic acid in E. coli , AckA-Pta pathway and Acs pathway [ 31 , 
34 ]. Both pathways can convert acetic acid to acetyl-CoA, but there are 
obvious differences between these two pathways. The AckA-Pta 
pathway was discovered to be central for mutual conversion between 
acetic acid and acetyl-CoA [ 27 ]. The direction of reaction in this 
pathway can be rapidly transformed from acetic acid production to 
acetic acid consumption [ 35 ], which is a major pathway for acetic acid 
assimilation. In contrast, Acs pathway is responsible only for conversion 
acetic acid to acetyl-CoA. For acetic acid uptake, the former pathway 
consumes less energy than the latter because Acs in E. coli consumes ATP 
and produces AMP instead of ADP [ 36 ]. Mutant cells lacking AckA-Pta 
pathway grew poorly in high concentrations of acetic acid [ 37 ]. Previ -
ous studies have shown that when high concentrations of acetic acid is 
used as carbon source, the AckA-Pta pathway is the main route for acetic 
acid assimilation [ 31 , 34 ]. In previous study, the plasmid pET28a-MDA 
has been proven enough to produce 3-HP at high concentration from 
glucose [ 38 ]. We constructed the pET28a-M*DA (MCR with 3 muta -
tions: N940V, K1106W, and S114R) on the basis of pET28a-MDA, since 
the MCR with 3 mutations (N940V, K1106W, and S114R) performed 
much better than MCR in the production of 3-HP from glucose [ 20 ]. 
Compared with BL27 (MDA), BL27 (M*DA) achieved a higher 3-HP 
production (~1.75-fold more) and yield on acetic acid (0.44 g/g vs. 
0.23 g/g) ( Figs. 2C and 5 ). It indicated that the mutant of MCR can still 
maintain the higher activity in the cultivation of acetic acid as well as 
glucose. When 5 g/L yeast extract was added to the minimal M9 medium 
without adding acetic acid, only a small amount of 3-HP was detected, 
about 0.1 g/L (Data not shown). Therefore, it could be considered that

yeast extract is mostly used for the growth of E. coli , and acetic acid is the 
main carbon source for the production of 3-HP. In order to enhance 
acetic acid utilization and improve 3-HP production in our engineering 
strains, the native promoter shared by ackA and pta genes in the strain 
E. coli BL27 was replaced to a modified trc promoter (P trc -mut, Table 2 ), 
yielding strain LNY01. The strain LNY01(M*DA) produced 3.22 g/L of 
3-HP in 48 h, about 13.0% higher than that of BL27 (M*DA) ( Fig. 2 A and 
B). And the yield of 3-HP in LNY01 (M*DA) reached 0.472 g/g, which is 
about 8.0% higher than that of the control strain. The results indicated 
that promoting the acetic acid up-take rate was beneficial for the 3-HP 
production. 
When E. coli grows on acetic acid as a sole carbon source, the 
glyoxylate cycle is a critical and up-regulated, which can replenish 
dicarboxylic acid intermediates from the TCA cycle for cell metabolism 
and increase the utilization rate of exogenous acetic acid [ 39 ]. In the 
pathway, isocitrate is cleaved by isocitrate lyase (encoded by aceBAK ) to 
succinate and glyoxylate ( Fig. 1 ) [ 40 ]. IclR (isocitrate lyase repressor, 
encoded by iclR ) is known as a repressor protein binding to a site which 
overlaps the aceBAK promoter [ 41 ]. Thus, the most common approach 
to enhance the glyoxylate cycle is deletion of iclR . FadR (fatty acid 
degradation repressor) is recognized as a fatty acid metabolism regu -
lator, which not only represses fatty acid degradation pathway [ 42 , 43 ], 
but also activates expression of genes essential for the unsaturated fatty 
acid synthesis [ 44 ]. Additionally, it has been reported that FadR acti -
vates the expression of iclR by binding to a part of the upstream site of 
the iclR promoter [ 41 ]. In this work, we investigated the effect of 
deletion of fadR on 3-HP production. The fadR gene was deleted in E. coli 
BL27 strain, resulting in LNY02 strain. And the plasmid pET28a-M*DA 
was inserted into LNY02 to obtain the LNY02(M*DA) strain. It was 
found that the cell biomass of strain LNY02(M*DA) were enhanced 
( Fig. 2 A), and the 3-HP production and acetic acid assimilation rate were 
also higher than that of strain BL27 (M*DA) ( Fig. 2 B and C). LNY02 
(M*DA) produced 3.16 g/L 3-HP, which was 10.9% higher than that of 
BL27 (M*DA). In addition, the yield of 3-HP on acetic acid (0.46 g/g) 
was increased slightly due to the increased substrate consumption and 
product accumulation. The consumption rate of acetic acid was signif -
icantly increased by combining with “ push ” (enhancing the pathway of 
acetic acid uptake by overexpression of ackA-pta ) and “ pull ” (enhancing 
the pathway of acetic acid utilization by deletion of fadR ). Between 16 
and 32 h, the acetic acid consumption rate of strain LNY04(M*DA) 
reached 0.3 g/L/h, which was a 68% increase compared to BL27 
(M*DA). The results demonstrated that the deletion of fadR shown a 
positive effect on the 3-HP production and yield. 
Although the cell growth, 3-HP production, and acetic acid uptake 
rate were successfully enhanced, the yield was still low. The native 
promoter of ackA and pta in LNY02 was further replaced, yielding the 
LNY04 strain. Compared to BL27 (M*DA), LNY04(M*DA) showed 
improved 3-HP titer by 9.1% (from 2.85 to 3.11 g/L) in 48 h cultivation 
( Fig. 2 A and C). In addition, all acetic acid had been consumed by the 
strain LNY04(M*DA) in 32 h ( Fig. 2 B), and the 3-HP production rate of 
LNY04(M*DA) was also enhanced significantly ( Fig. 2 C). It indicated the 
strain has great potential to convert acetic acid into 3-HP. 
3.2. Effect of temperature-controlled TCA cycle on 3-HP accumulation 
To further regulate the carbon flux and improve 3-HP accumulation, 
we decided to dynamically regulate TCA cycle by controlling the 
expression of sdh . The bacteriophage λ promoters (P
R
, P
L
) enable a 
simple temperature change to switch on-off the expression of genes 
efficiently and rapidly by using the temperature-sensitive repressor 
CI857 [ 45 , 46 ]. In a previous study, the native lactate dehydrogenase 
gene ( ldhA ) in E. coli were controlled by the promoters, which repressed 
ldhA when growth at 33 
◦
C and was able to increase the biomass yield by 
10% (compared with the static strategy), while switching to 42 
◦
C 
induced the expression of ldhA and increased the production of lactate 
[ 45 ]. In our case, sdh is active under the control of the P
R 
promoter 
during cell growth (favored by an inactive CI857 at 39 
◦
C) and inactive 
due to CI857 is active at low temperatures and binds to the P
R 
promoter 
in the phase of 3-HP production (favored by an active CI857 at 25 
◦
C). 
Through the dynamic regulation of sdh , we expect to decouple the 
growth and 3-HP production. We obtained LNY03, LNY05, LNY06 and 
LNY07 strains by changing the native promoter of sdh into the 
temperature-sensitive promoter P
R 
in BL27, LNY01, LNY02 and LNY04 
strain, respectively. As the native promoter is replaced, different OD
600 
of induction were studied in the strain LNY03(M*DA). When the OD
600 
of induction was 1, only 2.46 g/L of acetic acid was consumed, about 
28% of the initial acetic acid with least 3-HP accumulation ( Fig. 3 ). And 
when the OD
600 
of induction was 2.5, LNY03(M*DA) produced the 
highest concentration of 3-HP. The experimental results showed that the 
expression level of SDH affects carbon flux distribution and it was found

that the optimum OD
600 
value for induction of the 3-HP biosynthesis 
pathway was 2.5 (Fig. 3). The strains LNY03(M*DA), LNY05(M*DA), 
LNY06(M*DA) and LNY07(M*DA) generated 3.48, 3.45, 3.46 and 3.92 
g/L of 3-HP in 48 h (Figs. 3B and 4B), which were 22.1, 7.2, 9.5 and 
26.0% higher than those of the control strains without promoter 
exchanging. The yield of 3-HP in LNY07 (M*DA) reached 0.57 g/g, 
which is about 76% of theoretical maximum (0.75 g/g) (Fig. 5). The 
result showed that replacing the promoter of sdh with the 
temperature-sensitive promoter enhanced the rate of 3-HP production 
significantly. 
3.3. The 3-HP production in whole-cell bioconversion of engineered E. coli 
strain 
Whole-cell catalysis has the advantages of higher cell density, higher 
product yield and productivity, lower energy requirements, etc. In the 
experiment we used concentrated E. coli strain LNY07(M*DA), which 
had both a high titer and high yield of 3-HP as whole-cell biocatalyst, 
acetic acid as the sole carbon source. The initial OD600 of LNY07 
(M*DA) was around 40. After 44 h of bioconversion, almost all the acetic 
acid was consumed and 15.8 g/L 3-HP was obtained (Fig. 6A), with the 
yield increasing to 0.71 g/g, about 94% of the maximum theoretical 
pathway. The titer of 3-HP in the biotransformation was significantly 
higher than the concentration obtained using fed-batch cultures. The 
titer of 3-HP increased significantly due to the high cell density, and it 
indicated that the carbon metabolic flux were redirected into the 3-HP 
production pathway by whole-cell bioconversion. The cell density 
decreased during the process, which may occur due to the repeatedly 
addition of acetic acid (at 17 and 34 h) (Fig. 6A), which was to prolong 
the production of 3-HP and better test the life span of 3-HP production 
activity. And the production rate of 3-HP was maintained constantly 
during the cultivation, about 0.35 g/L/h. 
3.4. Utilization of syngas-derived acetic acid for 3-HP 
Here, the syngas-derived acetic acid, which was produced by 
M. thermoacetica, was used as a solo carbon source for 3-HP biosynthesis 
by LNY07(M*DA). The results of acetic acid consumption, 3-HP pro -
duction and cell density during the cultivation are shown in Fig. 6B. The 
initial concentration of acetic acid in the syngas fermentation broth was 
20.5 g/L and the initial OD600 of LNY07(M*DA) was around 39. As a 
result, the strain consumed almost all the acetic acid in the biologically 
produced culture medium and accumulated 11.2 g/L 3-HP from the 
syngas-derived acetic acid. The titer of 3-HP dropped due to the initial 
concentration of acetic acid in the biologically produced culture me -
dium. No additional acetic acid was added during the cultivation. In 
addition, the cell density did not show any significant decrease 
compared to the condition of using chemically synthesized acetic acid. 
The complex composition in the culture broth of M. thermoacetica may 
help the cell density. Since the yield of 3-HP dropped a little (0.55 g/g), 
it indicated that more acetic acid maybe used to the cell maintenance 
than that of using chemically synthesized acetic acid. In this study, the 
current titer of 3-HP from syngas-derived acetic acid was the highest 
concentration ever reported. This result indicates a great potential for 
the metabolically engineered E. coli strain to generate 3-HP from syngas- 
derived acetic acid. 
The current results can be compared with other studies using E. coli 
as host to produce 3-HP from acetic acid. The engineered E. coli con -
verted 8.98 g/L of acetic acid into 3.00 g/L of 3-HP in 48 h cultivation 
with overexpression of mcr and acs and deletion of iclR, when 50 μ M 
cerulenin was added to repress fatty acid synthesis pathway [29]. In 
two-stage bioreactor (glucose is used for cell growth and acetic acid for 
3-HP formation), the engineered E. coli strain with upregulated glyox -
ylate shunt produced 7.3 g/L of 3-HP with yield of 0.26 mol/mol (0.39 
g/g) [30]. In comparison, the engineered E. coli LNY07(M*DA) obtained 
15.8 g/L of 3-HP with the yield of 0.71 g/g from chemically synthesized 
acetic acid and 11.2 g/L of 3-HP with the yield of 0.55 g/g from 
syngas-derived acetic acid. The study demonstrates an effective route to 
produce 3-HP from acetic acid. Despite the encouraging results in the 
whole-cell bioconversion experiment, there are still challenges. 
Compared with the use of glucose as the substrate, when acetic acid is 
used as the substrate, the cell growth is slower and the final titer of 3-HP 
is lower. Studies have been conducted to balance the activities of key 
enzymes and use glucose to synthesize 40.6 g/L of 3-HP in E. coli [20]. In 
order to increase the production of 3-HP from acetic acid, further strain 
modification or bioprocess optimization should be considered. 
4. Conclusions 
In this study, the engineered E. coli strains can produce 3-HP using 
acetic acid efficiently. Several strategies were applied to enhance 3-HP 
production from acetic acid, including exchanging promoter of ackA- 
pta, deletion of fadR, and temperature-controlling the expression of sdh. 
The engineered strain LNY07(M*DA) produced 15.8 g/L of 3-HP with 
the yield of 0.71 g/g from chemically synthesized acetic acid and 11.2 g/ 
L of 3-HP with the yield of 0.55 g/g from syngas-derived acetic acid. The 
results demonstrate an effective route to use syngas-derived acetic acid 
as raw materials to produce 3-HP and other important chemicals, 
especially malonyl-CoA derived compounds.
