ABSTRACT The autotrophic 3-hydroxypropionate/4-hydroxybutyrate (HP/HB) cycle
functions in thermoacidophilic, (micro)aerobic, hydrogen-oxidizingCrenarchaeota of the
order Sulfolobales as well as in mesophilic, aerobic, ammonia-oxidizingThaumarchaeota.
Notably, the HP/HB cycle evolved independently in these two archaeal lineages, and
crenarchaeal and thaumarchaeal versions differ regarding their enzyme properties and
phylogeny. These differences result in altered energetic efﬁciencies between the var-
iants. Compared to the crenarchaeal HP/HB cycle, the thaumarchaeal variant saves two
ATP equivalents per turn, rendering it the most energy-efﬁcient aerobic pathway for car-
bon ﬁxation. Characteristically, the HP/HB cycle includes two enoyl coenzyme A (CoA)
hydratase reactions: the 3-hydroxypropionyl-CoA dehydratase reaction and the crotonyl-
CoA hydratase reaction. In this study, we show that both reactions are catalyzed in the
aforementioned archaeal groups by a promiscuous 3-hydroxypropionyl-CoA dehydra-
tase/crotonyl-CoA hydratase (Msed_2001 in crenarchaeonMetallosphaera sedula and
Nmar_1308 in thaumarchaeonNitrosopumilus maritimus). Although these two enzymes
are homologous, they are closely related to bacterial enoyl-CoA hydratases and were
retrieved independently from the same enzyme pool by the ancestors ofCrenarchaeota
and Thaumarchaeota, despite the existence of multiple alternatives. This striking similar-
ity in the emergence of enzymes involved in inorganic carbonﬁxation from two inde-
pendently evolved pathways highlights that convergent evolution of autotrophy could
be much more widespread than anticipated.
IMPORTANCE Inorganic carbon ﬁxation is the most important biosynthetic process on
Earth and the oldest type of metabolism. The autotrophic HP/HB cycle functions in
Crenarchaeota of the order Sulfolobales and in ammonia-oxidizing Archaea of the
phylum Thaumarchaeota that are highly abundant in marine, terrestrial, and geother-
mal environments. Bioinformatic prediction of the autotrophic potential of microor-
ganisms or microbial communities requires identi ﬁcation of enzymes involved in
autotrophy. However, many microorganisms possess several isoenzymes that may
potentially catalyze the reactions of the cycle. Here, we studied the enzymes catalyz-
ing 3-hydroxypropionyl-CoA dehydration and crotonyl-CoA hydration inNitrosopumilus
maritimus (Thaumarchaeota)a sw e l la si nMetallosphaera sedula (Crenarchaeota). We
showed that both reactions were catalyzed by homologous promiscuous enzymes,
which evolved independently from each other from their bacterial homologs.
Furthermore, the HP/HB cycle is of applied value, and knowledge of its enzymes is
necessary to transfer them to a heterologous host for synthesis of various value-added
products.

A
utotrophic CO2 ﬁxation is responsible for primary production, being the quantita-
tively most important biosynthetic process on Earth. It proceeds mainly through
the Calvin-Benson cycle that evolved quite recently but became a superior autotrophic
pathway due to its oxygen tolerance (1; for recent reviews, see references 2 –4).
However, two major anaerobic autotrophic pathways may be traced back to a hypo-
thetical abiotic chemistry: the reductive acetyl coenzyme A (CoA) pathway and the
reductive tricarboxylic acid cycle (5–7). Furthermore, the anaerobic, selenocysteine-de-
pendent reductive glycine pathway has recently been described inDesulfovibrio desul-
furicans (8). Three other known CO
2 ﬁxation pathways are not broadly distributed and
restricted to de ﬁned phylogenetic groups: the 3-hydroxypropionate bi-cycle to
Chloroﬂexi, the dicarboxylate/4-hydroxybutyrate cycle to anaerobic Crenarchaeota,
and the 3-hydroxypropionate/4-hydroxybutyrate (HP/HB) cycle to thermoacidophilic,
(micro)aerobic, hydrogen-oxidizing Crenarchaeota of the orderSulfolobales (9–12) and
to oligotrophic, mesophilic, aerobic, ammonia-oxidizingThaumarchaeota (13) (Fig. 1).
The presence of the HP/HB cycle in two distantly related archaeal groups with different
physiology was counterintuitive, as CO
2 ﬁxation is the central anabolic process in an
autotroph and should be adapted to the corresponding ecological niche.
The biochemical and phylogenetical analysis of the enzymes of the HP/HB cycle
performed in the model organismsMetallosphaera sedula (Sulfolobales/Crenarchaeota)
and Nitrosopumilus maritimus(Thaumarchaeota) revealed that the pathway evolved in-
dependently in these two lineages and that the crenarchaeal and thaumarchaeal ver-
sions of the cycle differ in their properties (13, 14). While those enzymes that catalyze
the mechanistically challenging reactions (reactions 1, 7, 9, and 13 in Fig. 1) evolved
only once during evolution, and thus are phylogenetically related in these archaeal
groups, other enzymes that catalyze speciﬁc reactions of the cycle (reactions 2, 3, 4, 6,
10, 11, and 12) are not homologous inSulfolobales and Thaumarchaeota. Importantly,
synthetases (reactions 4 and 12) activating 3-hydroxypropionate and 4-hydroxybuty-
rate produce ADP and phosphate inThaumarchaeota and AMP and pyrophosphate
(that is further cleaved into two phosphates) inSulfolobales. The thaumarchaeal variant
therefore saves two ATP equivalents in the activation of 3-hydroxypropionate and 4-
hydroxybutyrate compared to the crenarchaeal variant. This is considered a crucial adap-
tation to the low energy yields and nutrient-poor habitats of ammonia-oxidizing archaea in
Thaumarchaeotain contrast to those of hydrogen-oxidizing archaea inCrenarchaeota(13).
The pathway encompasses two enoyl-CoA hydratase reactions, i.e., dehydration of
3-hydroxypropionyl-CoA to acryloyl-CoA (3-hydroxypropionyl-CoA dehydratase) (reac-
tion 5 in Fig. 1) and hydration of crotonyl-CoA to (S)-3-hydroxybutyryl-CoA (3-hydroxy-
butyryl-CoA dehydratase, here referred to its function as crotonyl-CoA hydratase) (reac-
tion 14 in Fig. 1). InM. sedula, two dehydratases/hydratases have been characterized,
(i) 3-hydroxypropionyl-CoA dehydratase (3HPD) Msed_2001 that acts equally well as
crotonyl-CoA hydratase, and (ii) a bifunctional fusion protein crotonyl-CoA hydratase/
(S)-3-hydroxybutyryl-CoA dehydrogenase Msed_0399; they are both present in, and
were puriﬁed from, autotrophically grown cells (15, 16). InM. sedulacell extracts, corre-
spondingly, the crotonyl-CoA hydratase activity is much higher than the 3-hydroxypro-
pionyl-CoA hydratase activity (10, 17). However, we have recently shown that, inM.
sedula, the (S)-3-hydroxybutyryl-CoA dehydrogenase reaction is primarily catalyzed by
Msed_1423 (which is universally found in autotrophicSulfolobales) and that the bifunc-
tional crotonyl-CoA hydratase/( S)-3-hydroxybutyryl-CoA dehydrogenase Msed_0399
is apparently not the main crotonyl-CoA hydratase in this archaeon, although this pro-
tein is present in autotrophically grown cells (17). Indeed, the genome contains four
more dehydratase candidates that could catalyze crotonyl-CoA hydratase reaction. In
contrast, N. maritimus contained only one dehydratase candidate, a promiscuous 3-

hydroxypropionyl-CoA dehydratase/crotonyl-CoA hydratase, which was shown to oper-
a t ew i t hb o t hs u b s t r a t e s( 1 3 ) .
Therefore, we reevaluated the identity of crotonyl-CoA hydratase and compared
the corresponding enzymes inN. maritimus and M. sedula. Surprisingly, the enzyme
characterization and quantiﬁcation of various crotonyl-CoA hydratases inM. sedulaper-
formed here revealed that the previously characterized 3-hydroxypropionyl-CoA dehy-
dratase Msed_2001 is mainly responsible for the crotonyl-CoA hydratase reactionin vivo,
rendering it a promiscuous enzyme, as is the case forN. maritimus.F u r t h e r m o r e ,o u r
phylogenetic analysis showed that, although bothM. sedulaand N. maritimusenzymes
evolved independently from different bacterial enoyl-CoA hydratases, they are highly ho-
mologous, which reveals striking similarities in the course of convergent evolution of
autotrophic CO
2 ﬁxation.
RESULTS
Crotonyl-CoA hydratase and 3-hydroxypropionyl-CoA dehydratase reactions
in M. sedula cell extracts. The HP/HB cycle contains two enoyl-CoA hydratase reac-
tions, the 3-hydroxypropionyl-CoA dehydratase and the crotonyl-CoA hydratase reac-
tion. The study of their kinetics in cell extracts of autotrophically grownM. sedula
showed that they followed Michaelis-Menten kinetics withV
max of 15.760.6 U mg21
protein andKm of 2363mM for crotonyl-CoA hydration (65°C) and 1.1860.02 U mg21
protein and 10965mM for 3-hydroxypropionyl-CoA dehydration (42°C) (Fig. 2). Usually,
reactions catalyzed by several enzymes do not follow Michaelis-Menten kinetics, which

suggests that each of the corresponding reactions is catalyzed by a single enzyme and
not by several isoenzymes. An array of proteins could be responsible for these activities:
M. sedula genome harbors six crotonyl-CoA hydratase homologs (Table 1), and four of
them were previously characterized. One of these homologs was identiﬁed as 3-hydroxy-
propionyl-CoA dehydratase (Msed_2001) (15, 18). This protein is universally conserved
among autotrophicSulfolobales (Table 1). Uncharacterized crotonyl-CoA hydratase hom-
olog Msed_0566 was also present in all autotrophicCrenarchaeota,w h i l ef o u ro t h e r
homologs were present only in some strains. Based on this fact, it was proposed that
Msed_0566 may be a designated crotonyl-CoA hydratase in the crenarchaeal HP/HB
cycle (17).
Characterization of an enoyl-CoA hydratase Msed_0566.The gene msed_0566
was cloned and heterologously expressed inEscherichia coli, and the corresponding
protein was studied biochemically. Although it was active with the tested enoyl-CoAs,
the activity was low (Table 2). Previous attempts to characterize the heterologously
produced Msed_0566 were unsuccessful (17), probably due to the low expression level
of the protein and its poor activity with crotonyl-CoA. Bad catalytic efﬁciency (k
cat/Km)
with the tested substrates suggests that the protein is speciﬁc to unknown substrate(s)
and is not involved in the HP/HB cycle. The question remains as to which of the enoyl-
CoA hydratase homologs is predominantly responsible for crotonyl-CoA conversion
into (S)-3-hydroxybutyryl-CoA in M. sedula. Considering that no genetic system is

sedula. The concentrations of the six enoyl-CoA hydratase homologs were assessed
using data-independent mass spectrometric and ion mobility analysis of the total pro-
teome tryptic digest. We found that all six proteins were present in autotrophically
grown M. sedulaand that their abundance can be ranked in the order Msed_2001 (set
to 100%). Msed_0399 (89%). Msed_0384 (68%). Msed_0385 (47%). Msed_0566
(42%) . Msed_0336 (16%) (Table 3). The characterized crotonyl-CoA hydratase homo-
logs (Msed_0399, Msed_0384, Msed_0336, and Msed_0566) display aV
max too low to
be responsible for the reactionin vivo. Indeed, the comparison ofVmax values measured
for each of the characterized enzymes and forM. sedula cell extracts resulted in much
higher estimated abundances (6.0, 6.9, 60.4, and.100%, respectively; compare Tables
1 and 2 and Fig. 2). Despite all our attempts, we could not produce Msed_0385 hetero-
logously in a soluble and active form. Nevertheless, this protein is not universally con-
served in autotrophicSulfolobales and thus does not appear to be the sought-after cro-
tonyl-CoA hydratase. Therefore, we decided to reevaluate the function of the 3-
hydroxypropionyl-CoA dehydratase Msed_2001 (which is present in all autotrophic
Sulfolobales; reference 17) and to characterize this protein with different substrates.
Msed_2001 is a promiscuous 3-hydroxypropionyl-CoA dehydratase/crotonyl-
CoA hydratase.The genemsed_2001 was cloned in vector pET16b and heterologously
expressed, and the corresponding protein Msed_2001 was puriﬁed and characterized.
As expected, it was highly active with 3-hydroxypropionyl-CoA (Table 4), which was al-
ready shown to be its natural substrate (15, 18). The measuredVmax and Km values of
Msed_2001 to 3-hydroxypropionyl-CoA were close to those determined previously
(see Table 1). Surprisingly, the protein was also highly active with all other tested sub-
strates (Table 4). In particular, it had a very highV
max value to crotonyl-CoA. Although
the same reaction was detected with a lowerKm value in cell extracts, the difference

was in the range of deviation, which can be expected of heterologously produced
enzymes. Importantly, the ratio of crotonyl-CoA hydratase and 3-hydroxypropionyl-
CoA dehydratase activities in cell extracts (3:1) was close to that of Msed_2001 (5:1).
Considering a universal distribution of this protein in autotrophicSulfolobales, we con-
clude that Msed_2001 is a promiscuous 3-hydroxypropionyl-CoA dehydratase/cro-
tonyl-CoA hydratase that is responsible for both conversionsin vivo. Msed_0399, which
was previously thought to be responsible for crotonyl-CoA conversion into acetoace-
tyl-CoA, is responsible for a smallﬂux in autotrophically grownM. sedula, at best.

tase/crotonyl-CoA hydratase (Nmar_1308) was also proposed for the HP/HB cycle inN.

to theM. sedulacycle (13). As Nmar_1308 is the only enoyl-CoA hydratase homolog in
N. maritimus, it was obvious from the beginning that a promiscuous enzyme catalyzes
both reactions, being in sharp contrast to what was known forM. sedula at that time.
To compare the corresponding enzymes inCrenarchaeota and Thaumarchaeota,w e
thoroughly characterized Nmar_1308.

was cloned in the vector pET16b and heterologously produced inE. coli. The puriﬁed
protein was highly active in both 3-hydroxypropionyl-CoA dehydratase and crotonyl-
CoA hydratase reactions and had catalytic properties very similar to those ofM. sedula
protein (Table 4). Both proteins indeed share notable sequence similarity (42/69% of
sequence identity/similarity); hence, phylogenetic analysis was performed.
The homologs of N. maritimus protein were found in all ammonia-oxidizing
Thaumarchaeota sequenced so far (Table S1). Interestingly, phylogeny of 3-hydroxy-
propionyl-CoA dehydratase/crotonyl-CoA hydrataseﬁts well to the current taxonomy
of this group (Fig. 3), suggesting that the gene was transferred vertically during its evo-
lution and was most probably present in the ancestor of ammonia-oxidizing
Thaumarchaeota. Thaumarchaeal 3-hydroxypropionyl-CoA dehydratase/crotonyl-CoA

hydratases are closely related to a number of bacterial proteins and build a separate
phylogenetic branch on the tree. The genomes ofThaumarchaeota that are not able to
oxidize ammonia (and apparently do not grow autotrophically) possess Nmar_1308
homologs as well. However, they do not cluster with Nmar_1308 in the tree and prob-
ably evolved independently from them (Fig. 3). Furthermore, thaumarchaeal 3-hydrox-
ypropionyl-CoA dehydratase/crotonyl-CoA hydratases are only distantly related to
Msed_2001 homologs present in Sulfolobales (Fig. 3), revealing that both proteins
evolved independently from phylogenetically related bacterial homologs. Hence, cata-
lytic properties of one of those homologs, i.e., the enoyl-CoA hydratase homolog from

hydroxypropionyl-CoA (Table 4). These activities are relatively low and probably not
physiologically relevant forS. lipocalidus. Nevertheless, their presence appears to be a
common property of enoyl-CoA hydratases of this family, suggesting that the ancestral
proteins for both groups possessed the two required activities and were well suited to
ever function in the HP/HB cycle and to adapt to the performed functions.
DISCUSSION
Although both Crenarchaeota and Thaumarchaeota belong to the TACK superphy-
lum (named afterThaum-, Aig-, Cren-, andKorarchaeota), they are only distant relatives
on the phylogenetic tree. Furthermore,M. sedula(representative ofSulfolobales) andN.
maritimus (representative of ammonia-oxidizingThaumarchaeota) are adapted to very
different ecological niches. Sulfolobales are (hyper)thermophilic and acidophilic arch-
aea that prefer (micro)aerobic conditions. Many strains are able to grow autotrophically,
using elemental sulfur, thiosulfate, sulﬁdic ores, or molecular hydrogen for energy gener-
ation (19). In contrast, ammonia-oxidizing archaea of the phylumThaumarchaeota are
mesophilic to thermophilic, mainly autotrophic archaea known for their unusually high
afﬁnity to ammonia (in the low nanomolar range, as studied inN. maritimus) (20), being
thus adapted to lower energy supply than bacterial ammonia oxidizers. Our analysis of
the distribution of genes encoding enzymes of the HP/HB cycle revealed their occur-
rence in all genomes of ammonia-oxidizingThaumarchaeota sequenced so far but their
absence in nonautotrophic, non-ammonia-oxidizing members of the phylum (Table S1).
This ﬁnding corroborates the results of recent ancestral genomic reconstructions dating
the emergence of the thaumarchaeal HP/HB cycle back to the last common ancestor of
ammonia-oxidizing Thaumarchaeota (21). Interestingly, some non-ammonia-oxidizing
Thaumarchaeota possess an enoyl-CoA hydratase homologous to Msed_2001 (Fig. 3). Its
function in these heterotrophic archaea is unknown.
Corresponding to the difference in the physiology,Sulfolobales and Thaumarchaeota
use different variants of the HP/HB cycle. In these two variants, the enzymes catalyzing
speciﬁc conversions of the cycle, i.e., reductions of malonyl-CoA to propionyl-CoA (reac-
tions 2 to 4 and 6 in Fig. 1) and of succinyl-CoA to 4-hydroxybutyryl-CoA (reactions 10 to
12), are unique and not homologous to each other (13, 14). Acetyl-CoA/propionyl-CoA
carboxylase, methylmalonyl-CoA mutase, and 4-hydroxybutyryl-CoA dehydratase cata-
lyze mechanistically challenging reactions and are broadly distributed in the microbial
world. They appear to have been“invented” only once in the evolution and are under-
standably homologous inSulfolobales and Thaumarchaeota. The same seems to be the
case for methylmalonyl-CoA epimerase catalyzing a relatively simple deprotonation/pro-
tonation reaction (22). This enzyme emerged just once in the evolution and is homolo-
gous inCrenarchaeota and Thaumarchaeota. Nevertheless, thaumarchaeal and crenarch-
aeal enzymes do not build sister groups in the phylogenetic trees of the corresponding
proteins and are only distantly related to each other, conﬁ
rming that the HP/HB cycle
was not inherited from the common ancestor (13).
The conversion of crotonyl-CoA to acetoacetyl-CoA was originally attributed to very
different enzymes inN. maritimusand M. sedula. The annotation ofN. maritimusgenes

was straightforward, as this organism has a relatively small, streamlined genome (1.65
Mbp [23]) that harbors only one homolog of an enoyl-CoA hydratase possessing both
crotonyl-CoA hydratase and 3-hydroxypropionyl-CoA dehydratase activities and one
distinct homolog of (S)-3-hydroxybutyryl-CoA dehydrogenase (13) (Table 4). In con-
trast, M. sedula genome encodes multiple enoyl-CoA hydratase and hydroxyacyl-CoA
dehydrogenase homologs. Nevertheless, it wasﬁrst assumed that the corresponding
reactions are catalyzed in M. sedula by a bifunctional crotonyl-CoA hydratase/(S)-3-
hydroxybutyryl-CoA dehydrogenase Msed_0399 (16, 18, 24). Indeed, the homologous
fusion protein consisting of an enoyl-CoA hydratase and a dehydrogenase domain is
responsible for the corresponding conversion in the dicarboxylate/4-hydroxybutyrate
cycle in anaerobic Crenarchaeota like Ignicoccus hospitalis (Desulfurococcales)o r
Pyrobaculum neutrophilum(Thermoproteales) (25, 26), and it was logical to propose the
same for M. sedula. However, we have recently shown that the (S)-3-hydroxybutyryl-
CoA dehydrogenase reaction is catalyzed inM. sedula by a distinct enzyme (17). Here
we conﬁrm that Msed_0399 is not the main protein responsible for the crotonyl-CoA
hydratase reaction. Moreover, we show thatM. sedula uses a promiscuous 3-hydroxy-
propionyl-CoA dehydratase/crotonyl-CoA hydratase, exactly as inN. maritimus. Although
it was known before that this protein possesses (S)-3-hydroxybutyryl-CoA dehydratase
activity (15, 16, 18), it was not identiﬁed as the main protein responsible for the afore-
mentioned conversion inM. sedula in vivountil now. In fact, that activity was attributed
to another protein.
Heterologous expression often results in production of proteins with properties not
identical to those of the native enzymes. Indeed, based on theV
max of crotonyl-CoA hy-
dratase in cell extract (15.7 U mg21 at 65°C) and the Msed_2001 abundance (0.19%),
the expected Vmax of Msed_2001 should be;8,300 U mg21 protein (at 65°C), i.e., 3.4-
fold higher than the value measured with heterologously produced Msed_2001. The
Km value of the protein produced inM. sedula was also higher. Additional enoyl-CoA
hydratases were present inM. sedulacell extracts (Table 3), which, too, may contribute
to the crotonyl-CoA hydratase reaction inM. sedula. Nevertheless, their contribution is
not high, as most of them have low activity. Furthermore, they are not universally con-
served among autotrophic members of theSulfolobales. Based on the comparison of
Vmax of the heterologously produced proteins (Tables 1, 2, and 4) and their abundances
(Table 3), Msed_2001 is responsible for 99% of 3-hydroxypropionyl-CoA dehydratase
activity and for 86% of crotonyl-CoA hydratase activity inM. sedula, the latter probably
with some contribution of Msed_0399 (8.2%) and Msed_0384 (5.5%) enoyl-CoA hydra-
tases (Tables 1 and 3).
Our work showed that enzymes catalyzing enoyl-CoA hydratase reactions in
Crenarchaeota and Thaumarchaeota were retrieved from the same enzyme pool, de-
spite the existence of multiple alternatives. Both enzymes are closely related to bac-
terial enoyl-CoA hydratases, yet cluster with different bacterial proteins and do not
show a direct relationship to each other (Fig. 3). Although the physiological func-
tion of the corresponding bacterial homologs is not known, it appears that these
proteins possess both 3-hydroxypropionyl-CoA dehydratase and crotonyl-CoA hy-
dratase activities, as was shown for S. lipocalidus enoyl-CoA hydratase (Table 4).
Their adaptation to a new function inThaumarchaeota /Sulfolobales did not require
many amino acid substitutions. Indeed, Nmar_1308 and the closest bacterial homo-
log (according to the BLASTP search) share 85/92% of sequence identity/similarity.
A previous structural and phylogenetic analysis showed that crenarchaeal 3-
hydroxypropionyl-CoA dehydratase/crotonyl-CoA hydratase homologs have an
enoyl-group binding pocket similar to that of bacterial short-chain enoyl-CoA
hydratases (27). This striking similarity in the evolutionary routes, leading to the
emergence of similar (and homologous) enzymes that participate in two independ-
ently evolved pathways, highlights that convergent evolution of autotrophy could
be much more widespread than anticipated.

Germany), Thermo Scientiﬁc (Rockford, Illinois, USA), Pall Corporation (Dreieich, Germany), GE Healthcare
(Freiburg, Germany), or Millipore (Eschborn, Germany). Primers were synthesized by Sigma-Aldrich
(Steinheim, Germany).
Microbial strains and growth conditions.Cells ofM. sedulaTH2
T (DSM 5348) were cultivated auto-
trophically at 75°C in a 100-liter fermenter using modiﬁed ALLEN medium, pH 2.0 (19), under gassing
with a mixture of 19% CO2,3 %O2, and 78% H2 (0.5 liters/min) (generation time, 8 h) (28, 29). Cell pellets
were stored at280°C until use.N. maritimus strain SCM1 was isolated by Martin Könneke from aﬁsh
tank of the Seattle Aquarium (30) and has since been maintained as reference strain in his laboratory
using culture conditions described in reference 31. To obtain the biomass for enzymatic assays,N. mariti-
mus was cultivated at 28°C in 15-liter HEPES-buffered medium (pH 7.5) as described previously (32).
Cells were stored at 220°C. E. coli strain TOP10, E. coli NEB DH5
a, and E. coli strain Rosetta 2 (DE3)
(Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) were cultivated at 37°C in lysogeny broth (LB) medium.S. lipocalidusTGB-
C1 (DSM 12680) DNA was obtained from Deutsche Sammlung von Mikroorganismen und Zellkulturen
(DSMZ).
CoA-esters synthesis.Crotonyl-CoA and methacrylyl-CoA were chemically synthesized from the cor-
responding anhydrides and CoA (33). 3-Hydroxypropionyl-CoA was enzymatically synthesized with
recombinant propionate CoA-transferase fromClostridium propionicum(34). Acryloyl-CoA was enzymati-
cally synthesized with recombinant acyl-CoA oxidase 4 from Arabidopsis thaliana as described in
Schwander et al. (35). (S)-3-Hydroxybutyryl-CoA and (E)-2-octenoyl-CoA were synthesized from the corre-
sponding free acids by the mixed anhydride method (36) and then were puriﬁed using high-perform-
ance liquid chromatography (37).
Preparation ofM. sedula cell extracts.Frozen cells (100 to 150 mg) were suspended in 0.6 ml of
20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.8), 5 mM dithioerythritol (DTE) containing 0.1 mg ml
21 DNase I in 1.5-ml Eppendorf
vials. After addition of 1 g of glass beads (diameter 0.1 to 0.25 mm), the cell suspensions were treated in
the mixer-mill (type Mikro-Dismembrator S, Sartorius, Göttingen, Germany) for 10 min at 1,800 rpm and
the cell lysates were centrifuged for 20 min (14,000 rpm, 4°C). The supernatant (cell extract) was used for
enzyme assays immediately or stored at280°C until use.
Gene cloning.Primers and restriction enzymes used for the cloning of genes are listed in Table S2.
The M. sedula gene encoding 3-hydroxypropionyl-CoA dehydratase (Msed_2001) was inserted into the
expression vector pET16b with an N-terminal His
10-tag by restriction-free cloning method (38). TheM.
sedula genes encoding enoyl-CoA hydratase (Msed_0566 and Msed_0385) and theS. lipocalidus gene
encoding a putative crotonyl-CoA hydratase (Slip_2089) were ampliﬁed using Q5 polymerase (NEB,
Frankfurt, Germany). The gene encoding 3-hydroxypropionyl-CoA dehydratase/crotonyl-CoA hydratase
(Nmar_1308) was ampliﬁed from N. maritimus genomic DNA using MangoMix polymerase (Bioline,
London, UK). The PCR products were digested with the corresponding restrictases (Table S2). The genes
msed_0566, msed_0385, and nmar_1308 were ligated into pET16b using T4 DNA ligase (NEB). The gene
slip_2089 was inserted into pET16b by means of Gibson cloning (39). The Gibson Assembly Cloning kit
(NEB) was used according to the manufacturer’s instruction. Ampliﬁcation of the plasmids was per-
formed inE. coliTOP10.
Heterologous expression inE. coli. E. coli Rosetta 2 (DE3) was transformed with the recombinant
vectors. The cells were grown at 37°C in LB medium with 100
mg ampicillin ml21 and 34mg chloram-
phenicol ml21. Expression of Msed_2001 was induced at OD578 of 0.7 with 0.5 mM isopropyl-b-D-thioga-
lactopyranoside (IPTG), and the temperature was lowered to 30°C. The cells were harvested after addi-
tional growth for 6 h. Expression of Msed_0566 and Msed_0385 were induced at OD
578 of 0.6 to 0.8 with
0.2 mM IPTG, and the temperature was lowered to 16°C. The cells were harvested after additional growth
for 15 h. Expression of Nmar_1308 and Slip_2089 were induced at OD578 of 0.6 to 0.7 with 1 mM IPTG,
and the temperature was lowered to 20°C. The cells were harvested after additional growth for 3 h.
Puriﬁcation of recombinant proteins. The heterologously produced His 10-tagged Msed_2001,
Msed_0566, Msed_0385, Nmar_1308, and Slip_2089 were puriﬁed using afﬁnity chromatography. (i)
Preparation of cell extract. FrozenE. colicells were resuspended 1:3 (wet weight/volume) in 20 mM Tris-
HCl (pH 7.8), 5 mM DTE containing 0.1 mg ml21 DNase I. The suspensions were passed through a chilled
French pressure cell twice at 137 MPa, and the cell lysates were centrifuged for 1 h (100,000/C2g, 4°C). (ii)
Heat precipitation. The supernatant of Msed_2001 cell lysate was incubated for 15 min at 85°C and then
cooled on ice for 15 min, followed by centrifugation (14,000 rpm) at 4°C for 15 min. (iii) Afﬁnity chroma-
tography. The supernatants of Msed_2001, Nmar_1308, and Slip_2089 were applied at aﬂow rate of
0.5 ml min
21 to 1-ml Protino Ni-NTA columns (Macherey-Nagel), which had been equilibrated with
20 mM Tris-HCl containing 100 mM KCl (pH 7.8). The columns were washed with the same buffer con-
taining 100 mM imidazole at aﬂow rate of 0.5 ml min21 to elute unwanted protein. The enzymes were
eluted with the same buffer containing 500 mM imidazole. The recombinant Msed_0566 and
Msed_0385 were applied to 0.2-ml HisPur Ni-NTA Spin Columns (Thermo Scientiﬁc, Rockford, Illinois,
USA) that had been equilibrated with 50 mM Tris-HCl containing 500 mM KCl (pH 8.0). The unwanted
proteins were washed out with the same buffer containing 100 mM imidazole, and the enzymes were

eluted with the same buffer containing 500 mM imidazole. The recombinant proteins were stored in
50% glycerol at220°C after concentration using 10K Vivaspin Turbo 4 (Sartorius, Göttingen, Germany).
Enzyme assays. The 3-hydroxypropionyl-CoA dehydratase and 3-hydroxybutyryl-CoA dehydratase
activities of Msed_2001, Msed_0566, and Msed_0385, as well as those in cell extracts ofM. sedula, were
measured at 42°C. Their other enzyme activities were measured at 65°C. All enzyme activities of
Nmar_1308 and Slip_2089 were measured at 30°C and 42°C, respectively. The reactions were started by
the addition of pure enzyme and were stopped after 1 min by the addition of 1 M HCl-10% acetonitrile
(20
ml). Protein was removed by centrifugation (14,000 rpm) at 4°C for 20 min, and the products were an-
alyzed by ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography (UHPLC) using a reverse-phase (RP) C18 column
as described previously (17).
Crotonyl-CoA hydratase activity was detected by the formation of 3-hydroxybutyryl-CoA from cro-
tonyl-CoA. The 20-ml reaction mixture contained 100 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.8), 0.5 mM crotonyl-CoA, and
puriﬁed enzyme. The concentration of crotonyl-CoA was varied (0.005 to 2 mM) forKm determination.
3-Hydroxypropionyl-CoA dehydratase was detected as 3-hydroxypropionyl-CoA-dependent acryloyl-
CoA formation by coupling the reaction to crotonyl-CoA carboxylase/reductase (Ccr) fromRhodobacter
sphaeroides which reductively carboxylates acryloyl-CoA and crotonyl-CoA to methylmalonyl-CoA and
ethylmalonyl-CoA (40). The 20-ml reaction mixture contained 100 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.8), 1 mM NADPH,
50 mM NaHCO3, 0.1 mg ml21 Ccr, 0.5 mM 3-hydroxypropionyl-CoA, and puriﬁed enzyme. The concentra-
tion of 3-hydroxypropionyl-CoA was varied (0.01 to 1.5 mM) forKm determination.
3-Hydroxybutyryl-CoA dehydratase activity was detected by coupling the reaction to Ccr. The 20-ml
reaction mixture contained 100 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.8), 1 mM NADPH, 50 mM NaHCO3, 0.1 mg ml21 Ccr,
0.2 mM 3-hydroxybutyryl-CoA, and puriﬁed enzyme. The concentration of 3-hydroxybutyryl-CoA was
varied (0.005 to 2 mM) forKm determination.
Acryloyl-CoA hydratase activity was detected by the formation of 3-hydroxypropionyl-CoA from
acryloyl-CoA. The 20-ml reaction mixture contained 100 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.8), 0.1 mM acryloyl-CoA, and
puriﬁed enzyme. The concentration of acryloyl-CoA was varied (0.002 to 4 mM) forKm determination.
Methacrylyl-CoA hydratase activity was detected by the formation of 3-hydroxy-2-methylpropionyl-
CoA from methacrylyl-CoA. The 20-ml reaction mixture contained 100 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.8), 1 mM metha-
crylyl-CoA, and puriﬁed enzyme. The concentration of methacrylyl-CoA was varied (0.01 to 5 mM) forKm
determination.
(E)-2-Octenoyl-CoA hydratase activity was detected by the formation of 3-hydroxyoctanoyl-CoA
from (E)-2-octenoyl-CoA. The 20-ml reaction mixture contained 100 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.8), 0.2 mM (E)-2-
octenoyl-CoA, and puriﬁed enzyme. The concentration of (E)-2-octenoyl-CoA was varied (0.005 to 2 mM)
for Km determination.
Database search and phylogenetic analysis.Query sequences for the database searches were
obtained from NCBI database. The BLASTP searches were performed via NCBI BLAST server (http://www
.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/BLAST/) (41) and via the Integrated Microbial Genomes & Microbiomes system
(https://img.jgi.doe.gov/m/) (42). The phylogenetic tree was constructed by using the maximum likeli-
hood method and Jones-Taylor-Thornton (JTT) matrix-based model (43) in MEGA X (44). One hundred
sixty-six amino acid sequences were involved in this analysis. All positions containing gaps were com-
pletely deleted. The GenBank accession numbers for the protein sequences are listed in Table S3.
Mass spectrometric expression analysis.Cell lysates were prepared for mass spectrometric (MS)
analysis by ﬁlter-based reduction, alkylation, and tryptic digestion as described in reference 45 and
measured at a concentration of 500 ng/
ml. Samples were spiked with 47.6 fmol/ml yeast alcohol dehy-
drogenase 1 and 23.9 fmol/ml enolase 1. High-deﬁnition MS was performed using Synapt G2 Si ion mo-
bility mass spectrometer coupled to M-Class UPLC (Waters Corp.) as described in reference 46 using a
90-min gradient (solvent system 100% water versus 100% acetonitrile, both containing 0.1% formic acid;
trap column V/M Symmetry C18 100 Å 5
mm, 180mm by 20 mm; reversed phase column HSS T3 1.8mm,
75mm by 200 mm; 3- to 4-ml injection volume, 3 technical replicates). Data were analyzed with
ProteinLynx Global Server (Waters Corp.) using the Metallosphaera UniProt database containing the
sequences for the spike proteins alcohol dehydrogenase and enolase 1 for protein identiﬁcation.
Other methods.Protein was measured according to the Bradford method (47) using bovine serum
albumin as a standard.Km and Vmax values were calculated by GraphPad Prism5 software. DNA sequence
determination of puriﬁed plasmids was performed by Euroﬁns (Ebersberg, Germany). Sodium dodecyl
sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE; 12.5%) was performed as described by Laemmli
(48). Proteins were visualized using Coomassie blue staining (49). The purity of the recombinant protein
was calculated by the determination of band intensities on SDS-gel using Image Lab software (Bio-Rad).
Protein identiﬁcation and quantiﬁcation were performed at the IZKF Core Unit Proteomics Münster
based on tryptic in-gel digestion and mass spectrometric analysis using Synapt G2 Si coupled to M-Class
(Waters Corp.).
