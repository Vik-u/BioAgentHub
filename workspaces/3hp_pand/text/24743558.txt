Abstract
Marine Group I (MGI) Thaumarchaeota are one of the most abundant and cosmopolitan chemoautotrophs within the global
dark ocean. To date, no representatives of this archaeal group retrieved from the dark ocean have been successfully
cultured. We used single cell genomics to investigate the genomic and metabolic diversity of thaumarchaea within the
mesopelagic of the subtropical North Pacific and South Atlantic Ocean. Phylogenetic and metagenomic recruitment analysis
revealed that MGI single amplified genomes (SAGs) are genetically and biogeographically distinct from existing
thaumarchaea cultures obtained from surface waters. Confirming prior studies, we found genes encoding proteins for
aerobic ammonia oxidation and the hydrolysis of urea, which may be used for energy production, as well as genes involved
in 3-hydroxypropionate/4-hydroxybutyrate and oxidative tricarboxylic acid pathways. A large proportion of protein
sequences identified in MGI SAGs were absent in the marine cultures Cenarchaeum symbiosum and Nitrosopumilus
maritimus, thus expanding the predicted protein space for this archaeal group. Identifiable genes located on genomic
islands with low metagenome recruitment capacity were enriched in cellular defense functions, likely in response to viral
infections or grazing. We show that MGI Thaumarchaeota in the dark ocean may have more flexibility in potential energy
sources and adaptations to biotic interactions than the existing, surface-ocean cultures.

Introduction
Marine Group I (MGI) Thaumarchaeota [1–3] are numerically
dominant and cosmopolitan within the ocean’s interior [4,5].
Studies of the marine sponge symbiontCenarchaeum symbiosum [6]
and free-living, epipelagicNitrosopumilus maritimus[7] have revealed
that at least some members of this archaeal group fix inorganic
carbon via a modified 3-hydroxypropionate/4-hydroxybutyrate
(3H/4H) pathway [8,9] and oxidize ammonia aerobically, and
therefore may be responsible for a significant fraction of
chemoautotrophic production in the dark ocean [10]. However,
several studies have provided evidence for heterotrophy within the
MGI [11,12], suggesting a role for mixotrophy within this archaeal
group. The potential importance of urea as a source of carbon and
energy has also been demonstrated for deep water thaumarchaea
of the Mediterranean Sea using PCR amplification [13] and in the
Arctic Ocean through metagenomics [14]. In contrast, the
cultured N. maritimus lacks the genes required for utilization of
urea.
To date, representatives of MGI have not been successfully
cultured from the dark ocean. To address this limitation, we
employed a single cell DNA sequencing approach to obtain partial
genomes of MGI from the mesopelagic region in the South
Atlantic and North Pacific Oceans. Single amplified genomes

(SAGs) representing MGI were found to be the dominant
component of the mesopelagic archaeal community, with both
ammonia monooxygenase (amoA) and nitrite reductase (nirK) genes
successfully retrieved from a large percentage of the sequenced
SAGs. The presence of urease genes within MGI SAGs confirms
their potential for urea utilization in the mesopelagic, providing an
alternative energy production pathway for these putative ammonia
oxidizers. Genes supporting heterotrophic carbon assimilation
were also identified, providing further evidence for mixotrophy
among MGI in the dark ocean. While MGI SAGs share a large
portion of genes with N. maritimus and Cenarchaeum symbiosum,a
significant number of genes were present only in SAGs, greatly
expanding the number of dark ocean thaumarchaeal protein
families with genomic context.
Materials and Methods
Sample Collection and Construction of Single Amplified
Genome (SAG) Libraries
No specific permission was required for the collection of water
samples at HOT station ALOHA or the South Atlantic cruise
station. None of the field collections involved endangered or
protected species. GPS coordinates and water depths for all sample
collections are provided in the manuscript.
Water samples for single cell analyses were collected from
mesopelagic depths using Niskin bottles during cruises in the South
Atlantic (27 November 2007, 800 m, Cruise KN192-5 station 11,
12u29941.40S, 4u59955.20W) and North Pacific (9 September
2009, 770 m; Hawaii Ocean Time-series (HOT) Cruise 215,
station ALOHA; 22u459N, 158u009W) subtropical gyres. Repli-
cate, 1 mL aliquots of water were cryopreserved with 6% glycine
betaine (Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, MO, USA) and stored at280uC
[15]. Single cell sorting, whole genome amplification, real-time
PCR screens and PCR product sequence analyses were performed
at the Bigelow Laboratory Single Cell Genomics Center (www.
bigelow.org/scgc), as described previously [16]. PCR amplification
of SSU rRNA and metabolic genes (amoA, nirK, nifH) from SAGs
was done using primers and conditions provided in Table S1.
Nitrite Reductase (nirK) Primer Design
Primer3 software [17] was used to design PCR primers for
amplifying a portion of the nitrite reductase ( nirK) gene from
SAGs, using sequences retrieved from subphotic metagenomes
and previously publishednirK sequences (Figure S1).
Phylogenetic Analysis of SAG SSU rRNA and Metabolic
Genes
SSU rRNA and metabolic gene sequences were trimmed and
edited using Sequencher v4.10.1 (Gene Codes, Ann Arbor, MI,
USA). SAG SSU rRNA nucleotide and metabolic gene protein
sequences were aligned with selected database sequences using
MUSCLE v3.8 [18]. In order to reduce the number of misplaced
gaps within metabolic gene sequence alignments, nucleotide
sequences were translated to protein sequences and aligned, then
backtranslated to produce nucleotide alignments using the
RevTrans 1.4 server [19]. Maximum likelihood trees (1000
bootstrap replicates) for SSU rRNA and each metabolic gene
nucleotide sequences were generated separately using RAxML
version 7.0.3 [20] implemented within the ARB package [21].
MGI SSU rRNA SAG sequences with $99% similarity were
grouped into phylotypes prior to tree construction (Table S2).
SAG Sequencing and Analysis
A total of 37 MGI Thaumarchaeota SAGs were chosen for
whole genome sequencing based on multiple displacement
amplification (MDA) kinetics, presence of metabolic genes from
PCR screening and geographic location. Three approaches were

used for sequencing MGI SAGs (Table S3): 1) A combination of
Illumina and 454 shotgun sequencing (AAA007O23), or Illumina
only (AAA001A19), as described in Swan et al. [16], 2) a
combination of Illumina and PacBio long read sequence data
(AAA007N19, AAA288I14, and AAA288J14) as described in
Martinez-Garcia et al. [22] and assembled using Velvet-SC [23]
and PBcR [24], and 3) 454 shotgun sequencing of Nextera-
prepared libraries followed by dual assembly with Newbler v2.4
and Geneious Pro v.5.5.6 [25] (all remaining SAGs; total of 32).
For each of 32 Single Amplified Genomes (SAGs), raw 454
sequences were trimmed in Geneious Pro v5.5.6 and any
remaining Nextera transposon insert sequences were removed
using TagCleaner v0.11 [26]. Sequences were then assembled
separately in Newbler v.2.4 (Roche) using default settings and
Geneious using the high-sensitivity setting. The Newbler-assem-
bled were imported into Geneious and co-assembled with both the
Geneious-assembled contigs and the unused reads. The dual
assembled contigs and all other contigs longer than 300 bp were
pooled and annotated. Nextera-prepared sequencing libraries
were generated using the Roche Titanium-Compatible kit and
MDA product as the input DNA, following the manufacturer’s
instructions [27]. A total of 32 Nextera sequencing libraries
constructed from SAGs were barcoded and sequenced (454 FLX
Titanium chemistry) on 1/2 microtiter plate. A metagenome
library from the South Atlantic sampling station at 800 m was also
prepared using the Nextera kit and DNA extracted from a
collected water sample (Table S4). Whole-genome sequence data
for MGI SAGs are available in IMG under accession numbers
listed in Table S3.
To estimate the completeness of each assembled SAG genome,
we analyzed all finished genome sequences within the archaeal
domain (n = 155) available from the IMG [28]. Based on COG
gene classifications, a set of conserved single copy genes (CSCGs)
were extracted from these finished archaeal genomes. A CSCG
was defined as a gene that occurs only once in each of 98% of the
genomes that contributed to the taxonomic group. The number of
archaeal CSCGs was 94. The ratio of the number of CSCGs
observed for each SAG assembly, and the finished archaeal
genomes, was used as a measure of genome recovery (Table S3).
The gene modeling program Prodigal (http://prodigal.ornl.
gov/) was run on the draft single cell genomes, using default
settings that permit overlapping genes and using ATG, GTG, and
TTG as potential starts. The resulting protein translations were
compared to the GenBank non-redundant database (NR), the
Swiss-Prot/TrEMBL, Pfam, TIGRFam, Interpro, KEGG, and
COGs databases using BLASTP or HMMER. From these results,
product assignments were made. Initial criteria for automated
functional assignment set priority based on TIGRFam, Pfam,
COG, Interpro profiles, pairwise BLAST versus Swiss-Prot/
TrEMBL, and KO groups. The annotation was imported into
the Joint Genome Institute Integrated Microbial Genomes (IMG;
http://img.jgi.doe.gov/cgi-bin/pub/main.cgi) [29].
Metagenome Recruitment Analysis
The basic approach of Rusch et al. [30] was used to estimate
abundances of metagenome sequences that are close relatives of
MGI SAGs and marine thaumarchaea cultures within each
metagenome depth profile (Table S4). BLASTN+ v2.2.25 was
used to recruit metagenome sequences to each SAG assembly
using default parameter values, except for the following: -evalue
0.0001 -reward 1 -penalty -1 -soft_masking true -lcase_masking -
xdrop_gap 150. The percentage of unique recruits ($200 bp in
length and matching at$95% identity) from each metagenome
matching to each SAG was normalized by genome assembly
length. Metagenomes used in the recruitment analysis were
gathered from previously published studies and a metagenome
sequenced in this study (SA, South Atlantic Gyre; Table S4).
Genome abundances determined for each metagenome were
calculated from BLAST output and plotted using custom R scripts.
Metagenomes used in fragment recruitment analysis were quality
processed using PRINSEQ [31] and all sequences identified with
the following characteristics were removed from further analysis:
sequences ,100 bp, sequences containing any ambiguities (N’s),
all forms of replicate and duplicate sequences, and sequences with
a minimum entropy value of 70 (applied to pyrosequencing
datasets only).
Protein Homology and Identification of Genomic Islands
A non-redundant set of protein sequences from all 37 MGI
SAGs was used as input for the calculation and visualization of
sequence homology betweenC. symbiosumand N. maritimusprotein
sequences by BLAST Score Ratio analysis [32]. Genomic islands
within this non-redundant protein set were determined by first
using BLASTN-based recruitment as described above, using a 454
metagenome set consisting of sequences from HOT station
ALOHA (500 and 770 m) and the subtropical South Atlantic
(800 m) (Table S4). Protein sequences with zero recruitment across
the entire sequence length were identified as putative genomic
islands. This conservative measure was employed to avoid the
inclusion of false positives.

Results and Discussion
Community Composition, Metabolic Gene Diversity and
Depth Distribution of Archaeal SAGs
A total of 1,252 and 630 SAGs from the South Atlantic and
North Pacific Ocean, respectively, were screened for archaeal SSU
rRNA genes and MGI was found to be the dominant archaeal
group in both ocean regions (Figure 1A). Several SAGs affiliated
with Euryarchaeota Marine Group II [33] and Group III [1]
clusters were recovered from each site. Phylogenetic analysis of
MGI SAG and reference SSU rRNA gene sequences revealed
shallow marine samples and cultures were more distantly related
to those from the dark ocean (Figure 1B). A total of nine
phylotypes ($99% SSU rRNA similarity) were defined for MGI
SAGs, and six phylotypes comprised of more than one sequence
included SAGs from both ocean regions (Table S2). These results
support previous studies showing that the dark ocean archaeal
community is composed mostly of MGI [34,35]. The high degree
of similarity between SSU rRNA sequences recovered from SAGs
collected from two geographically distinct regions highlights the
cosmopolitan nature of this group, although significant genomic
differences between cells may exist that are not evident from SSU
rRNA similarity [36].

Gene sequences ofamoA were successfully PCR-amplified from
over 50% of MGI SAGs from which the 16S rRNA gene was also
recovered (Table 1). Phylogenetic analysis of amoA sequences
revealed a consistent clustering of SAG amoA sequences with
environmental sequences belonging to the ‘Water Column B
Group’ cluster that have been retrieved from samples within dark
ocean regions (Figure S2; [6,35,37,38]). These results support the
potential for ammonia oxidation among the majority of MGI
SAGs recovered from the mesopelagic.
PCR screening also recoverednirK from the majority of MGI
SAGs (Table 1), suggesting this gene plays an important metabolic
role in the putative ammonia oxidizing archaea (Figure S2). MGI
SAG nirK sequences formed a monophyletic group consisting
exclusively of sequences recovered from marine habitats, and were
most similar to a bathypelagic fosmid sequence recovered from
station ALOHA (Figure S3). Conserved sites corresponding to
copper coordinating residues were present in SAGnirK sequences,
distinguishing them from multicopper oxidases (MCOs) identified
in genomes of C. symbiosum and N. maritimus (Figure S1).
Denitrifying bacteria utilize the nirK gene for the conversion of
nitrite (NO
2
2) to nitric oxide (NO); however, this gene has also
been identified in aerobic, autotrophic ammonia-oxidizing bacte-
ria and archaea [6,7,39–42]. Although the exact role of
denitrification genes in nitrifiers is still unknown, the presence of
nirK and its associated activity has been shown to support growth
in some ammonia-oxidizing bacteria [43,44], as well as provide a
mechanism for NO
2
2 tolerance [45]. Recently, production of
nitrous oxide (N2O) by ammonia oxidizing archaea in the surface
ocean has been shown to be a globally important process [46], and
our results suggest that N
2O produced via ‘nitrifier-denitrification’
may also occur in the dark ocean.
The abundance of MGI gene sequences in several metagenome
depth profiles, determined by fragment recruitment analysis,
revealed a strong depth-dependent distribution for dark ocean
MGI SAG relatives (Figure 2 and Table S4). MGI SAG
recruitment was highest in waters below the photic zone
(,200 m) at all geographic regions. In contrast, recruitment of
sequences from cultures ofC. symbiosumand N. maritimuswas lower
than MGI SAGs at all depths and exhibited some depth-
dependence only at HOT station ALOHA in the North Pacific
Ocean (Figure 2). The highest recruitment of MGI SAGs was
found at the 500 m depth at station ALOHA and depths below
200 m at the eastern tropical South Pacific (ETSP) station.
Whereas the 500 m depth at ALOHA is located above the oxygen
minimum zone, ETSP stations deeper than 50–100 m are below
the oxycline, and the 500 m station is within the core of the
oxygen minimum zone (OMZ) [47]. Transcript sequences
matching to genes from N. maritimus were dominant among the
RNA fraction retrieved in ETSP upper waters (15–85 m) [47].

based on genomic DNA, which does not account for gene
transcription activity, our results indicate that MGI may also be
active within the OMZ core. The depth distributions of MGI
SAGs further highlight the importance of nitrification and
associated nitrogen-based metabolic processes occurring within
both aerobic and low-oxygen dark ocean regions [48].
Genomic Characteristics and Metabolic Potential of MGI
Thaumarchaeota SAGs
Genome recovery estimates of MGI SAGs ranged from 2.1 to
94.7%, with genome size estimates of 0.72 to 2.73 Mbp (Table
S3). Thus, MGI SAG genome sizes are similar to those found for
N. maritimus (1.65 Mbp) andC. symbiosum (2.05 Mbp). GC content
of MGI SAGs (33.56–36.46%) was also comparable toN. maritimus
(34.20%), but significantly lower thanC. symbiosum (57.70%).
Genes encoding all three subunits of ammonia monooxygenase
(amoABC) were identified within the majority of MGI SAGs with
highest genome completeness (Table S5). In addition to nitrite
reductase (nirK), a number of copper binding proteins within the
plastocyanin/azurin family and multicopper oxidases (MCOs)
were identified. Plastocyanin/azurin blue type (I) copper proteins
within N. maritimushave been implicated as electron carriers for an
alternative mode of ammonia oxidation than that found in
bacteria [7]. Although the exact details of ammonia oxidation
employed by thaumarchaea remain unclear, genes identified
within MGI SAGs suggest that dark ocean thaumarchaea utilize a
similar strategy identified inN. maritimus for carrying out the first
step in nitrification for energy production. Genes involved in the
transport and hydrolysis of urea were also identified in several
MGI SAGs and found to be syntenic to genes identified inC.

symbiosum (Figure 3A). While PCR-amplified sequences of the
urease a-subunit (ureC), as well as several subunits from fosmid
sequences have previously been retrieved from the dark ocean
[13,49], this is the first identification of urease genes within
putatively free-living dark ocean MGI assembled genomes.
Phylogenetic analysis ofureC sequences from MGI SAGs revealed
they are associated with a subclade consisting of other deep ocean
sequences (Figure 3B). The role of urea in supporting thaumarch-
aeal production in polar waters was recently reported [14], and
our results suggest this metabolic pathway may have global
importance for thaumarchaea within the dark ocean.
A majority of gene homologs involved in the modified 3H/4H
pathway [50] were identified in MGI SAGs with larger genome
assembly sizes (Table S6). Five genes within the described 3H/4H
pathway had no homology to gene sequences from MGI SAGs
and the N. maritimus genome; however, several proteins (e.g.,
alcohol dehydrogenases, aldehyde dehydrogenases, acyl-CoA
synthetases) identified in N. maritimus were proposed to provide
similar function and were also identified in MGI SAGs. In
addition to autotrophic growth, enzymes supporting a near-
complete oxidative tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle were also
identified, suggesting a role for this pathway in biosynthesis (Table
S6). Similar to C. symbiosum , genes supporting the Embden–
Meyerhof–Parnas (EMP) and nonoxidative pentose phosphate
pathways were identified, supporting gluconeogenesis and sugar
production for biosynthesis.
Several ABC transporter classes were identified in MGI SAGs
involved in the transport of metals, sugars, phosphonate, and
antibiotics (Table S7). Although the presence of phosphonate
transporters could suggest a role for these organic compounds as a
source of phosphorus, genes for the production of C-P lyases and
hydrolases were not identified in MGI SAGs. Genes supporting
motility were also not identified in MGI SAGs, and although
incomplete genome recovery is problematic for the interpretation
of missing genes, it is statistically unlikely genome incompleteness
can explain the absence of these genes from all genomes [51].
Protein Family Expansion and Characterization of
Genomic Islands within MGI Thaumarchaeota SAGs
A large proportion of protein sequences from MGI SAGs were
found to share homology with C. symbiosum and N. maritimus
(Figure 4A). MGI SAGs were also found to share more
homologous protein sequences withN. maritimusthan C. symbiosum,
with the former representing a free-living form of thaumarchaea.
However, 27% of MGI SAG protein sequences had BSR ratios
less than 0.4 when compared to sequences from either of the two
cultures, suggesting they are unique to dark ocean thaumarchaea
(Figure 4A). The ‘no COG category assignment’ (i.e. none) was
found to characterize the largest group of SAG-only proteins
(Figure 4B). The majority of sequences were annotated as
hypothetical or conserved hypothetical, thus making it difficult
to interpret the role of these proteins within the dark ocean
thaumarchaea. Proteins that recruited no 454 metagenome
sequences from the sampling environment, often termed genomic
islands (GIs), were identified within MGI SAGs (Figure 4).
Interestingly, the set of GI proteins was enriched in genes
associated with COG categories L (Replication, Recombination,
Repair), M (Cell Wall/Membrane Biogenesis), and V (Defense
Mechanisms) (Figure 4B). This pattern in GI characterization has
been noted in other marine taxa as well, and has been attributed to
increased hypervariability among proteins associated with cell
surfaces and cell recognition systems, which may function to
reduce viral attachment [52–54] or recognition by grazers [55,56].
These hypervariable genes may also function to mask genetic
discontinuities detected within environmental gene sequences used
to separate microorganisms into ecotypes [57]. Thus, this pattern
of hypervariability among proteins functioning to protect the cell
from infection or predation may be a universal feature among
marine microbes.
Summary
Single cell whole genome analysis of dark ocean thaumarchaea
provided further evidence for their metabolic capacity for aerobic
ammonia oxidation and urea hydrolysis for energy and/or
biosynthesis, and utilization of inorganic and possibly organic
carbon sources. Although MGI SAGs shared several metabolic
features identified in C. symbiosum and N. maritimus, we found
distinct depth distributions of genomic SAG sequences, suggesting
genetic divergence between epipelagic and dark ocean thau-
marchaea. The sequenced SAGs contain numerous genes with low
homology to either of the two available marine thaumarchaea
cultures, thus significantly expanding the known genetic repertoire
of marine thaumarchaea. Similar to prior reports on marine
bacteria, we found that dark ocean thaumarchaea contain
hypervariable regions, with the majority of identifiable genes on
these regions likely involved in cellular defenses. Our findings
provide important insights into the metabolic potential, genetic
variability, and vertical distribution of the globally important
thaumarchaea in the ocean.

Figure S1 Alignment of nitrite reductase (nirK) and multicopper
oxidase (MCO) gene sequences. Sequences recovered from
archaeal and bacterial isolates, environmental samples, and
selected single amplified genomes (SAGs) were used in the
alignment. South Atlantic SAGs: AAA001-A19, AAA003-I22,
AAA007-M20, and AAA008-M23; North Pacific SAGs: AAA288-
E09, AAA288-G06, AAA288-K09, and AAA2888-N08. Identical
(dark grey) and similar (light grey) amino acid residues are
indicated, as well as locations of copper coordinating residues
(arrows), as previously reported by Bartossek et al. [41]. Boxes
surrounding residues and labeled ‘‘F’’ (forward) and ‘‘R’’ (reverse)
indicate regions used for primer design. Sequences from
Nitrosopumilus maritimus are prefaced by ‘‘Nmar’’ andCenarchaeum
symbiosum are prefaced by ‘‘CENSYa’’.
