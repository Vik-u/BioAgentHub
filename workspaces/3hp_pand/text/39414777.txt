Microorganisms can be engineered to sustainably produce a variety of pro-
ducts including fuels, pharmaceuticals, materials, and food. However, highly
engineered strains often result in low production yield, due to undesired
effects such as metabolic burden and thetoxicity of intermediates. Drawing
inspiration from natural ecosystems, the construction of a synthetic commu-
nity with division of labor can offer advantages for bioproduction. This
approach involves dividing speciﬁc tasks among community members,
thereby enhancing the functionality ofeach member. In this study, we identify
six pairs out ofﬁf t e e nc o m p o s e do fs i xa u x o t r o p h so fYarrowia lipolyticathat

between two species. Subsequently, weintroduce a 3-hydroxypropionic acid
(3-HP) biosynthesis pathway into thesyntrophic community by dividing the
pathway among different strains. Our results demonstrate improved produc-
tion of 3-HP in both intra- and interspecies communities compared to mono-
cultures. Our results show the stableformation of synthetic syntrophic
communities, and their potential in improving bioproduction processes.
The advances in synthetic biology and metabolic engineering have led
to improved biotechnology processes using microorganisms for the
production of food, pharmaceuticals, biofuels, and biomaterials.
Despite methodological advances in our capacities to improve
microbial strains, some commonly found challenges remain, including
metabolic burden due to the high level of pathway engineering,
cofactor imbalance, or toxicity of intermediates and/orﬁnal products.
To overcome the drawbacks of engineering single chassis strain, the
establishment of synthetic microbial communities by engineering
multiple strains that cooperate during the bioprocess has been
proposed
1– 3. By dividing the labor among multiple strains, synthetic
communities are able to improve the functionality of each member,
reduce metabolic burden and engineering complexity, and accomplish
high efﬁciency of production as found in natural consortia
1,2,4.
In natural communities, there are various cellular interactions that
determine the dynamics of the consortia, such as competition, com-
mensalism, mutualism, or neutralism
5. When it comes to synthetic
consortia, designing a proper interaction between members are cru-
cial for constructing a stable and robust synthetic community

stable coexistence by tying together the members in the community5,6.
One way to achieve cross-feeding is by using co-auxotrophic strains
that exchange essential amino acids to allow each other to grow
7,8.
It has been generally regarded that yeast co-cultures were not as
effective as bacterial ones in forming co-auxotrophic communities,
except for strains engineered to produce higher amount of amino
acids
8. Recently, we performed high-throughput screening of syn-
trophic interactions in the model yeastSaccharomyces cerevisiaeby
using yeast knockout library9,10. From this study, 49 pairwise auxo-
troph combinations which is 3.6% of tested pairs were identiﬁed to
spontaneously form syntrophic communities and some of them were
tested for division of labor, leading to improved bioproduction

ﬁnding suggests that cross-feeding-based communities could be
formed in other yeast species, including those with high industrial
potential.

this yeast include robustness, stress tolerance, being amenable by
synthetic biology tools, and high cell density cultivation. Most research
using Y. lipolyticahave focused on engineering in a single strain. The
studies on microbial communities using this yeast are so far limited.
There are few studies of co-culture usingY. lipolyticawith other species
for bioremediation or feedstock utilization with the modulation of

lipoltyica strains. A modular co-culture dividing the pathway for
boosting precursor pools and amorphadiene synthesis resulted in the
improved titers
21. These works highlight the increasing interest in
creating communities ofY. lipolytica. However, tools for controlling
population dynamics, such as cross-feeding9, to maximize robustness
and efﬁciency have not yet been developed inY. lipolytica.
In this study, we explored the creation of syntrophic communities
of Y. lipolyticausing auxotrophic strains and identiﬁed pairs exhibiting
synergistic growths, which were further characterized. TheY. lipolytica
auxotrophic strains were also evaluated for establishing the inter-
species syntrophic growth withS. cerevisiae auxotrophs. Weﬁnally
developed a division of labor strategy for the production of a bio-
plastic precursor, 3-hydroxypropionic acid, employing syntrophic
intraspecies and interspecies communities, which resulted in
increased bioproduction.
Results
Establishing syntheticY. lipolyticacommunities by engineering
cross-feeding behaviors
To evaluate if auxotrophs ofY. lipolyticacould form syntrophic com-
munities by exchanging essential metabolites, we constructed the
strains Δlys5, Δtrp2, Δtrp4, Δmet5, Δura3 and Δleu2, auxotrophic for
lysine, tryptophan, methionine, uracil, and leucine.
The growth of 15 paired combinations from these six auxotrophs
was tested at a 1:1 inoculation ratio in YNBD media without amino acid
supplementation. The observed growth of the tested combinations
can be grouped into three categories according to their maximal
OD
600 during the cultivation (Fig.1a, Supplementary Table 1, Supple-
mentary Figs. 1, 2): high (OD600 ≧ 0.55): Δura3-Δtrp4, Δura3-Δmet5,
Δleu2-Δtrp4, Δlys5-Δtrp4,a n d Δtrp4-Δmet5;m o d e r a t e( 0 . 3 2≦

Δlys5-Δmet5,a n dΔtrp2-Δtrp4;a n dl o w( O D600 < 0.32):Δura3-Δleu2,
Δleu2-Δlys5, Δleu2-Δmet5,a n dΔtrp2-Δmet5. Among the high-growth
combinations, three pairs (Δleu2-Δtrp4, Δlys5-Δtrp4,a n dΔtrp4-Δmet5)
showed a constant increase in growth, while the other two pairs
(Δura3-Δtrp4 and Δura3-Δmet5) exhibited an exponential growth after
a certain time of lag phase (40 and 20 hours, respectively) (Fig.1b,
Supplementary Fig. 1). Positive correlation between growth and
glucose consumption depending on the auxotroph pairs was
observed (Supplementary Fig. 3). The shortest lag phase, 12 hours,
was found in the combination ofΔtrp2 and Δtrp4, and the stationary
phase was reached at 36 hours of cultivation. While theﬁnal OD
600
reached by theΔtrp2 and Δtrp4 did not rank amongst the top, it
exhibited the highest growth rate compared to other combinations
(Supplementary Table 1). The prolonged lag phase in some of the
synthetic communities could be originated by the needs of each
population to adapt their metabolism to export metabolites, which is
required by its partner, and/or to import metabolites secreted from
the partner
10.
Characterization of growth dynamics of synthetic cross-feeding
communities
We characterized population dynamics of three selected pairs (Δura3-
Δtrp4, Δtrp4-Δmet5,a n dΔtrp2-Δtrp4) by varying the inoculation ratios
from 10:1 to 1:10 (Fig.2). Changes in inoculation ratios exhibited con-
siderable differences in growth patterns, which suggest that certain
population ratios favor syntrophic growth. In the pair ofΔura3-Δtrp4,
the inoculation ratios of 10:1 and 5:1 showed a shorter lag phase than
other ratios, suggesting the importance of having moreΔura3 cells at
the beginning of the culture (Fig.2a). Despite the shorter lag phase for
these ratios, all inoculation ratios reached a similarﬁnal OD
600 at
120 hours. In addition, regardless of the initial ratio, the population
tended to stabilize at the end of the stationary phase, maintaining a
ratio ofΔura3:Δtrp4 between 1:1.2 and1:1.8 (Fig.2d, g, Supplementary
Fig. 5). In the case ofΔmet5-Δtrp4 pair, the coculture with initial ratios
of 1:1, 1:5 and 1:10 started growing earlier than those with 10:1 and 5:1
(Fig. 2b). At ratios of 10:1 and 5:1, the cocultures showed a mild growth
until 48 hours followed by exponential phase. Theﬁnal OD
600 was
correlated with the inoculation ratio from 1:10 to 10:1 which also cor-
responded to glucose consumption (Supplementary Fig. 4). At the
stationary phase, the population ratio was stabilized in all cases
(Δmet5:Δtrp4 between 1:1.0 and 1:1.9 (Fig.2e, h, Supplementary Fig. 6).
The pair ofΔtrp2-Δtrp4 showed a faster growth at all inoculation ratios
compared to other combination tested (Fig.2c). The ratio 1:10 showed
the shortest lag followed by 1:5 and 1:1, while the ratios of 5:1 and 10:1
resulted in a longer lag phase and lowerﬁnal OD
600. Since the muta-
tions Δtrp2 and Δtrp4 are both mapped in the same tryptophan
synthesis pathway, the growth between these two auxotrophs is
achieved by the exchange of intermediates, which are known to be
anthranilate and indole/tryptophan inS. cerevisiae
10.I n S. cerevisiae,
the coculture of Δtrp2-Δtrp4 was naturally highly enriched in one
population, Δtrp2 cells, after inoculating at 1:1 ratio. Similarly, a
majority ofΔtrp2 cells were found in theY. lipolyticacoculture at 10:1
and 5:1 inoculation ratios, which showed a slower and lower growth
compared to other inoculation ratios (Fig.2f, Supplementary Fig. 7).
However, inY. lipolytica, the ratio resulting in better growth exhibited
different population dynamics, the ratio ofΔtrp2:Δtrp4 at the sta-
tionary phase was 1:1.5 from the inoculation ratio of 1:5 and 1:10
(Fig. 2i). These considerable distinct population dynamics between
two species suggest differences in metabolite exchange rates or
mechanisms betweenS. cerevisiaeand Y. lipolytica.
Establishing cross-feeding communities between two yeast
species, Y. lipolyticaand S. cerevisiae
After demonstrating the formation of stable cross-feeding co-cultures
between two Y. lipolytica auxotrophs, we decided to test whether
the syntrophic growth could be established between the two species,
Y. lipolyticaand S. cerevisiae.W es e l e c t e dt h eY. lipolyticaauxotrophs
described above (YLΔtrp2,Y LΔtrp4,Y LΔmet5,a n dY LΔlys5) and the

10.T h r e ep a i r s( Y LΔtrp2-SCΔtrp4,S CΔtrp2-

interspecies coculture (Fig.3a, Supplementary Fig. 8). The growth

dynamics differed depending on the auxotrophies and species
involved. For example, the pair of YLΔmet5-SCΔtrp4 did not grow while
SCΔmet5-YLΔtrp4 showed higher OD600 than the coculture of YLΔ-
met5-YLΔtrp4. This might be due to the different metabolite exchange
rates among species. As SCΔtrp2-YLΔtrp4 pair showed higher growth
compared to other auxotrophic pairs, we further characterized the
population dynamics of SCΔtrp2-YLΔtrp4 and YLΔtrp2-YLΔtrp4 by
inoculating different ratios (Fig.3b– e, Supplementary Figs. 9 and 10).
Both cocultures showed better growth at 1:1, 1:5, and 1:10 initial ratios.
However, the inoculation ratios of 10:1 and 5:1 in SCΔtrp2-YLΔtrp4
failed to grow, which could indicate that the exchange of the inter-
mediate (anthranilate) was not enough for SCΔtrp2 to grow in these
conditions. The populations of SCΔtrp2-YLΔtrp4 stabilized between
the ratios of 1:0.9 and 1:1.5 at the stationary phase, which differs from
the skewed population distribution of the SCΔtrp2-SCΔtrp4 coculture.
To validate whether different cultivation conditions affect the syn-
trophic growth of SCΔtrp2-YLΔtrp4, especially regarding a potential
inﬂuence of the Crabtree effect, co-cultures of SCΔtrp2-YLΔtrp4 with
different glucose concentrations (20 and 100 g/L) and aeration con-
dition (aerobic and semi-anaerobic) were performed (Supplementary
Fig. 11). At 20 g/L of glucose, the coculture SCΔtrp2 :Y LΔtrp4 showed
growth at 1:1 ratio in semi-anaerobic conditions, while no growth was
observed in aerobic conditions. We observed a higher production of
ethanol in the 1:1 ratio than in the 1:10 ratio, suggesting the Crabtree
e f f e c th e l p e dt h eg r o w t ho fS CΔtrp2. At a higher glucose concentration
(100 g/L), in both aerobic and semi-anaerobic conditions, we generally
observed higher growth when there was a higher presence of theΔtrp4
strain. In the SC-YL co-culture, we observed the Crabtree effect, as
reﬂected by the ethanol production (100 g/L glucose, semi-anaerobic
condition) that seemed to come from SCΔtrp2. As expected, a negli-
gible amount of ethanol was observed in YL-YL co-culture in the same
condition.
Division of labor in cross-feeding communities improves
bioproduction
Splitting metabolic pathways between strains in communities (division
of labor) can be effective for bioproduction as it can reduce metabolic
burden and avoid bottlenecks or toxic intermediates2.A sap r o o fo f
concept, we aimed to synthesize a value-added molecule by splitting
the biosynthesis pathway into a cross-feeding community. We selected
the Δtrp2-Δtrp4 pair because of its shorter lag phase and more rapid
growth (Fig.1).

3-Hydroxypropionic acid (3-HP, C3H6O3) is a desired platform
chemical with a wide range of applications, as identiﬁed by the US
Department of Energy in 2004. It is a precursor of acrylic acid, 1, 3-
propandiol, malonic acid, biodegradable polyesters, and other valu-
able chemicals
22,23. In order to synthesize 3-HP, we selected the bio-
synthetic pathway through β-alanine and malonic semialdehyde,
which has not yet been applied inY. lipolytica. This pathway requires
the expression of three enzymes, aspartate-1-decarboxylase (TcPAND
from Tribolium castaneum), β-alanine-pyruvate aminotransferase
(BcBAPAT from Bacillus cereus), and 3-hydroxypropanoate dehy-
drogenase (EcYDFG fromEscherichia coli)( F i g .4a)
23. The 3-HP pathway
was split into module P, expressing TcPAND, and module B, expressing
BcBAPAT and EcYDFG. Each module is integrated into two distinct
auxotrophic strains, thereby generating a community that relies on the
transport of β-alanine from one strain to another for producing
3-HP (Fig.4b).
First, we tested intraspeciesY. lipolyticacommunities with divi-
sion of labor and compared them with two WT controls, monoculture
and coculture (Fig.4, Supplementary Figs. 12 and 15). The WT mono-
culture bears three enzymes without division of labor and the WT
coculture is composed of two strains, one harboring module P (WT-P)
and the other module B (WT-B), thereby implementing division of
labor but without cross-feeding. The growth was comparable between
the WT monoculture and the WT coculture (Fig.4c). The production of
3-HP was two times lower in the WT coculture compared to the WT
monoculture (Fig.4d), suggesting that division of labor, without cross-
feeding, was not beneﬁcial. In the case of the cross-feeding commu-
nities, the growth varied depending on the inoculation ratio of
the strainsΔtrp2 with module B (Δtrp2-B) and Δtrp4 with module P
(Δtrp4-P) (Fig.4c), which is consistent with the result shown in Fig.3c.
When the initial ratio was 1:10 (Δtrp2-B:Δtrp4-P), the synthetic com-
munity reached a similar OD
600 as the WT monoculture after 48 hours
of cultivation (Fig.4c). However, the growth of coculture with initial
ratios of 1:1 and 10:1 resulted in lower growth. The production of
metabolites varied signiﬁcantly with the inoculation ratio. Coculture at
the ratio of 1:10 showed a comparable 3-HP production (0.26 mM) to
one from the WT monoculture. The coculture ofΔtrp2-Ba n dΔtrp4-P
with an initial ratio of 10:1 reached a production of 4.67 mM of 3-HP,
which is 19.3 times higher than the WT monoculture. Instead, WT
monoculture produced higher citrate than co-culture (Supplementary
Figs. 15 and 16). The higher ratio of module B in the communities
showed higher 3-HP production, suggesting that the conversion ofβ-
alanine to 3-HP is more important than the one from L-aspartate toβ-
alanine for higher production of 3-HP.
As cross-feeding communities were successfully established
between Y. lipolyticaand S. cerevisiae, we then decided to study the
division of labor within this interspecies community. The strain pairs
YLΔtrp2-SCΔtrp4 and SCΔtrp2-YLΔtrp4,e a c hw i t hd i f f e r e n t3 - H P
synthesis modules, were cultured using different initial inoculation
ratios (Fig. 4, Supplementary Fig. 13). Consistently with what was
observed for the corresponding cocultures without 3-HP bioproduc-
tion modules (Fig.3c), different growth and metabolite proﬁles were
observed depending on the inoculation ratio (Supplementary Fig. 10).
The production of 3-HP varied depending on the combination of
species and modules used for 3-HP production. Higher 3-HP produc-
tion was commonly obtained with the ratio of B:P = 10:1 which is con-
sistent with the result ofY. lipolyticaintraspecies communities. This
also demonstrates an effective transport ofβ-alanine from theΔtrp2-P
strain to theΔtrp4-B strain in the syntrophic community. The highest
3-HP production from interspecies communities was achieved at 10:1
ratio of SCΔtrp2-B:YLΔtrp4-P, reaching 4.50 mM which is 40.3 and 18.6
times higher than the one from the WT monoculture ofS. cerevisiae
and Y. lipolytica, respectively (Fig.4d, Supplementary Fig. 14). There-
fore, these results successfully demonstrated an improvement of 3-HP
production through pathway split (and likely division of labor) in both
types of synthetic cross-feeding communities, the intraspecies ofY.
lipolyticaand the interspecies ofY. lipolyticaand S. cerevisiae.

In nature, many microorganisms are auxotrophs and therefore rely on
external nutrients (including amino acids) for their growth24.T h i s

communities often require a high level of engineering to maintain the
stability of the coculture and control the population

the applicability and universality of these methods. Auxotrophic-based
cross-feeding offers a simpler alternative to creating stable commu-
nities. However, identifying the adequate pairs of auxotrophs able to
establish syntrophic interactions is challenging as metabolic costs and
energy requirements for the synthesis of each amino acid or meta-
bolite vary and their transport systems are not fully understood
27– 29.
Here, we aimed to uncover spontaneous syntrophic communities
in Y. lipolytica.O u to fﬁfteen combinations involving six auxotroph
strains,ﬁve exhibited robust syntrophic growth, and six demonstrated
a slower but still discernible growth at an initial ratio of 1:1. Further
investigation by modulating the initial inoculation ratio could poten-
tially unveil additional auxotrophic pairs capable of establishing syn-
trophic communities. Generally, the success of syntrophic interaction
is thought to be determined by the rates of import, export, and con-
sumption of the involved metabolites, as the depletion of one of the
metabolites before establishing the syntrophy can lead to the collapse
of the community
30. Therefore, pairs that failed to establish sponta-
neous syntrophic interactions might be attributed to low production
or a limited transport system of speciﬁc metabolites that need to be
provided to the other member of the community. Engineering strains
to overproduce speciﬁc metabolites through the regulation of feed-
back inhibition or the strengthening carbonﬂux towards their synth-
esis could be beneﬁcial in promoting syntrophic interactions, as
demonstrated independently in bothE. coliand S. cerevisiae

more fundamental level, it would be beneﬁcial to study the transport
mechanisms of metabolites, including amino acids inY. lipolytica.
Understanding the secretion or uptake of metabolites is pivotal in
order to improve stable syntrophic interactions. Employing omics
approaches, such as metagenomic sequencing
7 and exometabolomic
analysis32,33 could contribute to unravel some of these transport sys-
tems and better understand microbial cross-feeding within synthetic
communities.
In this work, we also demonstrated spontaneous syntrophic
growth between two yeast species,Y. lipolyticaand S. cerevisiae.Ap a i r
of Δtrp2-Δtrp4 demonstrated successful syntrophic interaction
between two strains regardless of the combination of the auxotroph
pairs and the species. InS. cerevisiae communities, Δtrp2-Δtrp4 has
been described to exhibit an extremely unbalanced population dis-
tribution, with one strain dominating the coculture (over 95% of

Δtrp2)10. A similar trend was observed in theY. lipolyticacommunities
at inoculation ratios of 10:1 and 5:1, however, the population was more
balanced (Δtrp2:Δtrp4 of 1:0.9-1.5) at the ratio of 1:5 and 1:10 (Fig.2f, i).
In the interspecies coculture ofΔtrp2-Δtrp4, a balanced population was
achieved in all tested strains, species, and ratios (Fig.3e), highlighting
the potential of interspecies syntrophic communities to provide an
additional level of control. In speciﬁc inoculation ratios (10:1 and 1:1) of
the SCΔtrp2-YLΔtrp4 coculture, growth failed to occur, suggesting an
insufﬁcient exchange of metabolites in this experimental condition.
Similarly, the pair of YLΔmet5-SCΔtrp4 was unable to grow, while
SCΔmet5-YLΔtrp4 grew. This observation might also be explained by
different exchange rates of metabolites in different species
7,10.I n t e r -
dependent cocultures for bioproduction have so far mostly been
explored using model microorganisms
1,34. Our results suggest a
broader applicability of syntrophic interactions beyond model
microorganisms, paving the way for designing synthetic communities
of non-conventional yeasts for bioproduction.
To study the effect of division of labor and cross-feeding in bio-
production by synthetic communities, we divided the biosynthetic
pathway of 3-HP into two modules. The coculture of YLΔtrp2-Ba n d
YLΔtrp4-P, with an initial ratio of 10:1, produced 19.3 times higher 3-HP
(4.67 mM) than the WT monoculture harboring the complete 3-HP
synthetic pathway in a single strain. Notably, this synthetic pathway
convertingβ-alanine into 3-HP was investigated inY. lipolyticafor the
ﬁrst time in this study. The growth and metabolite analysis (Supple-
mentary Fig. 16) suggests that the higher 3-HP production found in the
co-cultures originated from a higher availability of pyruvate, a
common precursor of 3-HP and citrate. This result underscores that
the division of labor within a synthetic community can be used to
validate undiscovered synthetic pathways, in addition to the tradi-
tional approach of embedding the entire pathway in a single strain. The
production of 3-HP was further improved in the interspecies cross-
feeding community, YLΔtrp2-Ba n dS CΔtrp4-P at a 10:1 inoculation
ratio, reaching 3.96 mM of 3-HP. This is slightly higher than the
reported 0.35 g/L (3.88 mM) of 3-HP production inY. lipolyticahar-
boring the alternative pathway from malonyl-CoA
22.
When it comes to MSA production inS. cerevisiaecommunities,
the coculture of Δtrp2-B:Δtrp4-P = 10:1 produced the highest MSA
among different inoculation ratios but also outperformed the mono-
culture, which is consistent with the MSA production in a previous
study ofS. cerevisiaecommunities (Supplementary Table 4 and Sup-
plementary Figs. 14 and 18)
10. However, the production of MSA inS.
cerevisiae co-culture atΔtrp2-B:Δtrp4-P = 1:1 and 1:10 was negligible,
although it was higher than the monoculture in the previous study.
This might be due to the different promoters used for expressing

and different cultivation scales.
In the case of 3-HP production,S. cerevisiaeco-culture at speciﬁc
inoculation ratio (Δtrp2-B:Δtrp4-P = 1:1) performed better than theS.
cerevisiae monoculture (Supplementary Fig. 14, Supplementary
Table 4). The level of total metabolites produced from theΔtrp2-B
strain (MSA and 3-HP) in the coculture ofΔtrp2-B:Δtrp4-P = 10:1 is
higher than the one from the monoculture (Supplementary Table 4

pathway of 3-HP as a proof of concept, but further modiﬁcations can
lead to improve titers. Increased production is expected through
additional engineering strategies such as promoter engineering, multi-
copy integration, and precursor and/or cofactor supply. Overall, this
work demonstrates that the combination of cross-feeding and
inoculation ratio to control population dynamics in synthetic yeast
communities with division of labor has the potential to improve the
production of valuable molecules. It is worth noting that further
research is required to understand the complex relationship between
division of labor and bioproduction and fully correlate them both.

The strategy described here could be expanded to multiple organisms
(and their combination) and compounds of interest.
In conclusion, we successfully demonstrated the establishment of
a stable synthetic cross-feeding yeast community employing auxo-
trophs ofY. lipolytica, an yeast of high industrial interest. Synthetic
communities ofY. lipolyticawere characterized in terms of growth and
population dynamics, considering different auxotrophic pairs and
inoculation ratios. Ourﬁndings conﬁrmed that speciﬁc auxotrophs can
exchange metabolites with other members, facilitating spontaneous
growth in both intraspecies (Y. lipolytica)a n di n t e r s p e c i e s(Y. lipolytica
and S. cerevisiae) communities. We further explored the division of
labor and bioproduction of 3-HP within these syntrophic communities.
Notably, we found a 3-HP production improvement by 19.3 and 18.6
times when labor was divided in intra- and interspecies communities
compared to theY. lipolytica monoculture, respectively. This study
represents theﬁrst demonstration of a division of labor for biosyn-
thetic heterologous pathway using syntrophic communities of
Y. lipolytica.O u rﬁndings shed light on the potential of utilizing non-
conventional microorganisms to form enhanced synthetic commu-
nities for bioproduction of various value-added molecules.
Methods
Strains and media
The E. colistrains DH5α and TOP10 were used for plasmid construc-
tion. E. colistrains were grown at 37 °C in Luria−Bertani (LB) medium
(containing 1% tryptone, 0.5% yeast extract, and 1% sodium chloride) or
on LB agar with appropriate antibiotics.
PCR ampliﬁcations were performed in a PCR ProFlexTM (Applied
Biosystems) with Q5 High-Fidelity DNA Polymerase (New England
Biolabs). PCR fragments were puriﬁed with a QIAgen Puriﬁcation Kit
(Qiagen). The plasmids used in this study were constructed by Golden
Gate Assembly, as described in Yuzbashev et al.
35. In brief, each com-
ponent for GG assembly was cloned to Lv0 plasmid by using BsmBI. Lv1
plasmid containing the speciﬁc overhang for Lv2 plasmid was then
constructed by assembling the Lv0 plasmid consisting of promoter,
gene, and terminator using BsaI. Finally, the Lv2 plasmid containing
two or three transcription units was constructed by using BsmBI. To
verify the correct construction of plasmids, PCR with GoTaq DNA
polymerases (Promega) and digestion by restriction enzyme (New
England Biolabs) were carried out.
Y. lipolyticawas routinely grown at 30 °C in YPD medium which
consists of 1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, and 2% glucose, or yeast
synthetic medium (YNBD) which includes 0.17% yeast nitrogen base
without amino acids and ammonium sulfate, 0.5% ammonium chlor-
ide, 50 mM phosphate buffer (KH
2PO4-Na2HPO4,p H 6 . 8 ) ,a n d2 %g l u -
cose. To prepare the solid medium, 1.5% agar was added to the
respective liquid medium. To complement auxotrophic processes,
uracil, leucine, lysine, methionine, or tryptophan were added at a
concentration of 0.1 g/L, as necessary.
To introduce gene expression cassettes intoY. lipolytica,N o t I -
linearized plasmids were transformed into competent cells by the
lithium acetate/DTT method. The gene expression cassettes were
randomly integrated into the genome ofY. lipolytica.T r a n s f o r m a n t s
were selected on YNBD media containing the appropriate amino acids
for their speciﬁc genotype. Positive transformants were then con-
ﬁrmed by colony PCR with Phire Plant Direct PCR master mix (Thermo
Fisher). Auxotroph strains were constructed by homologous recom-
bination of promoter and terminator region of marker gene. The
resulting auxotroph strains were veriﬁed on YNBD media with/without
the corresponding amino acids. The removal of the selection marker
was carried out via the Cre-LoxP system. The strains and plasmids used
in this study are listed in Table1. The primers used for cloning and
veriﬁcation are listed in Supplementary Table 2. The sequence of
heterologous genes for 3-HP synthesis are listed in Supplementary
Table 3.
Growth andﬂuorescence analysis of yeast co-culture in 96
well plate
The yeast strains were initially cultured in YPD medium and cultivated
overnight at 30 °C and 250 rpm. The cells were then washed three
times with distilled water. Subsequently, the cells were inoculated into
a 96-well plate containing 200μl of YNBD media in triplicate. The
initial OD600 of culture, both monoculture and co-culture, was adjus-
ted to 0.1. The inoculation ratios of the co-culture varied between 10:1,
5:1, 1:1, 1:5, and 1:10. The plate was incubated at 30 °C with continuous
shaking for 120 hours. The growth andﬂuorescence of each strain were
monitored using a Spark Tecan or Biotek instrument every 30 min
using the following settings: OD
600, absorbance at 600 nm; GFP,
excitation at 485 nm and emission at 535 nm; RFP, excitation at 560 nm
and emission at 620 nm; mTAGBFP2, excitation at 400 nm and emis-
sion at 465 nm; and mScarlet-I, excitation at 560 nm and emission
at 620 nm.
Population analysis by Flow cytometry
Population of each member in the synthetic community was calculated
by the differentﬂuorescence of each strain. Cellﬂuorescence was
measured by an Attune NxT Flow Cytometer (Thermo Scientiﬁc) with
the following settings: FSC 100 V, SSC 355 V, BL1 345 V, YL2 510 V.
Attune Cytometric software was used for data collection. Fluorescence
data was collected from at least 10,000 cells for each experiment with
three biological replicates.
Growth analysis of yeast co-culture for 3-HP production inﬂask
The strains were initially cultured in YNBD medium with tryptophan
and cultivated overnight at 30 °C and 250 rpm. The cells were then
washed three times with distilled water. Subsequently, the cells were
inoculated into theﬂask containing 10 ml of YNBD media at the initial
OD of 0.1, for both monoculture and co-culture. The cells were incu-
bated at 30 °C with 250 rpm for 120 hours. Samples were taken during
cultivation to measure the OD
600 and quantify metabolites in the
pathway of 3-HP. OD600 values fromﬂask samples were measured by
using cuvettes in a UV/Visible spectrophotometer (Biochrom WPA
Lightwave II) then normalized by using calibration curve (Supple-
mentary Fig. 17) to compare OD
600 v a l u e sb e t w e e nm i c r o p l a t er e a d e r
and spectrophotometer measured in this study. Raw OD600 data from
each spectrophotometer are included in Supplementary Table 5.
Quantiﬁcation of metabolites
Metabolites including glucose, glycerol, citrate, and ethanol were
analyzed by HPLC. The supernatant of cultures at each time point was
diluted twenty times with distilled water before the analysis. The HPLC
system was equipped with an Thermo Fisher UltiMate 3000 system
and Aminex HPX-87H column (300 mm × 7.8 mm, Bio-RAD, USA)
coupled to UV (210 nm) and RI detectors. The mobile phase used was
0.01 N H
2SO4 with a ﬂow rate of 0.6 mL/min and the column tem-
perature was T = 35 °C. The raw data from HPLC were processed by
Chromeleon software (Thermo Scientiﬁc). Concentration of metabo-
lites was quantiﬁed by the calibration curve of each standard.
Metabolites in the 3-HP pathway, β-alanine, malonic semi-
aldehyde, and 3-HP, were analyzed by LC-MS. The supernatant of
cultures at each time point was diluted four times with 50% acetonitrile
for the analysis. The LC-MS system was equipped with an Agilent 1290
Inﬁnity LC system with an Agilent 6550 quadrupole time-of-ﬂight mass
spectrometer. An Agilent Poroshell 120 HILIC-Z, 2.1 × 100 mm, 1.9µm,
column was used at a temperature of 45 °C with a solventﬂow rate of
0.25 ml min
−1. LC separation was performed with buffer A (10 mM
ammonium formate in water) and buffer B (10 mM ammonium for-
mate in water:ACN 10:90 (vol:vol)). After 0.5 min at 98% buffer B, the
composition was changed to 5% buffer B over 2.5 min, then held at 5%
buffer B for 1 min. Injection volume was 1μl, and negative ion spectra
were recorded over a mass range of 100– 1000 m/z at a rate of

1 spectrum per second. All metabolites were qualiﬁed by the functional
m/z values.β-Alanine and 3-HP were quantiﬁed by the calibration curve
of the standards. Malonic semialdehyde was semi-quantiﬁed by the
standard curves ofβ-alanine10. The raw data from LC-MS were pro-
cessed by Agilent MassHunter Qualitative Analysis software (Supple-
mentary Table 6).
Statistics and reproducibility
All experimental data were analyzed using Microsoft Excel 365 and
Prism 9.5.0 (GraphPad) software. The error bars in the Figs.1, 2,a n d3
correspond to the standard deviation fromN = 3 biologically inde-
pendent samples as described inﬁgure legend. Statistical analyzes
were conducted using one-way ANOVA, followed by Bonferroni’s
multiple comparisons test with 95% conﬁdence intervals, andp values
are provided in the source data. The error bars in the Fig.4 correspond
to the standard deviation fromN = 2 biologically independent samples
as described inﬁgure legend.
