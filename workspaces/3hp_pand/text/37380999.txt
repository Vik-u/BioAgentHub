Abstract
Background Production of 3-hydroxypropionic acid (3-HP) through the malonyl-CoA pathway has yielded promising 
results in Pichia pastoris (Komagataella phaffii), demonstrating the potential of this cell factory to produce this platform 
chemical and other acetyl-CoA-derived products using glycerol as a carbon source. However, further metabolic 
engineering of the original P . pastoris 3-HP-producing strains resulted in unexpected outcomes, e.g., significantly 
lower product yield and/or growth rate. To gain an understanding on the metabolic constraints underlying these 
observations, the fluxome (metabolic flux phenotype) of ten 3-HP-producing P . pastoris strains has been characterized 
using a high throughput 13C-metabolic flux analysis platform. Such platform enabled the operation of an optimised 
workflow to obtain comprehensive maps of the carbon flux distribution in the central carbon metabolism in a 
parallel-automated manner, thereby accelerating the time-consuming strain characterization step in the design-
build-test-learn cycle for metabolic engineering of P . pastoris.
Results We generated detailed maps of the carbon fluxes in the central carbon metabolism of the 3-HP producing 
strain series, revealing the metabolic consequences of different metabolic engineering strategies aimed at improving 
NADPH regeneration, enhancing conversion of pyruvate into cytosolic acetyl-CoA, or eliminating by-product (arabitol) 
formation. Results indicate that the expression of the POS5 NADH kinase leads to a reduction in the fluxes of the 
pentose phosphate pathway reactions, whereas an increase in the pentose phosphate pathway fluxes was observed 
when the cytosolic acetyl-CoA synthesis pathway was overexpressed. Results also show that the tight control of the 
glycolytic flux hampers cell growth due to limited acetyl-CoA biosynthesis. When the cytosolic acetyl-CoA synthesis 
pathway was overexpressed, the cell growth increased, but the product yield decreased due to higher growth-
associated ATP costs. Finally, the six most relevant strains were also cultured at pH 3.5 to assess the effect of a lower 
pH on their fluxome. Notably, similar metabolic fluxes were observed at pH 3.5 compared to the reference condition 
at pH 5.

Background
The methylotrophic yeast Pichia pastoris  (syn. Komaga-
taella phaffii) has gained a lot of attention in the recent 
years due to its increased use in metabolic engineering 
applications [1–3]. Recent studies have shown the great 
potential of P. pastoris to produce 3-HP [ 4, 5]. 3-HP is 
a bulk chemical with a large interest due to its multiple 
applications. It was listed among the top-value added 
products to be obtained from biomass by the Department 
of Energy of the United States [6]. 3-HP can be converted 
to acrylic acid, which is used to produce superabsorbent 
plastics, as well as to other chemicals of interest, such as 
malonic acid or 1,3-propanediol [6, 7].
3-HP production in P. pastoris  has recently been 
achieved by heterologously expressing the bi-functional 
enzyme malonyl-CoA reductase (MCR) from Chloro-
flexus aurantiacus [4]. Further strain optimization based 
on rational strain engineering resulted in somewhat lim -
ited improvement (ca. 50% increase) of product yield [ 5] 
compared to similar strategies to increase the production 
of 3-HP in other yeasts [ 8, 9]. So far, the highest 3-HP 
production reported in P. pastoris is 37.1 g L− 1 of 3-HP at 
a volumetric productivity of 0.71 g L − 1 h− 1 in a fed-batch 
culture using glycerol as a carbon source [5].
One of the advantages of using P. pastoris to produce 
3-HP is its ability to grow at a low pH. Performing the 
cultures at an acidic pH allows the organic acids extrac -
tion from the fermentation media using non-toxic sol -
vents. This process is simpler, and it generates less waste 
products than classical downstream processes [ 10, 11]. 
Moreover, in situ product recovery systems can be imple-
mented, avoiding reaching toxic levels of 3-HP [ 12]. 
However, while the cultivation of P. pastoris at pH as low 
as 3 has been widely studied as a strategy to minimise 
the activity of some endogenous proteases [ 13, 14], there 
are no previous studies on the impact of low pH on the 
fluxome of P. pastoris.
Recent advances in the field of synthetic biology allow 
the generation of a high number of recombinant micro -
bial strains in a short amount of time within a single 
metabolic engineering project. Typically, the strains are 
tested in small scale cultivation systems such as microti -
ter plates or shake flasks, and the best performing ones 
are further characterized at a bioreactor scale. However, 
due to the development of high throughput (HT) biore -
actor platforms, it is now possible to characterize a whole 
set of genotypic variants at the fluxomic level providing 
the most complete and systematic description of the met-
abolic state of a cell [15–17]. A strain’s fluxome is a result 
derived from the combination of its genome, transcrip -
tome, proteome, and metabolome, and the regulatory 
interactions between these components. Thus, fluxomics 
can be used to identify regulatory mechanisms that may 
be hampering a strain’s performance [18, 19].
13C-Metabolic Flux Analysis ( 13C-MFA) is the most 
widespread technique for the quantification of the fluxes 
[20]. It consists in using a 13C-labelled substrate as tracer 
to latter infer the metabolic reaction rates. HT analysis 
of multiple strains has focused on stationary 13C-MFA 
(i.e., cells are collected at a metabolic and isotopic steady 
state) because the sampling protocol is easier to autom -
atize compared to instationary 13C-MFA, as there is a 
remarkably lower number of samples to process and 
analyse [16]. The use of 13C-MFA for the characterization 
of P. pastoris fluxes has been largely reported using glu -
cose, glycerol, or combinations of thereof with methanol 
[21–23]. Nonetheless, the exploitation of HT 13C-MFA 
tools and methodologies for the characterisation of P. 
pastoris metabolism remains largely unexplored. In this 
study, we have applied a workflow that allows the char -
acterisation of the fluxome of multiple strains in parallel. 
Such workflow integrates all relevant steps from experi -
mental design to data acquisition and processing, and 
flux calculation (Fig.  1), providing detailed supporting 
information to facilitate its transferability to other inves -
tigations. Notably, the workflow includes the generation 
of a genome-scale reduced metabolic model applying a 
compression protocol to a previously described Genome 
Scale Metabolic (GSM) model of P. pastoris [23, 24]. The 
aim of this study was to understand the impact of differ -
ent genetic modifications into the fluxome of a set of P. 
pastoris strains that produce 3-HP using glycerol as a sole 
carbon source. The fluxomics analyses provided mean -
ingful insights of the bottlenecks of this yeast’s metabo -
lism towards 3-HP production. Moreover, the fluxome of 
the 3-HP producing strains was also characterized at pH 
Conclusions This study shows that existing fluoxomics workflows for high-throughput analyses of metabolic 
phenotypes can be adapted to investigate P . pastoris, providing valuable information on the impact of genetic 
manipulations on the metabolic phenotype of this yeast. Specifically, our results highlight the metabolic robustness 
of P . pastoris’s central carbon metabolism when genetic modifications are made to increase the availability of NADPH 
and cytosolic acetyl-CoA. Such knowledge can guide further metabolic engineering of these strains. Moreover, 
insights into the metabolic adaptation of P . pastoris to an acidic pH have also been obtained, showing the capability of 
the fluoxomics workflow to assess the metabolic impact of environmental changes.

Materials and methods
Strains
The P. pastoris  strains used in this study are listed in 
Table 1. These were all derived from the parental strain 
X-33 (Invitrogen-Thermo Fisher Scientific, MA, USA), 
which was used as a reference strain for this study. The 
construction of all strains has been previously described 
elsewhere [4, 5].
Model generation
The genome scale model iMT1026v3 [ 24, 26] was com -
pressed using CellNetAnalyzer 2021.1 [ 27] in Matlab 
R2020b (Matlab inc., Mathworks, MA, USA). A con -
textualized core model was generated conserving the 
reactions, metabolites, and phenotypes that had been 
previously described for P. pastoris grown on glycerol as 
sole carbon source [ 23]. Additionally, D-arabitol secre -
tion was conserved, as it has been previously reported 
that theses strains produce D-arabitol as by-product in 
both batch and fed-batch cultures [ 4]. Cytosolic acetate 
production was also kept during model compression, as 
cytosolic acetate is used as substrate for 3-HP produc -
tion. The models and scripts to compress iMT1026v3 
model into a core model can be found in the Supplemen -
tary File S1.
The newly generated core model was manually curated 
considering relevant literature-based knowledge. First, 
production of isoleucine consumes mitochondrial pyru -
vate instead of 2-(α-hydroxyethyl)thiamine diphosphate. 
The production of lysine uses mitochondrial acetyl-CoA 
and α-ketoglutarate from the cytosol, instead of vice 
versa. Finally, alanine production is derived from mito -
chondrial pyruvate, instead of cytosolic pyruvate [ 28–
30]. In addition, as biosynthesis of glutamate, glutamine,

aspartate, and asparagine may take place in both the 
cytoplasm and the mitochondria, both pathways were 
included. Finally, the non-oxidative branch of the pen -
tose phosphate pathway was described using the half-
reactions model, which considers the kinetic mechanism 
of the transketolase and transaldolase reactions [ 31]. The 
3-HP production pathway from cytosolic acetate was also 
included.
All the necessary files to generate the new core model 
(PpaCore_3HP.mat) from the GSM model can be found 
in the Supplementary File S2. The final core stoichiomet-
ric model contains 151 species and 145 reactions.
For 13C-flux calculations, some of the amino acid bio -
synthetic reactions were manually lumped to reduce the 
number of overall reactions and metabolites. Some of the 
intermediary metabolites of the lumped reactions were 
present in the biomass production reactions. The stoi -
chiometry of the biomass formation equation was cor -
rected to remove these metabolites. These modifications 
can be found in the Supplementary File S3. This model 
was converted into FTBL (Flux TaBuLar) format [20, 32]. 
The reactions producing 3-HP from cytosolic acetate 
(the closest intermediary metabolite to malonyl-CoA 
in the core model) were introduced, and carbon atom 
transitions were added for all reactions to simulate label 
propagation. The final core isotopic model for the P. p a s-
toris 3-HP producing strains, which contains 113 species 
and 123 reactions, can be found in the Supplementary 
File S4 (PpaCore_3HP.ftbl ). The FTBL model can also 
be obtained from BIOMODELS [ 33], accession number: 
MODEL2210090004.
In silico design of 13C-labelling experiments
The context-specific core model of P. pastoris metabolism 
including the 3-HP formation reactions ( PpaCore_3HP.
ftbl) was used to calculate the optimal isotopic composi -
tion of the substrate using IsoDesign v1.2.1 [34]. IsoDesign 
uses influx_si [35] to calculate the precision of the fluxes 
for each (mixture of) label input to be tested.
To determine the optimal label input, the 13C-glycerol 
combinations yielding the highest number of fluxes 
with a SD < 1 was calculated. The commercially avail -
able 13C-labelled glycerol variants include 1- 13C-glycerol, 
2-13C-glycerol, 1,3-13C-glycerol, and U- 13C-glycerol. The 
substrate combinations were ranked based on the sum of 
SDs of the reactions with a SD < 1. Afterwards, the sub -
strates providing the highest precision of the fluxes of the 
upper glycolysis (UG) and the pentose phosphate path -
way (PPP) were ranked. The IsoDesign results indicated 
that the best substrate combination consisted of 20% 
1-13C-glycerol and 80% 2- 13C-glycerol (Supplementary 
File S5).
Media, cultivation conditions, and automated sampling
Seed cultures for the mini-bioreactor cultivations were 
prepared as follows: 50 mL falcon tubes containing 5 mL 
YPG (1% w/v yeast extract, 2% w/v peptone, and 1% v/v 
glycerol) medium were inoculated from cryostock and 
incubated overnight at 30 oC and 200  rpm. The over -
night cultures were transferred to a 250 mL shake flask 
containing 25 mL YPG at a starting OD 600 of 1 and sub -
sequently grown for 8  h at 30 oC and 200  rpm. The cul -
tures were harvested at the exponential phase and used 
to inoculate the mini-bioreactor cultures.
A HT fluxomics platform consisting of 48 mini bio -
reactors was used for the cultivation and the sampling 
[36]. Briefly, the 50-mL bioreactors of this platform are 
equipped with pH and dissolved oxygen sensors for pro -
cess monitoring and control. The bioreactors are agitated 
using a magnetic stirrer bar and they are designed to be 
aerated through the headspace of each reactor to avoid 
the accumulation of CO2.
The batch medium contained 1.8  g L − 1 citric acid, 
0.02 g L − 1 CaCl2 · 2 H 2O, 12.6 g L − 1 (NH4)2HPO4, 0.5 g 
L− 1 MgSO 4 · 7 H 2O, 0.9  g L − 1 KCl, 0.4  mg L − 1 biotin, 
and 4.6 ml L − 1 of PTM1 trace salts [ 37]. The pH of the 
medium was adjusted to 5 or 3.5 using HCl. The batch 
medium was supplemented with 0.5  g L − 1 glycerol 
labelled at position 1 and 2  g L − 1 glycerol labelled at 
position 2 (20% 1- 13C-glycerol and 80% 2- 13C-glycerol). 
Labelled substrates were obtained from Innovachem SAS 
(France). All the components of the medium except for 
the trace salts, the biotin, and the labelled glycerol were 
mixed and autoclaved. The other components were filter-
sterilized using a syringe filter with 0.2 μm pore size and 
introduced into the batch medium under sterile condi -
tions. Each bioreactor was filled with 15 mL of medium.
All the strains listed in Table  1 were tested in tripli -
cate in bioreactor cultures at pH 5. The cultures were 
inoculated at a starting OD 600 of 0.025. The strains X-33, 
PpHP1, PpHP6, PpHP8, PpHP15, and PpHP18 were 
tested in triplicate at pH 3.5. The cultures were inocu -
lated at a starting OD 600 of 0.05. The temperature was 
set to 28oC. The stirring rate was set to 2200 rpm. The air 
flow into the sterile gas cover, which ensures identical gas 
distribution into the head spaces of all the 48 bioreactors, 
was controlled to 104 mL min− 1 per bioreactor by a mass 
flow controller (Aalborg Instruments, NY, USA).
Automated sampling was programmed to measure the 
OD600 off-line every two hours for the first 16 h of culti -
vation. After 16  h of cultivation, sampling of the OD 600 
was performed every hour (during the exponential phase 
of the cultures). From the 16 to the 24  h of cultivation, 
250 µL samples were withdrawn hourly from each cul -
ture for supernatant analysis. The samples were placed 
on 96-well plates with a 0.45  μm filter bottom and vac -
uum filtered immediately. A final supernatant sample 
Page 5 of 16
Fina et al. Microbial Cell Factories          (2023) 22:117 
was withdrawn after 27 h cultivation. After 27 h cultiva -
tion, OD600 samples were withdrawn every 2.5 h for 10 h. 
Sampling and OD 600 data from the mini-bioreactor cul -
tures can be found on Supplementary File S6. When each 
culture reached an OD 600 above 1, a 500 µL sample was 
withdrawn from the culture. The samples were quenched 
on 3.5 mL quenching solution (40% v/v acetonitrile, 40% 
v/v methanol, 20% water and 0.1 M formic acid) at -20oC. 
Samples were stored at -20 oC between 1 and 3  h until 
further processing.
Analyses
Exometabolites analysis with NMR
Glycerol, 3-HP , and D-arabitol were quantified from 
the filtered supernatant samples using Nuclear Mag -
netic Resonance (NMR). 180 µL of sample and 20 µL of 
10 mM TSP (3-(trimethylsilyl)-[2,2,3,3- 2H4]-propionic 
acid sodium salt) were mixed. TSP was used as internal 
standard and quantified using a commercial succinate 
solution at 1  g L − 1 (43,057, Sigma Aldrich, MO, USA). 
1D-1  H analyses were carried out on a Bruker Advance 
III 800  MHz spectrometer (Bruker BioSpin, Germany) 
equipped with a 5  mm CQPI cryoprobe. Samples were 
analysed at 280 K using a 30 o pulse sequence with water 
suppression (zgpr30), with a relaxation delay of 7 s. Top -
Spin v3.6.4 (Bruker BioSpin, Germany) was used for the 
analysis of the NMR spectra. Commercial succinate at 1 g 
L− 1 (43,057, Sigma Aldrich, MO, USA) was used for the 
re-quantification of TSP . All data was corrected based on 
the quantification of succinate. The peak integration data 
from the NMR analyses can be found in Supplementary 
File S7.
Sample processing and analysis of the 13C-proteinogenic 
amino acids using LC/MS
Quenched samples were vortexed for 30  s and centri -
fuged at 5,000  g for 5  min in a swing-rotor centrifuge. 
Pellets were dried using a Rotavapor (Büchi, Switzerland). 
The biomass was treated with 150 µL 6 N HCl at 110 °C 
for 16 h. The acid was evaporated in the rotavapor. Each 
sample was washed using 100 µL milliQ water and sub -
sequently dried in the rotavapor. This step was repeated 
twice to eliminate all the acid traces. Finally, the pellets 
were resuspended on 200 µL milliQ water. The samples 
were centrifuged at 10,000  g for 5  min to eliminate the 
biomass debris. 40 µL of supernatant (containing the 
amino acids) were diluted onto 460 µL milliQ water.
The diluted amino acids were analyzed using a previ -
ously described HPLC-MS method [ 38]. The UHPLC 
Vanquish (Thermo Fisher Scientific, MA, USA) was 
coupled to a mass spectrometry (MS) detector Orbitrap 
Q-Exactive plus with a heated electrospray ionization 
source (Thermo Fisher Scientific). HPLC-MS was used 
with a precolumn Discovery HS F5 Supelguard Cartridge 
of 20 × 2.1  mm with particle size 5  μm (Supelco Belle -
fonte, PA, USA) and a column Discovery HS F5 HPLC 
column of 150 × 2.1 mm with particle size 5 μm (Supelco 
Bellefonte). Solvent A consisted of 0.1% v/v formic acid 
in ultrapure water and solvent B of 0.1% v/v formic acid 
in acetonitrile. The flow rate of the eluent was set to 0.25 
mL min − 1, and the temperature of the sampler and the 
column were set to 4 and 30  °C, respectively. Solvent B 
set points were varied as follows: 0 min: 2%; 2 min: 2%; 
10  min: 5%; 16  min: 35%; 20  min: 100%; 24  min: 100%. 
Finally, the set points of the initial conditions (2% solvent 
B) were set for 6 min before the injection of the next sam-
ple. The injection volume was 5 µL.
The MS detector was set to detect the positive ions 
on FTMS mode. The resolution was set to 70,000 (at 
m/z = 400), the capillary temperature to 320  °C, and the 
source heater temperature to 300 °C. Sheath gas and aux-
iliary gas flow rates were set to 40 and 10 arbitrary units, 
respectively. The S-lens RF level was set to 40% and the 
source voltage to 5  kV. The MS was set to measure the 
exact mass of all carbon isotopologues of all the amino 
acids (Supplementary File S8).
The isotopologue distribution of the amino acids was 
corrected considering the isotopologue labelling of the 
inoculum and the natural abundance of all isotopes using 
IsoCor v2.2.0 ( https://github.com/MetaSys-LISBP/Iso-
Cor) [39]. Raw and processed data can be found in Sup -
plementary file S9.
Bioprocess parameters
The OD 600 and the NMR supernatant analyses results 
were used to calculate the growth rate (µ) and the spe -
cific production or consumption rates (q-rates) for glyc -
erol, 3-HP , and D-arabitol. To this end, PhysioFit v1.0.2 
(https://github.com/MetaSys-LISBP/PhysioFit) was used 
[40]. The absorbance at OD 600 was correlated to the bio -
mass concentration using a constant conversion factor 
for all the strains, the rationale being that all the strains 
used in this study shared the same conversion factor in 
the culture conditions used. This assumption is sup -
ported by experimental data from our previous studies 
[4, 5], where the conversion factor of the biomass absor -
bance (OD600) to the cell dry weight (CDW) was statis -
tically identical for strains PpHP6, PpHP8, and PpHP18 
in batch cultures using the same growth medium. The 
conversion factor value was derived from calculating the 
µ (which is independent from the conversion factor) of 
the triplicate cultures of the reference strain (X-33) at 
pH 5. Afterwards, the genome scale model iMT1026v3 
was used to calculate the uptake rate of glycerol at such 
growth rate (0.21 h − 1) considering a non-growth associ -
ated ATP consumption of 2.51 mmol g CDW
−1 h − 1 [ 24], 
which resulted 3.4 mmolGlyc gCDW
−1 h− 1. This calculation 
was done in Matlab using the CobraToolbox v2.26.0 [41]. 
Page 6 of 16
Fina et al. Microbial Cell Factories          (2023) 22:117 
Finally, the conversion factor that correlates the experi -
mental data and the computational results was calculated 
to be 0.563 g CDW/OD600. The biomass yield for strain 
X-33 using this calculated conversion factor resulted in 
0.73 gCDW gGlyc
−1, which falls within the reported experi -
mental values [24].
The biomass concentration data can be found together 
with the OD600 data in Supplementary File S6.
The bioprocess parameters results calculated using 
PhysioFit can be found in the Supplementary File S10.
13C-Flux calculation
Flux calculations were performed from metabolic and 
isotopic steady-state data using influx_si v5.3.0 ( https://
influx-si.readthedocs.io, [ 35]) and the previously 
obtained FTBL format model. The bioprocess parameters 
and the corrected data of the isotopologue distribution 
of the amino acids were used as input data. All fluxes 
could be determined accurately from the extracellular 
fluxes and labelling data except for fluxes through the 
MDHc, MDHm, Tr_AKGMALtm and Tr_AKGOAAtm 
reactions.
All fluxes were normalized to the rate of the substrate 
uptake rate. A sensitivity analysis was performed using 
the Monte-Carlo method with 100 independent simu -
lations. Statistical analysis (chi-square test) was used to 
determine sufficient goodness of the fit (based on a 95% 
confidence level) for each experiment. The average fluxes 
and associated standard deviations of the mean were 
calculated from the biological replicates with sufficient 
goodness of the fit.
Throughout this study, the reference guidelines for the 
calculation of fluxes derived from 13C-data have been fol-
lowed [42]. Therefore, all the relevant data is adequately 
shared to the community for reproducibility and further 
analyses.
Flux distributions were visualized using Omix v2.0.7 
(Omix Gmbh, Germany) [ 43]. The figures show the aver -
age absolute or relative fluxes and the standard deviation 
of the triplicates.
Flux balance analysis
Flux Balance Analysis (FBA) [ 44] was performed using 
the CobraToolbox v2.26.0 in Matlab R2020b and the pre-
viously described PpaCore_3HP.mat model. The experi -
mental confidence intervals obtained from the Monte 
Carlo analyses were used as upper and lower bounds 
for each flux. Afterwards, FBA was performed using the

tion (ATPM) as objective function. This is the objective 
function resulting in the best description of the intracel -

to calculate the ATP and NADPH balance by summing 
fluxes through all producing and consuming reactions 
for each strain. The Matlab script, the input file with

Results and discussion
HT cultivation bioprocess parameters
The series of previously available 3-HP-producing P. p a s-
toris strains[4, 5] were grown in glycerol batch cultures at 
pH 5 using a HT 13C-fluxomics platform [ 36]. The stoi -
chiometry of the engineered reactions and correspond -
ing enzymes in the 3-HP-producing P. pastoris  strains 
are depicted in Fig.  2. Strain engineering strategies were 
aimed at increasing the delivery of the substrates of the 
malonyl-CoA to 3-HP pathway (i.e., cytosolic acetyl-
CoA, malonyl-CoA, and NADPH), and the reduction of 
the production of the main by-product (D-arabitol).
Measurement of the extracellular metabolites and the 
biomass concentration allowed calculating the biopro -
cess parameters (specific substrate consumption and 
(by)products production rates (q-rates) and µ max) for 
each strain (Fig.  3), which is a prerequisite for metabolic 
flux calculations. Results were consistent with previ -
ously reported cultivation data [ 4, 5]. In a nutshell, com -
parison between strains PpHP1 and PpHP2 reveals that 
dissection of MCR from C. aurantiacus  into each of its 
two subunits resulted in increased specific malonyl-
CoA reductase activity [ 4, 46], hence leading to a 10-fold 
increase in the 3-HP yield. The overexpression of the 
genes encoding for an acetyl-CoA carboxylase from Yar-
rowia lipolytica  ( ACC1Yl) and a cytosolic version of the 
mitochondrial NADH kinase from Saccharomyces cere -
visiae (cPOS5) in strain PpHP6 led to a further increase 
in 3-HP yield by enhancing the conversion of acetyl-CoA 
into malonyl-CoA (3-HP’s metabolic precursor) and 
NADPH supply, respectively. In addition, the expression 
of a second copy of the gene encoding the C-terminal 
domain of MCR yielded the highest 3-HP-producing 
strain (PpHP8), which was also the slowest growing strain 
and the strain producing the largest amount of D-arabitol 
in batch cultures. As previously reported, the overexpres-
sion of the genes encoding for the cytosolic acetyl-CoA 
synthesis pathway (i.e., acsSe
L641P and PDC1, Fig. 2) in the 
strain PpHP8 (yielding strain PpHP18), aimed to increase 
the conversion of pyruvate to cytosolic acetyl-CoA, 
restored the growth rate, but the 3-HP yield dropped 
drastically [ 5]. These results pointed at a limitation of 
resources in PpHP8 when growing at maximal growth 
rate [5], thereby resulting in an opposite trend between 
biomass and product yields.
Results in Fig.  3 also show that not only the growth 
rate of strain PpHP8 was remarkably lower than the 
growth rate of the reference strain (0.13 h− 1 and 0.22 h− 1, 
respectively), but also the substrate uptake rate (2.10 and 
Page 7 of 16
Fina et al. Microbial Cell Factories          (2023) 22:117 
3.37 mmol gCDW − 1 h − 1). In fact, the glycerol specific 
uptake rate (q S) of PpHP8 was significantly lower than 
the mean qS value observed for the rest of strains (based 
on a one-way ANOVA test, p = 0.02). A high activity of 
the malonyl-CoA to 3-HP pathway probably led to a 
reduced availability of acetyl-CoA for this strain. Acetyl-
CoA plays a central role on the biosynthesis of precur -
sors, and it plays a key role in physiological regulation 
processes, such as the acylation of histones [ 47]. Growth 
defects have also been reported in S. cerevisiae  strains 
harbouring a high acetyl-CoA carboxylase activity, where 
depletion of acetyl-CoA was described as the most likely 
cause of hampered growth [ 48]. Moreover, the observed 
increase in the growth rate and the uptake rate when 
acsSe
L641P was overexpressed support this hypothesis.
Strikingly, the biomass yield for PpHP8-derived strains 
overexpressing acsSe
L641P (PpHP13, ppHP17), and PDC1 
plus acsSe
L641P (PpHP18) were lower than the biomass 
yield of strain PpHP8.
Notably, all strains showed production of D-arabitol 
under the tested conditions. This by-product is typically 
produced due to an imbalance on the NADPH regen -
eration [4, 5], resulting in reduced biomass and product 
yields. Strikingly, deletion of the main D-arabitol dehy -
drogenase encoding gene ( ArDH) in strains PpHP15 and 
PpHP17 resulted in increased growth rates but reduced 
3-HP production, compared to their corresponding 
parental strains (PpHP8 and PpHP13, respectively).
Fluxome ofP . pastoris3-HP-producing strains at pH 5
The bioprocess parameters of the series of strains 
obtained from batch cultivations and the amino acids iso-
topologue distributions derived from the corresponding 
labelling experiments were used to calculate the intracel -
lular fluxes. The fluxome of each strain can be found in 
the Supplementary File S12 (see also Supplementary File 
S13 for a summary of the results).
The metabolic flux profile of the reference strain (X-33) 
obtained using the HT robotic platform is comparable to 
the previously reported results for the same strain grow -
ing in glycerol chemostats on a similar medium [ 23]. 
Noticeably, the fluxes of the upper glycolysis (UG) and 
pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) in our batch experi -
ments (i.e., at µ max) were higher than the ones observed 
in chemostat cultures at lower growth rates (0.10 and 
0.16 h− 1), coherent with the positive correlation between

growth rate and the UG and PPP fluxes previously 
observed in glycerol chemostats (Additional Figure S1). 
Similarly, fluxes of the lower glycolysis (LG) and the tri -
carboxylic acid (TCA) cycle reactions were lower than 
the ones observed in chemostat cultures at lower growth 
rates, also coherent with the reported inverse correla -
tion between growth rate and LG and TCA cycle fluxes. 
Lower LG and TCA cycle fluxes are consistent with 
increased UG and PPP fluxes, as already reported [ 23].
To facilitate comparison of metabolic flux distributions 
amongst strains, a heat map illustrating the fold-change 
between the relative fluxes (i.e., normalised to the spe -
cific glycerol uptake rate) of each recombinant strain 
compared to the relative fluxes of the reference strain 
cultivated at pH 5 is shown in Fig.  4. The most drastic 
changes were observed in the relative fluxes through the 
UG and PPP reactions. First, when the MCR activity was 
increased by expressing separately the two MCR domains 
(i.e., PpHP2 compared to PpHP1), the fluxes of the UG 
and PPP increased noticeably (10 ∼25%). Such trend can 
be explained by increased NADPH requirements, as 
NADPH is used as the electron donor for the two consec-
utive reactions catalysed by MCR. When the gene encod-
ing the heterologous cytosolic NADH kinase ( cPOS5Sc) 
was overexpressed (PpHP5), the observed fluxes of the 
UG and PPP reactions were 15 ∼30% lower compared 
to PpHP2. It is well known that the NADPH/NADP + 
ratio controls the fluxes towards the oxidative branch 
of the PPP [ 49]. In addition, overexpression of cPOS5 
in P. pastoris provides the cell with an additional source 
of NADPH, leading to a higher NADPH/NADP + ratio 
[50]. Therefore, decrease of UG and PPP fluxes in PpHP5 
compared to PpHP2 was consistent with an increased 
NADPH/NADP+ ratio.
No major changes were observed when ACC1Yl was 
overexpressed (i.e., in strain PpHP6, compared to strain 
PpHP5). For the strain PpHP8, which harboured an addi-
tional copy of the gene encoding for MCR-C Ca, the high-
est fluxes towards 3-HP production were observed, while 
the UG and PPP fluxes were the lowest among all strains. 
Such observation agrees with the results for the strain 
PpHP5, as the increase in the NADPH requirements due 
to production of 3-HP followed independent trends with 
the fluxes of the oxidative branch of the PPP .
Heterologous expression of acsSe
L641P in strain PpHP8 
(i.e., generating strain PpHP13) led to a drastic switch in 
the strain’s fluxome. The relative fluxes through the UG 
and PPP increased remarkably in PpHP13, while showing 
a lower relative flux towards 3-HP production compared 
to PpHP8 or PpHP6 strains. Moreover, the biomass 
yield of PpHP13 was lower. Therefore, considering the 
NADPH requirements for biomass and 3-HP produc -
tion, increased production of NADPH through the PPP 
seems unfounded. Deletion of the gene encoding for

the NADPH-dependent arabitol dehydrogenase enzyme 
(ArDH) in strains PpHP8 and PpHP13 (i.e., obtaining 
strains PpHP15 and PpHP17, respectively) led to minor 
changes in the strains’ fluxomes under the tested growth 
conditions. Finally, overexpression of PDC1 in PpHP17 
(resulting in PpHP18) led to the highest relative flux 
through the UG and PPP . However, neither the biomass 
yield nor the 3-HP yield were affected (Fig. 3).
Changes in the fluxes through LG and the TCA cycle 
reactions followed the opposite trend to the UG and the

PPP . Small differences in the fluxes through the glyoxylate 
cycle were also observed. However, as the absolute values 
of these fluxes were low (below 0.025 mmol mmol− 1 h− 1), 
absolute changes of these fluxes did not have an impact 
on the strain’s biomass and product yields.
Further comparison of the absolute flux distributions 
(i.e., non-normalised to the glycerol specific uptake rate) 
in the reference and the 3-HP-producing strains PpHP8 
and PpHP18 (Fig. 5) provided additional insights.

First, overexpression of the 3-HP production pathway 
led to a higher pyruvate decarboxylase flux at the pyru -
vate node in PpHP8 compared to the reference strain 
(0.30 mmol g CDW
−1 h − 1 and 0.12 mmol g CDW
−1 h − 1, 
respectively). The overexpression of ACS Se
L641P and Pdc1 
in strain PpHP8 did not result in a higher flux towards 
cytosolic acetyl-CoA in strain PpHP18, as the absolute 
flux values for the two strains were identical (0.30 mmol 
gCDW
−1 h − 1). Compared to the reference strain, overex -
pression of the cytosolic acetyl-CoA production path -
way in strain PpHP18 did not increase the LG fluxes. All 
these findings agree with previous results in S. cerevisiae, 
where the overexpression of PDC1 led to a higher flux 
towards this pathway without increasing the glycolytic 
flux [ 51]. It is well described that the glycolytic flux is 
tightly controlled in yeast S. cerevisiae, and the glycolytic 
flux cannot be increased by overexpressing individual 
enzymes [52]. In the case of P. pastoris, increased glyco -
lytic fluxes have only been described under low oxygen 
availability [ 53] or when a transcription factor control -
ling the expression of all the glycolytic genes was over -
expressed [ 54]. Therefore, as pyruvate is pulled into the 
production of 3-HP , but the glycolytic flux and the uptake 
of glycerol do not increase, the overall ATP yield of the 
3-HP-producing strains decreases.
Strain PpHP18 has remarkably higher UG and PPP 
fluxes than strain PpHP8 (Fig.  5). The UG and PPP have 
a low carbon and energy yield. Therefore, while PDC1 is 
being overexpressed, the energy requirements in strain 
PpHP18 sinked the pyruvate into the TCA cycle for 
ATP generation, hampering the flux toward cytosolic 
acetyl-CoA and, ultimately, reducing the 3-HP yield. On 
the contrary, as PpHP8 grew at a lower rate, the energy 
requirements of the strain were reduced, leaving more 
substrate available to produce 3-HP .
Overall, comparison of absolute flux distributions sug -
gests that to further increase the 3-HP yield in strain 
PpHP8, the glycolytic fluxes would need to be signifi -
cantly increased. Moreover, results also point to high 
ATP requirements in strain PpHP18 are the cause of the 
differences between these two strains.
ATP and NADPH producing/consuming fluxes of the 
3-HP-producing P . pastoris strains
The results from the previous section show that the 
fluxes through the PPP decreased when a heterologous 
cytosolic NADH kinase was expressed. Consistently, 
NADPH production rates calculated from the 13C-flux 
data (Fig. 6A) indicate that the NADPH produced by the 
glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PDH) reaction

was lower than the actual NADPH requirements in some 
of the strains overexpressing the cPOS5 gene (i.e., strains 
PpHP5, PpHP6, andPpHP8), supporting that the NADH 
kinase reaction contributed to cover the cell’s NADPH 
requirements.
Strains PpHP13, PpHP17, and PpHP18, which over -
express the cytosolic acetyl-CoA production pathway 
(i.e., Pdc1 and ACS Se
L641P), also produced more NADPH 
through the oxidative branch of the PPP than the actual 
cell requirements. The substantial increase in the fluxes 
through UG and PPP for such strains coincided with 
an increase in the specific glycerol uptake rate and the 
growth rate (Fig.  6A, and Fig.  3), but the biomass yield 
decreased (Fig.  3). Despite the large standard deviation 
of the fluxes through the UG and PPP fluxes in strains 
PpHP13, PpHP17, and PpHP18, it can be concluded 
that these strains did not benefit from the heterolo -
gous expression of the cPos5, while PpHP5, PpHP6, and 
PpHP8 do. NADPH production by NADH kinase is more 
efficient in terms of both carbon and ATP conservation 
than the use of the UG and PPP , which would explain the 
reduction in the biomass and 3-HP yield in the strains 
PpHP13, PpHP17, and PpHP18.
To corroborate the consistency of the observed meta -
bolic fluxes, FBA was used to verify the redox and energy 
conservation of the 13C-MFA results. The maximiza -
tion of the flux through the ATP sink reaction (ATPM) 
was used as an objective function. This is the function 
best describing the intracellular fluxes of a cell culture 
growing on a batch culture with an excess of substrate 
[45]. Consequently, the resulting flux values are based 
on in vivo data, and at the same time, they fulfil the bio -
logical function of optimizing the biomass yield. FBA 
results confirmed that both redox and energy balances 
could be conserved at the given experimental fluxes. The 
FBA results were also used to calculate the ATP balance 
(Fig. 6).
A higher ATP of maintenance for strains PpHP13, 
PpHP17, and PpHP18 was observed, as depicted in 
Fig.  6B, being PpHP18 the strain with the highest ATP 
requirements among all strains. Conversely, the calcu -
lated ATP requirement for strain PpHP8 was the lowest, 
particularly due to the lowest growth associated mainte -
nance energy (GAME) requirements, as it is the slowest 
growing strain.
Figure 6B shows there is a direct correlation between 
the overall ATP requirements of the strain and the frac -
tion of pyruvate that was directed into the TCA cycle 
for ATP production. While 47.1% of the pyruvate was 
channelled into the mitochondria in the reference 
strain, 32.1% was directed through the same pathway 
in strain PpHP8. The mitochondrial transport of pyru -
vate raised to 40.2% and 41.9% when the cytosolic ace -
tyl-CoA pathway was expressed (strains PpHP13 and 
PpHP18, respectively) to compensate for the higher ATP 
requirements.
Altogether, these results show the correlation between 
acetyl-CoA availability, growth rate, ATP requirements, 
and flux distribution at the pyruvate node, and their 
impact on the 3-HP production yield. Acetyl-CoA deple -
tion in strain PpHP8 hampered growth rate. When the 
cytosolic acetyl-CoA biosynthetic pathway was overex -
pressed (strains PpHP13, PpHP17, and PpHP18), growth 
rate increased. Increase in the growth rate increased ATP 
requirements, which increased channelling of pyruvate 
into the TCA cycle, hampering the 3-HP product yield.
Fluxome of P . pastoris strains at pH 3.5
It has been reported that a pH of 3.5 (i.e., 1 unit below 
the pKa of 3-HP) was optimal for the further downstream 
processing of 3-HP by solvent extraction [ 12]. Therefore, 
the reference strain (X-33) as well as some 3-HP-produc -
ing strains (i.e., PpHP1, PpHP6, PpHP8, PpHP15, and 
PpHP18) were further tested at pH 3.5.
No remarkable differences in the fluxome between 
the two conditions were observed for the reference 
strain (Fig.  7A). In contrast, higher UG and PPP fluxes 
were observed at pH 3.5 than at pH 5 in strains PpHP1, 
PpHP6, PpHP8, PpHP15 (See Fig.  7B). In addition, a 
higher production of D-arabitol was also observed in 
most strains when growing at low pH (Fig.  7B and Addi-
tional Figure S2).
The fold-change of the relative fluxes of each recom -
binant strain compared to the reference strain (Fig.  7C) 
showed that the impact of each genetic modification in 
the flux of each strain followed a similar trend at pH 5 
and pH 3.5 (Figs.  4 and 7B, respectively). 3-HP was pro -
duced at pH 3.5, but the yield was slightly lower than 
the one achieved at pH 5 for all the tested strains. For 
instance, the highest 3-HP producing strain at both pH 
values was PpHP8, which produced 3-HP at a yield of 
0.084 ± 0.007 Cmol Cmol − 1 at pH 3.5 (0.081 ± 0.006  g 
g− 1), which is 23% lower than the product yield of the 
same strain at pH 5. See Additional Figure S3 for the 
comparison of the fluxes at pH 5 and 3.5 for this strain.
Regarding the NADPH production and consumption 
fluxes for each strain, the same trends were also observed 
at pH 3.5 (Additional Figure S4), that is, NADPH require-
ments in strain PpHP8 exceeded NADPH production 
from the PPP , meaning the flux through the cytosolic 
NADH kinase reaction compensated for that difference. 
In contrast, the NADPH production through the PPP in 
strain PpHP18 greatly exceeded the requirements. More -
over, the substrate uptake rate also followed the same 
trend for all the strains in both pH conditions (Additional 
Figure S4).
Altogether, these results contribute to the understand -
ing of the adaptation of this yeast to a low pH at a fluxome

level. Production of D-arabitol at acidic pH was increased 
for all the 3-HP-producing strains (from 2 to 20-fold). P. 
pastoris produces D-arabitol under several stress condi -
tions, such as under hypoxia or osmotic stress [ 53, 55]. 
Thus, higher D-arabitol production at a lower pH is prob-
ably due to a stress response. Moreover, the biomass yield 
at pH 3.5 was lower for most strains (Fig.  7B), indicating 
a higher ATP requirement for maintenance. Such results 
have already been described in other yeasts grown at 
lower pH, such as S. cerevisiae , where the decrease in 
the biomass yield was also attributed to an increase in 
the ATP of maintenance [ 56]. Moreover, the 3-HP yield 
was lower than the one of the same strains at pH 5, con -
sistently with previous studies describing 3-HP produc -
tion in S. cerevisiae  grown at pH 3.5 [ 57]. The observed 
decrease in the product yield when the ATP usage 
increases confirms that ATP is a limiting factor towards 
increasing the 3-HP yield. Similarly, increased D-arabitol 
production, which is a NADPH sink, can also explain the 
decrease in the 3-HP yield observed at low pH.
Still, as metabolic flux profiles at pH 3.5 remained 
mostly unchanged compared to those at pH 5, it is likely 
that strain engineering strategies at both pH will have the 
same outcome.
Conclusions
This study describes the parallel characterization of a set 
of 3-HP-producing P. pastoris recombinant strains at two 
relevant process conditions (pH 5 and pH 3.5) using a 
HT approach that has allowed to save time and resources 
compared to conventional strain-by-strain sequential 
approach. Overall, we show, step-by-step, the setup of an 
optimized workflow for HT metabolic flux profiling of 
Pichia pastoris. It provides meaningful insights regarding 
the impact of each genetic perturbation on the metabolic 
flux distribution of the 3-HP producing strain, point -
ing to a competition for energy and carbon resources 
for either cell growth or 3-HP production as the major 
cause of the observed phenotypes, regardless of the pH 
of the culture. Thus, it is concluded that both acetyl-CoA 
and ATP limitations are the main bottlenecks hamper -
ing 3-HP production in P. pastoris . To overcome such 
bottlenecks, a strategy to increase the glycolytic fluxes 
(e.g., rewiring the regulatory mechanisms of this pathway 
and/or selecting cultivation conditions that favour higher 
glycolytic fluxes) should be addressed. Overall, this study 
will contribute towards the improvement of P. pastoris  
strains and bioprocess engineering strategies to produce 
3-HP and other acetyl-CoA-derived products. Impor -
tantly, this study showcases the potential of automated 
fluoxomics workflows for accelerated strain characteri -
sation in the context of the so-called Design-Build-Test-
Learn cycle for metabolic engineering of industrially 
relevant microorganisms, beyond model organisms. To 
this end, we also provide an end-to-end description of the 
fluxomics workflow, as well as sharing the raw and pro -
cessed datasets following the guidelines of good practices 
in publishing 13C-metabolic flux analyses studies, with 
the aim of contributing spreading the use of fluxomics 
analyses in P. pastoris.
