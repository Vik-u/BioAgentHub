Long-term fertilization can result in the changes in carbon (C) cycle in the 
maize rhizosphere soil. However, there have been few reports on the impacts 
of microbial regulatory mechanisms on the C cycle in soil. In the study, 
we  analyzed the response of functional genes that regulate the C fixation, 
decomposition and methane (CH 4) metabolism in maize rhizosphere soil to 
different fertilization treatments using metagenomics analysis. As the dominant 
C fixation pathway in maize rhizosphere soil, the abundance of the functional 
genes regulating the reductive citrate cycle (rTCA cycle) including korA, korB, 
and IHD1  was higher under the chemical nitrogen (N) fertilizer treatments 
[nitrogen fertilizer (N), compound chemical fertilization (NPK), the combination 
of compound chemical fertilizer with maize straw (NPKS)] than maize straw 
return treatments [maize straw return (S), the combination of phosphorus and 
potassium fertilizer with maize straw (PKS)]. The NPK treatment decreased the 
abundance of functional genes involved in 3-hydroxypropionate bicycle (3-HP 
cycle; porA, porB, and porD), which was one of the major C fixation pathways 
in soil aside from dicarboxylate-hydroxybutyrate (DC/4-HB cycle) and Calvin 
cycle. The abundance of functional genes related to C degradation was higher 
in S, PKS and NPKS treatments than N and NPK treatments, and chemical N 
fertilizer application had a significant effect on C degradation. The dominant 
Methanaogenesis pathway in maize rhizosphere soil, used acetate as a substrate, 
and was significantly promoted under chemical N fertilizer application. The 
functional genes that were related to CH 4 oxidation (i.e., pmoA and pmoB) were 
reduced under N and NPK treatments. Moreover, soil chemical properties had a 
significant impact on the functional genes related to C fixation and degradation, 
with SOC (r 2  = 0.79) and NO 3
−-N (r 2  = 0.63) being the main regulators. These 
results implied that N fertilization rather than maize straw return had a greater 
influence on the C cycle in maize rhizosphere soil.

1. Introduction
In recent years, the essential role of soil microorganisms in 
regulating agricultural production and the carbon (C) cycle has been 
elucidated in numerous studies ( Leadbeater et  al., 2021; Y e et  al., 
2023). Y adav et al. (2021) proposed that soil microorganisms played 
significant roles in the ecosystem for nutrients cycling, and can 
be  used for improving agro-environmental sustainability. Using 
microbiological systems to ameliorate agricultural production in a 
sustainable and eco-friendly way has been widely accepted as a future 
key-technology (Kumawat et al., 2022). Moreover, the structure and 
function of microbial community have an important impact on soil C 
emissions and are a major driver of the C cycle in rhizosphere micro-
ecosystems, and the study of functional microbiomes has become a 
hot topic in recent years (Chen X. et al., 2023; Tang et al., 2023; Wu 
D. et al., 2023). Although the volume of rhizosphere soil is relatively 
small, due to the continuous secretion of various metabolites by plant 
roots and the discontinuous death and shedding of root surface 
tissues, the nutrients and microorganisms in rhizosphere soil are 
abundant, and their physical, chemical and biological properties are 
quite different from those in non-rhizosphere soil (Chen J.-Z. et al., 
2023). And Cai et al. (2022) confirmed that the rhizosphere is the most 
active soil area, which plays an important role in soil biochemical 
cycling. Specially, the composition and function of the microorganisms 
in rhizosphere soil has drawn more attention due to the important role 
that the rhizosphere soil played in the uptake of mineral nutrients and 
water by plants (Castellano-Hinojosa et al., 2021). And soil functional 
microbiome is crucial to understand the ecological processes and 
functions such as nutrient cycles, conversion of C substances into 
carbon dioxide ( Enebe and Babalola, 2022 ). The changes in the 
abundance of genes related to C metabolism and microbial community 
structure could lead to the differences in C metabolism functions, 
which would further affect the dynamics of soil “C source” and “C 
sink” in farmland ecosystem (Deng et al., 2019; Wang J. et al., 2021). 
Hence, the study of soil microorganisms could provide essential new 
insights into the regulatory mechanism of the C cycle in 
rhizosphere soils.
Long-term fertilization, which adds nutrients into agroecosystems 
to improve crop production to meet the growing food demands, is a 
common phenomenon in China at present (Li et al., 2009; Gao et al., 
2023). However, long-term fertilization application, especially 
excessive fertilization could cause a series of environmental problems, 
such as soil acidification and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions (Jin 
et al., 2022). Maize straw is abundant in organic matter, nitrogen (N), 
phosphorus, potassium and other nutrients, and could be used as 
renewable organic fertilizer ( Cheng et  al., 2018). Previous studies 
confirmed that long-term fertilization had a significant impact on the 
stability of soil C carbon and C emissions ( Zhang et  al., 2021 ). 
According to previous reports, soil physicochemical properties played 
important roles in controlling microbial community structure (Lauber 
et  al., 2008; Val-Moraes et  al., 2016). In addition, many bacterial 
communities are closely correlated with soil chemical properties and 
can be used as indicators of soil condition ( Kuramae et al., 2015). 
Investigating the correlation between soil microbial communities and 
soil chemical properties can enable a better understanding of the 
mechanism of soil C cycle. However, the mechanism of soil C cycling 
under different fertilizer application is still unclear. Therefore, more 
attention should be paid to explore the association and underlying 
mechanism of long-term fertilization for regulating soil C cycle.
Fertilization has a significant effect on the dynamical balance of 
the soil C cycle (B. Liu et al., 2022). Hu et al. (2022) found that soil C 
fixation and degradation processes were significantly affected by 
manure application, but were not significantly changed under 
chemical fertilizer application. Fertilizer application promotes soil 
carbon dioxide (CO 2) emissions by increasing the abundance of 
catabolic genes involved in carbon cycling (Enebe and Babalola, 2021). 
Maize straw is an important source of organic C in agroecosystem and 
can substantially increase the soil carbon stock (Chen et al., 2022). 
Furthermore, chemical N fertilization increased the abundance of 
methanogenic genes in croplands ( Yuan et  al., 2018 ). And the 
magnitude of the effect of fertilizer application on soil microbiome is 
depended on the soil properties such as soil N and C contents and 
fertilizer source ( Castellano-Hinojosa et  al., 2021 ). Recently, the 
studies investigating the soil functional microbial communities were 
mainly focused on the abundance of functional genes. However, the 
impacts of different long-term fertilization management on the 
microbial function genes relate to C cycling processes need to 
be determined.
In this study, the metagenomic sequencing technology was 
applied to quantify the C metabolic pathways (including metabolic 
modules and the functional genes related to C cycle) and analyze the 
potential metabolic response to long-term fertilizers application. 
We aimed to (i) explore the effects of long-term fertilizer application 
on soil C cycle processes at the level of metabolic modules and 
functional genes. (ii) To analyze the correlation between the soil 
properties and the abundance of functional genes related to C cycle in 
maize rhizosphere soil. This study hypothesized that the functional 
genes related to C cycle will be altered in maize rhizosphere under 
long-term fertilization.
2. Materials and methods
2.1. Experimental design
The rhizosphere soil samples were collected from a long-term 
experimental site located in Jilin Agricultural University, Changchun 
City, Jilin Province, Northeast China, which has a semi-humid 
temperate continental climate (43°47′42″ N, 123°20′45″ E). The maize 
field experiment was established in 1984, with the maize seeds sown 
in April, and all maize residues were removed from the plot after 
harvest in October. The maize was rained without additional 
irrigation. We collected the rhizosphere soil in polyethylene bags by 
shaking the roots until the non-adhering soil fell off. Soil samples were 
collected after the harvest period, each plot was sampled at five points, 
and the samples were mixed into one sample for a total of 18 test 
samples. Six treatments, including no fertilization (CK), N fertilization 
(N, 150 kg/ha), compound chemical fertilization (NPK, N-P-K: 
150–75-75 kg/ha), maize straw return (S, 5,000 kg/ha), the 
combination of phosphorus and potassium fertilizer with maize straw 
(PKS, P-K-S: 75-75-5,000 kg/ha), the combination of compound 
chemical fertilizer with maize straw (NPKS, N-P-K-S: 150-75-75-
5,000 kg/ha), were implemented with three replicates per treatment 
for this study.
Li et al. 10.3389/fmicb.2023.1170214
Frontiers in Microbiology 03 frontiersin.org
The methods adopted for the measurements of soil properties, i.e., 
soil pH, total N (TN), total phosphorus (TP), total potassium (TK), 
ammonium-N (NH4
+-N), nitrate-N (NO3
−-N), available phosphorus 
(AP) and available potassium (AK) were described in Li et al. (2020). 
The readily oxidizable organic carbon (ROC) was determined by 
potassium permanganate oxidation method, and dissolved organic 
carbon (DOC) was determined by TOC analyzer (Huang et al., 2021). 
The measured soil properties were listed in Supplementary Table S1.
2.2. Metagenomics sequencing, contig 
assembly, and annotation
The microbial DNA extraction and metagenomic sequencing was 
conducted according to previous research ( Li et  al., 2020 ). The 
non-redundant contigs set is obtained by using the MMseqs2 software. 
The (merged) contigs sequence set is de-redundant according to the 
similarity degree of 95% and the coverage degree of alignment area of 
90%. Then the contigs sequence set were further filtered to remove 
nontarget fragment sequences and sequences with an actual depth of 
0. Subsequently, contigs were used for the prediction of open reading 
frames (ORFs) using MetaGeneMark,1 then translated into amino acid 
sequences. The non-redundant gene catalog was searched against 
Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes 2 for functional 
annotation. A total of 1,605,676,212 reads were obtained after 
sequencing, of which 51,418,797 contigs sequences were retained after 
filtering and removing chimeras (Supplementary Table S2).
2.3. Statistical analyses
We used analysis of variance (ANOV A) to analyze the differences 
among means, followed by least significant difference (LSD) test if the 
difference was significant. Redundancy analysis (RDA) was used to 
analyze the contribution of environmental factors (soil properties) to 
the changes in functional genes related to soil C cycle. Principal 
components analysis (PCA) was used to identify the effect of fertilizer 
application on the abundance of functional genes related to C cycle. 
The RDA and PCA analysis were performed by a free online platform 
for data analysis.3 We used Spearman’s rank correlation coefficients to 
examine the associations between the functional genes related to C 
cycle and soil properties, and illustrated heatmaps to show the results 
by an online tool of Majorbio Cloud Platform.4
3. Results
3.1. Carbon metabolic pathways in soil
There were a total of 164 genes participated in the soil C cycle 
according to the KEGG database in maize rhizosphere soil. The 
reductive citrate cycle (rTCA) was the dominant C metabolic pathway

2 http://www.genome.jp/kegg/
3 https://www.genescloud.cn
4 https://cloud.majorbio.com/page/tools/
in maize rhizosphere soil (38 genes, 23.48–23.97%), and its relative 
abundance was changed significantly under different treatments 
(p < 0.05). The following was the dicarboxylate-hydroxybutyrate 
(DC/4-HB cycle, 20 genes, 15.37–15.95%), and N and NPK treatments 
significantly decreased its reductive abundance (p < 0.001). There were 
21 genes participating in the Calvin cycle (12.24–12.51%) and 
3-hydroxypropionate bicycle (3-HP cycle, 13.03–13.30%), and their 
relative abundance was not significantly different from each other 
under different fertilization treatments (p > 0.05). Only a small number 
of genes participated in the Crassulacean acid metabolism (CAM) 
cycle and C4-Dicarboxylic acid cycle, and the relative abundance of 
which increased significantly under N and NPK treatments 
(M00169, M00172, p < 0.001). Chemical fertilizer (N and NPK 
treatments) and NPKS treatments increased the abundance of 
glyceraldehyde-3P = > ribulose-5P (M00167). Furthermore, S and PKS 
treatments had no significant impact on C cycle at the module level 
compared with CK treatment except for M00375 ( Figure  1 ; 
Supplementary Figure S1).
A total of 70 genes were involved in the methane (CH4) metabolic 
pathways. 11 genes participated in CH 4 oxidation (M00174), and 
compared with CK treatment, the relative abundance of CH4 oxidation 
pathway had significantly changed under fertilization treatments 
except for N and PKS treatment. The relative abundance of CH 4-
producing metabolic pathways that used acetate as a substrate was the 
highest in maize rhizosphere soils (68.08–72.94%), and increased 
significantly under N fertilizer application (p < 0.001). In contrast, N 
application significantly decreased the relative abundance of CH 4-
producing metabolic pathways that used methylamine, dimethylamine 
and trimethylamine as substrates (p < 0.001). Furthermore, 19 genes 
participated in CH4-producing metabolic pathways that use CO2 as a 
substrate, and its relative abundance did not significantly change 
under different fertilizer application treatments (p > 0.05; Figure 2; 
Supplementary Figure S2).
3.2. Functional genes involved in C cycle in 
soil
A subset of 53 genes involved in C cycling was retrieved from the 
18 metagenomes, all genes listed in Supplementary Table S3. They 
were involved in C fixation and degradation and CH 4 metabolism 
(Wang S. et  al., 2021). The functional genes related to C fixation 
exhibited the highest abundance, followed by the C degradation 
functional genes (Table 1). Within the C fixation group, the relative 
abundance of functional genes related to multiple systems (13.76–
15.36%), C monoxide (CO) oxidation (18.34–21.15%), and the rTCA 
cycle (13.58–15.37%) was higher than that of functional genes 
participated in the other C fixation pathways. Within the C 
degradation group, functional genes related to hemicellulose 
degradation exhibited highest abundance (9.29–10.98%) across all 
treatments, followed by starch degradation (7.49–8.13%) and cellulose 
degradation (3.20–4.33%) genes.
Functional genes participated in CO oxidation ( coxS) were 
decreased significantly under N treatment (p < 0.05), similar with the 
effects of fertilizer application on cooC gene related to reductive 
acetyl-CoA pathway. In the rTCA cycle, the relative abundances of 
korA, korB and IHD1 were higher under chemical fertilization 
treatments than maize straw return treatments. The NPK treatment 
Li et al. 10.3389/fmicb.2023.1170214
Frontiers in Microbiology 04 frontiersin.org
decreased the functional genes involved in 3-HP cycle (porA, porB, 
and porD). No significant changes were found in the functional genes 
related to Calvin cycle and DC/4-HB cycle under different fertilizer 
application treatments (p > 0.05). The relative abundance of PCCA, 
PCCB, accA, accC, and accD related to multiple system in C fixation 
was also markedly enhanced by the N, NPK and NPKS treatments 
(Figure 3).
Compared with CK treatment, N and NPK treatment significantly 
decreased the relative abundance of functional genes (including xylA, 
xylH, xylF, and rfbB) related to hemicellulose degradation (p < 0.05).

However, other treatments had no significant effects on hemicellulose 
degradation genes (p > 0.05). Besides, the relative abundance of the 
functional genes related to cellulose (celF) and pectin (pgl) for NPK 
and NPKS treatments were higher than that for other treatments. The 
abundance of starch degradation gene malZ declined under N 
fertilizer application, increased under NPKS fertilizer application

(p < 0.05). The N, NPK, and NPKS treatments inhibited the process of 
methanogenesis. Compared with N fertilizer applications, the relative 
abundance of mttB, which participated in methanogenesis, was the 
higher under straw return application. Moreover, the N, NPK, and 
NPKS treatments reduced the abundance of CH4 oxidation genes in 
maize rhizosphere soil (Figure 3).

3.3. Correlations between microbial 
functional genes and soil properties
The results of PCA indicated that fertilizer application explained 
most of the variation in the C cycling genes across all samples (PC1 of 
PCA: 99.2%). The sample points from the CK-, S- and PKS-treated 
soils grouped together and were separated from those of other 
treatments (Figure  4A). The variations among these genes under 
different treatments were probably caused by the soil properties. The 
RDA showed that the different forms of soil C (soil organic carbon 
[SOC], dissolved organic carbon [DOC], readily oxidizable organic 
carbon [ROC]) and available nutrients (nitrate N [NO3
−-N], active 
potassium [AK], active phosphorus [AP], total phosphorus [TP]) and 
pH had significant effects on C cycle ( p < 0.05; Figure 4B). The soil 
properties had strong effects on the C fixation pathways including 
reductive acetyl-CoA pathway (cooC), rTCA cycle (korA, korB, and 
IDH1), 3HP (porB) and multiple systems (bccA, accA, accC, and accD). 
For C degradation, SOC, DOC, ROC, total nitrogen (TN), AP and AK 
were significantly positively correlated with the hemicellulose (xylF, 
xylH, and xylA) and cellulose ( celF and cbhA) and pectin ( pel) 
degradation. The NO3
−-N was significantly negatively correlated with 
xylF, xylH, and xylA, which were relative with hemicellulose 
degradation, and was positively correlated with starch degradation 
gene malQ. However, the soil properties had no significant correlation 
with the functional genes related to the Calvin cycle. Moreover, the 
methanogenesis-relative genes mttB had positive correlation with pH 
and AK, and negative correlation with TN, ammonium nitrogen 
(NH4
+-N) and NO3
−-N. Functional gene pmoC that participated in 
CH4 oxidation had strong correlation with DOC, ROC, TN, AP , and 
TP (Figure 5; Supplementary Table S4).
4. Discussion
4.1. Effects of fertilizer application on soil C 
fixation and CH4 metabolism at the module 
level
Fertilizer application could influence soil C turnover (Gong et al., 
2012). Similarly, in this study, chemical fertilizer application decreased 
the SOC content, while maize straw return and chemical fertilizer 
added with maize straw increased the SOC content compared to CK 
treatment. Active organic carbon is an essential component of soil 
organic carbon, the increase of its content can provide more available 
carbon sources for soil microorganisms, and then affect soil carbon 
cycle (Luo et al., 2018). Moreover, fertilizer application stimulated the 
transformation of stable SOC to labile forms such as DOC and ROC 
(Supplementary Table S1 ). The result confirmed that long-term 
fertilization can affect the C cycle by changing the content of different 
forms of soil carbon. Soil C transformation was found to be driven by 
microorganisms (Kramer and Gleixner, 2006) and previous studies 
have shown that soil microorganisms participate in the transformation 
of various forms of C in soil, and can mediate the CO2 fixation and C 
degradation (Beulig et al., 2016 ; Agarwal et al., 2017; Jacoby et al., 
2017). This study assessed eight CO2 fixation pathways including the 
plant photosynthesis pathway (CAM cycle) in maize rhizosphere soil 
that existed in the KEGG database (Li et al., 2022). It might be because 
the maize rhizosphere could provide the substrates needed for 
microbial photosynthesis. As the dominant C fixation pathway, the 
rTCA cycle only needed two adenosine triphosphates (ATP) to 
complete this metabolic process ( Claassens et  al., 2016 ), and the 
combined application of chemical fertilizer and maize straw (NPKS) 
decreased the abundance of the rTCA (Figure 1). Compared to the 
rTCA cycle, the Calvin cycle, a major pathway for CO2 fixation that 
catalyzes the carboxylation of ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate into two 
molecules of 3-phosphoglycerate, requires more energy (Huang et al., 
2022). Long-term fertilization could affect C cycle by altering C 
metabolism pathways. It was reported that long-term fertilizer 
application had no significant effects on the Calvin cycle (Hu et al., 
2022), but the glyceraldehyde-3P = > ribulose-5P (M00167) metabolic 
pathway was strongly improved under chemical fertilization (N and 
NPK treatments) and the combined application of chemical fertilizer 
and maize straw (NPKS) in this study ( Figure  1). Previous study 
concluded that soil water content and N fertilizer had significant 
effects on the CAM, and N fertilizer changed the net CO2 uptake and 
photosynthetic capacity of the CAM in soil (Ma et al., 2022). Similar 
results were observed in this study, that is, compared with CK 
treatment, chemical fertilization (N and NPK treatments) promoted 
the CAM metabolic pathway. In addition, chemical fertilization also 
increased the relative abundance of the C4-Dicarboxylic acid 
metabolic pathway. Moreover, compared with the CK treatment, 
maize straw return and the combined application of maize straw and 
PK fertilizer had no significant effects on C fixation metabolic 
pathways, indicating that the C fixation in soil was mainly affected by 
chemical N fertilizers.
Among the different agricultural production systems, paddy fields 
are a source of CH4 emissions whereas dryland is a weak sink for CH4 
uptake (Snyder et al., 2009; Wu P . et al., 2023). Previous studies mainly 
focused on CH 4 emissions, whereas the microbial process of CH 4 
metabolism in soil was less understood. Methane metabolism mainly 
consists of methanaogenesis and CH 4 oxidation that occurred in 
maize rhizosphere soil. The dominant metabolic pathways of 
methanaogenesis used acetate as the substrate (Padhy et al., 2022), 
thus increasing significantly under chemical N fertilization and the 
combined application of chemical N fertilizer with maize straw. 
Oppositely, the chemical N fertilization inhibited the methanaogenesis 
pathway from methylamine, dimethylamine and trimethylamine. 
Methanosphaera could reduce the methyl group of methanol to CH4 
(Ferry, 2010), the abundance of which decreased under chemical 
fertilizer application and combined application of chemical fertilizer 
and maize straw ( Supplementary Figure S3 ). Moreover, chemical 
fertilization and maize straw return had no significant effect on CH4 
metabolism that utilized CO 2 as a substrate, probably because the 
Methanocella genera grow and produce CH4 from CO2 and H2, which 
was not significantly affected by N fertilization treatments (Yuan et al., 
2018; Supplementary Figure S3).
4.2. Mechanisms of fertilizer application for 
regulating soil C cycle
The functional genes related to C fixation have been studied 
extensively in terrestrial ecosystems and most of the previous studies 
focused on the cbbL and cbbM genes driving the Calvin cycle ( Liu 
et al., 2016; Li et al., 2017; Treseder et al., 2018). However, we found 
the relative abundance of cbbL and cbbM genes was lower than the 
Li et al. 10.3389/fmicb.2023.1170214
Frontiers in Microbiology 08 frontiersin.org
functional genes participated in multiple system, CO oxidation and 
rTCA cycle. This result is similar to the pattern of soil C metabolism 
at module level. Chemical N addition can induce a shift in soil N 
availability, which influences soil C turnover (Wang et al., 2018). In 
this study, the abundances of the functional genes related to C fixation 
including the rTCA cycle, 3HP cycle, multiple system and CO 
oxidation responded distinctively to different fertilization treatments. 
This was similar with (Schleuss et al., 2019), but different from the 
results reported by Hu et al. (2022), which was probably because the 
samples were obtained from the maize rhizosphere soil in this study 
and surface soil in previous study, respectively. Three functional genes 
related with the CO oxidation process were obtained from the maize

rhizosphere, among which the abundance of coxL was the highest and 
did not significantly vary among different treatments. However, the 
abundance of coxS and coxM decreased under chemical fertilizer 
application, and coxS was also influenced by maize straw return. It 
indicated that chemical N fertilizer rather than maize straw imposed 
significant effects on CO oxidation in soil. It is consistent with the 
dynamic pattern of functional genes related with the multiple systems 
and 3 HP cycle. The N and NPK treatments had higher functional 
gene abundance that was related to rTCA cycle (including korA, korB, 
and IDH1) than S and PKS treatments, and the relative abundance of 
PCCA, PCCB, accA, accC, and accD related to multiple systems in C 
fixation was also markedly enhanced by the N, NPK and NPKS 
treatments. These results indicated that chemical fertilizer contributed 
more to the variations in soil microbial C fixation than maize straw.
The functional genes related to C degradation mostly participated 
in hemicellulose, starch and cellulose degradation. The abundance of 
functional genes related to hemicellulose, cellulose and starch 
degradation were significantly different from each other under 
different fertilization treatments in this study. The amendment of 
maize straw could enhance the nutrient availability for microbial 
growth such as organic C and N in soil, and improve the activity soil 
hydrolytic enzymes, and provide more C source for soil 
microorganisms (Zhu et  al., 2019 ; Wu et  al., 2020 ). In addition, 
previous findings showed that maize straw addition increased the 
amount of macroaggregates in soil, thus improving the permeability 
of soil and promoting the growth and development of aerobic 
microorganisms (Zhang et al., 2022 ). Therefore, the abundance of 
functional genes related to C degradation was higher under S, PKS 
and NPKS treatments than N and NPK treatments. Moreover, 
chemical fertilizer application decreased the abundance of functional 
genes related to hemicellulose degradation (i.e., xylA, xylH, xylF, and 
rfbB). It was because that long-term application of chemical fertilizer 
resulted in the decrease of soil microbial diversity and the change in 
microbial community structure, thus reducing the capacity of 
microbial C decomposition in soil (Jin et al., 2022). Previous study 
concluded that the combined application of chemical fertilizer and 
maize straw improved the activity of soil enzymes that degraded 
cellulose and hemicellulose from straw into glucose 
(β-Cellobiohydrolase, βxylosidase and β-glucosidase; Liu et al., 2022). 
Consistently, in this study, the combined application of chemical 
fertilizer and maize straw increased the abundance of celF, a functional 
gene related to cellulose degradation.
The abundance of functional gene mttB which was the highest 
abundance gene for methanogenesis, and decreased by 0.49, 0.69, and 
0.43% under N, NPK and NPKS treatments, respectively, which was 
consistent with the findings of Wu P . et al. (2023). Compared with S 
and PKS treatments (without chemical N fertilizer), N, NPK, and 
NPKS treatments produced lower CH4. Previous study concluded that 
the limiting factor of CH 4 emission was the precursor for CH 4 
production instead of the mineral nitrogen in soil (Wang Xiaoqi et al., 
2017). The decomposition of maize straw increases the content of 
SOC, which provides a higher level of C source for soil microorganisms 
(Liang et al., 2021; Ren et al., 2023). Consequently, the decomposition 
of organic C into monosaccharides and then acids by microorganisms 
was accelerated, which promotes the CH4 production (Wang Xiaoqi 
et al., 2017; Zhang and Zhang, 2020). In this study, long-term fertilizer 
application significantly affected the abundance of CH 4 oxidation 
genes including pmoA and pmoB. In conclusion, chemical fertilizer 
application rather than maize straw addition exhibited significant 
influences on soil C fixation, degradation and CH4 metabolism. The 
above results indicated that long-term fertilization affect C cycle by 
alter functional genes related to C cycle.
4.3. Correlations between functional genes 
and soil chemical properties
Long-term chemical fertilization can greatly alter the microbial 
function by directly increasing available nutrients or indirectly 
changing the soil physical and chemical properties. The chemical 
properties including SOC, DOC, ROC, TN, NO3
−-N, AK, AP , TP , and 
pH changed significantly under different fertilization treatments in the 
maize rhizosphere soil in this study (Supplementary Table S1), which 
resultantly influenced the C fixation and degradation (Figures 4B, 5). 
Carbon and N sources in soil such as SOC, ROC, DOC, and TN and 
NO3
−-N provided C and N source for microbial growth (Xie et al., 
2012). Labile SOC had negative effects on C fixation and positive 
effects on C degradation. However, the effects of NO3
−-N on C fixation 
and degradation were opposite with that of SOC (Figure 5). Previous 
studies confirmed that soil P was the most influential driver of C cycle, 
and could efficiently maintain the microbial growth and enhance the 
microbial function for mediating soil C cycle ( Y ao et al., 2018; Hu 
et al., 2022). In this study, AP had significantly positive correlations 
with the abundance of bbcA, accD6, xylH, xylA, chi, celF, cbhA, pgl, 
malZ, and negative correlations with that of por, porB and coxL. Soil 
pH was also an important factor regulating the soil C cycle. Soil pH 
could alter the availability of soluble nutrients in soil, and directly 
affect the contents of dissolved CO2 and the use of C sources (CO2 and 
HCO3
−) by soil microorganisms, thereby imposing a significant 
influence on the C cycle (Huang et al., 2022). The result also confirmed 
that long-term fertilization can affect soil functional genes and carbon 
cycle by changing soil physical and chemical properties.
5. Conclusion
In this study, there were eight C fixation pathways in maize 
rhizosphere soil, and the dominant one was the reductive citrate cycle 
(rTCA cycle), followed by the dicarboxylate-hydroxybutyrate 
(DC/4-HB cycle), 3-hydroxypropionate bicycle (3-HP cycle) and the 
Calvin cycle. Long-term fertilizer application had a significant effect 
on soil C fixation except for the Calvin and 3-HP cycles. Chemical 
fertilizers increased the abundance of the C4-Dicarboxylic acid cycle 
metabolic pathway and the CAM light metabolic pathway, and 
inhibited the DC/4-HB cycle. Compared with CK treatment, S and 
PKS treatments had no significant influences on the soil C fixation. 
The relative abundance of CH4-producing metabolic pathways that 
used acetate as a substrate was the highest in maize rhizosphere soils, 
and increased significantly under N fertilizer application relative to 
CK. However, long-term fertilizer application had no significant effect 
on CH4 metabolic pathway that used CO2 as a substrate. The functional 
genes related to C degradation mostly participated in hemicellulose, 
cellulose and starch degradation. The abundance of functional genes 
related to C degradation was higher under S, PKS and NPKS 
treatments than N and NPK treatments, indicating that chemical 
fertilizer application had a significant influence on C degradation. In 
Li et al. 10.3389/fmicb.2023.1170214

addition, chemical fertilizer application decreased the abundance of 
methanogenesis genes (i.e., mttB and mttC) and CH4 oxidation genes 
(i.e., pmoA and pmoB). In conclusion, this study implied that N 
fertilizer rather than maize straw application had significant impacts 
on the C cycle in maize rhizosphere soil. Moreover, soil chemical 
properties had significant influences on the abundance of functional 
genes related to C fixation and degradation, with SOC and NO3
−-N 
being the major drivers. Overall, our results highlighted the important 
of long-term fertilization in C cycle and the microorganism regulated 
C cycle in maize rhizosphere.
