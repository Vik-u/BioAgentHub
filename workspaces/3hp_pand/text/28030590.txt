Abstract
Lactobacillus reuteri, a heteroferme ntative bacterium, metabolizes glycerol via a Pdu (pro-
panediol-utilization ) pathway involving dehydration to 3-hydroxypropion aldehyde (3-HPA)
followed by reduction to 1,3-propandiol (1,3-PDO) with concomitant generation of an oxi-
dized cofactor, NAD
+
that is utilized to maintain cofactor balance required for glucose
metabolism and even for oxidation of 3-HPA by a Pdu oxidative branch to 3-hydroxypropio-
nic acid (3-HP). The Pdu pathway is operative inside Pdu microcompartment that encapsu-
lates different enzymes and cofactors involved in metabolizing glycerol or 1,2-propaned iol,
and protects the cells from the toxic effect of the aldehyde intermediate. Since L. reuteri
excretes high amounts of 3-HPA outside the microcompart ment, the organism is likely to
have alternative alcohol dehydrogenase(s) in the cytoplasm for transformation of the alde-
hyde. In this study, diversity of alcohol dehydrogenases in Lactobacillus species was investi-
gated with a focus on L. reuteri. Nine ADH enzymes were found in L. reuteri DSM20016, out
of which 3 (PduQ, ADH6 and ADH7) belong to the group of iron-dependent enzymes that
are known to transform aldehydes /ketones to alcohols. L. reuteri mutants were generated in
which the three ADHs were deleted individually. The lagging growth phenotype of these
deletion mutants revealed that limited NAD
+
/NADH recycling could be restricting their
growth in the absence of ADHs. Notably, it was demonstrate d that PduQ is more active in
generating NAD
+
during glycerol metabolism within the microcompartm ent by resting cells,
while ADH7 functions to balance NAD
+
/NADH by converting 3-HPA to 1,3-PDO outside the
microcompartment in the growing cells. Moreover, evaluation of ADH6 deletion mutant
showed strong decrease in ethanol level, supporting the role of this bifuctional alcohol/alde-
hyde dehydrogenase in ethanol production. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first
report revealing both internal and external recycling for cofactor homeostasis during 3-HPA
conversion in L. reuteri.

Introduction
Lactobacillus species constitute an important group of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) that are nor-
mally used as probiotics, for production of fermented foods, and also of biobased chemicals
like lactic acid and 1,3-propanediol (1,3-PDO) [1–3]. The production of 1,3-PDO is achieved
due to the ability of the bacteria to use glycerol as an indirect electron acceptor that helps to
maintain regeneration of cofactor needed for maintaining glucose metabolism, cell growth
and energy production [4–8].
Lactobacillus reuteri is an obligate heterofermentative bacteria that grows on several carbon
sources and is well recognised for its probiotic effect [9]. Metabolic flux analysis has shown that
L. reuteri uses both phosphoketolase pathway (PKP) and Embden-Meyerhof pathway (EMP)
for glucose metabolism; the primary flux is through the PKP while the EMP is used as a mere
shunt [10]. The organism does not grow on glycerol, but addition of glycerol, 1,2-propanediol
or 1,2-ethanediol to the cultivation medium induces the expression of genes in the propanediol-
utilization (Pdu) operon encoding shell proteins and enzymes needed for metabolism of glyc-
erol (or the other diols) and use as electron acceptor[11].
The glycerol metabolism is initiated by vitamin B12-dependent glycerol dehydratase (PduCDF)
catalysed dehydration to 3-hydroxypropionaldehyde (3-HPA), followed by a reductive and an oxi-
dative route [12]. Reduction of 3-HPA to 1,3-PDO is catalysed by a NAD(P)
+
-dependent alcohol
dehydrogenase (PduQ), whereas oxidation to 3-hydroxypropionic acid (3-HP) is catalyzed by a
set of 3 enzymes, propionaldehyde dehydrogenase (PduP), phosphotransacylase (PduL) and pro-
pionate kinase (PduW) [12–14]. The Pdu structural proteins form microcompartments (MCP)
called metabolosomes that encapsulate the components of the metabolic pathways, and are
expected to protect the cells against the toxic effect of the intermediate aldehyde, while allowing
enzyme substrates (e.g. glycerol), cofactors (e.g. NAD
+
, NADH), and products (e.g. 1,3-PDO,
3-HP) to pass [15].
1,3-PDO is the main product of glycerol metabolism by the growing cells, providing the
cofactor needed for glucose metabolism. On the other hand, the resting cells convert glycerol
to an equimolar mixture of 1,3-PDO and 3-HP with maintained cofactor recycling, but signifi-
cant accumulation of 3-HPA occurs at high feeding rate of glycerol [12,16]. 3-HPA forms an
equilibrium mixture with 3-HPA hydrate and dimer called as reuterin to which is attributed
the probiotic role of L. reuteri [16]. Our laboratory studies have further shown that unlike
3-HPA, propionaldehyde produced from 1,2-propanediol (1,2-PDO) by L. reuteri, is not
excreted outside of MCP (unpublished data). These observations suggest that L. reuteri is likely
to have other routes for conversion of 3-HPA outside the MCP. Hence, understanding the role
of other alcohol dehydrogenases in 3-HPA reduction becomes important.
Alcohol dehydrogenases (ADHs) comprise an extremely diverse group of enzymes cata-
lysing the interconversion of alcohols and aldehydes or ketones [17]. Several categories of
ADHs can be analyzed based on their cofactor specificity, these being: (i) NAD
+
or NADP
+
,
(ii) the pyrrolo-quinoline quinine, haem or cofactor F
420
, and (iii) FAD [18]. The NAD(P)-
dependent ADHs are further sub-divided into zinc-dependent (group I), short-chain
(group II), and iron-dependent (group III) ADHs [19]. Most of the known ADHs from Lac-
tobacillus sp. are NAD(P)-dependent, which indicates that they share a common catalytic
mechanism. Among the group III NAD(P)-dependent bacterial ADHs that have been
described and characterised so far are lactaldehyde dehydrogenases, butanol dehydroge-
nases, 1,3-propanediol (1,3-PD) dehydrogenases while there are several remaining to be
characterized [19,20]. In general, the group III enzymes have been found to preferentially
catalyse the reduction of aldehydes.

The current study was initiated to explore the diversity of ADH enzymes in Lactobacillus
species and L. reuteri DSM20016 in particular, with a subsequent focus on the iron-dependent
group III ADHs and their role in the redox balance in glycerol/glucose metabolism.
Materials and Methods
Bacterial strains, plasmids and primers
The bacterial strains and plasmids used and the primers constructed in this study are listed in
S1 Table. Escherichia coli strains DH5α was used as an intermediate cloning host and was
grown at 37˚C in Luria Bertani (LB) broth. For preparation of inoculum of L. reuteri, wild type
as well as mutants, 20 mL of 55 g/L MRS broth (Difco) supplemented with 20 mM glycerol
was added to the 30 mL serum bottles, boiled, and bubbled with nitrogen gas, after which the
bottles were closed with rubber stoppers, and autoclaved at 121˚C for 10 min. After inocula-
tion of the medium, the cells were grown anaerobically without shaking for 8 h at 37˚C. The
stock culture was stored at -80˚C in MRS broth containing 20% v/v glycerol. For selective culti-
vation of the mutants, appropriate antibiotics were supplemented to the media. For recombi-
nant E. coli, 10 μg/mL chloramphenicol and 250 μg/mL erythromycin were used, while for
recombinant L. reuteri 10 μg/mL chloramphenicol and 30 μg/mL erythromycin were used.
Chemicals and reagents
All restriction enzymes, X-Gal and isopropyl-β-D-1-thiogalactop yranoside (IPTG) were pur-
chased from Fermentas. T4 DNA ligase and Taq DNA polymerase were from New England
Biolabs, while BugBuster protein extraction reagent was from Novagen. β-Nicotinamide ade-
nine dinucleotide, reduced disodium salt hydrate (NADH), β-Nicotinamide adenine dinucleo-
tide (NAD
+
), and all antibiotics were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Primers and other kits
for DNA extraction and purification were from Thermo Fisher Scientific.
Bioinformatics analysis
Geneious 9.1.2 was utilized for detection of enzymes in the Protein DataBank having sequence
resemblance to ADHs. Multiple sequence alignments for identification of conserved amino
acids were analyzed by ClustalW2 tools (EMBL-EBI) and visualized in Geneious. The derived
Lactobacillus ADH sequences for phylogenetic analysis were extracted from protein database
UniProt. Homology modeling of the L. reuteri ADHs was performed with the aid of Program
DeepView (Swiss PDB-Viewer) [21]. Homology model quality assessment was performed by
utilizing the SWISS-MODEL workspace. Chimera developed by the UCSF Resource (http://
www.cgl.ucsf.edu/chimera) was used as a platform for the study of dockings with NADH
using the tool AutoDock Vina [22,23]. Figures were generated using either Chimera or PyMol
(http://www.pymol.org) and raytraced images are produced with POV-Ray. Global alignment
(Cost Matrix: Blosum 62, Gap open penalty:12, Gap extension penalty:3) was adapted for
building distance matrix by using Neighbor-Joining (NJ) as the tree bulid method and Jukes-
Cantor as genetic distance model (bootstrap number: 100). No outgroup was chosen for root-
ing the phylogenetic tree.
Construction of plasmids and mutant strains
The ADH genes were amplified from the genomic DNA of L. reuteri DSM20016. The approach
to obtain gene deletion variants was based on double-crossover integration method reported
earlier by Jolamda et al. [24]. Generally, about 1-kb fragment of the sequences upstream and
downstream of the target locus were amplified and cloned into the SwaI and SrfI blunt-end

restriction sites of pNZ5319, respectively. Colony PCR was performed to identify the colonies
harboring the anticipated insert in the desired orientation.
Using this approach, the PduQ mutagenesis vector pLCH007 was constructed by successive
cloning of both 5’- and 3’- flanking regions of PduQ gene (lreu_1734). Clones that harbored
the desired inserts were identified by PCR using primer sets 13–16 (S1 Table). Likewise, vec-
tors pLCH008 and pLCH009 were successfully constructed to harbor the 5’- and 3’- flanking
regions of ADH6 and ADH7 gene inserts, respectively. Approprate primer sets 17–24 were
designed to check the correct insertion.
The gene-specific mutagenesis vectors (1–4 μL) were transformed into L. reuteri DSM20016
in order to engineer lox66-P
32-
cat-lox71 gene replacement by electroporation as previously
described [25], with slight modification. An overnight culture of the transformed L. reuteri
strains was used to inoculate 15 mL MRS broth containing 2% glycine and 0.5 M sucrose, and
incubated at 37˚C. The absorbance of the culture at 600 nm reached 0.2 after 3 h, after which
the cells were separated by centrifugation and then washed twice with 5 mL cold distilled water
followed by a 10 min incubation in 50 mM EDTA solution (pH 8.0). After washing with cold
distilled water and 0.3 M sucrose, the cells were re-suspended in 100 μL of 0.3 M sucrose solu-
tion as electroporation buffer. Then the suspension was transferred into a disposable cuvette
(Bio-Rad Laboratories) and subjected to an electric pulse using a MicroPulser (Bio-Rad) under
the following conditions: Capacitance = 25 μF; Resistance = 400 ohm; Voltage = 2.0 kV.
Candidate double-crossover clones (Cm
r
), which indicated correct integration of the lox66-
P
32-
cat-lox71 into the genome was confirmed by PCR amplification using primer pairs 13:16,
17:20 and 21:24 for PduQ, ADH6 and ADH7, respectively.
In order to cut off the P
32
-cat cassette from the chromosome, 1–4 μL of cre expression vec-
tor pNZ5348 was transformed into the mutants. Em
r
(erythromycin resistance) colonies were
tested by PCR for desired Cre-mediated recombination, using primer pairs of 25:26, 27:28 and
29:30 for PduQ, ADH6 and ADH7, respectively. The pNZ5348 vector was cured from relevant
colonies of L. reuteri mutants by growth without erythromycin selection pressure for about 10
generations.
All the above inserts were verified by DNA sequencing. Other molecular cloning and DNA
manipulation procedures, not mentioned here, were essentially done as described by Sam-
brook et al. [26].
Recombinant expression and production of L. reuteri PduQ and ADH7
The gene sequences coding for PduQ and ADH7 genes were amplified by using appropriate
primer pairs (S1 Table). Initial denaturing at 95˚C for 3 min was followed by 30 cycles of dena-
turing at 95˚C for 30 s, annealing at 54˚C for 30 s and elongation at 72˚C for 1 min. A final
elongation was performed at 72˚C for 15 min. The PCR product was separated and purified by
agarose gel electrophoresis and inserted directly into the expression vector pET21a after
digesting both vector and PCR product with the restriction enzymes BamHI and XhoI. The
resulting plasmids pET21a-pduQ-His
6
/ pET21a-ADH7-His
6
were introduced in E. coli BL21
(DE3) and the recombinant strains were designated as E. coli PduQ-WT and ADH7-WT,
respectively.
The recombinant E. coli strains were then grown in 100ml LB medium of 500 mL flask con-
taining 40 μg/mL Ampicillin under aerobic conditions at 37˚C with shaking at 220 rpm. The
gene expression was induced by addition of 0.1mM IPTG when the bacterial growth had
reached mid-exponential phase (OD
620
around 0.5) with subsequent incubation for 24 h at
15˚C and 160 rpm. The cells were then harvested and washed with 20 mM sodium phosphate
buffer pH 7.4 containing 0.5 M NaCl.

Lysis of the cells was performed by re-suspending and incubating the cells in 5 ml Bugbus-
ter protein extraction reagent and 10 μL lysonase bioprocessing reagent (Novagen) according
to manufacturer´s instructions. The soluble protein fraction was separated from cell debris by
centrifugation for 40 min at 16 000 x g, 4˚C, and subjected to immobilized metal ion affinity
chromatography (IMAC) for purification of the recombinant enzymes. The enzyme solution
was loaded on 5 ml Ni-NTA HisTrap™ FF crude column equilibrated with binding buffer at a
flow rate of 5 mL/min. After washing the column with the equilibration buffer, the bound pro-
tein was eluted using elution buffer containing 500 mM imidazole solution.
The eluted enzyme was concentrated 10 fold at 4˚C in Vivaspin 15R (MWCO 10kDa) cen-
trifugal concentrator tubes using a Sigma 3-16PK centrifuge at 3000 g for about 60 minutes.
The concentrated enzyme solution (volume1mL) was mixed with 900 μL of pure glycerol
and 20 μL of antioxidant stock solution (1M ascorbic acid, 50 mM copper sulphate), and
stored in an airtight anaerobic glass vial at -20˚C. Purity of the recombinant PduQ and ADH7
was analysed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) on a
gel containing 12% acrylamide. The protein bands were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue
R-250.
Analyses
Cell growth was monitored at 600 nm using a Ultrospec 1000 spectrophotometer (Pharmacia
Biotech) and correlated with cell dry weight (CDW) as described previously [12]. For CDW
determination, the culture broths (5 mL) were harvested and centrifuged (4000 x g) in a pre-
weighed tube. After removing the supernatant, cell pellets were dried overnight in an oven at
110˚C and then weighed again. The difference in weight is then refered to the cell dry weight
in 5 mL cell culture.
Glucose, glycerol, lactate, ethanol, 1,3-PDO and 3HP concentrations were determined by
HPLC (JASCO, Tokyo, Japan) equipped with refractive index detector. Separation of the com-
pounds was performed on Aminex HPX-87H chromatographic column using sulfuric acid (50
mM) as mobile phase. The modified colorimetric method of Circle et al. [27] was used for
measuring 3HPA concentration using acrolein as standard [28].
The activity of PduQ and ADH7 was determined as described by Reid et al. [20] with some
modification. Aldehyde reduction was measured by following the decrease in absorbance of
NADH at a wavelength of 340 nm (Δε
340
NADH
= 6.22mM
-1
cm
-1
) in a reaction mixture con-
taining 0.2 mM NADH, 100 mM 3-HPA and appropriate amount of enzyme in 50 mM potas-
sium phosphate buffer pH 7.0, if not mentioned otherwise. For determining alcohol oxidation,
the reaction mixture contained 5 mM NAD
+
, 500 mM 1,3-PDO and the enzyme in 50 mM
Tris-HCl pH 9.0. All spectrophotometric measurements were made using UV-1650 PC Spec-
trophotometer (Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan) at 30˚C.
3-HPA was produced by biotransformation of glycerol in aqueous solution using resting
cells of L. reuteri as described by Sardari et al. [29]. One Unit (U) of the enzyme activity is
defined as the amount of enzyme catalyzing the formation or consumption of 1 μmol NADH
per minute under the standard assay conditions. Kinetic parameters were obtained by non-lin-
ear curve fitting to the Michaelis-Menten equation v = V
max
[S]/(K
m
+[S]) using GraphPad
Prism6 software (http://www.graphpad.com).

carbohydrates into the typical three-carbon intermediates [30]. In general, homofermentative
LAB convert carbohydrates into lactate using the Embden-Meyerhof pathway (EMP), whereas
heterofermentative LAB produce lactate, acetate and ethanol using the phosphoketolase path-
way (PKP) by the enzymes listed in Table 1.
However, the relatively low growth rate as well as low biomass yield obtained in the pres-
ence of nonlimiting glucose concentration, indicate restriction in the growth of L. reuteri.
Årsko ¨ ld et al. [10] have earlier shown that the choice of carbon source could obviously affect
the growth performance of L. reuteri; growth on 0.15 M sucrose resulted in a higher growth
rate (0.82 h
-1
) and high ATP yield (10.5 g biomass•mol substrate
-1
), whereas growth with 0.28
M glucose was characterized by a maximum specific growth rate and ATP yield of about 0.45
and 5.2, respectively. In the present study, the growth limitation on glucose could be alleviated
by the presence of glycerol, confirming that the limitation was imposed by a redox imbalance
(Fig 1). With glycerol, part of the NAD(P)
+
could be regenerated via the reduction of the
3-HPA to 1,3-PDO, using the activity of ADHs. As 3-HPA is transported outside the micro-
compartment into the cytoplasm, its reduction with concomitant regeneration of NAD
+
could
occur either via fermentation pathways by ADH and lactate dehydrogenase or instead by the

Alcohol dehydrogenases (ADHs) from lactobacilli
To date, Lactobacillus is the largest genus of the LAB group, with over 50 species in total [32].
In order to analyse diversity amongst Lactobacillus ADHs and related proteins, all their amino
acid sequences (2533 in number) available from public databases (UniProt, NCBI and PDB)
were compiled and aligned using Geneious19.1.2 for the purpose of constructing a phyloge-
netic tree using the average distance method and bootstrap analysis (Fig 3). The resulting phe-
nogram revealed that within the NAD(P)-dependent group, the Lactobacillus ADHs are
clustered in order according to enzyme type, i.e. zinc-dependent ADHs, short-chain ADHs,
and iron-containning ADHs, irrespective of the species of Lactobacillus. It is worth mentioning
at this point that ADHs from closely related species are often clustered together. Using this
method, unknown Lactobacillus ADHs can be classified via phylogenetic relatedness into their

respective ADH types, and as observed in the phylogenetic tree more than 70% of known Lacto-
bacillus ADHs are grouped into Zn-dependent ADH type. Normally, zinc-containing long/
medium-chain enzymes (group I ADHs) and metal-free short-chain enzymes (group II ADHs)
are approximately 350 or 250 amino acids, respectively, in size, while the iron-containing ADHs
(group III ADHs) exhibit a size of around 385 amino acid residues per subunit (Fig 3B). Typi-
cally, screening of all ADHs in Lactobacillus shows a group of ADHs in the range of 850 aa to
900 aa, referred as the bifunctional alcohol/aldehyde dehydrogenases.
All ADHs found in L. reuteri are listed in Table 1. A genome-wide transcription analysis of
L. reuteri cells grown on glucose with differentially expressed genes in response to glycerol
revealed 2.7 and 1.9 times higher expression of ADH7 and PduQ genes in exponential phase,
and during stationary phase the expression levels were 2.9 and 1.5 fold higher, respectively
[31]. In contrast, ADH5 and ADH6 genes were down-regulated in the presence of glycerol.
Particularly, ADH6 gene expression dropped to 25% and 1% of the original in exponential and
stationary phase, respectively, during glycerol feeding.
All the L. reuteri ADHs are metal-ion dependent enzymes, where the metal-ion can have a
catalytic and/ or a structure stabilizing effect on the enzyme. Addtionally, homology modeling
for the prediction of the tertiary structure of these ADHs were obtained through the online
sever Swiss-model and structural analysis were performed using Pymol (Fig 4). The modeled
monomer of all ADHs contains about 320–400 amino acid residues except for the ADH6 with
878 aa residues. In general, the monomeric protein of ADH6 (alcohol dehydrogenase part),
ADH7 and PduQ fold into two domains that are separated by a deep cleft. The N-terminal
domain has a so-called Rossmann-fold architecture, which is a typical protein structure motif
that binds nucleotide cofactor such as FAD
+
, NAD
+
or NADP
+
. The C-terminal domain con-
sists of α-helical structures, with an up-and-down bundle architecture well-known as a dehy-
droquinate synthase-like α-domain. Particularly, the binding site for cofactor NAD(P)
+
resides
in the deep hydrophilic pocket between the two domains. The parameters used for homology
modeling and the outcome are listed in S2 Table. Our laboratory studies have shown these
ADH enzymes to have low affinity and catalytic efficiency towards ethanol as substrate
(Unpublished data). It has been speculated that most group III ADHs are mainly involved in
aldehyde reduction in bacterial species rather than alcohol turnover. Nevertheless, the other
alcohol dehydrogenases (ADH1-ADH5, and ADH8) in L. reuteri are more likely to play a role
in ethanol transformation as reported in other microorganisms [33].
To identify the genes involved in 3-HPA to 1,3-PDO conversion, a BLASTP analysis using
PduQ as query was conducted among putative alcohol dehydrogenases in the genome of L.
reuteri (NC_009513). The results indicated the presence of two other putative ADHs, i.e.
ADH6 (lreu_0321, E-value: 2e
-53
) and ADH7 (lreu_0030, E-value: 5e
-46
). To identify features
unique to these ADHs, protein sequence alignment of PduQ, ADH6 (truncated) and ADH7
was carried out after being aligned and adjusted by gap insertion. Similarities (Blosum62 with
threshold 1) ranging from 42.9% to 48.4% were observed (Fig 5). The conserved amino acid
sites marked by boxes revealed the common features for substrate/NADH/iron binding as in
the iron-dependent ADHs. The specificity of all the enzymes towards NAD(P)
+
is determined
by motif G-G-G-S-X-X-D-X-X-K. In addition, five conserved metal-ion coordination resi-
dues, Asp207, His211, His276, His280 and His290 were found to be involved in the Fe
2+
-binding.
Characteristics of the ADH mutant L. reuteri cells

Addition of glycerol to mutant cells is expected to achieve regeneration of NAD(P)

to vari-
ous levels that in turn will have an impact on other coupled physiological reactions in the cen-
tral metabolism. Therefore, tests on growth characterisitics of mutants were carried out by
growing both wild type cells and mutants in MRS medium with or without glycerol supple-
mentation. The growth rate without glycerol was observed to be similar for wild type (0.71 h

and LCH010 (0.70 h

about 28%, 16%, 66% and 16% for wild type cells, LCH010, LCH012 and LCH011, respectively.
Particularly for LCH012, the higher growth rate (0.88 h
-1
) suggests higher ATP production
rate, and as a consequence end-product yield in this mutant can be partly replenished by the
use of glycerol as the electron acceptor. Therefore, quantification of the metabolic end-prod-
ucts at an early stationary phase would provide more insight for the mutant behavior on
NADH/NAD
+
homeostasis.
As shown in Fig 7B, when grown in the presence of glycerol (20 mM), there was no notable
difference in the glucose and glycerol comsumption by the wild type and all mutant strains.
However, the clear differences were observed in end-product concentration, i.e. lactate, etha-
nol and 1,3-PDO. The wild type, LCH010 and LCH012 produced around 20 mM lactate,
whereas LCH011 produced 26.4 mM lactate, which is 32% higher compared to the others. This
could suggest that LCH011 had to resort to the use of LDH activity for regeneration of NAD
+
.
More interestingly, nearly similar production of ethanol by wild type cells (16.9 mM) and
LCH010 (18.5mM) was observed, while LCH012 produced relatively high amount of ethanol
(28.2 mM) and ADH6 knockout strain LCH011 showed distinctly lower ethanol production
(8.4 mM). This observation accords with the idea that ADH6 enzyme is a bifunctional alcohol/
aldehyde dehydrogenase; similar enzymes are found in many other fermentative cells, and

participate in ethanol generation by catalysing the conversion of an acyl-coenzyme A to an
alcohol via aldehyde as an intermediate. Higher level of ethanol and lower 1,3-PDO produc-
tion obtained in case of LCH012, obviously suggests the preference of the bifunctional ADH6
to regenerate NAD
+
and also lower activity of PduQ for converting 3-HPA to 1,3-PDO.
Indeed, up to 13 mM 1,3-PDO is produced by the wild type strain, LCH010 and LCH011,
whereas production of 1,3-PDO in LCH012 was much lower (5.3 mM), which strengthened
the assumption that ADH7 was most likely involved in the conversion of 3-HPA to 1,3PDO
outside of Pdu microcompartment.
3-HPA, 3HP and 1,3-PDO production was then studied in a two-step process, in which L.
reuteri cells were first cultivated anaerobically in MRS medium supplemented with 20 mM
glycerol, followed by using the cells for transformation of 300 mM glycerol. The wild type and
LCH011 strain produced nearly similar amounts of 3-HPA, i.e. 138.6 mM and 137.3 mM,
respectively, while strain LCH010 produced 152.5 mM and LCH012 produced only 115.3 mM
of 3-HPA (Fig 7C). The amounts of by-products 1,3-PDO and 3-HP formed by the wild type
L. reuteri were 18.9 mM and 23.7 mM, respectively. The strain LCH010 produced 7.7 mM
1,3-PDO and 16.2 mM 3-HP, which results in a significantly higher ratio of 3-HPA/3-HP and
3-HPA/1,3-PDO as described in Fig 7D, showing that the ADH encoded by PduQ gene is
mainly active in non-growing cells.
Kinetic analysis of recombinant PduQ and ADH7 activities
Since PduQ and ADH7 seemed to catalyse 3-HPA reduction, both the enzymes were produced
recombinantly and purified for further characterization. Studies with PduQ-His
6
showed that
the iron content of the enzyme (measured by ICP-MS) as well as the activity was lower in the
enzyme exposed to air as compared to that under anaerobic conditions, confirming the iron
dependence of the enzyne (unpublished data). Kinetic characterization of PduQ-His
6
and
ADH7-His
6
with varied concentrations of aldehyde and alcohol substrates, respectively,
obtained from GraphPad Prism6 showed the enzymes to exhibit significantly higher activity
(K
cat
/K
m
) for aldehyde reduction than the oxidation of the corresponding alcohol, attributed
to lower K
m
as well as higher V
max
with the aldehyde and NADH (Table 2). Propionaldehyde
was a better substrate than 3HPA (not shown). Measurements at varying concentrations of
cofactor with 3HPA or 1,3-propanediol as substrate revealed that the enzyme activity increased
with increase in NADH or NAD
+
concentration up to a certain extent. Maximum specific
activity of PduQ-His
6
for aldehyde reduction with NADH as cofactor (12.6± 0.7 U/mg) was
about three-fold higher than that obtained for alcohol oxidation with NAD
+
(3.9± 0.2 U/mg).
On the other hand, the difference between the V
max-NADH
and V
max-NAD+
with the purified
ADH7-His
6
was eight-fold (33±2.1 vs 4.1±0.2 U/mg).

Discussion
Several microorganisms possess the ability to metabolize glycerol both reductively and oxida-
tively, e.g. Klebsiella, Clostridium or Enterobacter [34]. These species can utilize the NAD
+
-
dependent enzyme glycerol dehydrogenase for the production of dihydroxyacetone (DHA),
followed by subsequent phosphorylation to DHAP that gets funneled into glycolysis. However,
L. reuteri does not grow on glycerol as the sole carbon and energy source, apparently due to an
inactive glycerol dehydrogenase (lreu_1840, Fig 1). This assumption could also be confirmed
by functional genomics analysis carried out by Santos et al. [31]. In their work, glycerol dehy-
drogenase gene was observed to be down-regulated 3.3-fold in the cells grown in the presence
of glycerol compared to that without glycerol, and the extent of down-regulation was almost
10.8-fold once the cells entered early stationary (non-growth) phase.
L. reuteri possesses theoretically an alternative glycerol-utilization pathway involving initial
reactions catalyzed by glycerol kinase (lreu_1065) and glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase
(lreu_0371), and the obtained dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP) is converted to interme-
diate glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate by triose-phosphate isomerase (lreu_0171, lreu_0237) before
entering the glycolytic pathway (Fig 1). However, no significant evidence has been found so
far to prove the feasibility of this pathway in L. reuteri; a possible reason could be the reversible
redox conversion catalyzed by the key enzyme glycerol-3-phosphate dehyderogenase (GPDH),
which plays a vital role in lipid biosynthesis and has been shown to allow the prompt dephos-
phorylation of glycerol 3-phosphate into glycerol [35].
Accorrding to Talarico et al. [5], addition of glycerol (20 mM) reduced the generation time
of L. reuteri from 66 min to 42 min, and as a consequence increased the final cell mass yield
about 3-fold. Although further increase in glycerol concentration to 40 mM did not influence
the generation time, the cell mass yield was consistently increased. Indeed, supplementation of
the growth medium with glycerol leads to an obvious increase in acetate and a significant
decrease in ethanol production, as also observed in our study.
These observations suggest that the Pdu pathway is the important route for glycerol metab-
olism in L. reuteri, and that glycerol, serving as an electron acceptor, could compete with acetyl
phosphate in glucose fermentation, resulting in a shift in metabolite production from ethanol
to acetate and the accumulation of 1,3-PDO (Fig 1).
Earlier studies have indicated that an alcohol dehydrogenase encoded by the Pdu operon is
involved in glycerol/1,2-PD metabolism in the microcompartment in L. reuteri as well as in
Salmonella enterica, and the role of the enzyme is mainly to regenerate NAD(P)
+
from NAD
(P)H [13,36]. It has also been shown that L. reuteri is able to excrete large amounts of 3-HPA,
an antimicrobial compound, to the outside of microcompartment and into the extracellular
medium while still maintaining viability at concentrations that are inhibitory to other micro-
organisms [37]. Hence, the self-defence mechanisms by 3-HPA detoxification in L. reuteri, as
the producer strain, was assumed to exist by habouring other conversion routes of 3-HPA.
Some microorganisms have mutiple ADHs, sometimes of different types for different func-
tions. For example, there is one well-characterised and 12 putative ADHs of one type found in
Sulfolobus solfataricus [38], while Pyrococcus furiosus has two different types of ADHs [39].
The presence of mutiple ADHs within one organism conceivably reflects the environment to
which the organism has been exposed and adapted. Therefore, each ADH may have a different
role and specificity for survival.
In this study, we have identified nine different genes encoding alcohol dehydrogenases in
L. reuteri DSM20016, three of which were hypothesized as genes encoding iron-dependent
ADHs including PduQ present in the Pdu microcompartment. Deletion mutants of L. reuteri
incorporating gene deletions of the iron-dependent ADHs ORFs (PduQ, ADH6, ADH7),

respectively, displayed different behaviours in the production of metabolites. Supplementation
with glycerol results in a higher growth of both L. reuteri wild type strain and mutants to differ-
ent extents, but with little effect on glucose consumption. The mutants LCH010 (Δlreu_1734,
PduQ deletion mutant) and LCH012 (Δlreu_0030, ADH7 deletion mutant) displayed 15.7%
and 15.8% increased growth rate, respectively, in the presence of glycerol, compared to the
wild type with 28% higher growth, implying an affected NAD
+
regeneration for 3-HPA reduc-
tion (Fig 7). Most strikingly, LCH011 (Δlreu_0321, ADH6 mutant) displayed 66% increased
growth rate with glycerol. Due to the lowest growth rate without glycerol (0.53 h
-1
) and almost
similar growth as the wild type L. reuteri in the presence of glycerol (0.88 h
-1
), ADH6 is not
likely to be involved in 3-HPA reduction but is responsible for another reaction in glucose
fermentation.
Indeed, shift in metabolites production was further detected in the wild type L. reuteri and
mutants. Although all the strains showed similar comsumption behaviour for glucose and
glycerol, LCH012 produced 7.5 mM less 1,3-PDO but 11.3 mM higher ethanol concentration
compared to the wild type (Fig 7). What was most suprising was that LCH010, the PduQ dele-
tion mutant, displayed similar production behaviour as the wild type. In contrast, the role of
ADH6, shown by LCH011 mutant, seems to be different. With 25.1% increased production of
lactate and 50.5% reduced ethanol production, ADH6 is assumed to play a role in cofactor
regeneration in the last step of glucose fermentation by converting acetyl-CoA to ethanol
instead of 3-HPA conversion.
Previous genetic tests illustrated that a PduQ deletion mutant grew slower than wild-type
Salmonella on 1,2-PDO and could not be complemented by co-expressing a non-microcom-
partment associated Adh2 from Zymomonas sp. that catalyzes the same reaction [36]. This
phenotype proposes that PduQ keeps a microcompartment-sp ecific function. The overarching
function of Pdu microcompartment is to optimize metabolic pathways by restricting the efflux
of toxic or volatile intermediates while allowing enzyme substrates, products and cofactors to
pass [40]. In another report, Cheng et al. reported that it could be possible to restore the
growth of a PduQ deletion mutant to wild-type levels by genetically disrupting the MCP shell
[36], which was ascribed to facilitating the free diffusion of the metabolites and NAD
+
/NADH
recycling.
The bifunctional alcohol/aldehyde dehydrogenase (ADHE) enzymes, which catalyse the
conversion of an acyl-coenzyme A to an alcohol via an aldehyde intermediate, by coupling
with oxidation of two NADH molecules to maintain the NAD
+
pool during fermentative
metabolism, are found in many microorganisms [41]. In L. reuteri, ADH6 is the bifuctional
dehydrogenase, which seems to catalyse oxidation of acetyl-CoA to ethanol, and has little
activity with 3-HPA substrate. The ADH-domain structure of ADH6 enzyme has been under-
stood to consist of an Rossmann-fold architecture and an α-helical domain containing residues
coordinating a metal ion, which is structurally similar to ADH7 and PduQ as shown by the
homology-model. In accordance with the data for the E. coli ADHE [42], the activity of the L.
reuteri ADH6 is only stimulated by the presence of Fe
2+
and not by other metal ions (unpub-
lished data), which is also the case for enzymes reported for Streptococcus bovis and Entamoeba
histolytica [43,44].
The exact mechanism of iron-dependent alcohol dehydrogenases catalysed reduction of
3-HPA to 1,3-PDO with concomitant NAD
+
generation remains to be elucidated. Neverthe-
less, the divalent metal ion in active site of the metal-dependent alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH)
is believed to aid polarization of the aldehyde carbonyl O atom, facilitating reduction by
NADH to proceed [37]. Furthermore, due to differences in the strength of the carbonyl group
polarization, the charge density of the metal ion can have an effect on the catalysis rate [42].

Cumulatively, our studies have confirmed that the PduQ enzyme can convert NADH to
NAD
+
to supply the cofactor needed for oxidation of 3-HPA (in a reaction catalysed by PduP)
internally within the MCP, while ADH7 is mainly responsible for providing NAD
+
via 3-HPA
to 1,3-PDO outside of the MCP. In fact, the latter enzyme exhibited faster reaction kinetics
compared to PduQ (Table 2).
Conclusions
The study reveals the diversity of alcohol dehydrogenases in Lactobacillus species, and their signif-
icance in energy and redox balance is exemplified in case of L. reuteri that uses glycerol as an elec-
tron acceptor and transforms it to 1,3-PDO via 3-HPA. Although glycerol is not used as a carbon
source by L. reuteri for cell growth, it influences metabolism and improves growth through cofac-
tor regulation; as the cofactor requirement is different for growing and resting cells, glycerol plays
different roles. It is yet to be determined to what extent the distribution of energy carriers, such as
NAD
+
/NADH through the microcompartment shells contribute to the regulation.
The findings presented here are the first to show the 3-HPA reduction to 1,3-PDO is not
limited just to the activity of PduQ located in the bacterial microcompartment but also to
ADH (ADH7) outside of the microcompartment, however with distinct roles in cofactor
regeneration. Moreover, ADH6, the bifunctional alcohol/aldehyde dehydrogenase, does not
play a role in 3-HPA reduction but is responsible for cofactor regeneration in the last step of
glucose fermentation by converting acetyl-CoA to ethanol. Further studies on the individual
enzymes are ongoing for gaining understanding of structure-function relationship as well as
potential in biocatalysis.
