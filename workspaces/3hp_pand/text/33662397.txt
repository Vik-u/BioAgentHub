Thiol dioxygenases are a subset of nonheme iron oxygenases
that catalyze the formation of sulﬁnic acids from sulfhydryl-
containing substrates and dioxygen. Among this class,
cysteine dioxygenases (CDOs) and 3-mercaptopropionic acid
dioxygenases (3MDOs) are the best characterized, and the
mode of substrate binding for CDOs is well understood.
However, the manner in which 3-mercaptopropionic acid
(3MPA) coordinates to the nonheme iron site in 3MDO re-
mains a matter of debate. A model for bidentate 3MPA coor-
dination at the 3MDO Fe-site has been proposed on the basis
of computational docking, whereas steady-state kinetics and
EPR spectroscopic measurements suggest a thiolate-only co-
ordination of the substrate. To address this gap in knowledge,
we determined the structure of Azobacter vinelandii 3MDO
(Av3MDO) in complex with the substrate analog and compet-
itive inhibitor, 3-hydroxypropionic acid (3HPA). The structure
together with DFT computational modeling demonstrates that
3HPA and 3MPA associate with iron as chelate complexes with
the substrate-carboxylate group forming an additional inter-
action with Arg168 and the thiol bound at the same position as
in CDO. A chloride ligand was bound to iron in the coordi-
nation site assigned as the O
2-binding site. Supporting HYS-
CORE spectroscopic experiments were performed on the
(3MPA/NO)-bound Av3MDO iron nitrosyl (S = 3/2) site. In
combination with spectroscopic simulations and optimized
DFT models, this work provides an experimentally veriﬁed
model of theAv3MDO enzyme–substrate complex, effectively
resolving a debate in the literature regarding the preferred
substrate-binding denticity. These results elegantly explain the
observed 3MDO substrate speciﬁcity, but leave unanswered
questions regarding the mechanism of substrate-gated reac-
tivity with dioxygen.
Thiol dioxygenases are a subset of nonheme mono-
nuclear iron oxygenases that catalyze the O 2-dependent
oxidation of thiol-bearing substrates to yield the corre-
sponding sulﬁnic acid. Among this group, cysteine dioxy-
genase (CDO) ( 1– 5) and cysteamine dioxygenase (ADO)
(6, 7) are responsible for the biosynthesis of cysteine
sulﬁnic acid (CSA) and hypotaurine (HT), respectively,
which are precursors for the biosynthesis of taurine ( 1).
Among bacteria, a number of other thiol dioxygenases
have been identi ﬁed, including mercaptosuccinate dioxy-
genase (MSDO) (8) and 3-mercaptopropionate dioxygenase
(3MDO) ( 9– 14). Plant cysteine oxidases (PCO) catalyze
the formation of an N-terminal cysteine sul ﬁnic acid
within ERF-VII transcription factors to initiate N-end rule
degradation (15, 16). A similar function has recently been
proposed for mammalian ADO in controlling regulators of
G protein signaling (17).
Over the past decade, this class of enzymes has attracted
considerable attention as imbalances in L-cysteine (CYS)
metabolism are associated with neurological diseases (5, 18, 19).
This observation suggests a correlation between impaired sul-
fur metabolism, oxidative stress, and neurodegenerative disease
(20, 21). Consequently, enzymes involved in sulfur oxidation
and transfer are increasingly being evaluated as potential drug
targets (22– 25).
Across the domains of life, structurally characterized thiol
dioxygenases share two major features: (1) a mononuclear
nonheme iron active site coordinated by three protein-derived
histidine residues and (2) a conserved sequence of outer Fe-
coordination sphere amino acids (Ser-His-Tyr), the latter be-
ing adjacent to the iron site ( /C24 3 Å). By analogy to the
chymotrypsin-like serine proteases, the Ser-His-Tyr (“SHY”)
network was previously referred to as a“catalytic triad” (5, 13,
14, 26– 30). However, these residues appear to enhance the
catalytic rate and efﬁciency but are not required for activity
(31– 34). Consequently, we simply refer to this hydrogen-
bonding network as the “
SHY” motif. In eukaryotic CDOs,

the “SHY” motif tyrosine (Tyr157) is covalently cross-linked
with an adjacent cysteine residue (C93) to yield a C93-Y157
pair (35, 36), whereas bacterial forms utilize an unmodiﬁed
Tyr-residue at this position.
As shown in Figure 1A, the substrate-bound mammalian
CDO reveals a bidentate coordination of CYS to the mono-
nuclear Fe-sitevia thiolate and neutral amine (32, 37, 38). Both
kinetic and spectroscopic studies demonstrate additional in-
teractions between the CYS-bound Fe-site and outer sphere
residues (Tyr157 and Arg60) within the CDO active site (27,
31). These multiple points of interaction are likely responsible
for the high substrate speciﬁcity exhibited by this enzyme (35).
To illustrate, cysteamine [2-aminoethanethiol, (CA)] is struc-
turally similar to CYS, lacking only theα-carboxylate group. It
is therefore reasonable that this substrate analogue could co-
ordinate to the CDO Fe-site in a similar bidentate fashion as
CYS. However, relative to CYS, a 10,000-fold decrease ink
cat/
KM was reported in steady-state reactions with CA ( 35).
Therefore, removal of the CYS carboxylate has a profound
impact on the formation of the CDO ES complex. More
dramatically, no activity whatsoever is observed in reactions
with similarly sized thiol substrates lacking an amine func-
tional group. This observation demonstrates that coordination
of the substrate amine to the CDO Fe-site is required for ac-
tivity. By contrast, 3MDO (Fig. 1B) is capable of accommo-
dating a variety of thiol-bearing substrates, such as 3-
mercaptopropionic acid (3MPA), CYS, and CA to catalyze
dioxygenation over a broad pH range (10, 11, 13, 14). While a
modest decrease in k
cat is observed in reactions with CA
[0.29 ± 0.08 s−1] relative to 3MPA and CYS [1.0 ± 0.1 s−1], the
vast difference in catalytic efﬁciency (kcat/KM) identiﬁes 3MPA
as the preferred substrate for MDO (14). Since 3MPA lacks an
amine functional group, theﬁrst coordination sphere for the
Av3MDO Fe-site cannot be equivalent to CDO.
To date, structures for the 3MPA-bound enzyme have been
unavailable; however, two models for substrate binding at the
Fe-site have been proposed. A bidentate model for 3MPA
coordination to the Fe-sitevia substrate thiol and carboxylate
functional groups was recently proposed by Jameson and
Karplus ( 9). In this report, docking of 3MPA into the
Pseudomonas aeruginosa 3MDO (Pa3MDO) crystal structure
led to the conclusion that a salt bridge formed between the
Arg168 guanidinium group and 3MPA carboxylate was cata-
lytically essential ( 9, 10). Structurally, this model closely
matches the CYS-bound mammalian CDO, although the
relevant Arg group is in a position nonhomologous to that of
mammalian CDO. The proposed salt bridge provided a
reasonable explanation for the decreased afﬁnity of the enzyme
for amino-bearing substrates. However, the instability of
Pa3MDO Arg168 variants precluded experimental validation
of this model by site-directed mutagenesis.
Alternatively, we have previously argued that 3MPA Fe-
coordination occurs via thiolate only based on the results of
two key experiments (12). First, pH-dependent kinetic data for
Av3MDO-catalyzed reactions with a substrate lacking a
carboxyl group (cysteamine, CA) reveal only a modest
decrease in k
cat-values [v0/[E], 0.29 ± 0.08 s−1] relative to re-
actions performed with 3MPA and CYS [1.0– 1.2 s−1]( 14).
Since both CDO and 3MDO exhibit an obligate-ordered
binding of organic substrate prior to molecular oxygen, we
conclude that Fe-coordination of the substrate– carboxylate
group is not required to produce the O
2-activating enzyme–
substrate (ES) complex. Second, experiments using the O2-
mimetic nitric oxide corroborate this argument. EPR spec-
troscopy veriﬁes formation of a substrate-bound iron-nitrosyl
species using thiol substrates lacking carboxylate groups [such
as CA and ethanethiol (ET)] ( 14). Therefore, direct Fe-
coordination of a substrate carboxylate is not required for
converting the Fe(II) site into an NO-reactive state. These
results clearly demonstrate that direct carboxylate coordina-
tion to the iron center is not obligatory to trigger oxygen
activation.
In order to address this discrepancy in 3MDO substrate-
binding models, we present the structure of Av3MDO in
complex with the substrate analog and competitive inhibitor,
3-hydroxypropionic acid (3HPA). Using theAv3MDO-3HPA
complex as a starting point, density functional theory (DFT)
computations were performed to model the coordination of
the native 3MPA substrate. Supporting HYSCORE experi-
ments performed on the (3MPA/NO)-bound Av3MDO

conﬁrm the NO-binding site and corroborate bidentate 3MPA
coordination in the substrate-bound iron-nitrosyl site. As
suggested by Jameson and Karplus, these experiments support
bidentate coordination of 3MPA with the substrate carbox-
ylate group forming an additional interaction with Arg168 and
the thiol bound at the same position as CDO.
Results
Crystal structure ofAv3MDO in complex with 3HPA
Following extensive sparse matrix screening, we identiﬁed a
condition giving rise to well-diffracting, rod-shapedAv3MDO
crystals. The optimized crystals diffracted X-rays to/C24 2.2 Å
resolution and belonged to space group P31 (Table S1 ).
Structure determination was initially complicated by the
presence of tetartohedral twinning and pseudosymmetry (see
Experimental procedures section for further details), but
eventually the structure was solved by molecular replacement
and reﬁned against reﬂections extending to 2.25 Å resolution
(Table S1). The polypeptide is clearly resolved except for the
extreme N- and C termini, which are omitted from theﬁnal
model. The asymmetric unit of theAv3MDO crystals consists
of 12 monomers arranged in pairs of C
2 symmetric dimers.
The moderately hydrophobic dimer interface buries an
average of /C24 1260 Å
2 (1199– 1322 Å2 depending on the spe-
ciﬁc dimer pair) or/C24 13% of the total monomer surface area
(39) and is structurally similar to the dimers observed for

3MDOs from other bacteria (11, 26), all suggesting that it
represents a physiologically relevant assembly. This ﬁnding
contrasts with cysteine dioxygenases, which are monomeric
proteins (37, 40).
Av3MDO exhibits the classic thiol dioxygenase cupin fold
consisting of three N-terminal alpha-helices followed by a
series of 11 β-strands forming the cupin β-barrel structure
that houses the enzymatic active site (Fig. 2A). Owing to the
near uniformity in structure between the 12 monomers (Cα
RMSD <0.4 Å), chain B was used as the representative
monomer for structural comparisons. Among 3MDOs of
known structure, Av3MDO exhibits greatest sequence and
structural similarity to the 3MDO enzyme fromP. aeruginosa
(Pa3MDO, PDB accession code: 4TLF) with 70% sequence
identity and a Cα RMSD of /C24 1 Å. The largest main chain
difference is found within the Leu113-Leu117β hairpin where
the insertion of an Arg inPa3MDO results in a 5.8 Å shift at
the tips of theβ hairpins (Fig. 2B, asterisk). Like inPa3MDO
and other thiol dioxygenases (11, 26, 28), the iron center of
Av3MDO is coordinated by three His residues (90, 92, and
142) contained within the conserved cupin motifs (Fig. 2C).
Although the Av3MDO sample used for crystallization was
/C24 36% loaded with iron, the ironB-factors are similar to those
of the surrounding His ligands when the metal is modeled at
full occupancy, indicating the metal-loaded enzyme selec-
tively crystallized ( Table S1 ). Additionally, the metal is
modeled as an Fe(III) ion given that a bulk of the iron in the
enzyme sample used for crystallization was in the ferric
oxidation state. However, some portion of the iron may have
been photoreduced to Fe(II) during data collection. Analysis
of residual electron density maps revealed two strong features
near the Av3MDO iron center, which could not be
successfully modeled with aquo ligands as was the case for
Pa3MDO ( 11)( Fig. S1 ). As described in detail in the
Experimental procedures section, we modeled these density
features with chloride ( trans to His90) and 3-
hydroxypropionic acid (3HPA, trans to His 92 and 142), the
latter being present as contaminant in the polyacrylate solu-
tion used for crystallization (Fig. 2C, Figs. S1 and S2).
3HPA binds to the iron center in a bidentate fashionvia its
hydroxyl and carboxylate oxygen atoms with metal – ligand
bond distances of/C24 2.1 to 2.2 Å (depending on the particular
monomer). The carboxylate group simultaneously engages in
an ionic interaction with Arg168, which is situated adjacent to
the iron center. The 3HPA carboxylate oxygen is located
/C24 3.1 Å from the hydroxyl group of Tyr159, which is part of the
“SHY” motif and is known to inﬂuence substrate binding to
the iron center (12). Notably, we do not observe a signiﬁcant
interaction of 3HPA with Gln63, the distinguishing residue of
the “Gln-type” thiol dioxygenases (26). These results indicate
that the carboxylate-interacting Arg residue is relocated from
position 61, as found in Arg-type thiol dioxygenases, to a
nonhomologous position in the“Gln-type” thiol dioxygenases,
as was previously suggested based on docking studies of 3MPA
in Pa3MDO (9).
Despite the close structural resemblance of 3HPA to the
native 3MPA substrate of 3MDOs (Fig. 3, inset), the inﬂuence
of this compound on 3MDO activity has, to our knowledge,
never been examined. Given its observed mode of binding to
the iron center, we hypothesized that 3HPA could act as an
inhibitor of Av3MDO. We tested this by carrying out
Av3MDO steady-state assays in the presence of 3HPA (Fig. 3).
We previously demonstrated that the initial rate ofAv3MDO-
catalyzed 3MPA reactions is independent of oxygen
Figure 3. 3-hydroxypropionic acid (3HPA) inhibition ofAv3MDO-catalyzed 3MPA-reactions. Kinetic data were collected in the presence of 167μM
(white square), 500μM( gray diamond), and 1500μM( white triangle) 3HPA for comparison to the uninhibited enzyme (black circle). SigmaPlot was used to
globally ﬁt enzyme kinetics in either Michaelis– Menten (A) or Lineweaver– Burk (B) fashion assuming a fully competitive model of inhibition. The resulting
least-square ﬁts (solid-lines) are overlaid on kinetic data to obtain values forkcat, KM, and KI, as well as the error associated with each parameter [1.31 ±
0.01 s−1, 6.7 ± 0.4μM, and 280 ± 26μM, respectively]. Michaelis– Menten results (A) are presented with a gap ranging from 0.6 to 0.8 mM 3MPA to avoid data
crowding at low concentration.

concentration down to/C24 25 μM( 13). Therefore, atmospheric
oxygen concentration is sufﬁcient to saturate the enzyme ki-
netics. Moreover, the consumption of oxygen per 3-
sulﬁnopropionic acid (3SPA) produced is essentially stoichio-
metric (14). Crucially, no oxygen is consumed upon mixing
enzyme with excess of 3HPA (10 mM). Therefore, the initial
rate of oxygen consumption was used to monitor enzymatic
inhibition as a function of inhibitor concentration. A
Lineweaver– Burk plot of the activity data revealed an inhibi-
tion constant (K
i) of 280 ± 26μM and intersection point at the
ordinate consistent with the behavior of a classic competitive
inhibitor. These results establish that 3HPA is an effective
substrate analog and that its mode of binding toAv3MDO
likely mirrors that of 3MPA.
Chloride binds to the iron centertrans to His90 at a dis-
tance of /C24 2.4 Å and simultaneously contacts the hydroxyl
moiety of Tyr159 forming a 2.7 Å ion – dipole interaction
(Fig. 2C). This corresponds to the binding site for solvent 3 in
the resting Pa3MDO structure (Fig. 1B). To distinguish this
site from the other solvent-bound positions, we refer to this as
the axial Fe-coordination site henceforth. Similar binding of
chloride has been observed in structures of CDO (27, 41) but
not in other“Gln-type” thiol dioxygenases determined to date.
Activity studies carried out in the presence of increasing Cl
−
show a modest degree of inhibition (30%) at the 100 mM
concentration found in the crystal (Fig. S3). However, EPR
experiments demonstrated that Cl − concentration has no
impact on the extent of NO binding to the 3MPA-bound
enzyme; therefore, it is unlikely that this chloride inhibition
reﬂects competition for O
2 binding at the iron center (data not
shown). It is possible that Cl− coordination is only signiﬁcant
for the ferric form of the enzyme, owing to its ability to provide
charge balance to the Fe(III)-site. Regardless, the presence of
an anionic ligand at the putative O
2-binding site of the enzyme
supports the idea that Tyr159 could facilitate the formation of
an Fe(III)-superoxo intermediate during the Av3MDO cata-
lytic cycle via hydrogen bonding (12).
Av3MDO active site accessibility
MDO homologs ofAv3MDO, including Pa3MDO, exhibit
active site openings on one side of the cupin beta barrel that
presumably serves as the passageway for organic substrate
diffusion (Fig. 4A, left). However, inspection of theAv3MDO
structure revealed that its active site is completely sealed off to
the bulk solvent (Fig. 4B, left). In comparison to the homolo-
gous residues ofPa3MDO, residues Tyr61, Pro88, and Phe180
of Av3MDO are shifted inward toward each other to occlude
the potential passageway (Fig. 4, A and B, right panels). We
observed additional variation within the active site of
Av3MDO as compared withPa3MDO including rotamer dif-
ferences for Phe79 and Trp81 that were found in all 12 copies
within the asymmetric unit (Fig. 5). Notably, the difference in
Figure 4. An occluded active site channel in 3HPA-boundAv3MDO. In contrast to the resting-state structure ofPa3MDO (A) in which the active site is
readily accessible to organic substrate through a passageway marked by anarrow on the left viewand a dashed circle on the right view, the active site of
Av3MDO (B) is completely sealed to bulk solvent due to positional differences in Tyr61, Pro88, and Phe180 (directionality differences with respect to the
corresponding residues inPa3MDO indicated byarrows). The structures are shown as Connolly surfaces.

Trp81 rotameric state results in different arrangements of the
“SHY” motif between Av3MDO ( Fig. 5 A) and Pa3MDO
(Fig. 5B). In thePa3MDO structure, the Ser155 residue of this
motif forms a hydrogen bond with Glu104, which simulta-
neously interacts with the Trp80 indole NH group. The
alternative conformation of Trp81 as observed in the
Av3MDO structure results in a/C24 2.2 Å shift in Glu105 toward
Ser153, which also has an altered conformation in the
Av3MDO structure (Fig. 5), resulting in a new H-bond inter-
action with Ser153. These collective changes produce an
extension of the“SHY” motif in Av3MDO.
Because intrinsic structural differences betweenAv3MDO
and Pa3MDO are expected to be small owing to their high
sequence similarity (Fig. 2A), we considered the possibility that
the observed active site differences could arise from the bound
substrate mimetic in Av3MDO. To test this hypothesis, we
identiﬁed alternative crystallization conditions to allow inves-
tigation of the resting-state structure ofAv3MDO. Following
further sparse matrix screening, we identiﬁed a crystallization
condition containing a nonpolyacrylate precipitant (pentaery-
thritol propoxylate) as well as sodium thiocyanate that pro-
duced yellowish, rod-shaped crystals. The crystals diffracted
X-rays to/C24 3 Å resolution and belonged to space groupP6
122
with a pair of dimers (same conserved interface described
above) in the asymmetric unit. Strong difference density in the
equatorial positions of the iron center was adequately
explained by two water molecules while the axial position
contained an elongated difference peak that was too strong to
represent only water or chloride ( Fig. S4A). Placement of
thiocyanate, a well-known Fe(III)-binding ligand present at>
0.3 M concentration in the crystal mother liquor, at this
position adequately accounted for the density with reasonable
reﬁned B-factors ( Table S1 ). Because thiocyanate is an
ambivalent ligand, test reﬁnements were carried out with the
anion boundvia either its nitrogen or sulfur atoms. Analysis of
difference maps and re ﬁned B-factors provided strong
evidence that coordination is through the nitrogen atom,
which is consistent with the coordination preferences of
Fe(III), a hard Lewis acid, and small-molecule crystallography
results for high-spin, nonheme iron model compounds (42).
Although this structure is not a true“resting-state” form of
Av3MDO, it allowed us to address the question of whether the
active site closure results from 3HPA binding.
Contrary to our hypothesis, we observed that the active site
has maintained its closed state in this new crystal form
(Fig. S4B). Hence, we conclude that the closed conformation is
energetically favorable in crystallo and that active site closure
is not strictly coupled to 3HPA coordination. Notable differ-
ences between the two Av3MDO crystal forms included a
/C24 40
/C14 rotation of the Phe79 Cβ-Cγ bond away from the iron
center in the 3HPA-bound structure as well as rotamer dif-
ferences for Gln63 and Ile98, which all are likely a conse-
quence of steric factors involving the different metal-bound
ligands (Fig. S4A). By contrast, the conformation of Trp81 is
identical in every copy within the asymmetric units of the two
Av3MDO structures, suggesting it represents an intrinsic
structural difference as compared withPa3MDO.
Computational modeling of theAv3MDO-3MPA complex
The structure of the Av3MDO-3HPA complex revealed a
bidentate coordination of 3HPA to the Fe-site through the
hydroxyl group and proximal oxygen of the carboxylate
(Figs. 2C and 5A). Given the near structural equivalence of
3MPA and the competitive inhibitor 3HPA, a logical argument
for bidentate 3MPA coordination within the enzymatic site can
be made. Based on this hypothesis, we determined the optimal
3MDO Fe-site geometry for the bidentate Av3MDO-3MPA
complex through DFT calculations using the coordinates from
the 3HPA-boundAv3MDO crystal structure as a starting point.
A truncated model for the inhibitor-bound active site,
comprised of iron, His residues 90, 92, and 142, chloride, and
Arg168, was generated and geometry-optimized with both
3HPA and 3MPA bound to the iron. Selectedﬁrst-coordination
sphere distances are presented inTable S2 for the Av3MDO-
HPA complex, CYS-bound CDO, synthetic nonheme mono-
nuclear iron model complexes, and our computational models.
Although the bulk oxidation state observed forAv3MDO was
ferric prior to crystallization, the possibility of reduction by the
synchrotron source could not be ruled out.
Figure 5. Active site differences observed between 3HPA-boundAv3MDO and Pa3MDO.Comparison of the 3HPA-bound structure ofAv3MDO (A) and
the resting-state structure ofPa3MDO (B) reveals active site conformational differences in Phe79/Phe78 and Trp81/Trp80 and a rearrangement of the“SHY”
H-bonding network with Glu105 interacting with Ser153 and Ser155 in theAv3MDO structure.

The pKa of the 3HPA hydroxyl (14.4– 15.1) is expected to be
much higher than the 3MPA-thiol (/C24 8) (43). While it is un-
likely that the Fe-bound 3HPA-hydroxyl is deprotonated, pKa
values for metal-coordinated water can decrease by several pH
units (44, 45). To corroborate the ionization state of the 3HPA
inhibitor, optimized DFT models for the deprotonated
(3HPA
2−)- and protonated (3HPA 1−)-hydroxyl group were
made with ferric and ferrous iron for comparison to the
crystallographic results (Table 1). While the overall structures
were similar (Fig. S5), the protonated (3HPA1−)-bound model
exhibited the lowest RMSD values relative to crystallographic
coordinates. Moreover, optimized bond distances and angles
closely match what is observed for the Av3MDO-3HPA
complex. From this we conclude that the 3HPA-inhibitor co-
ordinates bidentate to the Fe-site through carboxylate and
neutral hydroxyl groups. For simplicity, all calculations and
3HPA-bound structures discussed henceforth refer solely to
the 3HPA
1− form in which the hydroxyl group is protonated.
However, the calculated structural perturbations incurred by
altering the oxidation state of the iron (+IIversus +III) site fall
within the inherent error (/C24 0.1 Å) of the crystal structure.
Therefore, neither oxidation state can be ruled out on the basis
of these calculations.
Given the ambiguous oxidation state of the iron site, 3MPA-
bound structures were optimized in both the ferric and ferrous
states. Figure 6illustrates the Fe-sites for theAv3MDO-3HPA
XRD structure and the DFT-optimized 3MPA-bound model.
Selected bond distances and angles for both optimized struc-
tures are provided inTable 1for comparison. DFT-optimized
structures show a shorter bond length between the iron and
3HPA-hydroxyl than with the corresponding 3MPA-thiolate
[2.23 versus 2.32 Å, respectively for ferric and 2.26 versus
2.33 Å for ferrous]. Similarly, the distance separating the
substrate carboxylate O-atom from the Fe-site (Fe-O
carbox)i s
closer for the ferric 3HPA-bound model [2.08 for 3MPAversus
1.97 Å for 3HPA]. The trend is more drastic in the ferrous
state with 2.25 Å for 3HPA and 2.51 Å for 3MPA. The longer
bond length for the 3MPA-bound structure can likely be
attributed to (1) electrostatic interaction of the anionic
carboxylate group with the adjacent cationic Arg168 and (2)
inclusion of thee negative charges [Cl
− and 3HPA 2− (or
3MPA2−)] in the Fe(II) coordination sphere. However, charge
neutrality is easily remedied by loss of a chloride ligand in the
ferrous enzyme. For both ferric computational models, these
distances are shorter than observed in the Av3MDO-3HPA
complex (/C24 2.17 Å). By contrast, both ferrous models are
longer, but well within the estimated coordinate error of the
crystal structure (/C24 0.1 Å). Similarly, the average Fe-N
His and
Fe-Cl bond lengths for the 3MPA-bound complex are largely
invariant and any deviations observed fall well within the co-
ordinate error of theAv3MDO-3HPA complex. For compar-
ison, selected bond distances for thiolate-bound nonheme
ferric thiol dioxygenase enzymes and model complexes are
provided in Table S2.
Regardless of iron oxidation state (+II or +III), all optimized
structures modeled (3HPA
2−, 3HPA1−, and 3MPA) predict a
bidentate Fe coordinationvia a single carboxylate O-atom and
terminal oxide/hydroxyl or thiolate. As predicted by Aloiet al.
(9), this places the substrate carboxylate in a favorable position
for electrostatic stabilization by cationic Arg168. Taken
together with the XRD structure of the Av3MDO-3HPA
complex, these optimized DFT structures infer that the native
3MPA substrate coordinates to the Av3MDO iron site in a
bidentate fashion as well.
Modeling of the (3MPA/NO)-boundAv3MDO
Nitric oxide is frequently used as a surrogate for molecular
oxygen when characterizing nonheme iron oxidase/oxy-
genases. These experiments provide an excellent handle for
EPR spectroscopy as the resulting iron-nitrosyl {FeNO}
7 spe-
cies is paramagnetic (S = 3/2). According to the Feltham–
Enemark notation ( 46), the ground state S = 3/2 spin-
manifold is produced by an antiferromagnetic coupling be-
tween a high-spin Fe(III) (S = 5/2) and a bound NO
− anion
(S = 1). Moreover, given the similarity of the NO electronic
structure to O2, the resulting (3MPA/NO)-bound Av3MDO

ternary complex likely provides insight into transient iron-oxo
species produced during native turnover with oxygen. The
3MPA-bound iron nitrosyl form of Av3MDO has been
extensively characterized by EPR and Mössbauer spectros-
copies (12, 14). Such data provides an opportunity to validate
computational models by comparing predicted spectroscopic
properties to experimental values. To this end, we studied
whether bidentate iron coordination of 3MPA is retained in
the (3MPA/NO)-bound ternary complex. Starting from the
optimized Av3MDO-3MPA model, a new structure for the
(3MPA/NO)-bound Av3MDO active site was modeled and
optimized. As shown inFigure 7, nitric oxide was placed in
putative oxygen-binding site trans to His90, essentially dis-
placing the axial chloride in previous models. This positioning
of NO is also consistent with previous EPR experiments, which
suggest that hydrogen bonding from Tyr159 stabilizes NO
binding within the active site (12). The outer sphere Tyr159
was included in optimized models to account for this
interaction.
The precise orientation of hydrogen bonding between
Tyr159 and Fe-bound nitric oxide is not known. Therefore, an
energy surface (47– 49) for Tyr159 hydrogen bonding was
generated from the Av3MDO-3HPA complex to evaluate
likely H-bond acceptors (Supporting Information). As shown
in Fig. S6C, an energy minimum is observed for H-bond
donation from Tyr159 to the Fe-bound Cl atom for both
ferrous and ferric oxidation states. Potentially, substitution of
the axial chloride ligand for NO could alter the direction of the
Tyr159 H-bond to favor donation to H157. However, this
would be inconsistent with the previous EPR and Mössbauer
results. Moreover, as both chlorine and nitrosyl ligands have
an equivalent formal charge (−1), a reasonable argument can
be made that H-bond donation from Tyr159 would similarly
favor axially bound NO over His157.Table S3 illustrates the
inﬂuence of Tyr159 H-bond orientation on selected geometric
parameters in the optimized (3MPA/NO)-bound Av3MDO
Fe-site.
As an initial validation of the model, Mössbauer spectro-
scopic parameters were calculated for the optimized (3MPA/
NO)-bound active site structures allowing comparison to the
experimental values. As shown inTable S4, the isomer shift (δ)
and quadrupole splitting (ΔE
Q) observed for the (3MPA/NO)-
bound enzyme are reasonably reproduced by all optimized
models. In particular,ΔE
Q is highly sensitive to the nature and
symmetry of ligands directly coordinated to the Fe-site. Thus,
the closeness of calculatedΔEQ-values strongly supports the
hypothesis of a bidentate 3MPA coordination within the
(3MPA/NO)-bound enzyme. Overall, theΔE
Q and asymmetry
parameter (η) are bestﬁt in optimized structures with Tyr159
donating a hydrogen bond to the N-atom of nitric oxide.
However, the observed deviations among optimized structures
largely fall within experimental error. Therefore, while the
calculated Mössbauer parameters are entirely consistent with
the optimized model shown in Figure 7, the orientation of
Tyr159 hydrogen bond donation cannot be de ﬁnitively
assigned based solely on these results.
HYSCORE of the (3MPA/NO)-boundAv3MDO
As noted above, we have previously reported the charac-
terization of iron-nitrosyl produced by treating 3MPA-bound
Av3MDO with nitric oxide using continuous-wave (CW) EPR

spectroscopy (12). The CW EPR spectrum, shown inFigure 8
(panel A), has observed g-values of 4.06, 3.96, and 2.01
consistent with a nearly axial (E/D = 0.008) S = 3/2 iron-
nitrosyl site. Further, the measured axial zeroﬁeld splitting
(D =1 0±2c m −1) conﬁrms that this signal is derived from a
transition within the ground |ms = ± 1/2> doublet (38). These
parameters are consistent with other spectroscopically and
crystallographically characterized S = 3/2 iron-nitrosyl com-
plexes (50, 51). Crucially, the observed CW spectrum is nearly
homogeneous and exhibits only minor contributions from
known dinitrosyl (DNIC) complexes localized nearg =2 .A sa
result, this complex is ideal for further characterization by
hyperﬁne sublevel correlation spectroscopy (HYSCORE).
HYSCORE is a two-dimensional, four-pulse EPR technique
that directly probes magnetic nuclei coupled to paramagnetic
centers. This is an exceptionally sensitive technique that has
the resolution necessary to distinguish and characterize indi-
vidual nuclei. The magnitude of coupling for each magnetic
nucleus is highly dependent on the distance separating it from
the paramagnetic center and its position relative to the mag-
netic axis. Similar HYSCORE experiments have been per-
formed on a variety of nonheme enzymes to provide structural
details about the (substrate/NO)-bound active site geometry
(12, 51– 56). Moreover, relative to Mössbauer spectroscopy,
HYSCORE is much more sensitive to subtle structural per-
turbations in the outer coordination sphere of the Fe-site,
allowing for a more robust validation of the optimized
(3MPA/NO)-bound Av3MDO structure.
Figure 8 (panel B) shows a representative HYSCORE spec-
trum of the (3MPA/NO)-bound Av3MDO complex. This
spectrum was measured at 175 mT near the low-ﬁeld edge of the
CW EPR spectrum (Fig. 8A) where there is no contribution from
the small proportion of DNIC that appears nearg =2( 12, 38).
The spectrum can be divided into two quadrants, the (−,+ )
quadrant, or the left half of the spectrum, and the (+, +) quad-
rant, or the right half of the spectrum. HYSCORE peaks appear
in pairs that are reﬂected along the frequency diagonal at or near
the nuclear Larmor frequency. The spectrum inFigure 8B en-
codes precise information about the nuclei coupled to theS =3 /
2 center. The spectrum is comprised of multiple, overlapping
peaks characteristic of coupled
14N and1H from the coordinated
histidine ligands, NO, 3MPA, and other nearby residues making
up the second coordination sphere. The peaks in the (−,+ )
quadrant represent strongly coupled
14N nuclei; these peaks
arise from nuclei where the hyperﬁne couplings are much
greater than the14N Larmor frequency at 175 mT,/C24 0.54 MHz.
These peaks are characteristic of what is observed for directly
coordinated
14N from histidine ligands (53, 57). The (+, +)
quadrant contains peak from weakly coupled nuclei, namely
those where the
14N Larmor frequency is greater than the hy-
perﬁne coupling.Figure 8B shows several overlapping peaks in
the (+, +) quadrant below/C24 4 MHz; these peaks can be attrib-
uted to weakly coupled14N. In general, the remote14N of his-
tidine ligands in metalloenzymes has a much weaker hyperﬁne
coupling than the directly coordinated14N( 57). For example,
the remote14N in histidine residues coordinated to the diiron
site of the hydroxylase component of methane monooxygenase
was found to have an isotropic coupling of 0.8 MHz, whereas the
coordinated nitrogen had a coupling of 13.0 MHz (58). There-
fore, the peaks in the (+, +) quadrant below 4 MHz are likely the
remote
14N on the three coordinated histidine ligands, although
there could be a small contribution from second-sphere resi-
dues. In addition to
14N, the (+, +) quadrant reveals multiple
pairs of coupled1H peaks that are shifted from the1H Larmor
frequency by signiﬁcant dipolar couplings. The most intense
region of the1H spectrum is an arc centered near (5, 12) MHz
(ν1, ν2) that curves in toward the frequency diagonal. For
simplicity, we refer to the coordinates of the peak that is on the
high frequency side (largerν2) of the diagonal since each peak is
nearly symmetric about the diagonal. The arc consists of several
underlying peaks with similar anisotropic hyperﬁne couplings.
There are two additional sets of peaks with frequencies of (6– 9)
MHz; these are more weakly coupled
1H as they appear closer to
the 1H Larmor frequency along the diagonal.
In order to derive speci ﬁc structural information from
HYSCORE results, we carried out computational simulations
for comparison to the experimental spectrum. In this case, the
observed HYSCORE spectrum depends on several discrete

factors. For anI = 1/2 nucleus like1H, the peak positions are
largely determined by the hyperﬁne coupling and the position
of each nucleus with respect to the magnetic axis system.
Beyond these parameters, additional complications arise for
14N( I = 1) quadrupole nuclei. For this reason, we chose to
focus our attention solely on the1H region of the spectrum.
DFT calculations provide the geometry-optimized model from
which distances and positions of each coupled
1H can be
derived. As such, it is possible to simulate the HYSCORE
spectrum by including all protons in the calculated model.
However, the strongest couplings dominate the spectrum and
the simulated intensity, which makes the intensity of weakly
coupled protons dif ﬁcult to distinguish. Accordingly, we
focused on eight individual
1H with larger dipolar couplings
(Ttotal derived from Equation6, and listed inTable S5). These
protons are located on the coordinated histidine residues and
on C3 of 3MPA.Figure 9 shows HYSCORE spectra and sim-
ulations at magneticﬁelds spanning the low-ﬁeld region of the
EPR spectrum. The simulations take into account eight pro-
tons with axial hyperﬁne couplings, each with a hyperﬁne
tensor and a set of angles that relate the Fe-
1H vector and the
magnetic axis system. Many of these peaks overlap due to the
similarities in dipolar couplings. Figs. S7– S10 illustrate the
individual contributions for each simulated1H to the overall
1H HYSCORE spectrum. The hyper ﬁne tensors and Euler
angles, listed in Supporting Information (Table S5), were both
derived directly from the DFT-optimized structure (see
Experimental procedures for details).
The intensity of a1H HYSCORE peak depends in part on
measurement conditions, but the shape of the contours, or the
peak “footprint,” shows the range of observed nuclear fre-
quencies, which is largely independent of measurement con-
ditions. Consequently, HYSCORE spectra are simulated by
matching the peak locations and shapes rather than the in-
tensities. The simulations in Figure 9, plotted as black con-
tours, match the observed experimental contour shapes well.
While the overlap of
1H peaks in the HYSCORE spectra limits
our ability to optimize simulated contributions from individual
1H nuclei, the calculated parameters obtained from our
computational model reasonably reproduce the entire1H re-
gion of the observed spectra collected at multiple magnetic
ﬁeld positions. This later point is crucial as HYSCORE simu-
lations are sensitive to changes in the hyperﬁne tensor and
nuclear positions. To illustrate,Fig. S11demonstrates how the

are described in detail elsewhere (12). The data in (B) were collected with the following instrumental parameters: microwave frequency, 9.78 GHz;ﬁeld
position of 175 mT; temperature, 5 K; pulse repetition rate, 1.25 kHz;τ, 120 ns. Additional instrumental parameters are described in detail inExperimental
procedures.

simulated peaks for each1H can shift considerably with rela-
tively small changes in hyperﬁne coupling and/or its position
relative to the magnetic axis. Accordingly, the fact that the
simulations shown in Figure 9 reasonably overlay onto the
experimental peaks across multiple magneticﬁelds conﬁrms
that the calculated model produces reasonable distances and
locations for the
1H included in simulations. The protons in
the optimized model that are not included in these simulations
produce peaks that are too weak to resolve in the presence of
the intense peaks from strongly coupled protons. The 3MPA
protons on C2 fall into this category. We therefore performed
deuterium exchange experiments as additional corroboration
of bidentate 3MPA coordination. These experiments uniquely
identify any solvent-based ligands that would be present in the
case of monodentate 3MPA coordination. In principle, mon-
odentate 3MPA coordination would be evident from the
absence of strongly coupled
1H peaks in samples prepared in
2H2O-buffer. In order to test this, samples of (3MPA/NO)-
bound AvMDO were prepared in 2H2O-buffer in order to
observe Fe-coordinated solvent ligands and exchangeable
protons via lost peaks in the
1H HYSCORE spectrum. How-
ever, as shown inFig. S11, no such difference is observed in
2H2O samples. This observation is consistent with the absence
of solvent-derived ligands directly coordinated to the Fe-site.
Moreover, the observed nonexchangeable behavior is consis-
tent with what is expected for each simulated group
(Table S5).
Despite the inability to resolve the
1H peaks associated with
3MPA C2, a monodentate coordination of 3MPA can be
reasonably ruled out as this would signiﬁcantly alter the po-
sition and distance of the 3MPA C3 protons. Therefore, the
ability to simulate the
1H HYSCORE spectra collected at
multiple magnetic ﬁelds along with the absence of exchange-
able Fe-bound solvent ligands provides ample validation of the
optimized (3MPA/NO)-boundAv3MDO Fe-site model shown
in Figure 7. Collectively, these results corroborate that the
bidentate inhibitor coordination reﬂected in the Av3MDO-
3HPA complex is retained in the 3MPA-bound ES-complex.

bound Fe-site are consistent with the bidentate substrate
binding model proposed by Jameson and Karplus (9) where the
substrate carboxylate group simultaneously interacts with iron
as well as a nearby Arg168 residue. Interestingly, this Arg is
nonhomologous to the Arg residue employed by CDO to bind
the carboxylate group of CYS, demonstrating the phenomenon
of active site plasticity within different lineages of thiol diox-
ygenases (59). Given the ambiguous oxidation state in the
Av3MDO-3HPA complex, additional spectroscopic validation
was performed to independently corroborate the nature of
3MPA coordination at the enzymatic Fe-site. Computationally
predicted Mössbauer parameters (δ and ΔE
Q) for the opti-
mized (3MPA/NO)-bound Av3MDO site (Fig. 7) are consis-
tent with reported experimental values, thereby providing
support for a similar 3MPA coordination as present in the
Av3MDO-3HPA complex. Moreover, the closeness of simu-
lated HYSCORE
1H-couplings from coordinated His residues
(His90, His92, and His142) and 3MPA C3 to observed spectra
collected across multiple ﬁeld positions makes a powerful
argument for the validity of the optimized (3MPA/NO)-bound
Av3MDO active site model. Further, since coordination of NO
to the Fe-site deﬁnes the primary magnetic axis,
1H HYSCORE
simulations also verify NO (and likely also dioxygen) binds to
the axial Fe-site trans to His90. While 1H-peaks associated
with 3MPA C2 are too weak to resolve, the absence of a dif-
ference in peaks between
2H2O/H2O HYSCORE spectra
demonstrates that there are no solvent-derived ligands in the
Av3MDO ES complex, further supporting the conclusion of
bidentate coordination of the native 3MPA substrate at the
enzymatic Fe-site. Collectively, the combined crystallographic,
spectroscopic, and computational results provide an experi-
mentally veri ﬁed model for 3MPA binding within the
Av3MDO active site resolving a debate in the literature
regarding the denticity of substrate binding.
The chelate effect associated with bidentate 3MPA Fe co-
ordination likely explains the/C24 2000-fold increase in theK
M
value obtained in CA-reactions [0.013 ± 0.005versus 26.5 ±
5 mM] (14). As mentioned in the start of the text, we previ-
ously disregarded this possibility on the basis of our kinetic
and CW EPR studies performed onAv3MDO using multiple
thiol-bearing substrates (3MPA, CYS, CA, and ET) (14). Taken
together with the results presented here, it is evident that while
bidentate coordination of the native 3MPA substrate is
favored, it is not obligatory for catalysis or O
2 activation. For
substrates lacking a carboxylate functional group, only coor-
dination of a thiolate (presumablytrans to H92) is required for
gating O
2 activation. This behavior is unlike mammalian CDO,
which is highly speciﬁc for the L-isomer of CYS (35). Despite
the ability to activate oxygen,Av3MDO reactions with non-
carboxylate-bearing substrates are signi ﬁcantly uncoupled.
For instance, in assays with 3MPA and CYS, the consumption
of molecular oxygen is essentially stoichiometric with forma-
tion of the sulﬁnic acid. However, in reactions with CA, the
coupling efﬁciency decreased by more than half [40 ± 9%] (14).
Similarly, in reactions with the aromatic substrate 2-
mercaptoanaline (2MA), O
2 consumption was observed
without formation of a sul ﬁnic acid product. Instead, the
majority products of this reaction appear to be hydrogen
peroxide and 2MA disulﬁde (60, 61). By contrast, no oxygen
consumption is observed inAv3MDO reactions with inhibitor
(3HPA) in the absence of substrate. Similarly, no formation of
iron-nitrosyl species is observed by EPR upon addition of nitric
oxide toAv3MDO in the presence of excess 3HPA. Therefore,
thiol Fe coordination is essential for initiating O
2 activation;
however, coordination of the substrate carboxylate appears to
attenuate nonproductive “off pathway” reactions following
binding of O2 to the ES complex.
Orientation of hydrogen bonding network
The Av3MDO-3HPA structure reveals an apparent change in
the directionality of the“SHY” proton relay network relative to the
eukaryotic CYS-bound CDO. As shown inFig. S6A,T r p 7 7o ft h e
mammalian CDO serves as an H-bond donor to Ser153 (W77→
S153). This dictates the direction of proton donation toward the
Fe-site (dashed blue lines). By contrast, Glu105 of theAv3MDO-
3HPA complex (Fig. S6B) is an H-bond acceptor, thus reversing
(H157→Ser155→Glu105) hydrogen bond donation (dashed red
lines). This leaves Tyr159 in a favorable position to donate a
hydrogen atom to either His157 (red) or the axial Fe-bound
chloride (blue). We have previously reported for bothAv3MDO
and Mus musculus CDO that perturbations within the“SHY”
motif directly inﬂuence substrate speciﬁcity and denticity of Fe
coordination, nitric oxide afﬁnity, and the oxygenK
M-value (12),
as well as“coupling,” which is deﬁned as the molar ratio of O2
consumed per sulﬁnic acid produced (35). Despite these obser-
vations, the functional role of this conserved proton relay network
remains poorly understood. An obvious question is whether the
orientation of the Tyr159 H-bond donation plays any role in
gating O
2 activation to coordination of the substrate at the Fe-site.
Energy surface scan calculations on the optimized
Av3MDO-3HPA complex (Fig. S6C) predict that Tyr159 H-
bond donation to the Fe-bound chloride ligand is more stable
relative to the Tyr159→ His157 conﬁguration. This conclu-
sion is consistent with previously reported both EPR and
Mössbauer studies verifying direct interaction between the
SHY Tyr-residue and enzymatic Fe-site (12, 14, 31). However,
the particular atom (N or O) receiving the hydrogen bond and
how it would translate to catalytically relevant molecular ox-
ygen remains unsettled. While attempts were made to directly
observe and assign the Tyr159 hydroxyl proton by HYSCORE
spectroscopy, the peaks overlapped with other weakly coupled
1H that had anisotropic hyperﬁne couplings of<1 MHz. These
more distant1H, which include the1H on the remote nitrogen
of the three histidine residues and the1H on Arg168, overlap
near the matrix 1H peak that occurs at the nuclear Larmor
frequency along the diagonal (Shown inFig. S13). Accordingly,
the direction of the Tyr159 H-bond donation could not be
corroborated spectroscopically.
Implications of the closed active site cavity observed for
Av3MDO
A notable ﬁnding from our structural analysis ofAv3MDO
was its lack of a patent tunnel for substrate diffusion to the

active site. This observation was consist across all crystallo-
graphically independent protomers of bothAv3MDO crystal
forms. This structural uniformity suggests that the closed
conformation could be adopted in the solution form of the
enzyme, although the fact that it is observed in both the
presence and absence of 3HPA seems to rule out the possi-
bility that active site closure could be triggered by substrate
binding. Such a uniformly occluded conformation has not, to
our knowledge, been observed for other thiol dioxygenases,
although two of the four subunits of the Pa3MDO crystal
structure do appear to be occluded. Clearly, the active site
must communicate with the bulk solvent to allow organic
substrate entry, and the tunnel described inFigure 4is the best
candidate for such a role given its appropriate size and
orientation with respect to the iron center. Discerning the
relevance of the closed conformation observed forAv3MDO to
the thiol dioxygenase catalytic cycle will require further
research.
Experimental procedures
Protein expression and puriﬁcation
A detailed description for the expression and puriﬁcation of
this enzyme has been reported elsewhere (12, 14). Brieﬂy, the
Av3MDO expression vector was transformed into chemically
competent BL21(DE3) E. coli (Novagen Cat. no. 70236-4) by
heat shock and grown overnight at 37/C14 C on a LB-agar plate
containing 100 mg/l ampicillin (Amp). A single colony was
selected for training on antibiotic in liquid LB media prior to
inoculation of the 10-L BF-110 fermenter (New Brunswick
Scientiﬁc) at 37
/C14 C. Cell growth was monitored by optical
density at 600 nm (OD 600). Induction was initiated by adding
1.0 g isopropyl β-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG), 78 mg
ferrous ammonium sulfate, and 20 g casamino acids at an
OD600 value of/C24 4. During induction, the temperature of the
bioreactor was decreased from 37 to 25
/C14 C and agitation was
set to maintain an oxygen concentration of 20% relative to air-
saturated media. Four hours postinduction, cells were har-
vested and pelleted by centrifugation (Beckman-Coulter
Avanti J-E, JA 10.5 rotor). The resulting cell paste was stored
at −80
/C14 C.
In a typical puriﬁcation, /C24 20 g frozen cell paste was added
to extraction buffer [20 mM 4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-
piperazineethanesulfonic acid (HEPES), 50 mM NaCl, pH
8.0]. Lysozyme, ribonuclease, and deoxyribonuclease were
added to the slurry for aﬁnal concentration of 10μg/ml each
and stirred slowly on ice prior to pulse sonication (Bronson
Digital 250/450). The insoluble debris was removed from the
cell-free extract by centrifugation at 48,000g for 1 h at 4
/C14 C.
The supernatant was diluted 1:1 with extraction buffer and
then loaded onto a DEAE sepharose fastﬂow anion exchange
column (GE Life Sciences #17070901) pre-equilibrated with
20 mM HEPES, 50 mM NaCl, pH 8.0. The column was washed
with three column volumes of extraction buffer prior to
elution in a linear NaCl gradient (50 mM– 350 mM).
Fractions were collected overnight and pooled based on
enzymatic activity and/or SDS PAGE as described elsewhere
(12). The pooled enzyme solution was concentrated to/C24 50 ml
using an Amicon stir cell and YM-10 ultraﬁltration membrane
prior to thrombin protease (Biopharma Laboratories) cleavage
to remove C-terminal His-tag from the expressed enzyme.
Following overnight cleavage at 4
/C14 C, the enzyme was dialyzed
against 4 l of 20 mM HEPES, 20 mM NaCl at pH 8.0 to
decrease the salt content. A second DEAE column separation
in a linear gradient (50– 250 mM NaCl) was used to separate
the free (His)
6-tag from the puriﬁed enzyme. Precrystallization
desalting was performed by Sephadex G25 column equili-
brated with 20 mM HEPES, 10 mM NaCl at pH 8.0 prior to
concentrating drop freezing in liquid nitrogen and storage
at −80
/C14 C. Iron content was quantiﬁed spectrophotometrically
for both ferric and ferrous concentration using 2,4,6-tripyridyl-
s-triazine (TPTZ) in a method previously described (14, 38).
Enzyme assays
The rate of dioxygen consumption in activity assays was
determined polarographically using a standard Clark electrode
(Hansatech Instruments, Norfolk, England) in a jacketed
2.5 ml cell. Reaction temperatures wereﬁxed at 25
/C14 C±1 /C14 C
using a 5 l circulating water bath (Grant Instruments) and O2-
electrode calibration was performed as described elsewhere
(12, 31, 62). For all 3MPA concentrations [7– 1000 μM], re-
actions were initiated by addition of 5.0μM Fe(II)-Av3MDO.
Steady-state kinetic parameters for the enzyme used in ex-
periments were consistent with previously published values at
25
/C14 C[ kcat, 1.0 ± 0.1 s−1; KM,1 3±5 μM; kcat/KM, 72,000 ±
9200 M−1 s−1]( 14).
Data analysis
Inhibition kinetic results wereﬁt globally using theEnzyme
Kinetics Add-On module of SigmaPlot ver. 14.0 (Systat Soft-
ware Inc). In the presence of a competitive inhibitor, the
Michaelis– Menten and Lineweaver– Burk equations take the
form shown in Equations 1 and 2, respectively. From the
analysis, kinetic parameters (V
max, KM, and KI) as well as the
error associated with each value were determined by nonlinear
regression.

Av3MDO crystallization
Av3MDO crystallization conditions were identiﬁed through
sparse matrix trials using a number of commercially available
screens. The initial hit (crystal form A) was obtained in con-
dition 2-42 of the MIDAS screen (Molecular Dimensions),
which consists of 100 mM MES pH 6, 30% w/v poly(acrylic

acid sodium salt) 5100, and 10% v/v ethanol. Two microliters
of Av3MDO at a concentration of 40 mg/ml was mixed with
2 μl of the crystallization cocktail on a siliconized coverslip
(Hampton Research), and the resulting drop was incubated
over 500 μl of the same crystallization cocktail in a sealed
chamber at 22
/C14 C. Thin needle-shaped crystals with a tendency
to grow in clusters were observed after a week of incubation.
These initial crystals were replicated with independently pre-
pared solutions and further optimized through streak seeding
and inclusion of 50 mM MgCl
2 in the crystallization cocktail.
The optimized crystals grew as thin rods over the course of a
week with approximate ﬁnal dimensions of 50 × 50 ×
(100– 800) μm. Most crystals exhibited a splitting defect along
their long axis. The crystals were harvested directly from the
mother liquor using elliptical Microloops (Mitegen) andﬂash
frozen in liquid nitrogen.
To obtain an alternativeAv3MDO crystal form,Av3MDO
was further puri ﬁed by anion exchange and gel ﬁltration
chromatography in the absence of reducing agents and then
concentrated to 40 mg/ml. A second crystallization hit (crystal
form B) was obtained in condition E4 of the MidasPLUS
screen (MD1-107, Molecular Dimensions), which consists of
100 mM HEPES pH 7, 40% v/v pentaerythritol propoxylate (5/
4 PO/OH), and 0.2 M sodium thiocyanate. Two microliters of
Av3MDO at a concentration of 40 mg/ml was mixed with 2μl
of the crystallization cocktail on a siliconized coverslip
(Hampton Research), and the resulting drop was incubated
over 500 μl of the same crystallization cocktail in a sealed
chamber at 22
/C14 C. Yellowish, rod-shaped crystals with
“feather-duster” growth defects on each end were observed
after 2 to 5 days of incubation. The growth defects were
minimized by changing the HEPES, pentaerythritol propox-
ylate, and sodium thiocyanate concentrations to 50 mM, 44%,
and 0.6 M, respectively. Mature (150 × 150 × 600μm) single
crystals were harvested directly from the mother liquor using
Microloops (Mitegen) andﬂash frozen in liquid nitrogen.
X-ray diffraction data collection, processing, and analysis
Av3MDO crystal diffraction data were collected using
beamlines 17-ID-2 (FMX) at the National Synchrotron Light
Source (NSLS)-II, beamline 12-2 at the Stanford Synchrotron
Light Source (SSRL) and beamline 24-ID-E (NE-CAT) at the
Advanced Photon Source (APS). All form AAv3MDO crystals
examined were twinned to various degrees as described in
more detail below. The microfocusing capability of the FMX
17-ID-2 beamline was used to collect data from small crystal
volumes to minimize contributions from twin-related do-
mains. Initial crystals diffracted to/C24 2.7 Å resolution and the
diffraction was somewhat anisotropic, being strongest along c*.
Weak diffuse scatter was observed between reﬂections in h-k
planes of reciprocal space. Data were indexed, integrated, and
scaled using XDS (63). The data were initially processed in
space groupP622 and examination of axial reﬂections along c*
indicated the presence of a 6
2 or 64 screw axis. Analysis of the
intensities with the L-test (64), as implemented inphenix.xt-
riage (65), provided strong indication that the data were
twinned. The data were therefore reprocessed in space groups
P321 and P3 with similarRmerge values for each. H-tests (66)
for the four possible unique twin operators in the latter point
group indicated that the crystals were tetartohedrally twinned.
Crystal streak seeding and the inclusion of MgCl
2 in the
crystallization cocktail substantially reduced crystal twinning
and improved the data resolution to/C24 2.25 Å. The optimized
crystals remained partially merohedrally twinned with respect
to operator (k, h,−l). The best crystals of crystal form B dif-
fracted X-rays to /C24 2.9 Å resolution. Data were processed in
space groupP6(
1,5)22. While no twinning was detected in this
crystal form, the native Patterson map suggested the presence
of pseudotranslational symmetry. X-ray data collection statis-
tics are shown inTable S1.
Structure reﬁnement and analysis
Structure solution for crystal form A was carried out by
molecular replacement in Phaser (67) using the coordinates
of a related 3MDO protein ( 5)a sas e a r c hm o d e l( P D B
accession code 4TLF). Structure solution was attempted,
unsuccessfully, in space groups P6(
2, 4 )22 before it was
realized the data were twinned. Space groups P3(1, 2 )12
were excluded from further consideration owing to poor
merging statistics. MR trials in space groups P3(
1, 2)21 led
to a clear solution in space groupP3121 with four molecules
(a pair of dimers) per asymmetric unit and a solvent content
of 64%. Amino acid substitutions and model adjustments
were made usingCoot (68) and the model was reﬁned using
Refmac (69). After several rounds of model building and
reﬁnement, R
free plateaued at /C24 3 7 % .A tt h i sp o i n t ,am a -
jority of the strongest residual electron density was found
within a large solvent channel, but it was largely uninter-
pretable. The possibility o f rotational pseudosymmetry
causing an elevation in the apparent crystal symmetry was
considered and the partially re ﬁned Av3MDO coordinates
were used as a search model for molecular replacement in
space group P3
1. Phaser located 12 molecules in the
asymmetric unit giving a solvent content of 47%. Re ﬁne-
ment of this new model against the P31 processed data
(with Rfree reﬂections transferred from the original data set
after symmetry expansion to P31)r e s u l t e di na ni m m e d i a t e
reduction of Rfree to /C24 28% and elimination of the residual
density features noted above. RvR analysis (70)o ft h eP31
data and calculated amplitudes as implemented in phe-
nix.xtriage (65) revealed the presence of twofold rotational
pseudosymmetry along the a and b axes together with
partial merohedral twinning (k, h, −lw i t hα /C24 0.34). These
features were also evident from inspection of Patterson self-
rotation plots, which showed strong chi = 180
/C14 peaks along
the “a” and “b” axes. Together, these features accounted for
the similar Rmerge values for space groups P3121 and P31.
The space group assignment was further validated using
Zanuda (71) and labelit.check_pdb symmetry (72)a sw e l la s
by manual inspection of the crystal packing environment
for each of the monomers in the asymmetric unit. A
monomer from the P3
1 model was then used as a model to

solve crystal form B by molecular replacement in space
group P6122 with four monomers in the asymmetric unit.
Reﬁnement of both models was completed by alternating
reciprocal space reﬁnement in Refmac, using the amplitude-
based twin reﬁnement option in the case of crystal form A,
and manual model improvements in Coot. Coordinate and
dictionary ﬁles for the test ligands were generated using the
GRADE server (Global Phasing LTD). In the case of crystal
form A, inspection of residual density near the iron center
revealed a large peak in the axial position and an elongated,
continuous feature in the equatorial positions, indicative of a
diffusible ligand set different from the three aquo complex
modeled in the structure ofPa3MDO (Fig. S1A)( 11). Indeed,
placement of three water molecules poorly explained the re-
sidual density as shown in Fig. S1B. The density trans to
His142 was ﬂat and appeared to make a simultaneous inter-
action with Arg168, suggesting it could represent a
carboxylate-containing ligand. Modeling of a bicarbonate at
this position resulted in an excellentﬁt to the electron density
map (Fig. S1C). However, the bicarbonate-H
2O-H2O model
resulted in residual positive density features at the axial posi-
tion trans to His 90 as well as between bicarbonate and the
water ligand trans to His92 in addition to an unacceptably
close interaction (2.1 Å) between the nonaxial water and bi-
carbonate ligands (Fig. S1C). Replacing the axial water with a
chloride ion, which was present in the crystal mother liquor at
/C24 100 mM concentration, fully quenched the residual density
with a reasonable reﬁned B-factor (Fig. S1D). Chloride binding
at the equivalent site in CDO was previously reported (27, 41),
which further supports the plausibility of our assignment. The
difference map analysis described above suggested that the
equatorial features represented a single carboxylate-containing
compound. Since known components of the crystal mother
liquor could not account for the electron density, we further
considered possible contaminants that the density could
represent. 3-hydroxypropionic acid is a known precursor and
contaminant of the polyacrylate used forAv3MDO crystalli-
zation, which we conﬁrmed by mass spectrometry, and was
considered the most likely source of the electron density
feature (73, 74). Additionally, 3HPA is a close analog of the
3MPA substrate of Av3MDO. Placement of 3HPA at this
position completely quenched the residual density with reﬁned
B-factors closely matching those of iron and its other ligands
(Fig. S1E and Table S1). We also attempted to model 3MPA
into the density, but observed a residual density hole near the
sulfur atom, which also exhibited an elevatedB-factor relative
to the remainder of the molecule (Fig. S1F).
The initial difference maps for the crystal form B model also
revealed density in both the equatorial and axial positions. The
equatorial features were interpreted as two coordinated water
molecules while the axial density was elongated and not
adequately satisﬁed by modeling either a single water or
chloride ligand. The elongated density instead strongly sug-
gested a bound thiocyanate ligand, which was modeled with its
nitrogen atom directly coordinating the iron ion based on
difference map analysis and reﬁned B-factors computed with
the ligand modeled in either orientation.
Structure validation was carried out with the Molprobity
(75) and wwPDB (76) web servers. Theﬁnal model statistics
are shown inTable S1. The coordinates and structure factor
amplitudes have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank
under accession code 6XB9 (crystal form A) and 7KOV
(crystal form B).
Mass spectrometry
Sodium polyacrylate 5100 solution (Hampton Research) was
diluted to 10% (v/v) with Millipore water. In total, 100μl of the
resulting solution was mixed with 900 μl of HPLC-grade
acetone to precipitate the acrylate polymer and the mixture
was centrifuged at 17,000g for 15 min. The supernatant (10μl)
was diluted with 50% HPLC-grade methanol (90μ
l), and 10μl
of the resulting solution was analyzed with LXQ Mass spec-
trometer (Thermo Scientiﬁc) coupled with an Ultimate 3000
HPLC system. 3HPA standard (Sigma-Aldrich) was prepared
in an identical manner. Chromatography was performed with a
Poroshell 120 EC C18 Column (2.7μm, 4.6 mm × 50 mm,
Agilent Technologies) using a gradient mobile phase of
acetonitrile/2-propanol (1/1, v/v) in water from 20% to 98%
over 20 min. Theﬂow rate was 0.6 ml/min. Ions were detected
in negative mode with a normalized collision energy of 35%.
Pulsed EPR measurements
HYSCORE measurements were made using an ELEXSYS
E680 EPR spectrometer (Bruker-Biospin) equipped with a
Bruker Flexline ER 4118 CF cryostat and an ER 4118X-MD4
ENDOR resonator. Measurements were made at 5 K with a
nominal EPR frequency of 9.78 GHz and used a four-pulse
sequence, π/2−τ−π/2−t1−π−t2−π/2−τ−echo. This sequence
was repeated at a rate of 1.25 kHz with values of 16 ns and
32 ns for theπ/2 andπ pulses, respectively. The times t1 and
t2 were varied independently from 48 ns to 3096 ns in in-
crements of 24 ns for a total of 128 points in each dimension.
The delay timeτ was set to 120 ns to maximize resolution in
the
1H region of the spectrum. HYSCORE spectra were pro-
cessed using custom scripts in MATLAB (Mathworks,
R2020a). Brieﬂy, the complex raw data was phased to minimize
the imaginary component, and the background decay was
subtracted in each dimension by removing a second-degree
polynomial. Then, a diagonal Blackman apodization function
was applied to minimize noise at larger values of t1 and t2. The
data were then zero-ﬁlled in both directions to 1024 points
before calculating the two-dimensional Fourier transform. The
absolute value of the real part of the Fourier transform is
displayed. HYSCORE peaks are symmetric about the fre-
quency diagonal; however, several factors, including interfer-
ence from strong nuclear modulation, can affect the intensity
of each peak. As a result, real peaks are roughly symmetric
about the frequency diagonal, but they can have minor in-
tensity variations. Noise, on the other hand, is not symmetric
about the diagonal. Therefore, the spectra were left unsym-
metrized in order to best distinguish between signal and noise.
Spectra were simulated using the“saffron” function in Easy-
Spin, a comprehensive EPR toolbox in MATLAB (77).

HYSCORE simulations on the1H region are based off the

where −γH is the proton gyromagnetic ratio,bS and bI are the
electron and nuclear spin operators,B is the magnetic ﬁeld

couplings were modeled using an axial dipolar tensor,
A ¼½ −T; − T; ð2 /C3 TÞ/C138 (4)
where T is the anisotropic contribution of the hyper ﬁne
interaction. The tensor was considered purely dipolar due to
the distance of the coupled
1H, which is consistent with other
HYSCORE analyses of {FeNO}7 centers (52– 54). The dipolar
contribution, T, was calculated using the geometry-optimized
DFT structure of 3MPA-bound Av3MDO treated with NO
and spin-projection factors that take into account the elec-
tronic structure of the {FeNO}
7 center (52, 54). In brief, dis-
tances between the Fe, the N, and the O of NO and each1H
were used to calculate a TFe, TN, and TO according to the
point-dipole approximation.

where TFe, TN, andTO are the dipolar couplings resulting from
the point-dipole approximation using the distance between the
1H and the Fe, N, and O of NO, respectively. The couplings for
the 1H on His90 and His142 were varied by ±0.1 Å, which is
the estimate of the precision of the atomic locations in the
crystal structure. Equations 5 and 6 were used to transform
the ±0.1 Å variation into the corresponding value in MHz. The
other
1H couplings were left unvaried. For each1H, the dipolar
coupling between the 1H and the Fe dominates Equation6;
therefore, the vector connecting each1H and Fe is a reasonable
approximation of the hyperﬁne interaction (52). In addition to
the hyperﬁne coupling, HYSCORE simulations take into ac-
count the transformation of the hyper ﬁne tensor into the
magnetic axis system. This transformation is deﬁned by a set
of Euler angles (α, β, γ) in EasySpin that follow the zy0z0
convention. In the case of an axial hyperﬁne interaction, only
two angles are necessary. As with other {FeNO}7 centers, the
principal axis of the zeroﬁeld splitting (zfs) and the molecular
z axis are nearly coincident (52, 53). As a result, these Euler
rotations can be approximated using polar anglesu and ɵ,
where u is taken as the angle between the proton and the x-z
plane, and ɵ deﬁnes the deviation from the z-axis deﬁned by
the Fe-NO bond. An illustration belowTable S3 shows how
these angles relate to structure for a1H on 3MPA. All angles
were measured based on the geometry-optimized structure
using Chimera 1.14 (UCSF) (78). While simulations were not
very sensitive to the value ofu, the value ofɵ was varied for
His90 and His142 by<10% for the bestﬁt.
Computational modeling
All calculations were performed using Orca version 4.2 (79).
Starting coordinates for geometry optimizations were extrap-
olated from the crystal structure presented in this work and
the crystal structure ofPa3MDO, PDB 4TLF. Optimizations
were done by capping the alpha-carbons of each residue with a
methyl group. Histidines directly coordinated to the iron were
capped at the beta-carbon. Preliminary optimizations were
done by optimizing only hydrogens and constraining the
dihedral angles of capped methyl group hydrogens relative to
the constrained main group atoms. These methyl groups were
constrained in all geometry optimizations. Histidines coordi-
nated to iron were protonated at the δ-position. Geometry
optimizations utilized two methods. Most optimizations used
the BP’86 functional with the Ahlrichs def2-tzvp basis set on
iron and directly coordinated atoms and the def2-svp basis set
on all other atoms (80– 82). This method has been shown to
work well for transition metal complexes (83). The nitroxide
containing complexes used the B3LYP functional with the
same basis set allocation as described earlier. B3LYP was
chosen among other tested functionals (e.g.,B P’86, TPSS, PBE,
and PBE0), as it was the only functional that could reproduce
the expected antiferromagnetically coupledS = 3/2 {FeNO}
7
electronic structure withS = 5/2 for iron andS = −1o nt h e
nitrosyl ligand. Additionally, the iron nitrosyl complexes used
the “broken-symmetry” approach where the wavefunction was
calculated as a high spinS = 7/2 system beforeﬂipping the sign
of the spin on the nitrosyl atoms to converge to anS = 3/2
system (84). All calculations utilized Grimme’s D3 dispersion
correction, a CPCM solvent model withε = 4 to emulate a
protein environment, and either the resolution of identity (RI)
for BP’86 or resolution of identity and chain of sphere (RIJ-
COSX) approximation for B3LYP with def2/J auxiliary basis
sets (85– 88).
Mössbauer parameters were calculated using the B3LYP
functional with the CP(PPP) basis set for iron and def2-TZVP
on all other atoms. Orca speciﬁc settings featured the radial
integration accuracy raised to 7 for the iron atom and a
TightSCF convergence threshold with Grid5 and FinalGrid7
for the whole structure. Quadrupole splitting (ΔE
Q) and η
were calculated directly in Orca using the electric ﬁeld
gradient on the iron nucleus. The isomer shift (δ) was deter-
mined from the method described by Remoltet al.(89) using
the s electron density at the iron nucleus.
EPR parameters were calculated with the same method
described for Mössbauer parameter, with the exception of the
IGLO-II basis set used for sulfur and EPR-II used for all other
Mode of substrate binding in a thiol dioxygenase

atoms (CP(PPP) was still used for iron). The spin – orbit
coupling part of the zeroﬁeld splitting tensor was calculated
with the coupled-perturbed method and the spin– spin part
was calculated using the spin density of“UNO” orbitals (84).
Isotropic and dipolar contributions of hyperﬁne coupling were
calculated for the nitrogens of H90, H92, H142, and Arg168
and the hydrogens of H90, H92, H142, Arg168, 3MPA, and the
phenol hydrogen of Tyr159.
