Pichia pastoris
ABSTRACT
Enabling tools are essential for facilitating the methanol bioconversion in Pichia pastoris . However, there is still a 
relative lack of promoters that can stably express high levels without being affected by the carbon source, which 
hinders the construction and modification of cell factories containing long metabolic pathways. This study 
mapped a gene expression intensity library of central metabolic pathways in P. pastoris under methanol and 
glucose conditions. Through modification of the upstream sequences of promoters, an artificial promoter P
S2 
was 
developed with a strong intensity up to 90 % of P
GAP
. By using this promoter, we successfully constructed a 
hybrid pathway that integrates the β -alanine and malonyl-CoA pathways for the production of 3-hydroxypro -
pionic acid. Further combining rational metabolic engineering strategies, such as optimizing gene copy 
numbers and blocking byproduct synthesis pathways, the engineered strains CHP9 and CHP20 achieved 3-HP 
titers of 23 g/L and 22 g/L by using methanol as the sole carbon source. These results indicate that adaptive 
strength of promoters can facilitate efficient chemical biosynthesis in methanol bioconversion by mitigating 
glucose repression effects. This work preliminarily explored the expression patterns of genes in the central 
metabolic pathways of P. pastoris , identified and characterized the intensities of various endogenous promoters, 
and extended the enabling toolbox for P. pastoris . This result also lays a foundation for the construction of mi -
crobial cell factories and the industrial production of 3-HP via methanol bioconversion.
1. Introduction
Pichia pastoris (also known as Komagataella phaffii ) is an unconven -
tional methylotrophic yeast capable of using methanol as sole carbon 
and energy source. Owing to the characters of robustness, high-density 
growth [ 1 ] and tightly regulated methanol-inducible expression sys -
tem, which making P. pastoris a widely used host for recombinant pro -
tein production [ 2 , 3 ]. P. pastoris is also recognized as Generally 
Recognized as Safe (GRAS) [ 4 ], which greatly expands its application as 
microbial cell factory platform. Recombinant protein expression typi -
cally involves in single gene modification. However, the production of 
complex chemicals usually required the reconstruction of metabolic 
pathways and regulating gene expressions. This process heavily relies on 
enabling tools, including the CRISPR-Cas9 gene-editing system and 
promoters expression intensity [ 5 ]. In P. pastoris , despite CRISPR-Cas9 
gene-editing tools were successfully constructed, and the gene editing 
efficiency improved either by enhancing homologous recombination [ 6 ,
7 ] or blocking non-homologous end joining process [ 8 ], the genetic el -
ements such as promoters are still deficient in P. pastoris .
In metabolic engineering, efficient genetic tools facilitate the precise 
manipulation of bioconversion pathways. Promoter is core enabling 
element in gene expression systems, specifically binding RNA

polymerase to drive the transcription of target genes, and level of gene 
expression [ 9 , 10 ]. Despite significant efforts have been made to explore 
the promoters in P. pastoris [ 11 – 15 ], the available endogenous pro -
moters remain quite limited, making challenges for efficient regulating 
gene expression involved in metabolic pathways during methanol 
bioconversion. Currently, the most commonly used promoters in 
P. pastoris are the methanol-inducible strong promoters P
AOX1 
(alcohol 
oxidase I) [ 16 ] and P
DAS2 
(dihydroxyacetone synthase) [ 17 ]. A library of 
P
AOX1 
promoter variants with enhanced activity has been developed 
through targeted modification of the underlying transcription factors 
[ 18 ]. As well as the strong constitutive promoters P
GAP 
(Glycer -
aldehyde-3-phisphate dehydrogenase) [ 19 ] and P
TEF1 
(transcriptional 
elongation factor) [ 10 ], a promoter library containing a P
GAP 
promoter 
mutant with transcriptional activity about 48-fold greater than that of 
the wild-type was obtained through random mutation [ 20 ]. Addition -
ally, inspired by natural bidirectional promoters, an artificial bidirec -
tional promoter library has been developed as an efficient solution for 
gene co-expression [ 21 ]. However, the repeated use of the same pro -
moter can lead to noticeable competition effects, reducing the tran -
scriptional expression levels of target genes and causing cellular 
instability, such as homologous recombination and gene loss [ 13 ]. 
Common promoter elements in yeast including Upstream Activating 
Sequences (UAS), TATA box and core promoter [ 22 ]. Among them, UAS 
serves as the binding site for transcription factors and RNA polymerase 
II, and thus can be fine-tuned through rational modification [ 23 – 25 ]. In 
eukaryotes, the design of synthetic core promoters also has significantly 
enhanced the performance of synthetic variants [ 26 ]. Blazeck [ 27 ] 
demonstrated that by combining different UAS elements (UAS
TEF1 
and 
UAS1B) and arranged 12 UAS
TEF1 
in tandem, the strength of promoter 
can be enhanced by 3 – 4.5 folds, achieving nearly 7-fold higher than the 
strong constitutive promoter P
TEF1
. An artificial promoter YGP1v7 with 
high activity in acidic environment was obtained by replacing the core 
promoter region and inserting transcription factor binding sites in UAS 
[ 28 ]. Ye [ 29 ] constructed two hybrid growth phase-dependent pro -
moters (Phy3 and Phy4) by tandem fusing UAS region, which had 2-fold 
increased activities compared to the wild-type promoters (Pro-Y13 and 
Pro-Y14). Therefore, exploring and modification of more promoters is an 
effective strategy to expand the genetic regulation elements for meth -
anol bioconversion and cell factory construction in P. pastoris.
P. pastoris is now well developed to bioconvert methanol into vari -
eties of chemicals, including 3-hydroxypropionic acid (3-HP) [ 23 ], fatty 
acids [ 30 ], fatty alcohols [ 31 ], polyketides [ 32 ], isoprenoids [ 33 ], and 
L -lactic acid [ 34 ], however, the titers are generally lower than those 
achieved through sugar-based fermentation. 3-HP is one of the 12 key 
platform chemicals [ 35 ] widely used in the chemical, pharmaceutical, 
food and agricultural industries [ 36 ]. The biosynthetic pathways for 
3-HP are diverse [ 37 ], and the malonyl-CoA reductase (MCR) pathway is 
particularly notable due to its fewer steps and the high availability of the 
precursor acetyl-CoA [ 38 ]. According to predictions from genomic 
metabolic models, the β -alanine pathway offers a higher theoretical 
yield when methanol or glycerol is used as the sole carbon source [ 37 ,
39 ] ( Supplementary Table S1 ). This indicates that the β -alanine pathway 
is a potential option for the economical production of 3-HP.
In this study, we first characterized the endogenous promoters of 
central metabolic pathway genes in P. pastoris , and identifying the 
medium-strength constitutive promoter P
PYC2
. By using promoter pre -
diction tools to assist the truncation of the upstream sequences, we 
obtained a variant promoter P
S2 
with double transcriptional activity 
compared to P
PYC2
. We also constructed various hybrid promoters by 
linking different UAS regions to enhance activity. Subsequently, we 
established a hybrid pathway combining the β -alanine pathway and 
malonyl-CoA pathway, using promoters P
S2 
and P
AOX1 
to regulate the 
β -alanine-pyruvate transaminase genes ( BAPAT ) and 3-hydroxypropa -
noate dehydrogenase gene ( YDFG ) or malonyl-CoA reductase N-termi -
nus ( MCRN ), respectively. The engineered strain CHP9 and CHP20 
achieved 3-HP titers of 23 g/L and 22 g/L in bioreactors, with a yield of 
0.13 g/g methanol. This study not only enriches the enabling toolbox for 
P. pastoris but also provides engineering strategy for construction of 
hybrid 3-HP biosynthetic pathways.
2. Results and discussion
2.1. Screening promoters related to central metabolism pathways in 
P. pastoris
In previous studies, we characterized the promoters of partial genes 
related to methanol metabolic pathways and expanded the enabling 
toolbox of P. pastoris [ 6 ]. However, methanol-induced promoters are 
often inhibited by glucose and other carbon sources, and there are still 
only a few strong constitute promoters such as P
GAP 
and P
TEF1
, which are 
often used for gene expression during methanol metabolism. To identify 
more powerful promoters, we expanded the screening to several central 
metabolism pathway genes that are crucial for maintaining cellular ac -
tivities. We screened 28 gene promoters from central carbon metabolism 
that have not yet reported promoter strength, mainly including genes 
from glycolysis (Embden-Meyerhof pathway, EMP), tricarboxylic acid 
cycle (TCA) and pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) ( Fig. 1 a, Table S2 ).
The key promoter regulatory elements are typically located > 500 bp 
upstream of the start codon (ATG), with optimal promoter lengths 
ranging from 1000 – 1500 bp [ 40 , 41 ]. Consequently, the 1000 bp up -
stream regions of these genes were adopted as candidate promoters. We 
then used green enhanced fluorescent protein (eGFP) to evaluate pro -
moter strength [ 42 ]. A series of different eGFP expression cassettes were 
integrated into the neutral site PNSII-5 using the CRISPR-Cas9 gene 
editing system, and their expression levels were evaluated in the me -
dium of glucose or methanol. The results showed that the promoter 
strength of most central metabolic pathway genes remained moderate 
and uniform during glucose culture. It was speculated that central 
metabolic pathways must rapidly respond to energy and nutrient 
changes. The promoters with basal-level expression can be rapidly 
modulated by transcription factors or cofactors to maintain metabolic 
network balance. The relative strong promoters were come from some 
genes that involve special regulatory processes. For example, the 
expression levels of enolase ( ENO1 ), phosphoglycerate kinase ( PGK1 ) 
and 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase ( GND2 ) reached to 83 %, 54 % 
and 35 % of the P
TEF1 
promoter at 24 h, respectively ( Fig. 1 b), and the 
growth of these strains were not affected ( Fig. S1a – d ).
In methanol medium, the expression level of most promoters were 
relatively uniform and the expression intensity were basically the same 
as that in glucose, which proved that these promoters belonged to 
constitutive promoters ( Fig. 1 c and Fig. S1e – h ). Besides, the promoter 
P
PYC2 
(pyruvate carboxylase gene) showed the highest expression level, 
reaching to 75 % of P
TEF1 
at 72 h, and the expression intensity of P
GND2 
reaching to 57 % of P
TEF1 
at 72 h, which significantly higher than that of 
other promoters. The intensity of P
PYC2 
and P
GND2 
promoters were 
moderate expressed in glucose while high expressed in methanol, this 
can effectively avoid the inhibition of glucose on methanol medium and 
improved the catalytic processes, and would have potential application 
in the chemical biosynthesis from methanol.
2.2. Promoter engineering enhanced expression level
The construction of cell factories usually requires high expression 
levels of exogenous genes, but the weak expression of promoter P
PYC2 
requires further modification to enhance its expression level. Basically, 
promoter, consists of a core promoter and Upstream Activating 
Sequence (UAS) region, is the binding site for transcription factors and 
RNA polymerase II, and the UAS region is the key for improving pro -
moter activity [ 23 , 43 ]. Therefore, we attempted to further enhance the 
activity of P
PYC2 
promoter by identifying the core promoter and modi -
fying the UAS sequence. The core promoter region of P
PYC2 
promoter 
was identified using an online Neural Network Promoter Prediction tool

917 
(BDGP, fruitfly.org ) with a length of about 50 bp (   898 ~   849/   920 
~   871). Subsequently, according to the transcription factor binding 
sites predicted by the online tool (Alibaba2, gene-regulation.com ), the 
UAS sequence of the P
PYC2 
promoter was reasonably divided into four 
fragments [ 29 ] ( Fig. 2 a). We designed four P
PYC2 
promoter variants, 
P
S1
– P
S4
, containing different length of UAS sequences, and character -
ized the performance of these modified promoters by fluorescence in -
tensity of eGFP expression. The results showed that the eGFP 
fluorescence expressed by P
S1 
was almost unable to detect, indicating 
that it only contained the core promoter region and lack of effective 
upstream activation sequences ( Fig. 2 b and Fig. S2a ). In addition, the 
cell growth were almost unaffected ( Fig. S2b – c ). The strength of pro -
moter P
S2 
was significantly increased by 197 % compared to the un -
modified P
PYC2 
and reached almost the same level as P
GAP 
(90 %) and 64 
% higher than P
TEF1
. However, the expression levels of P
S3 
and P
S4 
showed that, further prolong the UAS sequence leading to a decrease in 
eGFP expression, suggesting that the upstream sequence of P
S2 
may 
contain some negative regulatory elements. Based on the above results, 
we preliminarily define the sequence extending from P
S1 
to P
S2 
as 
UAS
PYC2
.
A transcription amplifier can be formed by increasing the copy 
numbers of UAS, and the activity of the modified promoter can be 
increased exponentially [ 43 ]. Here, we attempted to further enhance P
S2 
expression by adding UAS
PYC2 
or UAS
AOX1 
(UAS sequences from P
AOX1
, 
-638~-510 are cis -acting elements) [ 41 ] at the 5 ′ end of P
S2
. The 
UAS
AOX1 
and UAS
PYC2 
(UAS
AOX1
-UAS
PYC2
) were combined in tandem to 
create hybrid promoter M1. Additionally, two UAS
PYC2 
sequences were 
repeated in tandem [ 44 ] (2UAS
PYC2
) to form hybrid promoter Y1 by 
double enzyme digestion ( Fig. 2 c). However, the activity of the hybrid 
promoters were almost identical to that of P
PYC2 
( Fig. 2 d and Fig. S2d ) 
when fluorescence intensity was characterized using eGFP. Given that 
the regulatory mechanisms of core promoters in yeast systems can 
significantly influence promoter activity [ 23 ], it was speculated that the 
lack of synergy between the UAS and core promoters from different 
promoters may hindered gene expression regulation. Consequently, the 
promoter P
S2 
obtained from this truncation was retained for metabolic 
engineering.
2.3. Promoter P
S2 
improved the biosynthesis of 3-HP from methanol
3-HP is a promising chemical that can be synthesized through MCR 
pathway and β -alanine pathway in yeast [ 45 ]. In previous study, we 
obtained a strain with high 3-HP production by using methanol as car -
bon source through the MCR pathway [ 46 ]. Therefore, we focused on 
evaluating the biosynthesis of 3-HP via the β -alanine pathway ( Fig. 3 a). 
β -alanine as a crucial intermediate during 3-HP biosynthesis, we firstly 
attempted to enhance β -alanine biosynthesis (strain PCS2) by heterol -
ogous expression of the aspartate dehydrogenase gene BaAspDH from 
Brucella anthropic (genbank: ABS17096.1 ) and BsADC from Bacillus 
subtilis (NCBI Reference Sequence: WP_161619406.1) [ 47 , 48 ]. Consid -
ering that natural β -alanine synthesis is not efficient and ADC maybe a 
rate-limiting step, we added an additional copy of BsADC gene on 
chromosome to obtain the strain PCS3. The accumulation of 3-HP were 
not detected in both wild-type strain (G4RCH) and PCS2, but it was 
surprising that the 3-HP titer of PCS3 strain reached to 120 mg/L in 120 
h ( Fig. 3 b and Table 1 ). These results indicated that all genes required 
for 3-HP biosynthesis by β -alanine pathway were naturally existed in 
P. pastoris , but metabolic flux was not sufficient to drive 3-HP

biosynthesis. We then continued to expressed the third copy of ADC 
gene, and finally increasing 3-HP production by 17 %—141 mg/L 
( Fig. 3 b). As a node compound in the metabolic network, pyruvate is 
also be a precursor for various compounds such as acetic acid, ethanol 
andlactic acid, and reducing metabolic flux toward 3-HP synthesis. 
Here, knocking out the aldehyde dehydrogenase gene ALD4, which is 
involved in acetic acid synthesis, significantly increased the production 
of 3-HP to 256 mg/L in strain PCS15. In addition, the production of the 
precursor β-alanine in these strains were also measured, and the results 
showed that with the accumulation of precursor β-alanine ( Fig. 3 b), the 
production of 3-HP also gradually increased. This indicated that 
enhancing the precursor supply is conducive to the synthesis of 
products.
β-alanine is catalyzed by a two-step enzyme reaction to produce 3- 
HP. First, the intermediate product malonate semialdehyde (MSA) is 
generated under the catalysis of β-alanine pyruvate aminotransferase. 
Then 3-hydroxypropionic dehydrogenase catalyzes the formation of 3- 
HP. To further enhance the synthesis of 3-HP, we expressed the 
β-alanine pyruvate aminotransferase gene BcBAPAT [ 37 ] from Bacillus 
cereus (GenBank: EEL86940 ) to construct PCS16 strain, and the 3-HP 
titer was sharply increased by 5.1 times to 1.3 g/L ( Fig. 3 c). The re -
sults verified that P. pastoris contains endogenous 3-hydroxy acid de -
hydrogenase. However, when the strain PCS23 was further expressing 
the 3-hydroxypropionic dehydrogenase EcYDFG [ 49 ] from Escherichia 
coli (NCBI: NP_416057.1), the production of 3-HP was significantly 
reduced ( Fig. 3 c). Due to the NADPH-dependence of 3-hydroxypropionic 
dehydrogenase, redox imbalance may occurred if using stronger pro -
moters [ 50 ], thus reducing the production of PCS23 strain by 55 %. It 
has been reported that the use of moderate strength promoters, such as 
P
PDC1 
(pyruvate decarboxylase promoter) [ 51 ] and P
POR1 
(mitochon -
drial porin promoter) to drive the expression of EcYDFG were more 
contribute to the production of 3-HP [ 50 ]. Therefore, we used P
PDC1 
and 
P
S2 
promoters to express EcYDFG gene in strain PCS16 to generate 
strains CHP11 and CHP20, respectively. Shake flask fermentation 
showed that CHP11 and CHP20 produced 1.5 g/L 3-HP in 20 g/L 
methanol culture, which was 12.3 % higher than that of PCS16 strain 
( Fig. 3 c). The results also demonstrated that P
S2 
promoter was helpful 
for high level chemical production by moderately regulating gene 
expression.
During the synthesis of 3-HP, the intermediate product MSA is 
generated either through β-alanine pathway or MCR pathway [ 46 ]. 
Considering 3-hydroxypropanoate dehydrogenase may have bidirec -
tionally catalytic activity, and its high expression is not conducive to the 
accumulation of 3-HP. Therefore, we reconstructed a hybrid pathway by 
separately expressing the BcBAPAT gene coupled with EcYDFG or 
MCRN, or through a fusion expression using the linking peptide GGGGS. 
EcYdfg or McrN catalyze the reduction of MSA to 3-HP in the β-alanine 
pathway and the MCR pathway, respectively. The synthesis of 3-HP is 
drived by the promoters P
AOX1 
and P
S2
. The results showed that the 3-HP 
titer of CHP9 strain (MCRN at N-terminal) could reach to 1.5 g/L, which 
was 16.2 % higher than strain CHP8 (MCRN at C-terminal). Meanwhile, 
3-HP production was 18.7 % higher in fusion expression than in separate 
expression, which further proved that fusion design could make full use 
of intracellular intermediate metabolites for 3-HP biosynthesis ( Fig. 3 d). 
Here, we also tried to replace the MCRN promoter with P
S2
, and 
achieving 3-HP titer comparable to CHP9. These results suggested that

the synthesis of 3-HP by MSA required a moderately strong promoter in 
β-alanine pathway and a strongly induced promoter in the malonyl-CoA 
pathway.
2.4. Fed-batch fermentation
We finally conducted fed-batch fermentation of strains CHP9 and 
CHP20 using methanol as sole carbon source. We found that, strains 
CHP9 and CHP20 produced 4.5 g/L and 4.6 g/L 3-HP, respectively, with 
a yield of about 0.12 g/g methanol after 112 h of fed-batch fermentation 
in 250 mL shake flask containing 50 mL minimum medium ( Fig. 4 a–b). 
In the process of microbial fermentation, suitable dissolved oxygen is 
very important for the product synthesis [ 52 ], and the low production in 
the flask maybe caused by the insufficient dissolved oxygen, the regu -
lation of pH and other reasons. We speculated that the strain had a more 
stringent demand for fermentation conditions when using methanol as 
carbon source, and it is challenging to provide sufficient dissolved ox -
ygen and adjust the pH during the shake flask fermentation. We thus 
performed fed-batch fermentation in 1 L bioreactors. The fermentation 
process was divided into two stages, in the first stage, glycerol was used 
as carbon source for the accumulation of biomass. When the biomass 
reached to 35 g/L dry cell weight (DCW), methanol was added for the 
3-HP production stage. Finally, the engineered strains CHP9 and CHP20 
produced 23 g/L and 22 g/L 3-HP with the yields of 0.12 g/g methanol 
and 0.14 g/g methanol, respectively ( Fig. 4 c–d). In addition, strains 
CHP9 and CHP20 contained 2.6 g/L and 2.9 g/L intracellular 3-HP, 
corresponding to 12 % and 13 % of the total production, respectively 
( Fig. S3a–b ). The results is comparable to the reported highest produc -
tion of 3-HP produced by β-alanine pathway using methanol as carbon 
source [ 50 , 53 ]. It was confirmed that P
S2 
promoter and hybrid pathways 
can effectively promote the biosynthesis of 3-HP.
As an organic acid, the accumulation of 3-HP within cells may bring 
metabolic stress. Future efforts could focus on screening suitable car -
boxylic acid transport proteins [ 54 , 55 ] to enhance the export of 3-HP 
from inside to outside the cell, potentially increasing the capacity of 
cell factories to produce 3-HP. Additionally, studies have reported that 
overexpression of the transcription factors Mxr1 and Mit1 can 
strengthen methanol metabolism and quadruple L -lactic acid production 
[ 56 ]. This strategy may also be applicable to enhance the biosynthesis of 
3-HP.

3. Conclusion
In summary, we identified and modified a promoter, P
S2
, which ex -
hibits moderate expression strength in methanol medium, and the strong 
intensity up to 90 % of P
GAP
. Furthermore, we constructed a hybrid 
biosynthetic pathway for 3-HP by integrating the β -alanine pathway and 
the MCR pathway using the promoters P
AOX1 
and P
S2
. The maximum 
production of 3-HP reached to 23 g/L. Therefore, P. pastoris serves as a 
favorable cell factory platform for the methanol bioconversion of 
chemicals.

The strains, plasmids and primers used in the article were listed in 
Table S3 , Table S4 and Table S5 , respectively. P. pastoris strain was 
cultured in YPD medium containing 20 g/L peptone, 10 g/L yeast 
extract, 20 g/L glucose. G418 antibiotic (200 mg/mL) was added to 
screen the transformants. YPM medium containing 20 g/L peptone, 10

were screened with 20 g/L glucose and 10 g/L methanol with 100 mg/L 
histidine if necessary, respectively. For all Delft medium, the initial pH 
was adjusted to 5.6 by KOH. Solidified plates containing 2 % agar were 
used for colony selection. All yeast strains were cultivated at 30

4.2. Screening candidate promoters
EMP, TAC and PPP pathway related genes of P. pastoris were 
collected from KEGG and NCBI database, and 1000 bp upstream of the 
start codon ATG were captured as potential promoters [ 58 , 59 ]. Samples 
were taken at the logarithmic stages (16 h, 20 h, 24 h) and the stationary 
stages (48 h, 72 h).
4.3. Genetic manipulation
Most of genes manipulation were accomplished by the use of our 
previously reported CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing system in P. pastoris [ 6 ]. 
Gene expression cassettes, containing 1000 bp upstream and down -
stream sequences separately, were fused by overlapping extended PCR 
[ 60 ]. Then exchanged with neutral sites on the genome by homologous 
recombination with 80 μ L competent cell, 500 ng donor and 300 ng 
gRNA plasmid through electrotransformation [ 6 , 61 ]. All endogenous 
gene fragments were amplified from PC111 genome DNA and the chassis 
strains were the strain PC111 [ 6 ] and G4RCH. All exogenetics gene se -
quences were listed in Table S6 .
4.4. Construction of hybrid promoters
The UAS region of promoter was determined by using the predicted 
core promoter region (BDGP: Neural Network Promoter Prediction ( fru 
itfly.org )), and then reasonably divided into four fragments according to 
the predicted transcription factor binding sites (Alibaba2 ( gene-regul 
ation.com )) by a stepwise truncation strategy [ 29 ].
Hybrid promoter Y1-eGFP expression cassettes was constructed by 
double digestion homologous recombination using clonExpress MultiS 
One Step Cloning Kit (Vazyme, China), and the expression cassette was 
amplified from the plasmid pUC19-Y1. The restriction enzyme sites 
Bam HI/ Hin dIII were used to digest the plasmid and insert fragments. 
Other eGFP expression cassettes were constructed by homologous 
recombination overlapping extension PCR based on CRISPR/Cas9 sys -
tem, and all promoters were integrated into the PNSII-5 site of P. pastoris 
to characterize the promoter strength.
4.5. Fluorescence signal assay
Positive colonies were firstly streaked on YPD plates and grown for 3 
days, then precultured into 3 mL YPD medium and transferred into 
Delft-histidine medium contained 20 g/L glucose (OD
600 
= 0.1) or 10 g/ 
L methanol (OD
600 
= 0.2) as carbon source, separately. Samples were

harvested at certain time interval, and the supernatant were removed by 
centrifugating at 6000 rpm for 5 min. Then the OD
600 
was diluted to 1 
with water to normalized the OD
600 
value, and then 200 μ L cell sus -
pension was added to a 96-well plate, and fluorescence Rfu/OD
600 
was 
detected by Tecan SPARK enzyme marker (Tecan, Switzerland). The 
excitation and emission wavelengths were 485 and 525 nm [ 6 ].
4.6. Evaluation of 3-HP production in engineered strain
Fermentation for production of β -alanine and 3-HP in 100 mL shake 
flask with 20 g/L methanol in Delft medium, and the strains were 
cultured at 30 
◦
C, 220 rpm. 1 mL samples were taken to measure the 
concentration of β -alanine or 3-HP at 96 h or 120 h. The fed batch 
fermentation for 3-HP production was performed in 250 mL shake flask 
containing 50 mL Delft medium, the primary seed was cultured in YPD 
medium and the secondary seed was fed in YPM medium to induce the 
enzyme expression of the methanol pathway in advance, and the initial 
OD
600 
was adjusted to 5 for fermentation. Besides, 1 mL 10 × Delft was 
feeded and pH was set to 5, and methanol was supplemented into culture 
to maintain the concentration at 5 g.
The fed batch fermentation was performed in 1 L bioreactor with 
500 mL working volume (T & J-Minibox6 1.5L*8 Intelli-Ferm). The 
cultivation was divided into two stages, with first stage, the initial batch 
stage was inoculated at an initial OD
600 
of 1 in batch medium, and 
entered into next stage after DCW was reached to about 35 g/L. Second 
stage, the feeding salts medium fed rate was maintained at 0.3 – 0.5 mL/ 
h. The concentration of methanol maintained at 5 g/L in culture. All 
parameters containing the pH, temperature, dissolved oxygen (DO) 
level, aeration were real-time monitoring using parallel bioreactors. The 
lower limit pH was kept at 5 by 15 % ammonia, temperature was 
controlled at 28 
◦
C, and the aeration set to 0.5 and increased to 1 with 
agitation at 400 rpm – 800 rpm gradually increasing depending on the 
DO level throughout the fermentation process [ 46 , 50 ]. Samples were 
taken every 5 h or 12 h to measured OD
600
, methanol and production in 
time.
1 mL Samples were centrifuged at 1300 rpm for 5 min, and the su -
pernatant was filtered with 0.2 μ m water membrane to determine the 
extracellular concentration of β -alanine and 3-HP. And the cell pellet 
was resuspended in 300 μ L of ddH
2
O with moderate 0.5 mm beads and, 
followed by thorough grinding to disrupt the cells. An additional 700 μ L 
of ddH
2
O was added and mixed. The mixture was then centrifuged, and 
the supernatant was collected for the determination of intracellular 3- 
HP concentration. The pre-column derivation method was used for 
determination of β -alanine. The β -alanine were derived using derivation 
agent o -phthalaldehyde (OPA) via the online derivative method [ 62 ], 
and the concentration was measured by high-performance liquid chro -
matography (HPLC) carrying Agilent ZRABOX SB-C18 column (4.6 mm 
× 250 mm, 5 μ m) with UV detector at 338 nm. The mobile phase con -
tains 700 mL 35 mM CH
3
COONa (pH = 7) and 300 mL 30 % methanol at 
a flow rate of 1 mL/min at 40 
◦
C for 20 min [ 47 , 63 ]. The concentration 
of 3-HP was determined using an Aminex HPX87G column from Bio-Rad 
with 210 nm by Agilent 1260 infinity II HPLC (Agilent, America), the 
mobile phase was 5 mM H
2
SO
4 
at a flow rate of 0.5 mL/min, and tem -
perature of 50 
◦
C for a duration of 30 min, the UV detector was used for 
3-HP measuring, and RID for methanol measuring.
