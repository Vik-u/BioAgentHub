Engineering the synthetic β‑alanine 
pathway in Komagataella phaffii for conversion 
of methanol into 3‑hydroxypropionic acid

Abstract 
Background Methanol is increasingly gaining attraction as renewable carbon source to produce specialty and com‑
modity chemicals, as it can be generated from renewable sources such as carbon dioxide  (CO2). In this context, native 
methylotrophs such as the yeast Komagataella phaffii (syn Pichia pastoris) are potentially attractive cell factories to pro‑
duce a wide range of products from this highly reduced substrate. However, studies addressing the potential of this 
yeast to produce bulk chemicals from methanol are still scarce. 3‑Hydroxypropionic acid (3‑HP) is a platform chemical 
which can be converted into acrylic acid and other commodity chemicals and biopolymers. 3‑HP can be naturally 
produced by several bacteria through different metabolic pathways.
Results In this study, production of 3‑HP via the synthetic β‑alanine pathway has been established in K. phaffii 
for the first time by expressing three heterologous genes, namely panD from Tribolium castaneum, yhxA from Bacil-
lus cereus, and ydfG from Escherichia coli K‑12. The expression of these key enzymes allowed a production of 1.0 g 
 l−1 of 3‑HP in small‑scale cultivations using methanol as substrate. The addition of a second copy of the panD gene 
and selection of a weak promoter to drive expression of the ydfG gene in the PpCβ21 strain resulted in an additional 
increase in the final 3‑HP titer (1.2 g  l−1). The 3‑HP‑producing strains were further tested in fed‑batch cultures. The 
best strain (PpCβ21) achieved a final 3‑HP concentration of 21.4 g  l−1 after 39 h of methanol feeding, a product yield 
of 0.15 g  g−1, and a volumetric productivity of 0.48 g  l−1  h−1. Further engineering of this strain aiming at increasing 
NADPH availability led to a 16% increase in the methanol consumption rate and 10% higher specific productivity 
compared to the reference strain PpCβ21.
Conclusions Our results show the potential of K. phaffii as platform cell factory to produce organic acids such 
as 3‑HP from renewable one‑carbon feedstocks, achieving the highest volumetric productivities reported so far 
for a 3‑HP production process through the β‑alanine pathway.

Background
Fossil fuels not only constitute the most important energy 
sources in our everyday life, but they are also critical to 
produce plastics, synthetic materials, and other chemi -
cal products. However, the accelerated depletion of fos -
sil resources and its undeniable relationship with global 
warming are forcing us to identify alternative feedstocks.

Moreover, the use of plant-derived sugars as carbon 
sources comes into conflict with food commodities.
Methanol is increasingly gaining competitiveness as 
a microbial non-food feedstock for the chemical indus -
try and biomanufacturing. This one-carbon compound 
is broadly available, presently obtained from syn-gas. It 
can also be prepared through a catalytic conversion that 
oxidizes a natural gas (methane). Another renewable 
alternative to produce methanol includes the reduction 
of atmospheric  CO2 with hydrogen, promoting a sustain-
able circular carbon economy [1]. In addition, this carbon 
source has a greater degree of reduction per C-mol com -
pared to most sugars, leading to potential higher product 
yields, and thus is considered a promising building block 
for synthesizing biofuels, commodity chemicals and 
biopolymers [2].
Komagataella phaffii (also known as Pichia pastoris) 
is a methylotrophic yeast strain capable of assimilating 
methanol as a sole source of carbon and energy. This is 
possible due to the presence of strongly induced genes 
encoding for enzymes involved in methanol metabolism, 
which are mostly located in the peroxisomes. After its 
discovery in the late 1960s, K. phaffii was first used for 
biomass and single-cell protein production from metha -
nol [3, 4]. Later, K. phaffii was developed as a system to 
produce heterologous proteins for both academic and 
industrial purposes. The availability of the strong and 
tightly regulated methanol inducible AOX1 promoter 
paved the ground for the exploitation of this non-con -
ventional yeast for heterologous protein production. 
Synthetic biology toolboxes such as GoldenPi CS [5] and 
CRISPi kit [6], together with the growing knowledge 
base of its metabolism, have led K. phaffii to stand out 
as a specialized chassis not only to produce recombinant 
proteins, but also to metabolically engineer this yeast 
to produce added value metabolites [7]. In this context, 
the deployment of technologies for renewable methanol 
generation makes it an attractive feedstock for chemi -
cals production using methylotrophic microorganisms. 
Methanol possesses more available electrons per car -
bon atom (reduction degree) than most sugars, which 
implies that more reducing power is being generated, 
usually resulting in enhanced product yields of desired 
metabolites [2]. Over the past 10 years, several chemi -
cals have been synthesized in K. phaffii using methanol as 
C-source, including carboxylic acids such as malic acid, 
d-lactic acid and 3-hydroxypropionic acid (3-HP) [8–10], 
polyketides [11–13], and fatty acids derivatives [14]. 
Recently, the production of amino acids (β-alanine) from 
this renewable feedstock has also been reported in K. 
phaffii for the first time [15]. This β-amino acid is a pre -
cursor for the biosynthesis of several nitrogen-containing 
chemicals, such as pantothenic acid (vitamin  B5).
3-HP was identified as one of the top value-added 
chemicals from biomass by the US Department of Energy 
(DOE) in 2004, since it was considered a key building 
block for both commodity and specialty chemicals pro -
duction. 3-HP can be converted into 1,3-propanediol 
(PDO), acrylamide, acrylic acid, and methyl acrylate [16]. 
There is a growing demand for acrylic acid-based poly -
mers used in the personal care industry, coatings, adhe -
sives, and others. The global market size of this 3-HP 
derivative is expected to reach $19.2 billion by 2030 [17]. 
The bioconversion of renewable methanol into this three-
carbon acid building block will allow us to reduce the 
unsustainable use of fossil resources, meaning less envi -
ronmental pollution [18]. Furthermore, since K. phaffii is 
considered an acid-tolerant host, the fermentation pro -
cess could be performed at a pH below the pKa value of 
3-HP , obtaining the undissociated form of the acid, there-
fore reducing the costs of the downstream process [19].
Several microorganisms, both prokaryotes and eukary -
otes, are 3-HP natural producers, although none of them 
produces a significant amount of this organic acid [20]. 
Three predominant heterotrophic routes named accord -
ing to its precursor have been reconstructed into the 
industrial workhorses Saccharomyces cerevisiae and 
Escherichia coli for 3-HP synthesis. The highest 3-HP 
titer and overall process productivity were obtained with 
the coenzyme  B12-dependent glycerol pathway imple -
mented in E. coli [21]. Nevertheless, E. coli is not able to 
produce vitamin  B12 on its own. Therefore, this expensive 
cofactor must be added to the culture medium, making 
the process economically unfeasible at an industrial scale 
[22].
Alternatively, the gene encoding for a bifunctional 
malonyl-CoA reductase from Chloroflexus aurantiacus 
 (MCRCa) has been expressed to implement the malonyl-
CoA pathway in several model organisms, such as E. coli 
[23–26], S. cerevisiae [27–29] and Schizosaccharomy -
ces pombe [30, 31], allowing for the production of 3-HP . 
Recently, we have successfully introduced the malonyl-
CoA pathway in K. phaffii to produce 3-HP from glycerol 
[32]. After further metabolic engineering, the best strain 
produced up to 37.1 g  l−1 of 3-HP at 0.71 g  l−1  h−1 with 
a final product yield of 0.19 g  g−1 in fed-batch cultures, 
resulting in the highest volumetric productivity reported 
so far in yeast [33]. Notably, a free fatty acids (FFA) over -
producing S. cerevisiae strain engineered with the mal -
onyl-CoA pathway has been recently optimized for an 
enhanced supply of metabolic precursors (malonyl-CoA 
and acetyl-CoA) and cofactor (NADPH), enabling the 
highest 3-HP production (56.5 g  l−1) and product yield on 
glucose (0.31 g  g−1) in fed-batch cultivations reported so 
far in yeast [34]. Similarly, the malonyl-CoA pathway has 
also been implemented in a FFA-overproducing K. phaffii

strain to efficiently produce 3-HP from sole methanol, 
achieving a final titer of 48.2  g  l−1, which is the highest 
reported 3-HP production from one-carbon feedstocks, 
and a product yield of 0.23 g  g−1 [10].
In addition, 3-HP has been produced through the syn -
thetic β-alanine pathway in E. coli [35, 36] and S. cer -
evisiae [28, 37]. This metabolic pathway consists of two 
steps, the first one converting β-alanine into malonyl 
semialdehyde (MSA) by either a β-alanine-pyruvate ami -
notransferase (BAPAT) or a γ-aminobutyrate transami -
nase (GABT), and the second one consisting in a 
reduction of MSA to 3-HP consuming either NADH or 
NADPH [38–40]. Several genes were tested for each one 
of these two steps to implement the pathway in S. cerevi -
siae, finally determining the expression of a BAPAT from 
Bacillus cereus  (BAPATBc), along with a 3-hydroxypropi -
onate dehydrogenase from E. coli K-12  (YDFGEc), as the 
best option. Moreover, the endogenous biosynthesis of 
β-alanine is only active via spermine and has a very low 
flux. For this reason, an aspartate-1-decarboxylase from 
Tribolium castaneum  (PANDTc), catalyzing the conver -
sion of L-aspartate into β-alanine, was expressed in S. 
cerevisiae. After further metabolic engineering of this 
strain, a final titer of 13.7 g  l−1 of 3-HP with a 0.14 g  g−1 
product yield was obtained in a glucose-limited con -
trolled fed-batch cultivation [37]. Recently, 3-HP pro -
duction through the β-alanine pathway has been further 
optimized by applying phosphate-limiting conditions to 
a glucose-based fed-batch system, achieving a final 3-HP 
concentration of approximately 27  g  l−1 with a product 
yield of 0.26 g  g−1 [41].
In the present study, the enzymes used by Boro -
dina et  al. in S. cerevisiae [37] were expressed for the 
first time in K. phaffii to enable 3-HP production from 
methanol via the β-alanine pathway in our base strains. 
These base strains were further modified through cofac -
tor engineering by overexpressing a Pseudomonas sp. 
101  NADP+-dependent formate dehydrogenase variant. 
Fed-batch cultivations using methanol as the only car -
bon source in the feed were performed to evaluate the 
potential of this cell factory to generate an economically 
important product from this C1 feedstock.
Results and discussion
In silico comparison of the malonyl‑CoA and the β‑alanine 
pathways in K. phaffii
The K. phaffii’s iMT1026 v3.0 genome-scale metabolic 
model [42] was used to evaluate the maximum 3-HP 
theoretical yield (Υ 3-HP max) that could be achieved using 
methanol as sole carbon source through the malonyl-
CoA and the β-alanine pathways. Assuming that all the 
carbon source was used for product synthesis, that is, not 
used for biomass growth (µ = 0  h−1), the maximum Υ3−HP 
through the malonyl-CoA pathway was calculated to be 
0.718  g3-HP  gMetOH
−1 (Fig. 1a), whereas a higher value was 
obtained when using the β-alanine route (0.795) (Fig. 1b), 
mainly owing to a lower ATP requirement to produce 
one molecule of 3-HP from 3 molecules of methanol 
through the β-alanine pathway (see Additional file  1), 
resulting in slightly lower oxygen requirements compared 
to the malonyl-CoA pathway (Fig. 1a, b). The higher ATP 
requirement for 3-HP production through the malonyl-
CoA pathway is mainly due to acetyl-CoA synthesis, 
which not only has an impact on the Υ 3-HP max value, but 
also results in higher oxygen dependence, as previously 
pointed out by Borodina et al. [37]. Overall, the β-alanine

yield for each predicted 3‑HP production value. The color scale

route stands out as a more attractive metabolic pathway 
towards 3-HP production at industrial scale.
The expression of panD, yhxA and ydfG genes in K. phaffii 
generates a 3‑HP‑producing strain
To reconstruct the synthetic β-alanine pathway for 3-HP 
production, the three codon-optimized panD , yhxA and 
ydfG genes encoding for a PAND from T. castaneum, a 
BAPAT from B. cereus and a YDFG from E. coli, respec -
tively, were introduced into K. phaffii CBS7435, the 
parental strain. The strong and methanol inducible alco -
hol oxidase 1 (AOX1) and formate dehydrogenase (FDH1) 
promoters, were selected to conduct the expression of 
panD and yhxA  genes, respectively. According to previ -
ous studies [37], the utilization of strong promoters such 
as the translation elongation factor EF-1 alpha promoter 
 (PTEF1-α) for the expression of both panD and yhxA genes 
proved to be beneficial for 3-HP production with an 
engineered S. cerevisiae strain growing on glucose, since 
the reaction catalyzed by the  PANDTc was determined to 
be the main flux control step of the β-alanine pathway. In 
these two first steps, an l-aspartate is transformed into 
β-alanine by the  PANDTc, which is in turn converted into 
MSA by the  BAPATBc enzyme. 3-HP is finally obtained 
through the reduction of MSA by the action of the 
 YDFGEc (Fig.  2). Due to the NADPH-dependence of the 
latter enzyme, we expected the potential generation of a 
redox imbalance by the last step of the pathway. For this 
reason, instead of using a strong and methanol induc -
ible promoter to control the expression of the ydfG gene, 
two different constitutive promoters showing a lower 
expression strength in comparison with the strong GAP 
promoter under methanol feed conditions (µ max up to 
0.1  h−1) were tested, namely the moderate strength mito-
chondrial porin (POR1) promoter, obtaining the PpCβ10 
strain, and the weak pyruvate decarboxylase (PDC1 ) pro-
moter, obtaining the PpCβ20 strain [5].
The PpCβ10 and PpCβ20 strains were grown up to an 
optical density at 600 nm  (OD600) of 2.4 (see Additional 
file 2) on 24 deep-well plates with minimal medium con -
taining 11.9 g  l−1 (i.e., 1.5% v/v) of methanol, along with 
the reference strain (CBS7435). After 48 h of incubation, 
methanol was completely depleted. Since K. phaffii does 
not assimilate 3-HP as C-source [32], an endpoint sample 
was collected at the end of the culture to quantify the final 
3-HP titers. The heterologous expression of panD , yhxA 
and ydfG genes resulted in 0.93 ± 0.03 g  l−1 of 3-HP after 
48  h of cultivation when the  PPOR1 was used to control 
the expression of the ydfG gene (PpCβ10 strain), whereas 
a slightly but significantly higher titer (p-value < 0.05),

1.04 ± 0.01 g  l−1 3-HP , was obtained with the weak  PPDC1 
driving expression of this gene (PpCβ20 strain). Notably, 
the 3-HP titers obtained herein were slightly higher than 
those achieved with a base S. cerevisiae strain expressing 
the same key enzymes under the control of strong con -
stitutive promoters (TEF1 and PGK1) and growing on a 
20 g  l−1 glucose medium (0.83 g  l−1 3-HP) [37]. Moreover, 
the expression of these three heterologous genes in K. 
phaffii resulted in similar 3-HP titers to those previously 
reported for a glucose-utilizing S. cerevisiae strain car -
rying overexpression cassettes for 5 genes, namely pyru -
vate carboxylase (PYC1  and PYC2 ),  BAPATBc,  PANDTc 
and  YDFGEc. Only when xylose was used as substrate, a 
higher production of 3-HP was achieved (1.84 g  l−1) with 
the latter strain [28]. These initial screening experiments 
pointed at K. phaffii as a promising chassis cell for the 
bioproduction of 3-HP from methanol.
Improving 3‑HP production by optimizing the flux 
through the β‑alanine synthetic pathway
Once the functionality of the biosynthetic pathway 
was confirmed by the presence of 3-HP , we decided to 
improve the flux towards the production of this carbox -
ylic acid by overexpressing the key biosynthetic enzymes. 
Previous studies with a S. cerevisiae strain expressing 
the β-alanine pathway, demonstrated that the effect of 
multiple integrations of  PANDTc was larger than that of 
multiple copies of  BAPATBc/YDFGEc, thus suggesting 
that the major control point of the flux through the bio -
synthetic pathway were the panD  gene transcriptional 
levels [37]. Accordingly, we hypothesized the overexpres-
sion of this gene as the most straightforward strategy for 
3-HP improvement.
The integration of a second copy of the  PANDTc expres-
sion cassette into both PpCβ10 and PpCβ20 strains 
resulted in the PpCβ11 and PpCβ21 strains, respectively, 
which were cultivated on buffered minimal methanol 
medium (BMM) along with their parentals. After 48 h of 
cultivation, all strains reached a similar  OD600 between 
2.3 and 2.5 (see Additional file  2). The 3-HP production 
slightly increased by 3% (p-value = 0.04) in PpCβ11 strain 
(0.92 ± 0.01  g  l−1 3-HP), in comparison with its parental 
PpCβ10 strain (0.89 ± 0.02 g  l−1), while the strain PpCβ21 
reached the highest 3-HP concentration (1.18 ± 0.03  g 
 l−1), i.e., a 12% increase respect to PpCβ20 (1.05 ± 0.01 g 
 l−1). Notably, the 3-HP yield on methanol was increased 
by 11% with the additional copy of the panD gene 
(strain PpCβ21) while this effect was much lower in the 
PpCβ11 strain (3%) (Fig.  3). These results indicate that 
lower expression levels of the ydfG gene (i.e., under the 
control of  PPDC1) seem to be beneficial in terms of 3-HP 
production. This suggested the presence of a bottle -
neck at the final step of the pathway, since the  YDFGEc 
requires NADPH to catalyze the reduction of the malonic

semialdehyde to 3-HP , which is not being supplied. We 
hypothesized that this perturbation of the NADPH 
homeostasis could be further exacerbated when the 
β-alanine flux into the pathway is increased (i.e., with the 
insertion of an additional copy of the panD  gene under 
the very strong AOX1  promoter), resulting in a poten -
tial limitation of NADPH equivalents for anabolism/cell 
growth.
Engineering the redox balance by overexpressing 
the PseFDH(V9) enzyme variant from Pseudomonas sp. 
101, a  NADP+‑dependent formate dehydrogenase
To increase NADPH supply, the gene coding for a 
mutated formate dehydrogenase from Pseudomonas 
sp. 101, namely PseFDH(V9), was expressed in both 
PpCβ20 and PpCβ21 strains, obtaining the PpCβ20-P 
and PpCβ21-P strains, respectively. The enzyme vari -
ant PseFDH(V9) shows the highest catalytic efficiency 
 (kcat/KM) for  NADP+ that has ever been reported for 
any FDH towards this cofactor, mainly attributed to a 
very low  KM
NADP = 0.026 mM. This causes PseFDH(V9) 
to reduce  NADP+ with barely any competition from 
 NAD+, even though the high concentration of this com -
peting substrate in the cytosol [43]. The gene encod -
ing for the PseFDH(V9) enzyme was expressed under 
the control of the strong and methanol inducible FDH1 
promoter. The PpCβ20-P and PpCβ21-P strains were cul-
tivated along with their corresponding parental strains 
on 24-deep well plates containing BMM. A comparable 
endpoint  OD600 between 2.4 and 2.6 was reached after 
48  h of cultivation by the strains PpCβ20, PpCβ21 and 
PpCβ20-P . Conversely, cell growth was slightly lower 
for the PpCβ21-P strain  (DO600 = 2.2) (see Additional 
file  2). The final 3-HP titer was significantly reduced by 
about 11% in strain PpCβ20-P (1.12 ± 0.01  g  l−1) com -
pared to its parental strain PpCβ20 (1.24 ± 0.03  g  l−1) 
(p-value < 0.05). The introduction of the PseFDH(V9) 
enzyme in strain PpCβ21 resulted in a minor but also 
significant decrease (p-value < 0.0003) of about 6% on the 
final product titer, from 1.29 ± 0.01  g  l−1 to 1.22 ± 0.01  g 
 l−1 (PpCβ21-P). However, there were no significant dif -
ferences (p-value = 0.38) in the 3-HP produced per  OD600 
unit between these strains. In summary, the expression 
of this  NADP+-dependent formate dehydrogenase did 
not improve neither 3-HP production nor product yields 
using methanol as sole carbon and energy source in 
small-scale experiments.
Evaluating the impact of the β‑alanine pathway on cell 
growth kinetics
To determine the maximum specific growth rate (µ max) 
of the different strains obtained in this study, series 
of growth kinetics experiments were performed by 
cultivating a representative clone from each strain in 
shake flask cultures using BMM medium. The introduc -
tion of the β-alanine route led to a reduction of the µ max 
from 0.14  h−1 (reference CBS7435 strain) to 0.11   h−1 and 
0.09   h−1 for PpCβ20 and PpCβ10 strains, respectively 
(see Additional file  2). The β-alanine pathway consumes 
1 NADPH per 3-HP , thereby reducing NADPH avail -
ability for anabolic purposes, which has been previously 
correlated to decreased biomass yields on methanol 
[44]. Coherently, lower expression levels of the NADPH-
consuming  YDFGEc enzyme (i.e., under the control of 
 PPDC1, strain PpCβ20) of the β-alanine pathway proved 
to be beneficial, both in terms of 3-HP production and 
cell growth. Moreover, this effect was more pronounced 
with the overexpression of the  PANDTc expression cas -
sette, as inferred from the µ max comparison between 
strains PpCβ21 and PpCβ11 (see Additional file 2). Intro-
ducing a second panD gene copy into the PpCβ10 strain 
substantially decreased the µ max value from 0.09   h−1 to 
0.06  h−1 (PpCβ11), whereas this effect was minimal in the 
PpCβ20 strain, leading to a slight (not statistically signifi -
cant, p-value = 0.28) reduction from 0.11   h−1 to 0.10   h−1 
(PpCβ21). According to previous studies [15], fine-tun -
ing the panD gene dosage aiming at increasing the flux 
towards the β-alanine intermediate through aspartate 
decarboxylation may cause an impaired cell growth of 
K. phaffii, since aspartate takes part in many biological 
processes. The µmax value obtained for the PpCβ11 strain 
was consistent with this phenomenon, albeit we did not 
observe this effect in the PpCβ21 strain. Further meta -
bolic flux analyses should help elucidating the cause of 
the differences between the strains PpCβ11 and PpCβ21 
growth. In any case, PpCβ11 was discarded for further 
bioreactor-scale cultivation experiments.
The introduction of the mutated formate dehydroge -
nase FDH(V9) from Pseudomonas in the PpCβ20 strain 
did not affect cell growth on methanol, i.e., both PpCβ20 
and PpCβ20-P strains showed the same µ max (0.11   h−1). 
In contrast, the PpCβ21-P strain showed a lower µ max 
(0.08  h−1) compared to its parental strain PpCβ21. Since 
both strains showed similar 3-HP production titers, fur -
ther characterization in bioreactor-scale experiments 
was required.
Production of 3‑HP in fed‑batch cultivations
Initial fed-batch cultivations of the 3-HP-producing 
strains using a growth defined mineral medium typically 
used for recombinant protein production in K. phaffii 
[45], which is only supplemented with biotin, revealed 
that such medium did not support neither growth nor 
3-HP production during the feed phase on methanol. We 
hypothesized this was probably due to the special co-fac -
tor requirements described for some of the enzymes of 
Page 7 of 16

the β-alanine pathway, specifically for the  PANDTc (Uni-
ProtKB: A7U8C7) and  BAPATBc (UniProtKB: C2VE79) 
enzymes, which use at least one pyridoxal phosphate as 
cofactor for its synthesis according to the UniProtKB 
database [ 46]. This coenzyme is derived from pyridox -
ine (vitamin  B6) and plays an important role in amino 
acid metabolism. Moreover, β-alanine is an intermedi -
ate in pantothenic acid (vitamin  B5) biosynthesis, which, 
in turn, is an integral part of the coenzyme A and acyl 
carrier protein, co-factors required for several enzymes 
[37]. The redirection of this β-amino acid flux towards 
the production of 3-HP instead of vitamin  B5, could be 
an explanation for the observed growth impairment in 
the bioreactor-scale cultivations. Indeed, the presence 
of both vitamins  B6 and  B5 in the yeast nitrogen based 
(YNB)-containing medium used in the small-scale culti -
vations is likely to be the reason why the 3-HP-producing 
strains grow normally in those conditions. Subsequently, 
bioreactor cultivations were carried out using a growth 
medium supplemented with a vitamin solution contain -
ing, among others: calcium pantothenate  (B5), pyridoxine 
hydrochloride  (B6), and niacin  (B3), which is an impor -
tant precursor for the essential redox cofactors  NAD+ 
and  NADP+. This vitamin solution is usually added to 
Delft medium, commonly employed for bioreactor culti -
vations of S. cerevisiae [47], allowing for sustained growth 
on methanol and 3-HP production.
The best performing strains PpCβ20 and PpCβ21, along 
with the strain expressing the mutated FDH(V9) enzyme 
from Pseudomonas, PpCβ21-P , were further evaluated in 
aerobic fed-batch reactors. After the initial glycerol batch 
and methanol adaptation (transition) phases, the fed-
batch phase was started, where methanol was fed follow -
ing a pre-programmed exponential feeding strategy for 
controlled growth rate at µ = 0.03  h−1. The feeding phase 
was finalized before reaching a dry cell weight (DCW) of 
50 g  l−1 of biomass, accounting for 39.3 h of the total pro-
cess duration, with a total methanol concentration added 
into the culture of almost 125 g  l−1. Neither methanol nor 
by-products were detected by HPLC analysis over the 
course of fermentation. Nonetheless, exometabolome 
profiling analyses by NMR of the supernatant samples 
from the early, mid, and late methanol-feeding phase 
revealed the presence of small amounts (mM range, 
below HPLC detection limit) of ethanol as well as some 
metabolites potentially derived from leucine (Leu) and 
isoleucine (Ile) biosynthesis and degradation pathways 
(or pyruvate fermentation) such as 2-oxoisocaproate 
and 3-methyl-2-oxopentanoate (see Additional file  3 for 
NMR spectra of the culture supernatants). Both com -
pounds are involved in transamination reactions with 
2-oxoglutarate and l-glutamate, which, in turn, are also 
present in the oxaloacetate conversion into l-aspartate 
catalyzed by an aspartate aminotransferase (AAT2), reac-
tion that takes place upstream of the β-alanine pathway 
(see Fig.  2). 3-Hydroxyisobutyrate, pyruvate and acetate 
were also detected in much lower amounts as well as 
traces of methanol. In contrast to 3-HP-producing K. 
phaffii strains engineered with the malonyl-CoA pathway 
growing in fed-batch cultures using glycerol as C-source 
[32], no arabitol was accumulated during the fermenta -
tion process.
At the end of the culture, the PpCβ21 strain pro -
duced up to 21.4 ± 0.7 g  l−1 of 3-HP , whereas 20.3 ± 0.6 g 
 l−1 were achieved by the strain PpCβ20. In both cases 
the 3-HP generated during the batch phase of the cul -
tures was slightly above 2  g  l−1 (Fig.  4). The addition of 
a second copy of the panD  gene in PpCβ21 resulted in 
a 12% improvement of the final 3-HP titer in the small-
scale screenings. This increase was reduced to 6% when 
both strains were tested in bioreactor fed-batch cultiva -
tions. The 3-HP yield on biomass  (YP/X) calculated for 
the fed-batch phase was increased by 18% in PpCβ21 
with respect to PpCβ20. Consequently, this resulted 
in a 10% improvement of the specific productivity  (qp) 
(Table 1), and thus demonstrating that an enhanced sup -
ply of β-alanine intermediate in the metabolic pathway 
had a positive effect on 3-HP production, coherent with 
previous studies [37]. The expression of the PseFDH(V9) 
enzyme in PpCβ21-P strain allowed for a final 3-HP titer 
of 19.0 ± 0.5  g  l−1, along with lower biomass concentra -
tion levels (38.8 g  l−1 DCW) (Fig.  4), in comparison with 
the above-mentioned strains. This yielded a further 14% 
and 10% increase in  YP/X and  qp, respectively, while the 
product yield on methanol  (YP/S) remained unchanged 
for both PpCβ21-P and PpCβ21 (Table  1). Furthermore, 
the specific carbon dioxide evolution rate  (qCO2) was sig-
nificantly increased by 29% (p-value = 0.02) when com -
paring the PpCβ21-P to the PpCβ21 strain, whereas there 
were no significant differences (p-value = 0.10) in the 
 qCO2 between strains PpCβ20 and PpCβ21 (Table  1 and 
Additional file  4). Consistently, the PpCβ21-P showed 
the highest  CO2 yield on methanol  (YCO2/S) among the 
three strains (Table  1). Therefore, it is plausible that the 
introduction of the ectopic NADPH-regenerating reac -
tion from formate causes a carbon flux redistribution 
through the methanol dissimilation pathway, that is, 
generating more  CO2 while providing a higher supply of 
NADPH. This hypothesis is consistent with the higher 
 YP/X and  qP values observed for the strain PpCβ21-P , as 
3-HP synthesis requires a supply of reduction equiva -
lents. In addition, the biomass yield  (YX/S) obtained for 
the PpCβ21-P strain was reduced compared to the other 
strains. Since the total amount of methanol consumed by 
all strains was the same, this was also reflected in a sig -
nificant increase (p-value = 0.036, see Additional file  4) 
Page 8 of 16Àvila‑Cabré et al. Microbial Cell Factories          (2023) 22:237 
of the specific methanol consumption rate  (qs) of the 
PpCβ21-P strain in comparison to the PpCβ21 strain 
(Table 1). Overall, it appears that overexpression of the 
heterologous PseFDH(V9) gene caused a carbon flux 
redistribution towards  CO2 and 3-HP production to the 
detriment of biomass generation.
The iMT1026 v3.0 genome-scale metabolic model 
of K. phaffii [ 42] was used to validate the experimen -
tal 3-HP yields resulting from fed-batch cultivations. 
For the simulations, the experimental values obtained 
for the main macroscopic variables (i.e.,  qS,  qO2,  qCO2, 
and µ) of each methanol-grown strain were set as con -
straints, and  q3-HP was maximized.  YP/S and  YP/X were 
calculated for each strain using the predicted  q3-HP val-
ues (Table  2). Notably, the model showed reasonably 
accurate predictions, with overall deviations around 
6–15% in most cases, even though the mean elemental 
biomass composition and the estimated non-growth 
associated maintenance energy (NGAME) parameter 
that were used as constraints to perform these simu -
lations were taken from chemostat cultivations of a

non-producing (wild-type phenotype) K. phaffii strain 
growing on methanol [42]. The use of condition-spe -
cific biomass composition equations and the recalibra -
tion of energetic parameters (i.e., NGAME and GAME) 
through experimental data derived from chemostat 
cultivations should allow for a greater accuracy in the 
prediction of physiological macroscopic parameters.
Interestingly, the highest C-yield (C-mol of 3-HP 
per C-mol of substrate) calculated for the methanol 
feeding phase of fed-batch cultivations (0.16 ± 0.01 
Cmol  Cmol−1) is comparable to that achieved by a S. 
cerevisiae strain overexpressing AAT2, PYC1, PYC2, 
 BAPATBc,  YDFGEc, and multiple copies of  PANDTc 
growing on glucose (0.15 ± 0.0 Cmol  Cmol−1, calcu -
lated from data provided in Borodina et al. [37]). The 
conversion of 3 molecules of methanol to one mol -
ecule of 3-HP through the β-alanine pathway is an 
ATP-consuming process, whereas it has no net ATP 
consumption when glucose is used as substrate (see 
Additional file  1: Table  S1). Therefore, the Υ 3−HP max  
that could be achieved by a K. phaffii strain overex -
pressing the β-alanine pathway is significantly higher 
for cells growing on glucose (> 0.9  g3-HP  gGlucose
−1) 
than for methanol-grown cells (0.795  g3-HP  gMetOH
−1), 
based on simulations performed with the K. phaffi’s 
iMT1026 v3.0 genome-scale metabolic model [42]. 
Since there are no fundamental differences between 
K. phaffii’s and S. cerevisiae’s respiratory glucose 
metabolisms, the maximum theoretical 3-HP yields 
on glucose are very similar between these yeasts [37]. 
Overall, we demonstrate the potential of K. phaffii to 
achieve 3-HP yields on methanol comparable to those 
obtained from glucose, albeit methanol assimilation 
being less energy efficient. Furthermore, the volumet -
ric productivities calculated for the fed-batch phase in 
this study are more than twofold higher than the one 
obtained for the above-mentioned S. cerevisiae strain 
(0.21 g  l−1  h−1, calculated from data given by Borodina 
et al. [37]).
Production of 3-HP from methanol has also 
been reported by an engineered Methylobacterium 
extorquens AM1 expressing the reductive malonyl-CoA 
pathway [ 48], although the yields obtained were an 
order of magnitude smaller than the ones reported in 
this study. Furthermore, the volumetric productivities 
achieved herein are remarkably higher (about 3.2-fold) 
to the productivities observed in the recently published 
K. phaffii strain producing 3-HP from sole methanol 
(0.15  g  l−1  h−1, calculated from data reported by Wu 
et  al. [10]). To our knowledge, the values obtained in 
this study are the highest volumetric productivities 
reported so far for a 3-HP production process based on 
the β-alanine pathway.
Future perspectives
Although the 3-HP production yields and productivities 
we demonstrate herein are promising, further strain and 
process engineering is clearly needed to reach economi -
cally feasible metrics for carboxylic acid production at 
industrial scale, that is, a productivity and product yield 
not lower than 2.5  g  l−1  h−1 and 0.5  g  g−1, respectively 
[16]. Moreover, downstream operations may account 
for 20 to 60% of the entire production process costs. To 
reduce the overall separation and purification expenses, 
a final product concentration in the range of 50–100 g  l−1 
would be required for process scale up [49].
Despite the great potential of K. phaffii to produce 
metabolites such as 3-HP from methanol, a substantial 
fraction of the methanol consumed by the cells (typi -
cally, up to 50% or even higher) is channeled through 
the dissimilatory pathway to  CO2, limiting the carbon 
flux entering the assimilation pathway to pyruvate [50], 
an important central metabolite as well as the criti -
cal precursor for 3-HP production. Thereby, metabolic 
engineering strategies aiming to shift the carbon flux 
split ratio between the assimilatory and dissimilatory 
pathways may push carbon flux into 3-HP production 
and reduce the carbon loss caused by the direct oxida -
tion of methanol into  CO2 in K. phaffii. In addition, 
pulling pyruvate flux into the β-alanine pathway, e.g., by 
enhancing the generation of pathway precursors such as 
oxaloacetate and aspartate, can also be effective strategy. 
Full exploitation of the improved supply of NADPH by 
overexpression of the  NADP+-dependent formate dehy -
drogenase gene described in this study probably requires 
further fine-tuning of the ydfG gene expression levels for 
enhanced 3-HP production. Besides, final product con -
centration demands for industrial scale production will 
probably require engineering K. phaffii’s tolerance for 
high 3-HP concentrations, as demonstrated for other 
yeasts.
Conclusions
In this study, we successfully engineered the synthetic 
β-alanine to 3-HP pathway in K. phaffii for the first time. 
Minimal pathway optimization led to a final 3-HP titer 
of 21.4  g  l−1, a 0.15  g  g−1 3-HP yield on methanol, and 
a volumetric productivity of 0.48 g  l−1  h−1 in controlled 
fed-batch cultures. Notably, no major by-products were 
observed in the fermentation broth. Overexpression of 
a mutated formate dehydrogenase from Pseudomonas 
sp. 101 aiming at increasing NADPH availability led to a 
higher carbon uptake rate in K. phaffii. Exometabolome 
profiling points at the pyruvate node as a potential target 
for future metabolic engineering. Although further strain 
and process optimization is required to make this system 
Page 10 of 16Àvila‑Cabré et al. Microbial Cell Factories          (2023) 22:237 
industrially attractive, we laid the basis for development 
of yeast strains for 3-HP production from renewable C1 
feedstocks.
Materials and methods
Computational methods
The genome-scale metabolic model of K. phaffii used 
for all the simulations performed in this study was the 
iMT1026 v3.0 [42]. To evaluate the Υ 3−HP max of the mal-
onyl-CoA and the β-alanine pathways, a set of experi -
mental and calculated growth parameters based on data 
obtained from chemostat methanol cultivations were 
defined as constraints. When growing on this substrate, 
the growth associated and the non-growth associated 
maintenance energy (GAME and NGAME parameters) 
were calculated to be 166.77 mmol ATP  gDCW
−1 and 0.44 
mmol ATP  gDCW
−1  h−1, respectively. The maximum spe -
cific substrate uptake rate  (qMetOH max) was determined to 
be 7.82 mmol MetOH  gDCW
−1  h−1 at µ max = 0.10   h−1 [42]. 
The reactions for 3-HP production and excretion using 
either the malonyl-CoA or β-alanine pathways were 
added to the original model. The 3-HP yields (Υ 3-HP) 
simulating different oxygen availability conditions  (qO2) 
and growth rates (µ) were calculated using the COBRA 
Toolbox v3.0 [51], and the colored phase planes were 
generated using the ‘pcolor’ function from Matlab R2021a 
(Mathworks, Inc., Natick, MA, USA).
For the experimental data validation, the main physi -
ological macroscopic parameters derived from the meth -
anol fed-batch cultivations were used as constraints, 
together with the calculated NGAME value for metha -
nol growth, and 3-HP production was maximized by 
performing a parsimonious enzyme usage Flux Balance 
Analysis (pFBA) using the COBRA Toolbox v3.0 software 
[51] in Matlab R2020b (Mathworks, Inc., Natick, MA, 
USA).
Plasmid and strain construction
The parental strain K. phaffii CBS7435 (CBS, Centraal -
bureau voor Schimmelcultures, Utrecht, NL) was used to 
generate a battery of 3-HP-producer strains by means of 
CRISPR/Cas9-mediated homology-directed integrations 
of the heterologous genes. Plasmids and strains used in 
this study are listed in Table 3 from this section. The het -
erologous genes encoding for an aspartate-1-decarboxy -
lase from T. castaneum  (PANDTc, GenBank: ABU25221), 
a β-alanine-pyruvate aminotransferase from B. cereus 
 (BAPATBc, GenBank: EEL86940), a 3-hydroxypropi -
onate dehydrogenase from E. coli  (YDFGEc, GenBank: 
12932746), and a mutated formate dehydrogenase from 
Pseudomonas sp. (strain 101) (FDH(V9) Pse(A199G/D222Q/
S381V/C256A/H380K), UniprotKB: P33160), were codon-opti -
mized and synthesized by GenScript Biotech (Piscataway, 
NJ, USA) for its expression in K. phaffii (GenBank acces -
sion numbers: OR360384, OR360385, OR360386, and 
OR360387, respectively).
The modular cloning vectors used in this work are 
described in Prielhofer et  al. [5], and are available at 
Addgene (Watertown, MA, USA) as GoldenPi CS kit. 
The CRISPR/Cas9-mediated homology-directed genome 
editing protocol performed in this study is described in 
Gassler et al. [6], and a ready-to-use plasmid kit named 
CRISPi can also be found at Addgene. Further descrip -
tion of the molecular cloning protocols followed in this 
study can be found in the Additional file 5.
Different genomic regions were selected as targets 
to efficiently design each sgRNA, focusing on inter -
genic regions such as upstream of the promoters, where 
the integration of exogenous genes usually leads to sta -
ble expression, and cell fitness remains unaffected [52]. 
Accordingly, the  BAPATBc expression cassette was 
targeted within the 100-bp upstream of TEF1-α pro -
moter (PP7435_Chr1-1535), while the  YDFGEc expres -
sion unit was located within the first 100-bp of  PFLD1 
(PP7435_Chr3-0140), hence confirming this target 
sequence as a non-critical region of the FLD1 promoter. 
The  PANDTc expression cassette was integrated into the 
RGI2 locus [5], almost 800-bp upstream of a hypotheti -
cal protein (PP7435_Chr1-0725). The second copy of the 
 PANDTc donor DNA template was targeted within 50-bp 
upstream of the GAP  promoter (PP7435_Chr2-0858) for 
homology-directed DNA repair. Finally, the PseFDH(V9) 
expression cassette was targeted within 50-bp upstream 
of the AOX1 promoter (PP7435_Chr4-0130). The poten -
tial sgRNA candidates binding target regions within the 
selected loci were assessed with CHOPCHOP , a widely 
used web tool for CRISPR-based genome editing [53]. 
CHOPCHOP v2 seeks and scores suitable 20 nucleotide 
target sites, called protospacers, followed by a 5′-NGG-
3′ motif (PAM sequence). The existence of four con -
secutive thymine bases (TTTT) within the protospacer 
sequence might cause Pol III termination. Also, GC 
content without PAM sequence should be 20–80% [54]. 
Considering that the choice of the sgRNA causes locus-
specific variations on targeting efficiency, and even some 
sgRNAs might not be functional, two high-scored sgRNA 
targets for each genome locus were selected for the 
experiments (Table  4), eventually using one to perform 
each CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene insertion into the K. 
phaffii genome.
Electrocompetent K. phaffii cells were prepared as 
described elsewhere [55]. Donor DNA plasmids car -
rying each expression cassette flanked by the corre -
sponding homology arms were linearized using the 
FastDigest BpiI (IIs class) (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 
Waltham, MA, USA). Transformation was performed

according to the CRISPR/Cas9-mediated homology-
directed genome editing protocol for K. phaffii [ 6]. 
Correct genomic insertions were verified by Sanger 
sequencing using a set of primers covering the 5′  and 
the 3′ homology arms (see Additional file  5: Table S2). 
The sequenced clones were confirmed to be genetically

identical. Recombinant yeast strains were grown at 
30  °C in YPD agar plates (1% yeast extract, 2% pep -
tone, 2% dextrose and 15 g  l−1 agar). The medium was 
supplemented with the appropriate antibiotic when 
required: Nourseothricin (200  µg  ml−1 working con -
centration for K. phaffii) from Dismed S.A. (Asturias, 
Spain), and Geneticin (500  µg  ml−1) or Hygromycin 
(200 µg  ml−1) from InvivoGen (San Diego, CA, USA).
Screening in deep‑well plates
Komagataella phaffii strains were grown overnight in 
24 deep-well plates containing YPG medium (1% yeast 
extract, 2% peptone and 1% v/v glycerol). Cultures 
were placed on a platform with a slope of 20° in an 
incubator shaker Multitron Standard (Infors HT, Bott -
mingen, Switzerland) with a 2.5  cm orbit, and grown 
at 30  °C and 220  rpm. Afterwards, a 24 deep-well 
plate containing 2 ml of buffered minimal methanol 
medium (BMM; 100 mM potassium phosphate buffer 
pH 6, 1.34% yeast nitrogen base (YNB), 0.4 mg  l−1 bio-
tin and 0.5% v/v pure methanol) was inoculated with 
the overnight cultures, at a starting  OD600 of 0.1. The 
cultures were grown for 48 h at 25 °C. Moreover, the 
relative humidity (rh) in the incubation chamber was 
fixed to 80%. Agitation was set to 220 rpm. After 24 h, 
1% v/v pure methanol pulse was added to the cultures. 
Three independent transformants from each strain 
were tested to discard any biological variability. The 
parental strain K. phaffii CBS7435 was used as a nega -
tive control. All clones were inoculated in triplicate. At 
the end of the culture, the final biomass concentration 
of each deep-well was determined in duplicate with a 
96-well microtiter plate using a Multiskan FC Micro -
plate Photometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, 
MA, USA) to ensure all the cultures were grown up to 
a similar endpoint  OD600.
Shake‑flask cultures for small‑scale growth kinetics 
experiments
Komagataella phaffii strains were inoculated from cryo-
vials into 5 ml of YPG medium in 50 ml Falcon tubes. 
Cultures were grown overnight at 30  °C and 180  rpm. 
The overnight cultures were then diluted to an  OD600 
of 0.2 in 250 ml shake flasks containing 25 ml of BMM 
and grown in an incubator shaker Multitron Standard for 
12  h at 25  °C, 180  rpm and a relative humidity of 80%, 
to adapt cells to methanol metabolism and setting the 
screening conditions. Afterwards, these cultures were 
used to inoculate 250 ml shake flasks containing 25 ml 
of fresh BMM at a starting  OD600 of 0.2 and grown dur -
ing 24 h at the same cultivation conditions. Samples were 
taken every 3 h to measure the  OD600 in duplicate with 
a 96-well microtiter plate using the SPECTROstar Nano 
absorbance microplate reader (BMG Labtech, Ortenberg, 
Germany).
Bioreactor cultivations
Fed-batch cultures were performed in duplicate using a 
DASGIP Parallel Bioreactor System (Eppendorf, Ger -
many). The starting volume of each 1.3  l reactor vessel 
was 500 ml. The batch medium consisted of 40 g  l−1 glyc-
erol, 1.8 g  l−1 citric acid, 0.02 g  l−1  CaCl2·2H2O, 12.6 g  l−1 
 (NH4)2HPO4, 0.5 g  l−1  MgSO4·7H2O, 0.9 g  l−1 KCl, 50 µl 
antifoam Glanapon 2000 kz (Bussetti and Co GmbH, 
Vienna, Austria), 0.4  mg  l−1 biotin, 2 ml  l−1 of vitamin 
stock solution [47], and 5 ml  l−1 of PTM1 trace salts [45]. 
The pH was adjusted to 5 using 5 M HCl. The vitamins, 
the biotin and the trace salts were filter-sterilized and 
added to the autoclaved medium after cooling down.
Inocula were prepared as described elsewhere [56]. 
Reactors were inoculated at a starting  OD600 of 1. The 
pH was controlled at 5 throughout the culture using 15% 
ammonia (only base addition was used). The temperature

was set to 28 °C, and the inlet gas was fed into the reac -
tors at an aeration rate of 1 vvm (0.5  l  min−1). The dis -
solved oxygen (DO) was set to 30%, automatically 
controlled using the following cascade: (1) Increasing 
the stirring rate from 400 to 1000  rpm; (2) Raising the 
percentage of oxygen in the inlet gas, while maintain -
ing an aeration rate of 0.5  l  min−1. For the fed-batch 
phase, the temperature was set to 25 °C. Pure methanol 
(ρ = 792 g  l−1) and feeding salts were added separately to 
avoid precipitation. The feeding salts medium composi -
tion was 0.35  g  l−1  CaCl2·2H2O, 10  g  l−1 KCl, 6.45  g  l−1 
 MgSO4·7H2O, 200 µl antifoam Glanapon 2000 kz, 1.2 mg 
 l−1 biotin, 6 ml  l−1 of vitamin stock solution, and 15 ml 
 l−1 of PTM1 trace salts. This media was prepared at 2× 
concentration since pure methanol was used. Two sepa -
rated solutions were prepared and autoclaved, one con -
taining  CaCl2·2H2O, and the other containing the rest of 
the components. After that, both solutions were mixed 
under sterile conditions at room temperature. The vita -
mins, the biotin and the trace salts were filter-sterilized 
and added to this final feeding solution.
After reaching a peak in the % of  CO2 from the exhaust 
gas, indicating the end of the batch phase, two pulses of 
pure methanol (1 and 2 g  l−1, respectively) were sequen -
tially added into the reactors. Once the methanol of the 
last pulse was completely depleted, the cultures were 
fed with a constant feeding rate  (Fo) for 6 h to complete 
the transition phase. After that, the feeding medium was 
added to the bioreactors using a pre-programmed expo -
nential feeding strategy for controlled specific growth 
rate described in the following equation:
where µ was 0.03   h−1, the  X0 was set to 22 g  l−1 and the 
 YX/S to 0.273 g  g−1.
The reactors were sampled every 5.5  h to measure 
 OD600, biomass dry cell weight and supernatant metabo -
lites. The  OD600 measurements were performed in trip -
licate using a Lange DR 3900 spectrophotometer (Hach, 
Loveland, CO, USA). The Relative Standard Deviation 
(RSD) was below 5%. For the biomass DCW determi -
nation, 10 ml of distilled water with 9  g  l−1 NaCl were 
used to wet the pre-weighted glass microfiber filters 
(APFF04700, Merck Millipore) before filtering 2 ml of 
culture for each triplicate. After that, the filters were 
washed using the same volume of the NaCl solution and 
dried for 24  h at 105  °C. Filters containing the dry bio -
mass were weighted to calculate the DCW. This param -
eter was quantified for three samples throughout the 
fed-batch, in which the RSD was below 2.5%. For the rest 
of the samples, the DCW was calculated by interpola -
tion using an equation from a linear regression between 
F(t) = µ[X (to)V (to)]
YX /SSo
e[µ(t−to)]
DCW and  OD600 measures of the initial fed-batch cul -
tivations. To quantify the metabolites, 2 ml of culture 
samples were centrifuged 5  min at 13,400  rpm using a 
MiniSpin (Eppendorf, Germany). The supernatant was 
then filtered with a 0.2  μm pore size single-use syringe 
filter (SLLGX13NK, Merck Millipore, CA, USA). The 
filtered supernatant was stored at − 20  °C until HPLC 
analysis for methanol and 3-HP quantification, and for 
exometabolome profiling by NMR.
Analytical methods
Methanol and 3-HP were quantified using an HPLC 
Dionex Ultimate3000 (Dionex – Thermo Fischer Sci -
entific). The compounds were separated with an 
ionic exchange column ICSep ICE-COREGEL 87H3 
(Transgenomic, Omaha, NE, USA) using 6 mM sulphuric 
acid as mobile phase at a flow rate of 0.6 ml  min−1. Both 
metabolites were quantified from the Refractive Index 
(RI) spectrum.
For the NMR method, a Bruker Avance 600 MHz NMR 
spectrometer operating at a proton ( 1H) frequency of 
600.13  MHz equipped with a triple-resonance Bruker 
TXI 5 mm room-temperature probe and an autosampler 
(Bruker Biospin, Rheinstetten, Germany) was utilized. 
The probe temperature was maintained at 298.0 K in all 
experiments. Once centrifuged and filtered, each super -
natant aliquot (400  µl) was mixed with a  D2O sodium 
phosphate buffer (200  µl, 0.2  M, pH 7.4) containing an 
internal standard (3-(trimethylsilyl)-[2,2,3,3- 2H4]-propi-
onic acid sodium salt (TSP), 1 mM) and transferred to 
the NMR tube. All samples were analysed conducting 
1D 1H NMR experiments with presaturation of the resid-
ual water signal applying the pulse sequence commonly 
termed 1D NOESY-presat [57]. Data were collected into 
32K data points during an acquisition time of 2.3 s using 
a recycle delay of 2 s. Spectra were recorded in the time 
domain as interferograms (FID) across a spectral width 
of 7211 Hz and as the sum of 1024 transients. Each FID 
was multiplied by an exponential apodisation function 
equivalent to a 0.2  Hz line broadening, prior to Fourier 
transform. The frequency-domain spectra were manually 
phased, baseline corrected, and referenced to the TSP 
resonance at δ H 0.00 ppm. The identification of metabo -
lites was carried out using the BMRB spectral database 
[58] and the software Chenomix NMR Suite 8.5 (Cheno -
mix Inc., Edmonton, Canada).
Process parameters determination and data consistency 
checking
Recorded offline and online state variables during the 
fed-batch phase of the bioreactor-scale experiments, 
namely biomass X, substrate S, product P , flow rate 
F, and initial volume  V0 (see Additional files 4  and 6 ) 
Page 14 of 16Àvila‑Cabré et al. Microbial Cell Factories          (2023) 22:237 
were used to calculate all derived variables. Details of 
all equations derived from the mass balances used to 
calculate yields and rates in the fed-batch experiments 
can be found elsewhere [59, 60]. In short, intermedi -
ate values of the offline variables (X, P), correspond -
ing to the time when online measured variables were 
taken, were calculated (interpolated) after applica -
tion of the ‘smoothingspline’ function from Matlab 
R2021a (Mathworks, Inc., Natick, MA, USA). Variables 
measured as concentrations in the liquid phase were 
referred to the total volume. Recorded state vari -
ables were used to calculate the accumulated variables 
(total amounts, XV, SV, PV, V) during the fed-batch 
phase. Linear regression was applied on the time evo -
lution of accumulated variables. Regression slopes and 
its confidence intervals were taken as averaged rates 
of total state variables. Averaged rates of state vari -
ables during the fed-batch phase were used to calcu -
late the derived variables (growth rate µ, q-rates, and 
yields). The carbon and electron balances were veri -
fied using the averaged measures prior to apply com -
mon reconciliation techniques [61]. For the elemental 
mass balance verification, the mean elemental biomass 
composition  CH1.88O0.63N0.20S0.004 with an ash con -
tent of 5.9%, previously reported for cells growing on 
methanol at µ = 0.035   h−1 [ 42], was assumed in this 
study. Loss of methanol by stripping was considered 
almost negligible since C-balances were satisfied with 
less than 6% of deviation. Statistical χ2 consistency test 
based on h-index, applied on measured data balances 
as described elsewhere [62, 63], was passed with a con -
fidence level of 95%. Consequently, there was no evi -
dence for gross measurement errors. The method used 
for this purpose is also described in detail elsewhere 
[59].
