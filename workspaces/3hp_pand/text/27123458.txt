1. Introduction
Autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) are neurodevelopmental
disorders characterized by limited social interaction, abnor-
mal use of language, and stereotypical behaviors, interests,
and activities [1]. During the last decades, ASDs prevalence
estimates have risen to as much as 113/10,000 children in
the USA (2012) and 62/10,000 globally [2], corresponding to
1:88 and 1:161 children, respectively. Hence this once rare
diseasehasnowbecomeoneofthemostfrequentconditions

Amongenvironmentalfactorspossiblyrelevanttoclinical

in a sizable subgroup of autistic patients is of great inter-

RuminococcusandClostridiumspecies was initially reported

ium histolyticumgroup (Clostridiumclusters I and II) in the
fecal flora of 58 ASDs children compared to 10 healthy chil-
dren. Interestingly, 12 unaffected siblings of ASDs probands
displayed intermediate levels. Several members of theC.
histolyticumgroup are known toxin producers which could
leadtogutdysfunction[7].Adamsetal.foundlowerlevelsof

presumably derived from overgrownClostridiumspecies or
other gut microbiota in the urine of autistic individuals [9–
14].Inthisstudy,toseeksimilarmarkersandfurtherexplore

2. Material and Methods
2.1.PatientRecruitmentandSampleCollection. Thisprospec-
tive study was approved by the Ethics Committee of Mater-
nity and Child Care Hospital of Hunan Province. Informed
consentwasobtainedfromtheparentsofthepatients.Sixty-
twopatients(48malesand14femalesagedfrom1.5to7years)
previously diagnosed with ASDs and age/gender-matched
non-ASDs controls (male 48, female 14) were obtained from
Maternity and Child Care Hospital of Hunan Province. All
the children with ASDs did not have a history of food
restricted. The controls were excluded with mental retarda-
tion, verbal disorder, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder,
and tics, and the ASDs cases were diagnosed according
to DSM-IV diagnostic criteria. Children included in the
study had no antianaerobic drug use history. Urine samples
were collected into untreated vials during routine medical
consultations,principallyinthemorning,andtheexacttime
of collection was recorded. Each urine sample was aliquoted
into1.5mLEppendorftubesandstoredat −70

aftercollectionuntilanalysis.
2.2. Sample Pretreatment.The samples were pretreated as
described in our previous work [15]. Briefly, urine samples
werethawedatroomtemperatureandcentrifuged(at3000g)
for 10min and 100𝜇L urine samples (contained 2.5mmol/L
creatinine) was first treated with 30.0𝜇Lu r e a s e( 1 . 2U /𝜇L)

spiked with heptadecanoic acid (0.5mg/mL, 50𝜇L). Pro-
teins, including the added urease, were precipitated with
800𝜇L ethanol and removed after 15min centrifugation
(12000r/min). Forty microliters of 0.04mol/L hydroxy-
lamine hydrochloride and 60𝜇L of 0.05mol/L Ba(OH)
2was
addedtothedeproteinizedsolutionandthemixturewasthen
incubated at room temperature for 20min. Subsequently,
the mixture solution was evaporated to dryness, and the
compounds in the dried residue were converted to TMS
derivatives with 100𝜇Lo fB S T F A / T M C S( 1 0 0:1 )a n da n a -
lyzed by GC/MS. More experimental details can be found in
ourpatentedtechnology(ZL201210114246.2).
2.3. GC-MS Analysis. An Agilent GC-MS system (7890-
5975C)wasusedtoanalyzethederivativesamples.Asample
(1𝜇L) was injected with a split ratio of 50:1 into the GC
andthenseparatedwithafusedsilicaHP-5capillarycolumn
(30m, 0.25mm inside diameter, 0.25𝜇mt h i c k n e s so ft h e

were as follows. The injector temperature was set at 250
∘C.

turewere300
∘Cand230 ∘C,respectively.Ionsweregenerated
byelectronicimpact(EI)at70eV.Masseswereacquiredfrom
𝑚/𝑧50 to 800. Drift of retention time of each peak was
minimized by locking heptadecanoic acid at 36.00min with
retention time locking technology (RTL, Agilent). GC/MSD
ChemStation Software was used for autoacquisition of GC
totalionchromatograms(TICs)andfragmentationpatterns.
Each compound had a fragmentation pattern composed of

theabundanceofwhichwerecomparedwithastandardmass
chromatogram in the NIST (National Institute of Standards
and Technology) mass spectra library by the ChemStation
Software. Peaks with similarity index more than 70% were
assignedcompoundnames.
The chromatograms were subjected to noise reduction,
and peaks with intensity higher than threefold of the ratio
of signal to noise (S/N) were recorded prior to peak area
integration. The relative intensity of each peak was normal-
ized against that of the internal standard in GC/MS run.
All known artifact peaks, such as peaks due to column
bleed and BSTFA artifact peaks, were not considered in
the final data analyses. Integrated peak areas of multiple
derivative peaks belonging to the same compound were
summedandconsideredasasinglecompound.Eachsample
wascharacterizedbythesamenumberofvariables,andeach
of these variables was represented across all observations
with the same sequence. Thus, a data matrix was generated
by intensities of the commensal peaks from all samples to
characterize the biochemical pattern of each sample. The
resultingthree-dimensionalmatrixconsistingofpeakindices
(retention time (RT)-𝑚/𝑧pairs), sample names (observa-
tions), and normalized peak areas (variables) was exported
forprincipalcomponentanalysis(PCA).
2.4. Statistical Analysis.After GC/MS analysis, each sample
was represented by a GC/MS TIC, and ion peak areas of
compounds were integrated. The peak area ratio of each
compound to creatinine was calculated as the response.
The results are expressed as ratios to the urinary creatinine
concentration. Statistical analysis was used for the compar-
ison of the metabolite levels to determine their significant
differences between the ASDs group and the control group.
The differentially expressed compounds with 𝑝values of
<0.05wereconsideredtobestatisticallysignificant.
Principal component analysis (PCA) was used to differ-
entiate the samples and performed by Mass Profiler Pro-
fessional software (Agilent). All of the data from the dif-
ferentially expressed compounds were used for constructing
PCA models. The score plots of the first three principal
components allowed the visualization of data and compar-
ison of samples between the ASDs and control group. The
classification performance (specificity and sensitivity) was
assessed by the area under the curve (AUC) of the receiver-
operatingcharacteristic(ROC)curves.

3. Results and Discussion
3.1. Metabolomic Profiling of Urine Samples.Representative
GC/MSTICchromatogramsofurinesamplesfromtheASDs
group and the control group are displayed in Figure 1. The
majority of the peaks in the chromatograms were identi-
fied as endogenous metabolites by the NIST mass spectra
library, including amino acids, organic acids, carbohydrates,
amides,andfattyacids.TableS1inelectronicSupplementary
Material (see the Supplementary Material available online at
http://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2016/9485412)showsthe96signals,
which could be autoidentified by the NIST library through
comparing their fragmentation patterns composed of all the
fragment ions. Peaks which could not be identified by the
NIST library are not listed. The first three fragment-ion𝑚/𝑧
valueswiththehighestabundancewithineachfragmentation
pattern and the matching percentage to the NIST library are
listedinTableS1.
3.2. Pattern Recognition and Function Analysis.After nor-
malization of data using creatinine as internal standard, a
numberofdifferentiallyexpressedcompoundswith 𝑝values
of <0.05 were selected by statistical analysis to construct a
PCA model for assessment of the clustering of the ASDs
group and the control group. The PCA scores plot showed
a clear separation of the two groups besides only a few
ASDs cases (Figure 2(a)), which could be explained by the
fact that the etiology and pathogenesis of these cases are
probably caused by genetic factors. According to the pre-
viously reported studies, elevated concentration of 3-(3-
hydroxyphenyl)-3-hydroxypropionate (HPHPA) may be the
catabolism product of phenylalanine byClostridiumspecies
[9]. Interestingly, besides HPHPA, we also found two aro-
matic metabolites 3-hydroxyphenylacetic acid (3HPA) and
3-hydroxyhippuric acid (3HHA) among these differentially
expressed compounds. The three compounds were further
qualitatively analyzed by comparing their retention time
and fragment-ion of the chromatograms between the urine
sample and the corresponding standards (Figures S1–S4; see
SupplementaryMaterial).Allofthedatasupporttheidentifi-
cationofthethreecompoundsas3HPA,HPHPA,and3HHA,
respectively,Figures2(b),2(c),and2(d)graphicallyshowthe

HPHPA (𝑝<0.001), and 3HHA (𝑝<0.001) concentrations
were significantly higher in ASDs children compared with
age-matchedcontrols.
3.3. Effect of Vancomycin on Urinary Excretions of the Three
Compounds. Some studies tested vancomycin treatment for
ASDssincevancomycingivenorallyisvirtuallynotabsorbed,
anditisgenerallyeffectiveagainstgram-positivebacteriaand
Clostridia species [9, 16, 17]. For preventing the generation
of vancomycin resistance strains, we made some modifica-
tionsofvancomycintreatment.FiftyHPHPA-positiveautistic
children (9/50 patients 3HPA-positive and 17/50 patients
3HHA-positive)wereselectedfororalvancomycintreatment
at standard age-appropriate dosages (50mg/kg/d, 30 days
as one therapeutic course) followed by supplement therapy
with Bifidobacteriumagent (BifidobacteriumBB-12, 2 pills a
day).Afteronetherapeuticcourse,thetreatmentwasdiscon-
tinued for 15 days and the next course began only with
Bifidobacteriumagent treatment. The subsequentBifidobac-
terium agent treatment followed this cycle and continued
depending on the severity of patients’ condition assessed
by Autism Behavior Checklist (ABC) and the excretions
of the three compounds. Two months later, paired-sample

which may be attributed to the supplement therapy with
Bifidobacterium agent, a probiotic bacterium that benefits
the dynamic equilibrium for intestinal microecology. Fur-
thermore, after two therapeutic course treatments, the ABC

autistic children showed improved communication and eye
contact,butnoobviousimprovementinstereotypedbehavior

wereprobablyderivedfromovergrownintestinalmicrobiota,
andthepathogenesisofASDsmaybenotonlycorrelatedwith
overgrowngutpathogenicbacteria.
Additionally, the effect of this treatment on intestinal
symptoms was also studied. 32/62 children with ASDs have
frequent constipation; this gut symptom was positively cor-
related with the HPHPA level (Pearson correlation = 0.253,
𝑝<0.05). In 50 HPHPA-positive patients employed for the
treatment, 22 individuals have constipation. Interestingly,
after two therapeutic course treatments, 22 patients with
constipationallshowedremarkableimprovementsinconsti-
pation, which revealed that gut symptoms in ASDs may also
resultedfromovergrowngutpathogenicbacteria.

overgrown intestinal microbiota likeClostridiumspecies. As
shown in Figure 3, dietary phenylalanine firstly is converted
intom-tyrosine,o-tyrosine,and2,3-dihydroxyphenylalanine
by gut microbiota, for example, chloridazon-degrading bac-
teria [18]. It has been proved thatm-tyrosine induces a char-
acteristic behavioral syndrome in rats consisting of forepaw
padding, head weaving, backward walking, splayed hind
limbs,wetdogshakes,hyperactivity,andhyperreactivityand
depletes the brain of catecholamines. Therefore,m-tyrosine
might play a direct role in causing abnormal behaviors in
ASDs [19]. It is also possible thatm-tyrosine might form an
analogofdopamine,if m-tyrosineismetabolizedbythesame
enzymesthatconverttyrosinetodopamine(Figure3)[9].
m-Tyrosine converts to m-tyramine and 3-hydroxy-
phenylpropionic acid by decarboxylation and deamination,
respectively (Figure 3). It is documented thatEscherichia
coli could induce the activities of amine oxidase (MaoA)
and phenylacetaldehyde dehydrogenase (PadA) for the
catabolismofaromaticamines.Phenylethylamine,tyramine,
and dopamine are substrates of MaoA and PadA, leading
to formation of the corresponding aromatic acids, that
is, phenylacetic acid, 4-hydroxyphenylacetic acid, and 3,4-
dihydroxyphenylacetic acid, respectively [20, 21]. There-
f o r e ,3 H P Aw o u l db ee x p e c t e dt ob ef o r m e di ft h e r e
are amounts of m-tyramine for the substrate of the two
enzymes (Figure 3). Another metabolite fromm-tyrosine,
3-hydroxyphenylpropionic acid, converts into HPHPA and
3-hydroxybenzoic acid in order as reported by Shaw [9];
the latter product then conjugates with glycine and forms
3HHA(Figure3).
3.5. Sensitivity and Specificity.Receiver-operating character-
istic (ROC) analysis with sensitivity (true positives) and 1
minus specificity (false positives) of HPHPA, 3HPA, and
3HHA was used to evaluate the possibility of using these
markersfordiagnosingASDs.Selectedsensitivityandspeci-
ficity calculations for the three metabolites measures in

two-regressionanalysis,theoptimalAUC(0.962),sensitivity
(90.3%),andspecificity(98.4%)wereobtainedbyROCcurve
of Prediction probability based on the three metabolites
(Figure 4), which means that the three metabolites are good
discriminators to differentiate between ASDs and non-ASDs
control. These results indicate that the measurements of
the three metabolites are strong predictors of ASDs and
support the potential clinical utility for identifying a sub-
group of ASDs subjects in whom disordered phenylalanine
metabolismmaybeasalientcharacteristic.

The present metabolomic profile approach provides com-
prehensive analyses of metabolites in urine and elevated
