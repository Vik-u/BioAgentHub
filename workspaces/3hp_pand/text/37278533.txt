ABSTRACT Malonyl-CoA reductase (MCR) is a NADPH-dependent bi-functional enzyme 
that performs alcohol dehydrogenase and aldehyde dehydrogenase (CoA-acylating) 
activities in the N- and C-terminal fragments, respectively. It catalyzes the two-step 
reduction of malonyl-CoA to 3-hydroxypropionate (3-HP), a key reaction in the autotro­
phic CO 2 fixation cycles of Chloroflexaceae green non-sulfur bacteria and the archaea 
Crenarchaeota. However, the structural basis underlying substrate selection, coordina­
tion, and the subsequent catalytic reactions of full-length MCR is largely unknown. For 
the first time, we here determined the structure of full-length MCR from the photosyn­
thetic green non-sulfur bacterium Roseiflexus castenholzii (RfxMCR) at 3.35 Å resolution. 
Furthermore, we determined the crystal structures of the N- and C-terminal fragments 
bound with reaction intermediates NADP + and malonate semialdehyde (MSA) at 2.0 Å 
and 2.3 Å, respectively, and elucidated the catalytic mechanisms using a combination 
of molecular dynamics simulations and enzymatic analyses. Full-length RfxMCR was a 
homodimer of two cross-interlocked subunits, each containing four tandemly arranged 
short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase (SDR) domains. Only the catalytic domains SDR1 
and SDR3 incorporated additional secondary structures that changed with NADP +–MSA 
binding. The substrate, malonyl-CoA, was immobilized in the substrate-binding pocket 
of SDR3 through coordination with Arg1164 and Arg799 of SDR4 and the extra domain, 
respectively. Malonyl-CoA was successively reduced through protonation by the Tyr743–
Arg746 pair in SDR3 and the catalytic triad (Thr165–Tyr178–Lys182) in SDR1 after 
nucleophilic attack from NADPH hydrides.
IMPORTANCE The bi-functional MCR catalyzes NADPH-dependent reduction of 
malonyl-CoA to 3-HP , an important metabolic intermediate and platform chemical, 
from biomass. The individual MCR-N and MCR-C fragments, which contain the alcohol 
dehydrogenase and aldehyde dehydrogenase (CoA-acylating) activities, respectively, 
have previously been structurally investigated and reconstructed into a malonyl-CoA 
pathway for the biosynthetic production of 3-HP . However, no structural information for 
full-length MCR has been available to illustrate the catalytic mechanism of this enzyme, 
which greatly limits our capacity to increase the 3-HP yield of recombinant strains. Here, 
we report the cryo-electron microscopy structure of full-length MCR for the first time and 
elucidate the mechanisms underlying substrate selection, coordination, and catalysis 
in the bi-functional MCR. These findings provide a structural and mechanistic basis for 
enzyme engineering and biosynthetic applications of the 3-HP carbon fixation pathways.

M
alonyl-CoA reductase (MCR) catalyzes NADPH-dependent reduction of malonyl-
CoA to malonate semialdehyde (MSA). This is a key reaction step in two 
autotrophic CO 2 fixation pathways, the 3-hydroxypropionate (3-HP) ( 1) and 3-HP/
4-hydroxybutanoate cycles ( 2) that were initially identified in Chloroflexaceae green 
non-sulfur bacteria and in the archaea Crenarchaeota, respectively ( 3). Both carbon 
fixation pathways begin with an acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACCase)-catalyzed carboxyla­
tion of acetyl-CoA to malonyl-CoA, which is consecutively reduced to MSA and further 
reduced to 3-HP . Archaeal species often utilize two mono-functional enzymes, MCR 
and malonate semialdehyde reductase, to catalyze malonyl-CoA conversion to 3-HP ( 2). 
In contrast, green non-sulfur bacteria, including members of the genera Chloroflexus 
and Roseiflexus, employ a single bi-functional MCR to catalyze both reduction reactions 
of malonyl-CoA ( 4). MSA is an electrophilic aldehyde that can form adducts to free 
amino groups and exert toxic effects (5). Through catalyzing two consecutive reduction 
reactions, the bi-functional MCR directly converts MSA into 3-HP , thereby decreasing the 
cytotoxicity that resulted from the accumulation of this aldehyde intermediate. Given the 
important role of 3-HP as one of the 12 value-added platform chemicals generated from 
biomass (6, 7), a malonyl-CoA pathway for 3-HP biosynthesis containing ACCase and the 
bi-functional MCR has been reconstructed in Escherichia coli , yeast, Synechocystis, and 
type II methanotrophs (8–12). However, all recombinant strains carrying the malonyl-CoA 
pathway have low 3-HP yield, which was resulted from the imbalance in expression 
levels, catalytic activities, and metabolic coordination of the multi-subunit ACCase and 
bi-functional MCR enzymes (13, 14).
Chloroflexus aurantiacus  is a representative species of green non-sulfur bacteria in 
which the 3-HP cycle was originally identified ( 15, 16). The MCR enzymes purified 
from both autotrophically and heterotrophically grown C. aurantiacus  cells ( CfxMCR) 
have been dissected into two functionally distinct fragments, CfxMCR-N and CfxMCR-C, 
which perform the alcohol dehydrogenase and aldehyde dehydrogenase (CoA-acylating) 
activities, respectively ( 4). Malonyl-CoA is primarily reduced to MSA by CfxMCR-C, then 
further reduced to 3-HP by CfxMCR-N. Dissection of CfxMCR into these two individ­
ual fragments not only increases the overall enzyme activity but also improves 3-HP 
production in recombinant E. coli  strains ( 9, 12, 17). However, CfxMCR-N is expressed 
at significantly higher levels than CfxMCR-C in 3-HP-producing strains, even though 
both genes are codon-optimized and controlled by the same promoter ( 17). In combi­
nation with the rate-limiting effects of reduction catalyzed by MCR-C, the difference 
in expression generates a functional imbalance between MCR-N and MCR-C, which 
further decreases the 3-HP yield ( 17). Direct evolution of CfxMCR-C and fine-tuning 
of CfxMCR-N expression levels can minimize the imbalance of overall enzyme activity, 
which increased the 3-HP titer 270-fold in one instance ( 18); however, even when this 
approach is combined with optimized culture conditions, 3-HP production remains 
unsatisfactory. Structural and mechanistic investigations into the bi-functional MCR are, 
therefore, urgently needed.
Crystal structures of individual MCR-N and MCR-C from Porphyrobacter dokdonensis 
have revealed dimeric architectures of both PdMCR-N and PdMCR-C, which fit well into 
the surface model of the full-length PdMCR resolved from small-angle X-ray scattering 
(SAXS) analyses. It is proposed by the authors that a full-length PdMCR dimer was 
formed through paring contact of two subunits, with each subunit composed of four 
tandemly arranged short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase (SDR) domains ( 19). However, 
due to the lack of a high-resolution structure of full-length MCR, the assembly of the 
homodimer, as well as the conformation of MCR-N and MCR-C connecting regions are 
not clear. Although PdMCR-N and PdMCR-C structures revealed the cofactor/substrate-
binding mode, the molecular mechanisms underlying substrate selection, intermediate 
coordination, and subsequent catalytic processes of bi-functional MCR are not fully 
understood. These greatly limit our understanding of the catalytic mechanisms of 
bi-functional MCRs and also the potential to engineer a full-length enzyme for improving 
biosynthetic 3-HP production.

For the first time, we here determined the cryo-electron microscopy (EM) structure 
of the full-length MCR from Roseiflexus castenholzii  (20) ( RfxMCR), which shares 58% 
sequence identity with CfxMCR ( 21), at 3.35 Å resolution. The crystal structures of 
NADP+–MSA-bound RfxMCR-N and RfxMCR-C were also determined at 2.0 Å and 2.3 Å 
resolutions, respectively. Full-length RfxMCR was a homodimer of two cross-interlocked 
subunits that each contained four tandemly arranged SDR domains; only the catalytic 
SDR1 and SDR3 domains, which incorporated additional components (such as the 
α10 helix and the ED) into the SDR core, were capable of accommodating NADP +–
MSA as reaction intermediates. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of the full-length 
RfxMCR further revealed that malonyl-CoA binding required the cooperation of Arg1164 
from SDR4 and Arg799 from the ED. Malonyl-CoA was successively reduced through a 
proton-relay network formed by the Tyr743-Arg746 pair in SDR3 and the catalytic triad 
Thr165-Tyr178-Lys182 in SDR1 after nucleophilic attack by the NADPH hydrides. Our 
work illustrates the molecular mechanisms underlying substrate selection, binding, and 
consecutive reduction by the bi-functional enzyme MCR. These findings will serve as 
the structural basis for future enzyme engineering and biosynthetic applications of the 
malonyl-CoA pathway for 3-HP production.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Protein expression and purification
The gene sequences encoding R. castenholzii  MCR ( Rcas_2929) was amplified from R. 
castenholzii DSM 13941 genomic DNA and inserted into pET20b expression vector at 
XhoI and NdeI to construct the C-terminal His 6-tagged expression vector. The sequenced 
plasmid was transformed into E. coli  BL21(DE3) cells for the recombinant expression of 
a C-terminal His 6-tagged full-length RfxMCR. The gene sequences encoding RfxMCR-N 
(Met1-Phe572) and RfxMCR-C (Gly573-Val1229) were inserted into pET28a vectors at 
XhoI and NcoI restriction site, and NdeI and NcoI restriction site, respectively, to express 
the C-terminal and N-terminal His 6-tagged recombinant proteins. The transformed cells 
were grown in 1 L Luria-Bertani broth containing 100 mg/mL ampicillin at 37°C until 
the optical density at 600 nm (OD 600) reached 0.6–0.8. The gene expression was then 
induced with 0.2 mM isopropyl-β-D-thiogalactopyranoside overnight at 25°C.
Cells were harvested by centrifugation at 7,500× g for 10 minutes at 4°C and 
resuspended in wash buffer containing 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 300 mM NaCl, and 
2 mM MgCl2 prior to homogenization with a high-pressure homogenizer (Union, People’s 
Republic of China). The insoluble cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 22,000× 
g for 40 minutes at 4°C. The supernatant containing crude soluble proteins was loaded 
onto a Ni 2+-chelating affinity chromatography column (GE Healthcare, Fairfield, CT, USA) 
and was rinsed with 100 mL of binding buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 300 mM NaCl, 
2 mM MgCl 2, 50 mM imidazole) to remove non-specifically bound proteins. The bound 
full-length RfxMCR, RfxMCR-N, and RfxMCR-C proteins were eluted with the binding 
buffer containing 300 mM imidazole. The eluates were further purified by a HiLoad 
16/600 Superdex 200PG size exclusion column (GE Healthcare) with buffer containing 
25 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0 and 150 mM NaCl to 95% purity.
Cryo-electron microscopy
Three-microliter aliquots of full-length RfxMCR (0.3 mg/mL) was placed on the glow-
discharged GiG R1.2/1.3 300-mesh gold holey nickel titanium grid (Zhenjiang Lehua 
Electronic Technology, China) and blotted for 3.0 seconds under a blot force of 4 at 100% 
humidity and 16°C before being flash-frozen in liquid ethane with a Mark IV Vitrobot 
system (FEI). Micrographs were acquired on a Titan Krios microscope (FEI) operated at 
300 kV with a K3 Summit direct electron detector (Gatan). SerialEM ( 22) was used for 
automatic data collection. A nominal magnification of ×22,500 was used for imaging, 
which yielded a pixel size of 1.07 Å. The defocus range was between 1.3 and 1.8 µm. Each

micrograph was dose-fractionated to 32 frames under a dose rate of 9.4 e -/Å2 per second 
and an exposure time of 6.4 seconds, which resulted in a total dose of about 60 e-/Å2.
Image processing
Motion correction and exposure weighting were performed by the MotionCorr2 
program ( 23), and the CTF (contrast transfer function) parameter was estimated using 
the CtfFind program ( 24). All the image processing steps were performed using RELION 
3.0 ( 25) and CryoSPARC programs ( 26). To generate a template for two-dimensional 
(2D) classification, 14,112 particles were auto-picked from 20 micrographs and subjec­
ted to 2D classification. Using a reference generated from 2D classification of 12,105 
particles, 4,043,667 particles were auto-picked from 4,647 micrographs and imported 
in CryoSPARC. After five iterative rounds of 2D classifications, 2,391,743 particles were 
selected and imported in RELION for three-dimensional (3D) classification. Using the 
best 3D class as a reference, 3D classifications generated four classes of particles. Then 
1,766,605 particles from the best two classes (percentage of 42.89 and 30.97, respec­
tively) were selected and extracted, and subjected to another round of reference-based 
3D classiﬁcation and non-uniform reﬁnement in CryoSPARC, which produced an EM-map 
with a global resolution of a 3.35 Å based on the gold standard Fourier shell correlation 
(FSC). Local resolution was estimated with Resmap (27) (Fig. S2).
Model building, refinement, and validation
Based on the cryo-EM density map, de novo  atomic model building of RfxMCR was 
conducted in Coot ( 28). Then real-space refinement in PHENIX ( 29, 30) was used for 
model refinement. All figures were drawn in PyMOL (The PyMOL Molecular Graphics 
System, Version 2.5.2; Schrödinger, LLC), USCF chimera ( 31), or ChimeraX ( 32). The 
refinement statistics were summarized in Table 2.
Crystallization of NADP+–MSA-bound RfxMCR-N and RfxMCR-C
The purified R fxMCR-N and RfxMCR-C were concentrated using an Amicon Ultra 
centrifugal filter device (10-kDa molecular weight cutoff; Millipore) at 4°C. Protein 
concentrations were determined using a NanoDrop device (IMPLEN) by recording the 
absorption at 280 nm. The protein samples were diluted to 25 mg/mL in buffer (50 mM 
Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl) for crystallization. The RfxMCR-N and RfxMCR-C were 
incubated with cofactor NADP + at 1: 10 molar ratio for 30 seconds at 50°C before 
crystallization. Crystallization was performed using the hanging-drop vapor diffusion 
method, with 1.2 µL of protein sample mixed with an equal volume of reservoir 
solution, and the mixture was equilibrated against 200 µL reservoir solution. Crystals 
of NADP+–MSA-bound RfxMCR-N were obtained with the reservoir solution containing 1 
M sodium malonate pH 5.0, 0.1 M sodium acetate trihydrate pH 4.5, and 3% polyethylene 
glycol 20,000 at 16°C. The NADP +–MSA-bound RfxMCR-C were crystallized with reservoir 
solution containing 1.6 M sodium formate and 0.1 M Bis-tris propane pH 7.0 at 16°C.
Crystal data collection, structure determination, and refinement
The optimized crystals were cryo-protected by adding 30% glycerol to the reservoir 
solution and flash-freezing with liquid nitrogen. A 2.0-Å data set of NADP +–MSA-bound 
RfxMCR-N and a 2.30-Å data set of NADP +–MSA-bound RfxMCR-C were collected at 
SSRF BL10U2 ( Table 3). Diffraction data were automatically processed, integrated, and 
scaled with Porpoise XDS software ( 33). The quality of the data were assessed using 
SFCHECK ( 34), and the solvent content was calculated using Matthews_Coef from the 
CCP4 package (35, 36). The NADP+–MSA-bound RfxMCR-N and RfxMCR-C structures were 
determined by molecular replacement method using the cryo-EM structural model of 
full-length RfxMCR as a search model. The Phaser program ( 37) from the CCP4 package 
was employed to determine the initial phases; iterative model building and refinement

July/August  Volume 14  Issue 4 10.1128/mbio.03233-22 4
were performed using Coot ( 28), Refmac5 ( 38), and Phenix ( 29) to obtain the refined 
model (Table 3).
Site-directed mutagenesis and enzyme activity assay
Site-directed mutagenesis of the catalytic triad and amino acid residues that are involved 
in NADP+–MSA binding was performed using a mutagenesis kit (Yeasen), the constructed 
plasmids containing the mutated gene sequences were sequenced, and transformed 
into E. coli BL21(DE3) cells for the expression of the mutant proteins. The proteins were 
expressed and purified following the same procedure under identical conditions as the 
wild-type proteins.
The enzymatic activity of RfxMCR was assayed spectrophotometrically at 50°C by 
measuring the absorbance of NADPH at 340 nm ( ε = 6.22 mM -1·cm-1). The standard 
assay mixture (200 µL) was composed of 100 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM 
MgCl2, 0.4 mM NADPH, and 0.1 nmol RfxMCR as the enzyme. Enzyme concentration was 
determined by the Bradford method. The absorbance of NADPH at 340 nm was recorded 
for 10 minutes at 50°C. One unit of enzymatic activity was deﬁned as the amount 
of enzyme that catalyzes the oxidation of 1 µmol NADPH per minute. The apparent 
Michaelis–Menten constant ( Km) and Vm were measured at the reaction velocity by 
varying the substrate malonyl-CoA concentrations at 0.05, 0.1, 0.15, 0.2, 0.4, 0.5, and 
1.0 mM (Table 1). The kcat and Km values were determined by the non-linear least squares 
fitting method. The enzymatic activity of the site-directed mutants was measured in the 
same conditions as the wild-type RfxMCR. All the enzymatic data were obtained from 
triplicate experiments.
Sedimentation velocity analytical ultracentrifugation
Sedimentation velocity analytical ultracentrifugation (AUC) was performed to check the 
oligomerization state of RfxMCR-N and RfxMCR-C in solution. Sedimentation experiments 
were performed on a Beckman Coulter Proteome Lab XL-I ultracentrifuge using a 4-hole 
An-60Ti rotor. Protein samples with an initial absorbance at 280 nm of approximately 
0.5–0.8 were equilibrated for 2 hours at 20°C under a vacuum prior to sedimentation. The 
absorbance at 280 nm was measured using a continuous scan mode during sedimenta­
tion at 55,000 rpm in 12 mm double-sector cells. The data were analyzed using sedfit 
(39).
Molecular dynamics simulation and binding free-energy calculations
To obtain the binding structure of full-length RfxMCR with the substrate malonyl-CoA, 
the structures of full-length RfxMCR and NADP +–MSA-bound RfxMCR-C were superim­
posed with the CoA bound PdMCR-C (PDB 6K8T) ( 19) to construct the binding structure 
of NADP+–CoA–MSA-bound full-length RfxMCR. Then, the structure of full-length RfxMCR 
in complex with NADPH–malonyl-CoA was obtained through structure editing using the 
UCSF ChimeraX software ( 32). The missing residues in the determined structures were 
added with UCSF ChimeraX as well. To investigate the binding features of full-length 
RfxMCR in complex with the reaction intermediate NADP +–MSA, and the substrate for 
the second reduction reaction NADPH–MSA, the binding structures of full-length RfxMCR 
with NADP+–MSA and NADPH–MSA were constructed based on the crystal structures of 
NADP+–MSA-bound RfxMCR-C and RfxMCR-N, respectively.
To characterize the binding features of full-length RfxMCR with malonyl-CoA and 
MSA, MD simulations were performed on the binding structures of full-length RfxMCR 
bound with NADPH–malonyl-CoA, NADP +–MSA (NADP +–MSA bound at the C-terminal 
domain of full-length RfxMCR), and NADPH–MSA (NADPH–MSA bound at the N-terminal 
domain of full-length RfxMCR) by using the AMBER 20 software ( 40). Each binding 
complex was immersed into the center of a truncated octahedron box of TIP3P water 
molecules with a margin distance of 12.0 Å. Environmental sodium counterions were 
added to keep the system in electric neutrality. The AMBER ff14SB force field was applied

for full-length RfxMCR ( 41). The force field parameters of NADPH and NADP + were 
retrieved from previous reports ( 42, 43). For malonyl-CoA, the atomic partial charges 
were calculated using the restricted electrostatic potential method with a basis set of 
HF/6-31G(d) on the structures optimized at the B3LYP/6-31G(d) level (44). The other force 
field parameters of malonyl-CoA were generated from the Generalized Amber Force Field 
with the Antechamber module of AmberTools ( 45). Following the same procedure in our 
previous report (46), each MD simulation was conducted with a time scale of 100 ns.
To evaluate the binding affinities between full-length RfxMCR and the bound 
substrate and cofactors, their binding free energies ( ΔGbind) were obtained through the 
molecular mechanics/generalized Born surface area (MM/GBSA) calculation approach 
(47):
(1)ΔGbind = Gcomplex − (Gprotein + Gligand)
(2)ΔGbind = ΔH − TΔS ≈ ΔEMM + ΔGsolv − TΔS
(3)ΔEMM = ΔEvdW + ΔEele
(4)ΔGsolv = ΔGGB + ΔGSA
where EMM is the gas phase interaction energy comprising van der Waals energy 
(EvdW) and electrostatic energy ( Eele). Gsolv is the solvation free energy, including the 
contributions form a polar part ( GGB) and a non-polar part ( GSA). Δ GGB was estimated 
using the generalized Born model with the interior and exterior dielectric constants set 
to 4 and 80, respectively ( 48). Δ GSA was estimated using the LCPO algorithm: ΔGSA = 
γΔSASA + β, where γ and β were set to 0.0072 and 0, respectively (49). The solute entropy 
term TΔS is sometimes approximated by normal mode entropy ( 50), but such treatment 
rarely leads to improvement in the correlation with experiments ( 51). Therefore, the 
solute entropy term was not included in the current study. In calculating ΔGbind, 200 
snapshots were evenly extracted from the last 20 ns trajectories for the calculations of 
ΔEvdW, ΔEele, ΔGGB, and ΔGSA.
RESULTS
Cryo-EM structure of full-length RfxMCR
The gene sequence ( Rcas_2929) encoding the full-length RfxMCR (Met1-Val1229) was 
expressed with a C-terminal His 6-tag in E. coli  BL21 (DE3) cells ( 17). The encoded 
recombinant protein was purified via nickel-nitriloacetic acid affinity and size exclusion 
chromatography (Fig. S1A and B ). Gel filtration analysis of purified RfxMCR revealed an 
elution peak at 59.8 mL ( Fig. S1A ), which corresponded to the elution profile of an 
RfxMCR dimer with a calculated molecular weight of ~270 kD. Additionally, a single 
protein band with a molecular weight near 268 kDa was observed in the gel after 
Native PAGE (Fig. S1C), confirming the existence of the RfxMCR dimer in solution. Using 
malonyl-CoA as the substrate and NADPH as the cofactor, purified full-length RfxMCR 
was able to catalyze the reduction of malonyl-CoA to 3-HP ( Fig. 1A and B). The apparent 
catalytic constant ( kcat) was 5.65 ± 0.57 per second and the Michaelis constant ( Km) 
was 0.38 ± 0.08 mM for malonyl-CoA ( Table 1). Compared to CfxMCR, RfxMCR exhibited 
a lower catalytic efficiency for malonyl-CoA reduction, characterized by the decreased 
substrate-binding affinity and turnover number (17). This difference may be attributed to 
the varied amino acid residues that affect the conformation of substrate-binding pocket 
or resulted from the different temperature and pH values for measuring the enzyme 
activity.
Prior to our study, the structure of full-length MCR had not been reported. To 
investigate the dimer structure, RfxMCR was imaged on a 300 kV Titan Krios cryo-EM with

a K3 Summit direct electron detector (Gatan) in counting mode ( Fig. S1D). From 4,647 
micrographs, 4,043,667 particles were selected and used to construct an electron 
potential map with an average resolution of 3.35 Å ( Fig. S1D through G; Fig. S2). The final 
reconstructed cryo-EM map was clearly resolved and enabled us to build an accurate 
model of the protein side chains of full-length RfxMCR ( Table 2; Fig. S3A ). The overall 
structure of RfxMCR was a homodimer of two cross-interlocked subunits with the N- and 
C-terminal ends assembled in the same direction; the dimensions were 160 × 110 × 95 Å 
(Fig. 1C). Each subunit was composed of four tandemly arranged SDR domains (SDR1–4). 
The ED (Gly783–Arg932), which comprised eight α-helices, was inserted into the SDR3 
domains (Gly573–Glu782 and Met933–Gly962) and was exposed at the two sides of the 
homodimer ( Fig. 1C and D ). Each SDR domain adopted a typical Rossmann fold that is

composed of a central seven-stranded parallel β-sheet sandwiched with two or three α-
helices (Fig. S3B).
From the full-length RfxMCR structure, we first resolved the conformation of RfxMCR-
N and RfxMCR-C connecting region, which was folded into an α-helix (G573WAESL578). In 
the center of the homodimer, two of these α-helices were anti-parallel arranged in the 
reverse direction ( Fig. 1E ). Gel filtration and Native-PAGE analyses of the site-directed 
mutants W574A/E576A/F579A showed the same dimer formation as wild-type RfxMCR 
(Fig. S1H and I ), indicating that this helix is not essential for forming the homodimer. 
Instead, it plays an important role in connecting the RfxMCR-N and RfxMCR-C fragments 
and also serves as a point of intersection for the two subunits to form a dimer. This also 
confirmed that the two subunits were cross-interlocked to form the homodimer; this 
finding was inconsistent with the simulated SAXS model of PdMCR, in which the 
homodimer is formed by two parallel-contacted subunits ( 19). Actually, the dimer 
interface was formed by symmetrically distributed hydrogen bonding interactions 
between amino acid residues from the RfxMCR-N (SDR1–SDR2) and RfxMCR-C (SDR3–ED–
SDR4) of the two subunits (Fig. S4A and B).
Crystal structure of substrate-bound RfxMCR-N and RfxMCR-C
Attempts to obtain a cryo-EM structure of substrate-bound full-length RfxMCR were not 
successful. We did not resolve any densities of substrate or cofactor from the cryo-EM 
maps of full-length RfxMCR incubated with NADP + or malonyl-CoA ( Fig. S3E and F ). To 
elucidate the substrate binding and catalytic mechanisms of RfxMCR, we therefore 
determined the crystal structures of RfxMCR-N (Met1–Phe572) and RfxMCR-C (Gly573–
Val1229) bound with NADP +–MSA ( Fig. 2  and 3 ). The crystal structure of RfxMCR-N in

complex with NADP +–MSA was determined by the molecular replacement method and 
reﬁned to an Rwork of 19.62% and an Rfree of 20.81% at 2.0 Å resolution ( Table 3 ). 
Although the P6522 crystal contained only a monomer RfxMCR-N in one asymmetric unit, 
it was packed into a homodimer in the crystal ( Fig. S4C). This was consistent with both 
the gel filtration and AUC analyses, which showed the existence of an RfxMCR-N dimer in 
solution ( Fig. S5A and D ). Superimposition of the crystal-packed RfxMCR-N dimer with 
the full-length RfxMCR yielded a root mean square deviation (RMSD) of 1.031 Å (Fig. S4D), 
indicating that RfxMCR-C truncation did not affect the overall conformation of RfxMCR-N. 
Analyses of the dimer interface revealed similar symmetrically distributed hydrogen 
bonding interactions as the full-length RfxMCR dimer, such as those between Arg6 and 
Glu274 (2.9 Å), Glu190 and Arg243 (3.0 Å), Ala277 and His287 (2.9 Å), and Thr297, Thr298, 
and Glu552 (2.9 Å) (Fig. S4A).
Although SDR1 (Met1–Pro292) and SDR2 (Thr293–Gly572) in RfxMCR-N had identical 
architectures, only SDR1, which contained the conserved Tyr-X-X-X-Lys motif ( 52), was 
resolved with NADP + bound ( Fig. 2A ; Fig. S6A ). Surprisingly, we observed an extra 
electron density that precisely matched the reduction intermediate MSA near the 
nicotinamide ring of NADP + (Fig. S3C). The carboxyl groups of MSA were immobilized by 
hydrogen bonding interactions with Tyr172 (2.6 Å), Arg175 (2.7 Å), and Tyr178 (2.9 Å), 
whereas the aldehyde group was hydrogen bonded with the hydroxyl group of Thr165 
(2.9 Å) ( Fig. 2B ). NADP + was also coordinated in the cofactor-binding pocket through 
extensive hydrogen bonding interactions ( Fig. 2B). The nicotinamide ring was stabilized 
by a hydrogen bond with Ser213 (3.2 Å), and the ribose oxygen formed a hydrogen bond 
with the amino nitrogen of Lys182 (2.7 Å). The free oxygen atom of the pyrophosphate

group was hydrogen bonded with the guanidine side chain of Arg215 (3.1 Å). On the 
other side, the guanidine amine group of Arg41 covered the adenine ring and formed a 
hydrogen bond with one oxygen of the 2′-phosphate group of the ribose ring (3.0 Å). The 
adenosine ring was further hydrogen bonded with Asp70 (3.0 Å) and Asn138 (3.0 Å) ( Fig. 
2B). Site-directed mutation of Thr165, Tyr172, Arg175, Tyr178, and Lys182 to Ala residues 
resulted in a dramatic decrease in the overall enzymatic activity of the full-length RfxMCR 
(Fig. 2C ), confirming the essential role of these amino acid residues in malonyl-CoA 
reduction.
The crystal structure of RfxMCR-C in complex with NADP +–MSA was also determined 
by the molecular replacement method and reﬁned to an Rwork of 22.05% and an Rfree of 
25.28% at 2.3 Å resolution ( Table 3). In contrast to RfxMCR-N, both the gel filtration and 
AUC analyses showed the existence of a RfxMCR-C monomer in solution ( Fig. S5C and E). 
The overall structure contained 28 α-helixes and 13 β-strands that were organized into 
tandemly arranged SDR3 (Gly573–Glu782 and Met933–Gly962), ED (Leu783–Thr932), and

SDR4 (Phe963–Val1229) domains (Fig. S3B). Superimposition of a crystal-packed RfxMCR-
C dimer with the full-length RfxMCR yielded an RMSD of 0.995 Å (Fig. S4E and F), with the 
dimer interface stabilized by similar extensive hydrogen-bonding interactions as the full-
length RfxMCR dimer (Fig. S4B).
Similar to RfxMCR-N, a cofactor NADP + and intermediate MSA were resolved at the 
interface between the SDR3 and ED domains ( Fig. 3A; Fig. S3D). In the substrate-binding 
pocket, MSA was immobilized by hydrogen bonding interactions with Ser731 (3.0 Å) 
and Tyr749 (3.2 Å) from the SDR3 domain and Arg799 (3.5 Å) from the ED. NADP + 
was coordinated in the cofactor-binding pocket through extensive hydrogen bonding 
interactions with Tyr749 (2.6 Å), Lys753 (3.1 Å), Ser593 (2.7 Å), Arg616 (2.9 Å), and Asp651 
(3.2 Å). The essential catalytic roles of these residues were also confirmed by enzymatic 
analyses ( Fig. 3C ). Mutation of the NADP +–MSA coordinating residues Ser731, Tyr749, 
Lys753, and Arg799 completely eliminated enzymatic activity. In addition, mutagenesis 
of Arg746, Arg785, and Leu795 (the highly conserved residues that are essential for CoA 
binding in PdMCR) both markedly decreased RfxMCR enzymatic activity (Fig. 3C; Fig. S7).

RfxMCR conformational changes occurred during substrate binding
To investigate the conformational changes that occurred during substrate binding, we 
compared NADP +–MSA-bound RfxMCR-N and RfxMCR-C structures with that of full-
length RfxMCR (Fig. 4). Superimposition of NADP+–MSA-bound RfxMCR-N with full-length 
RfxMCR revealed striking conformational changes in the substrate-binding pocket. 
Specifically, the side chains of Arg41 and Asp70 in SDR1 were flipped by ~7.2 Å and 9.3 Å, 
respectively, to stabilize the NADP+ adenine ring. Notably, the side chains of members of

+ 
(shown in yellow), and the catalytic triad (Thr165-Tyr178-Lys182) both underwent dramatic side-chain conformational changes. Specifically, the α10 helix (which 
covered MSA and the nicotinamide ring of NADP
+
) was rotated by ~20° toward the substrate-binding pocket. ( B) Surface representation of the substrate-binding 
pocket in full-length unbound RfxMCR (white, upper panel) and NADP +–MSA-bound RfxMCR-N (blue, lower panel). Conformational changes of the α10 helix

(C) Superimposition of NADP +–MSA-bound RfxMCR-C (yellow) with full-length RfxMCR (white) revealed striking side-chain conformational changes in the

NADP+ (green) and MSA (salmon), all underwent dramatic side-chain conformational changes. ( D) Surface representation of the substrate-binding pocket in 
full-length unbound RfxMCR (white, upper panel) and NADP +–MSA-bound RfxMCR-C (yellow, lower panel). The conformational changes of these key residues

 adenosine ring. The positions of NADP

 and MSA are shown as green outlines in full-length

the catalytic triad (Thr165–Tyr178–Lys182) were also shifted toward the substrate-bind­
ing pocket, as were the sidechains of Tyr172 and Arg175, which were essential for 
coordinating MSA. Especially, the α10 helix (Ser213–Gly228) was rotated by ~20° toward 
the substrate-binding pocket to cover MSA and the NADP + nicotinamide ring ( Fig. 4A). 
This resulted in the closure of the MSA-binding site and shrinking of the substrate-bind­
ing pocket ( Fig. 4B ). Interestingly, no conformational changes were observed for the 
corresponding helix between the apo- and NADP+-bound PdMCR-N structures (PDB 6K8V 
and 6K8W), which adopted similar conformations to that of full-length RfxMCR; their 
nicotinamide ring–binding sites were still exposed when NADP + was bound ( Fig. 4B; Fig. 
S8A and B ). These analyses indicated that the dramatic conformational changes of the 
α10 helix were specific structural features that occurred when the reaction intermediate 
MSA was bound.
Similarly, extensive side chain conformational changes were observed in the 
RfxMCR-C substrate-binding pocket during NADP +–MSA binding (Fig. 4C). When NADP+–
MSA was bound, members of the SDR3 catalytic triad (Ser731–Lys753–Tyr749) were 
shifted toward the substrate-binding pocket to form hydrogen bonds with NADP + and 
MSA. Specifically, the guanidine side chain of Arg799 was flipped by ~1.6 Å to stabilize 
the MSA carbonyl group, and the side chains of Asp651 and Arg616 were shifted by ~2.0 
Å and 4.1 Å, respectively, to immobilize the adenosine ring of NADP+; this further resulted 
in partial closure of the adenosine ring–binding site in NADP +–MSA-bound RfxMCR-C 
(Fig. 4D; Fig. S8C and D). In PdMCR-C bound with NADP+ (PDB 6K8U) and CoA (PDB 6K8T), 
the substrate-binding pockets adopted similar conformations, even with respect to the 
secondary structures (Fig. S8C). There was a lack of clear electron density in the region of 
Glu782–Pro793 (corresponding to the α7 helix in PdMCR-C); however, the nicotinamide 
ring–binding site was exposed in NADP+–MSA-bound RfxMCR-C, whereas it was closed in 
PdMCR-C bound with NADP + and CoA ( Fig. 4D; Fig. S8D through G ), indicating that this 
region likely played important roles in CoA binding.
Malonyl-CoA-binding conformations revealed by MD simulations
To further explore the catalytic mechanism of RfxMCR, MD simulations were performed 
for the substrate malonyl-CoA, the cofactor NADPH ( Fig. 5A), and the reaction intermedi­
ates NADP(H)+–MSA with full-length RfxMCR. Due to the differences in the MD starting 
structures and the binding cofactor, as well as the substrate-induced conformational 
changes, RfxMCR in the binding complexes of RfxMCR‒ NADPH–malonyl-CoA, RfxMCR‒ 
NADP+–MSA, and RfxMCR‒ NADPH–MSA showed different RMSD profiles. But RfxMCR 
together with the binding cofactor and substrate showed converged RMSD profiles 
in the second half of all MD simulations, indicating the simulation process reached 
the equilibration stage ( Fig. S9A through C ). An MM/GBSA calculation ( 47) revealed 
that the highest binding free energy of malonyl-CoA to full-length RfxMCR was −77.76 
kcal/mol ( Table 4), indicating that malonyl-CoA was a much more favorable substrate 
than MSA for binding to RfxMCR. The binding free energy was further decomposed to 
identify per-residue contributions ( Fig. 5B ). The largest per-residue contribution came 
from Arg1164 in the SDR4 domain, which formed hydrogen bonds with the pyrophos­
phate oxygen of CoA and the guanidine nitrogen of Arg799 ( Fig. 5B  and C ). Similarly, 
the residues Arg799, Lys807, and Lys919 (from the ED domain) contributed to immobi­
lize the CoA moiety through hydrogen bonding interactions ( Fig. 5C ). The essential 
roles of these amino acid residues in malonyl-CoA binding were further verified by the 
decreased binding free energy of Arg799 and the absence of Lys807 and Lys919 in 
the per-residue decomposition of NADPH–MSA-bound RfxMCR (Fig. S9D). These results 
were also in agreement with the structural comparisons of NADP+–MSA-bound RfxMCR-C 
and full-length RfxMCR, in which Arg799 underwent dramatic conformational changes 
during MSA binding (Fig. 4C).
Importantly, the malonate moiety of malonyl-CoA was hydrogen bonded with 
residues Tyr749, Arg746, and Tyr743 within the sequence motif YXXRXXY that were 
conserved between SDR3 and SDR1 domains ( Fig. 5C; Fig. S6C). In contrast with Arg746

and Tyr749, which contributed to both malonyl-CoA and MSA binding, Tyr743 made 
significant contributions to malonate binding but no contributions to MSA binding ( Fig. 
5B through D; Fig. S9D). This indicated that Ty743 played an essential role in malonyl-CoA 
reduction. MD simulations of the reduction intermediate NADP(H)–MSA with full-length 
RfxMCR revealed a relatively higher binding affinity with the SDR1–2 domains than with 
SDR3–ED–SDR4 ( Table 4), demonstrating that it was more favorable for MSA to bind to 
the SDR1–2 domains to proceed through the second reduction step of MSA to 3-HP . 
Consistent with the crystal structure of NADP +–MSA-bound RfxMCR-N, Thr165, Tyr172, 
Arg175, and Tyr178 contributed considerable free energies for MSA binding to full-length 
RfxMCR. Specifically, Arg175 and Arg215 contributed the biggest free energies for MSA 
binding ( Fig. 5D ; Fig. 2B ). Coincidently, the amino acid residues Arg215, Ile216, and 
Met219, which had moderate binding free energies, were all located within the α10 helix 
(Ser213–Gly228) that underwent striking conformational changes during MSA binding 
(Fig. 5D; Fig. 4A). Superimposition analyses revealed that, in the simulated NADPH–MSA-
bound full-length RfxMCR, the α10 helix also adopted the same conformations that were 
observed in the crystal structure of NADP +–MSA-bound RfxMCR-N ( Fig. 5E and F ). This 
confirmed that the conformational changes of the α10 helix were necessary for MSA 
binding and closure of the binding pocket for subsequent reduction reactions.
Molecular mechanism of RfxMCR in catalyzing the two-step reduction of 
malonyl-CoA to 3-HP
In the equilibrated binding structure with NADPH–malonyl-CoA, electrostatic interac­
tions were observed between the carbonyl C3 atom and the hydride from the NADPH 
nicotinamide ring (3.4 Å); this provided the prerequisite for a hydrophilic attack at 
the C3 atom. On the other side of the molecule, oxygen atoms at the malonyl end 
were immobilized in a chain of hydrogen bonding interactions with the OH of Tyr743 
(2.7 Å), the NH1 of Arg746 (2.9 Å), and Tyr749 (2.8 Å) ( Fig. 5C ). Based on the crystal 
structures of NADP +–MSA-bound RfxMCR-N and RfxMCR-C, and the binding characteris­
tics of full-length RfxMCR with NADPH–malonyl-CoA and NADP(H) +–MSA, we propose 
a catalytic mechanism for the two consecutive reduction reactions ( Fig. 6A ). Initially, 
the hydride from the NADPH nicotinamide group launches a nucleophilic attack at the 
carbonyl C3 atom of malonyl-CoA, leading to breakage of the S ‒ C bond and generation 
of MSA, a CoAS − thioanion, and NADP + (Fig. 6B ). Subsequently, CoAS − is reduced by 
sequential deprotonation of the Tyr743 hydroxyl group and the Arg746 guanidine amine; 
the deprotonated Arg746 could be restored by surrounding solvents. As indicated in 
the structural analyses of NADP +–MSA-bound RfxMCR-C, the reaction intermediate MSA 
could be further stabilized in a proton relay network by hydrogen bonding interactions 
with Ser731, Tyr749, and Arg799 for the second reduction step (Fig. 3B).
In the structure of NADP +–MSA-bound RfxMCR-N, Thr165 stabilized the reaction 
intermediate MSA by forming hydrogen bonds with the C3 carbonyl oxygen ( Fig. 2B ), 
which facilitates nucleophilic attack by the NADPH hydride on the C3 atom of MSA. The 
MSA anion generated by this process is protonated by extracting a proton from the 
Tyr178 hydroxyl group to form 3-HP ( Fig. 6C ). Due to the steric hindrance and the 
distance between the Tyr178 hydroxyl and the Lys182 α-amino group (4.6 Å in the crystal 
structure) ( Fig. 2B), a direct proton transfer from Lys182 to Tyr178 is unlikely. However, 
Lys182 could play a dual role not only in orienting the cofactor NADPH by hydrogen 
bonding with the nicotinamide ribose (2.7 Å) but also by mediating protonation of 
Tyr178 through an NADPH hydroxyl-mediated proton transfer ( Fig. 2B ; Fig. 6C ). The 
deprotonated Lys182 could feasibly be recovered by the solvent, completing the 
catalytic reaction. Overall, using two molecules of NADPH, malonyl-CoA could be 
converted into MSA, then further reduced to 3-HP through two consecutive reactions 
occurring at domains SDR3–ED–SDR4 and SDR1–2 of RfxMCR (Fig. 6).

DISCUSSION
We here investigated the catalytic mechanism of a bi-functional MCR from R. castenholzii. 
It is a chlorosome-less green nonsulfur bacterium that is closely related to C. aurantiacus 
(20), the species in which the 3-HP autotrophic carbon fixation pathway was first 
identified and demonstrated. For the first time, we determined the cryo-EM structure of a 
full-length bi-functional MCR and found that it contained two subunits, each with four 
tandemly arranged SDR domains and one ED domain, which were cross-interlocked to 
form a homodimer. By determining the cryo-EM structure of full-length RfxMCR, we first 
observed that the RfxMCR-N and RfxMCR-C in each subunit were connected by an α-helix 
(G573WAESL578). Second, we revealed a homodimer of two cross-interlocked subunits with 
the N- and C-terminal ends in the same direction. In the center of the homodimer, two of 
these helices were antiparallelly arranged and serve as a point of intersection of the two 
subunits, further representing that the two subunits were interlocked but not paring 
contacted to form the homodimer ( Fig. 1E). This disagrees with the previous studies of 
PdMCR. In this work, the authors fit the dimeric crystal structures of PdMCR-N and 
PdMCR-C into the SAXS model of full-length PdMCR and proposed that two PdMCR 
subunits were paring contacted to form a homodimer (19).
MSA is an essential reaction intermediate of the malonyl-CoA reduction, and it is 
either released or remains enzyme bound ( 17). Like other aldehydes, cellular accumula­
ted MSA can react with free amino groups to form adducts and exert toxic effects. 
The growth of E. coli  K-12 cells at high temperature was severely restricted by the 
accumulation of MSA when pyrimidines were used as the sole nitrogen source ( 5). 
The bi-functional MCR is superior to the mono-functional enzymes in that it combines 
the alcohol and aldehyde dehydrogenase (CoA-acylating) activities into one single 
enzyme, which directly consumes the reaction intermediate MSA and thus decreases 
its cellular accumulation and toxicity. However, no structural information of the MSA-
bound conformation of MCR enzymes is available. Notably, we here determined the 
crystal structures of NADP +–MSA-bound RfxMCR-N and RfxMCR-C and revealed the 
conformational changes necessary for substrate selection and intermediate coordina­
tion. Superimposition of the catalytic SDR1 domain with the non-catalytic SDR2 domain 
gave a main chain RMSD of 6.680 Å. Compared to SDR1, the non-catalytic SDR2 lacked 
the α10 and α11 helices, which were necessary for covering the NADP +–MSA binding 
pocket; it also lacked two antiparallel β-strands (β7–β8) and two short α-helices (α5–α6) 
that were exposed on the SDR1 surface ( Fig. S6A). Consistent with the crystal structure of 
NADP+–MSA-bound RfxMCR-N, MD simulations of the full-length RfxMCR with NADP(H)+–
MSA revealed similar conformational changes of the α10 helix, confirming that this helix 
played an important role in stabilizing the binding of the reaction intermediate MSA ( Fig. 
4A; Fig. 5F). In addition, SDR2 and SDR1 had completely different amino acid residues 
in the NADP +–MSA binding sites; SDR2 had a distinct substrate-binding pocket that 
disfavored MSA binding ( Fig. S6A; Table 4). Similarly, the superimposition of the SDR3 
and SDR4 main chains had a larger RMSD at 18.511 Å ( Fig. S6B), indicating the dramatic 
differences between these two SDR domains arose from the incorporation of ED into 
the SDR3 domain. Sequence alignment further confirmed that the substrate-binding 
residues in SDR3 and SDR4 were less conserved, which resulted in the absence of a 
malonyl-CoA–NADPH binding pocket in SDR4 (Fig. S6B).
Interestingly, the superimposition of RfxMCR-N and RfxMCR-C revealed an excellent 
match of the tandem SDR1–2 and SDR3–4 domain core architectures and relatively 
high conservation of the NADP +–MSA binding site ( Fig. S6C ). Notably, SDR1 required 
additional secondary structures (such as the α10 and α11 helices) to cover the MSA-bind­
ing site. In contrast, SDR3 incorporated a larger module, including SDR4 and ED, to 
form the active site pocket, in which Arg1164 and Arg799 made major contributions 
to malonyl-CoA binding ( Fig. 5C ; Fig. S6C ; Table 4 ). As a result, the conformation of 
the substrate-binding pocket in SDR3 was more favorable for binding the substrate 
malonyl-CoA, whereas the SDR1-binding pocket was optimal for stabilizing the reaction 
intermediate MSA. However, the mutation of the amino acid residues in SDR4 of

CfxMCR increases enzymatic activity ( 18). Therefore, although SDR2 and SDR4 were 
not involved in either substrate or cofactor binding or catalysis, they served as auxil­
iary domains to maintain RfxMCR catalytic activity. Most importantly, we found that 
the substrate specificity of the bi-functional MCR was determined by incorporating 
additional secondary structures to the core SDR architectures (Fig. S6).
RfxMCR has not been examined in biosynthetic 3-HP production, but CfxMCR has 
been reconstructed in E. coli  BL21 (DE3) cells together with CfxACCase to generate 
a 3HP-producing strain ( 9). Separation of the CfxMCR-N and CfxMCR-C fragments in 
this strain increases 3-HP production by 1.5 times ( 17), indicating that the full-length 
CfxMCR enzyme activity is regulated by coordination between the CfxMCR-N and 
CfxMCR-C modules. However, the expression levels of CfxMCR-N and CfxMCR-C in the 
cells were different, which generated a functional imbalance that further decreased 
the 3-HP yield. Direct evolution of CfxMCR-C has yielded three mutants with increased 
enzymatic activity ( Fig. S10A ) and 270-fold higher 3-HP production (after fine-tuning 
of CfxMCR-N expression levels) ( 17, 18); these mutants were N940V (corresponding to 
Asn951 in RfxMCR), K1106W (Lys1116 in RfxMCR), and S1114R (Asn1124 in RfxMCR). 
The highly conserved Lys1116 was located at the interface between SDR4 and the ED 
domain. Mutation of Lys1116 to Trp would increase steric hindrance with Asn887 from 
the helix α33, which likely enhanced malonyl-CoA binding by facilitating closure of 
the substrate-binding pocket during catalysis ( Fig. S10B ). Mutation of the conserved 
Asn951 to Val likely enhanced the hydrophobic interactions with residues Pro934 and 
Pro959 located in the α36 and loop region covering the substrate-binding pocket, which 
probably enhanced NADPH binding during catalysis ( Fig. S10C ). In contrast, Asn1124, 
which was located at the end of the SDR4 domain, was not conserved and was far 
away from the substrate pocket ( Fig. S10D). Combination of these mutations enhanced 
the enzyme activity of CfxMCR-C, but the mutation “hot spots” identified via saturation 
mutation were distant from the substrate and cofactor-binding pockets. Nevertheless, 
the structural basis of RfxMCR revealed in this work serves as an accurate template for the 
future rational design of the full-length MCR enzymes, which contributes to eliminate the 
expression and functional imbalance between dissected MCR-N/C and also decreases the 
cytotoxicity resulting from the accumulation of the toxic reaction intermediate MSA.
In summary, we here revealed the molecular bases underlying substrate binding, 
specificity determination, and catalytic mechanisms of a bi-functional MCR from R. 
castenholzii. This was achieved through a combination of approaches, including cryo-EM, 
X-ray crystallography, enzymatic analyses, and MD simulations. The results of this study 
not only broaden our understanding of the key catalytic steps in the 3-HP autotrophic 
carbon fixation pathways but are expected to advance industrial applications of this 
metabolic pathway in biosynthetic 3-HP production.
