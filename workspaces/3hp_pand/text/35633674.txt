3-Hydroxypropionic acid (3-HP) is a promising high value-added chemical. Acetyl-CoA 
carboxylase (Acc) is a vital rate-limiting step in 3-HP biosynthesis through the malonyl-CoA 
pathway. However, Acc toxicity in cells during growth blocks its ability to catalyze 
acetyl-CoA to malonyl-CoA. The balancing of Acc and malonyl-CoA reductase (MCR) 
expression is another an unexplored but key process in 3-HP production. To solve these 
problems, in the present study, we developed a method to mitigate Acc toxicity cell growth 
through Acc subunits (AccBC and DtsR1) expression adjustment. The results revealed 
that cell growth and 3-HP production can be accelerated through the adjustment of DtsR1 
and AccBC expression. Subsequently, the balancing Acc and MCR expression was also 
employed for 3-HP production, the engineered strain achieved the highest titer of 6.8 g/L, 
with a high yield of 0.566 g/g glucose and productivity of 0.13 g/L/h, in shake-flask 
fermentation through the malonyl-CoA pathway. Likewise, the engineered strain also had 
the highest productivity (1.03 g/L/h) as well as a high yield (0.246 g/g glucose) and titer 
(up to 38.13 g/L) in fed-batch fermentation, constituting the most efficient strain for 3-HP 
production through the malonyl-CoA pathway using a cheap carbon source. This strategy 
might facilitate the production of other malonyl-CoA-derived chemical compounds in 
the future.

INTRODUCTION
3-Hydroxypropionic acid (3-HP , CAS 503-66-2) is a precursor for numerous chemicals (such as 
1,3-propanediol and malonic acid) and can be polymerized to useful polymers, such as poly(3-HP; 
Liu et  al., 2017 ). Because 3-HP was listed as one of the top value-added chemicals by the US 
Department of Energy in 2004 ( Werpy et  al., 2004 ), an increasing number of microbiology 
studies have focused on 3-HP synthesis. Since the early 2000s, various microorganisms, including 
Klebsiella pneumoniae and Escherichia coli et  al., have been metabolically engineered to produce 
3-HP using different substrates ( De Fouchécour et  al., 2018 ; Ji et  al., 2018 ; Zhou et  al., 2020 ). 
Three major routes of 3-HP biosynthesis have been reported, namely the (i) glycerol, (ii) malonyl-CoA, 
and (iii) β-alanine pathways ( Liu et  al., 2017 ; De Fouchécour et  al., 2018 ). Among these, the 
malonyl-CoA pathway has attracted considerable scientific attention and is particularly advantageous 
for its redox-neutral properties resulting from the use of a glucose substrate and its thermodynamic

feasibility (Liu et  al., 2017). In this pathway, 3-HP is synthesized 
from acetyl-CoA in three steps ( Figure  1; De Fouchécour et  al., 
2018). The first step involves the conversion of acetyl-CoA to 
malonyl-CoA through acetyl-CoA carboxylase (Acc), and the 
other two steps consist of two reductions with dissected 
malonyl-CoA reductase (MCR), including MCR-C and MCR-N, 
to catalyze malonyl-CoA to 3-HP (Liu et al., 2013; De Fouchécour 
et  al., 2018 ). MCR derived from Chloroflexus aurantiacus was 
systematically studied through the mutation and balancing of 
this bifunctional enzyme (Liu et al., 2016). Escherichia coli–derived 
Acc comprises four subunits, two carboxyltransferase ( α and β) 
subunits (encoded by accA and accD), carboxyl carrier protein 
(encoded by accB), and biotin carboxylase (BC; encoded by 
accC). However, Corynebacterium glutamicum–derived Acc consists 
of only two subunits, AccBC functions as C-terminal carboxyl 
carrier protein and N-terminal biotin carboxylase, and DtsR1 
function as carboxyltransferase (Cheng et al., 2016). One common 
strategy is to induce Acc overexpression to enhance intracellular 
malonyl-CoA accumulation for the production of biochemicals 
such as 3-HP , polyketide triacetic acid lactone, and fatty acid 
(Davis et  al., 2000 ; Zha et  al., 2009 ; Rathnasingh et  al., 2012 ; 
Liu et  al., 2013, 2016, 2019b; Xu et  al., 2014; Han et  al., 2020). 
However, many studies have reported that Acc overexpression 
is toxic to cells, although the mechanism of this toxicity remains 
unclear ( Davis et  al., 2000 ; Zha et  al., 2009 ; Liu et  al., 2015 ). 
To alleviate this toxicity, biosensors have been used to adjust 
Acc expression ( Xu et  al., 2014 ; Liu et  al., 2015 ). However, the 
application of these methods in industrial production is difficult 
because of genetic circuit instability (Liao et al., 2019). Therefore, 
investigating more stable new methods is essential for addressing 
this bottleneck in the biosynthesis of malonyl-CoA derivatives.
This study aimed to mitigate the toxicity of Acc during 
cell growth and improve 3-HP production. We  developed 
a novel strategy to address the problem of Acc toxicity 
during cell growth and 3-HP production by modifying 
C. glutamicum –derived DtsR1 and AccBC expression levels 
and demonstrated the effectiveness of this method. 
Additionally, balancing the Acc and MCR expression has 
been used to increase 3-HP production. Finally, the engineered 
3-HP-producing E. coli  strain achieved highest productivity 
of 1.03 g/L/h and a high yield of 0.246 g/g glucose, with the 
titer reaching 38.13 g/L during fed-batch fermentation.

Plasmid Construction
The primers used for plasmid construction are listed in 
Supplementary Table S2 . All plasmids in this study were 
constructed using the Gibson assembly method ( Gibson 
et  al., 2009 ). Nine plasmids (pA-0029, pA-0030, pA-0031, 
pA-0032, pA-0033, pA-0034, pA-0035, pA-0064, and pA-AR) 
were assembled through the fusion of RFP with RBSs of 
varying strengths (B0029, B0030, B0031, B0032, B0033, 
B0034, B0035, and B0064) 1 and AR from pACYCDuet-1 
(Supplementary Table S3 ) into a pACYCDuet-1 backbone. 
Two subunits, DtsR1 (1,632 bp and 58.47 KDa, Gene ID: 
3345446) and AccBC (1,776 bp and 63.419 KDa, Gene ID: 
3343021), of Acc from C. glutamicum  and accA (960 bp 
and 35.2 KDa, Gene ID: 6062185), accD (915 bp and 33.3 KDa, 
Gene ID: 6059083), accB (471 bp and 16.6 KDa, Gene ID: 
6058890), and accC (1,350 bp and 49.3 KDa, Gene ID: 
6058863) from E. coli  BL21 (DE3) were amplified and 
assembled into pACYCDuet-1 to generate 13 engineered 
plasmids to analyze cell growth and 3-HP production. To 
regulate the expression of DtsR1 and AccBC, plasmids (D30-
AAR, D30-A34, DAR-A34, DAR-A30, D34-A30, D34-AAR, 
D30-A30, DR-AAR, D34-A34, and D64-A64) were constructed 
using the primers listed in Supplementary Table S2  through 
the replacement of various RBSs. To balance the expression 
levels of Acc and MCR for 3-HP production, plasmids 
containing D34-A30, D34-AAR, D30-A34, DAR-A34, 
D30-A30, DAR-AAR, D34-A34, and D64-A64 were 
co-transformed with pMCR-C-N940V/K1106W/S1114R into 
Q2098. All fragments in this study were amplified with 
Phanta HS Super-Fidelity DNA Polymerase, which was 
purchased from Vazyme Biotech (Nanjing, China). All 
assembled plasmids were transformed into DH5 α through 
the calcium chloride (CaCl 2) method.
RBS Characterization and Cell Growth 
Analysis
For RBS characterization, RFP fluorescence was monitored 
in real time using a Multi-Detection Microplate Reader (Synergy 
HT, BioTek, Winooski, VT, United  States). Details of the 
procedure are as follows: The seeds of RBS characterization 
strains were prepared by transferring single colonies into a 
12-well microassay plate with 2 ml of LB medium supplemented 
with 34 μg/ml chloramphenicol for 12 h at 30 °C. Next, 2% 
1 http://parts.igem.org/Main_Page
of seeds were inoculated into a 96-well microassay plate 
containing 0.2 ml of LB medium with 34 μg/ml chloramphenicol 
to detect red fluorescence. The 96-well plate was cultured at 
30°C under vigorous shaking. During RBS characterization, 
the optical density (OD) was measured at 600 nm; red 
fluorescence was detected through excitation at 590 nm and 
emission at 645 nm.
For cell growth analysis, single colonies were cultivated in 
a 12-well microassay plate containing 2 ml of LB medium 
supplemented with 34 μg/ml chloramphenicol for 12 h at 
37°C. Subsequently, 2% seeds were inoculated into a 24-/96-
well microassay plate containing 2 ml or 0.2 ml of LB medium 
with 34 μg/ml chloramphenicol at 30 °C to monitor cell growth 
in real time through detection at an OD of 600 nm. All 
measurements were performed in triplicate.
3-HP Fermentation
Both shake-flask and fed-batch fermentation were performed 
in different minimal media ( Liu et  al., 2016 ). For shake-flask 
fermentation, a single colony was first cultivated in a 300-mL 
Erlenmeyer flask with 50 ml of modified M9 medium 
supplemented with 34 μg/ml chloramphenicol and 100 μg/ml 
ampicillin sodium at 220 rpm at 37 °C for 12 h. Next, 1 ml of 
preculture was transferred into a 300-mL Erlenmeyer flask 
containing 50 ml of fresh modified M9 medium with 34 μg/
ml chloramphenicol and 100 μg/ml ampicillin sodium at 220 rpm 
at 37 °C. After OD 600 reached 0.6–0.8, the temperature was 
controlled at 30 °C, and 0.2 mM IPTG, 40 mg/L D-biotin, and 
20 mM NaHCO3 were added for 3-HP production.
For fed-batch fermentation, the preculture was transferred 
into fresh modified M9 medium supplemented with 34 μg/ml 
chloramphenicol and 100 μg/ml ampicillin sodium at 220 rpm 
at 37 °C. Subsequently, 5% ( v/v) of the transferred culture was 
inoculated into a 7.5-L bioreactor (Infors HT, Bottmingen, 
Switzerland) containing 4 L of fed-batch fermentation medium. 
The dissolved oxygen level was controlled at ≥30% through 
adjustment of the agitation speed and airflow rate. The pH 
was adjusted to 7.0 by supplying ammonium hydroxide. Glucose 
was added as carbon source with initial 20 g/L, and supplemented 
to 20–40 g/L while lower than 10 g/L. Fed-batch fermentation 
was initially performed at 37 °C, and the temperature was 
downregulated to 30 °C when OD 600 was approximately 15. 
Simultaneously, 0.2 mM IPTG, 40 mg/L D-biotin, and 20 mM 
NaHCO3 were added for 3-HP production. During fermentation, 
D-biotin and NaHCO 3 were supplied every 12 h.
Analytical Methods
OD was measured at 600 nm with a spectrophotometer (Shimazu, 
Japan). Samples were centrifuged at 12,000 rpm for 2 min to 
collect the supernatant. The supernatant was then filtered with 
a 0.22-μm aqueous membrane for the analysis of 3-HP , glucose, 
acetate, and lactate. Glucose, acetate, and lactate levels were 
measured using a high-performance liquid chromatography 
(HPLC) system (Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan) equipped with a 
refractive index detector (RID-10A; Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan) 
and an Aminex HPX-87H ion exclusion column (Bio-Rad

Laboratories, Hercules, CA, United  States); 5 mM H 2SO4 was 
used as the mobile phase at a flow rate of 0.6 ml/min ( Li 
et  al., 2013 ). The HPLC system equipped with a diode array 
detector (SPD-M20A; Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan), with the Aminex 
HPX-87H ion exclusion column applied at 60 °C, was used to 
determine the 3-HP production level. Finally, 0.5 mM H 2SO4 
was used as the mobile phase at a flow rate of 0.4 ml/min. 
Glucose, acetate, lactate, and 3-HP were identified according 
to the retention time of standard samples, and the concentration 
was quantified with the peak area according to the corresponding 
standard curve.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Effect of Acc Expression on 3-HP 
Production
As a key factor in 3-HP production through the malonyl-CoA 
pathway, Acc must be  suitably screened for the catalyzation 
of acetyl-CoA to malonyl-CoA. Cheng et  al. introduced 
C. glutamicum –derived Acc into E. coli  BL21 (DE3) and 
optimized the expression level of Acc and MCR by co-expressing 
Acc with MCR into the sole plasmid. This resulted in the 
production of 3-HP up to 1.08 g/L with a yield of 0.18 g/g 
glucose during flask-shake fermentation ( Cheng et  al., 2016 ); 
however, the yield, productivity, and titer of 3-HP were low. 
Moreover, the effect of the heterologous expression of AccBC 
and DtsR1 on cell growth remains unclear. To explore the 
effect of native and heterologous Acc on 3-HP production, 
we constructed an E. coli BL21 (DE3) strain containing mutated 
MCR (N940V/K1106W/S1114R; Liu et  al., 2016 ) and Acc 
from C. glutamicum . As depicted in Figure  2A , compared 
with the strain with expression of native E. coli –derived Acc 
with 3.43 g/L, the engineered strain with expression of 
heterogenous C. glutamicum –derived Acc had a higher 3-HP 
titer of 4.86 g/L after cultivation at 30 °C for 48 h (3-HP 
retention time at 17.8 min; Supplementary Figure S1 ). In 
addition, the cell growth was similar with 3-HP production 
(Figure  2A  and Supplementary Figure S2 ). This result 
demonstrated that heterogeneously expressed Acc from 
C. glutamicum  is more suitable than E. coli –derived Acc for 
3-HP production.
Reports have stated that the optimal temperature for mutated 
MCR-C activity is 72 °C ( Liu et  al., 2016 ), and the greatest 
activity of temperature-sensitive AccBC is observable at 30 °C 
(Jäger et  al., 1996 ; Cheng et  al., 2016 ). Thus, we  tested the 
influence of various temperatures (25 °C, 30 °C, and 37 °C) on 
3-HP biosynthesis. The highest 3-HP titer was noted at 30 °C 
rather than at 25 °C or 37 °C. Follow-up experiments were 
performed at 30 °C ( Figure  2B).

Studies have indicated that native Acc overexpression in E. coli 
is toxic to cell growth ( Davis et  al., 2000 ; Zha et  al., 2009 ; Liu 
et  al., 2015); we  verified such growth inhibition using ribosome 
bind site (RBS) and the inducer isopropyl- β-d-thiogalactoside 
(IPTG) at various strengths ( Supplementary Figure S3 ).
To improve 3-HP production, we  systematically analyzed 
the influence of overexpressed C. glutamicum–derived Acc on 
cell growth in E. coli BL21 (DE3). First, the effect of expressed 
DtsR1 or AccBC on cell growth was assessed. Compared with 
the control without expression of DtsR1 or AccBC, both subunits 
were demonstrably beneficial for cell growth, especially DtsR1 
(Figure 3A). To further study the influence of regulated DtsR1 
and AccBC on cell growth, the two subunits were expressed

(shaken at 220 rpm for 48 h). Cultures were induced with 0.2 mM IPTG when OD600 reached 0.6–0.8. All results were calculated with three (n = 3) independent 
replicates.

FIGURE 4 |  Modified expression of DtsR1 and AccBC and their influence on cell growth in Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3). The adjusted DtsR1 and AccBC expression 
is listed as three levels according to RBS strength: DtsR1 < AccBC, DtsR1 > AccBC, and DtsR1 = AccBC. Strain containing empty vector without Acc expression 
was the control. The strength of RBS was calculated with the ratio of RFP/OD600: 65,116 (B0030), 46,388 (AR), and 36,515 (B0034). All results were calculated with 
three (n = 3) independent replicates.
in the same plasmid with varying strengths of RBS. Finally, 
RBSs with different TIR (Translation Initiation Rates), B0030 
(65116), AR (46388), and B0034 (36515), respectively, were 
selected through real-time measurement of the ratio of normalized 
red fluorescence intensity to cell density (Figure 3B). Accordingly, 
the strains containing various combinations and levels of AccBC 
and DtsR1 expression were formed ( Figure  4). The results 
indicated that, compared with the control, different combinations 
of DtsR1 and AccBC expression levels induce various effects 
on cell growth. For cells with the expression of AccBC was 
higher than that of DtsR1, strain W-3430 with high expression 
level of AccBC grew better than W-34AR with weak expression 
of AccBC. Similarly, a higher expression level of DtsR1 than 
that of AccBC lead to increased strains growths compared 
with that of W-AR34 due to the stronger DtsR1 expression 
(Figure 4). Other experiments on DtsR1 and AccBC combinations 
yielded similar results (Supplementary Figure S4). In conclusion, 
C. glutamicum–derived Acc can promote cell growth by regulating 
the expression levels of DtsR1 and AccBC, which may 
be  beneficial for 3-HP production.

The Effect of Regulated AccBC and DtsR1 
on 3-HP Production
To verify the influence of 3-HP synthesis through the modification 
of DtsR1 and AccBC expression levels, we  constructed a series 
of strains containing DtsR1 and AccBC of various expression 
levels by fusing together different strengths of RBS in a producing 
strain Q2098 ( Figure  5). Strain on a high level of AccBC 
(Q-3430) was beneficial for 3-HP accumulation and cell growth 
under the condition of AccBC expression stronger than DtsR1 
(Figure  5A). Similarly, when the level of DtsR1 was higher 
than that of AccBC, 3-HP production and cell growth were 
simultaneously promoted in strain Q-3034 with a high level 
of DtsR1 ( Figure  5B). When the expression level of DtsR1 
and AccBC were the same, 3-HP production with Q-3434 
(6.8 g/L) was higher than that with Q-3030 (4.7 g/L; Figure 5C). 
A study revealed that Acc activity is controlled through 
biotinylation by AccBC because it is a biotin-dependent 
carboxylase (Shi et al., 2014 ). DtsR1 can transfer carboxyl from 
BCCP-biotin into acetyl-CoA to form malonyl-CoA. Intracellular 
accumulation of acetyl-CoA and malonyl-CoA is tightly related 
to cell growth due to the key nodes through the connection 
with many pathways to regulate cell survival and biochemical 
synthesis ( Chang et  al., 1999 ; Zha et  al., 2009 ; Krivoruchko 
et  al., 2015 ; Shi and Tu, 2015 ). Therefore, the appropriate 
adjustment of catalyzing acetyl-CoA to malonyl-CoA can 
promoted 3-HP production and cell growth through the 
modulation between levels of DtsR1 and AccBC. These results 
indicated that 3-HP production is closely related to the 
modification of DtsR1 and AccBC expression levels. Robust 
cell host result in the improved 3-HP titer. Previous studies 
have successfully increased the production of malonyl-CoA-
derived chemical compounds by using Acc overexpression 
(Miyahisa et al., 2005; Leonard et al., 2007; Wattanachaisaereekul 
et  al., 2008). In this study, a high-efficiency strain Q-3434 was 
successfully constructed by adjusting the expression of DtsR1 
and AccBC, leading to the production of 6.8 g/L of 3-HP . Therefore, 
3-HP production through the malonyl-CoA pathway can 
be  increased by adjusting the expression of DtsR1 and AccBC.

Achieving a Balance Between Acc and 
MCR to Improve 3-HP Production
The catalysis efficiency of MCR improves through the attainment 
of a balance between the two separated fragments of MCR including 
mutated MCR-C and MCR-N, which reached a concentration of 
3.72 g/L during shake-flask fermentation (Liu et al., 2016). However, 
the balance of Acc and MCR for 3-HP production had not been 
studied. In this study, the relationship of expressed Acc and MCR 
was investigated by fusing four strengths of RBS (high-B0030, 
medium-AR, weak-B0034, and weaker-B0064) with Acc expressing. 
Mutated MCR-C was expressed in another plasmid. These two 
plasmids were co-transformed into strain Q2098, an E. coli BL21 
(DE3) integrated MCR-N, for 3-HP production. Compared with 
the high, medium and weaker expression levels of Acc, the weak 
level of Acc in strain Q-3434 achieved the highest titer of 6.8 g/L, 
yield of 0.566 g/g glucose, and productivity of 0.13 g/L/h during 
shake-flask fermentation through the malonyl-CoA pathway 
(Figure  6; Table  2). Additionally, Q-3434 produced less acetate 
and more lactate, which may be attributable to the efficient catalysis 
of acetyl-CoA to Malonyl-CoA with Acc as well as the increased 
glycolytic pathway (Supplementary Figure S5). Therefore, achieving 
a balance between Acc and MCR expression levels is vital for 
enhancing 3-HP production.
Fed-Batch Fermentation
To further verify the properties of Q-3434 for 3-HP 
production, we  amplified the fermentation scale through 
fed-batch fermentation in a 7.5-L bioreactor. The cell density, 
3-HP titer, glucose consumption levels, and by-products 
(acetate and lactate) are depicted ( Figure 7 ). Following 37 h 
FIGURE 7 |  The fed-batch process with Q-3434 in a 7.5-L bioreactor. 
Biomass, glucose consumption, and 3-HP accumulation were monitored in 
real time.

of cultivation, 38.13 g/L 3-HP was obtained, with a productivity 
and yield of 1.03 g/L/h and 0.246 g/g glucose concentration, 
respectively. After 37 h of incubation, unfavorable growth 
conditions and irreparable cellular damage lead to a death 
phase and long-term stationary phase ( Finkel, 2006 ), resulting 
in the lose viability of 3-HP production and glucose 
consumption. The maximization of productivity, yield, and 
titer is crucial for achieving large-scale industrial production 
with high cost efficiency ( Wendisch, 2020 ). Although studies 
had achieved a high titer (40.6 g/L of 3-HP) through the 
malonyl-CoA pathway, the actual yield (0.19 g/g glucose) 
has been much lower than the theoretical yield (1 g/g glucose), 
and the productivity (0.56 g/L/h) has been lower than that 
of other biochemicals ( Li et  al., 2013 ; Liu et  al., 2016 , 
2019a; Meadows et  al., 2016 ; Félix et  al., 2019 ; Hao et  al., 
2020). In contrast to the results of other reports, Q-3434 
achieved the highest productivity under a high yield and 
tier with cheap glucose as the sole carbon source ( Table  2). 
Therefore, with respect to the three major parameters in 
industrial production, Q-3434 possesses substantial 3-HP 
production ability.
CONCLUSION
Acc is the rate-limiting step for malonyl-CoA-derived metabolite 
production. However, the toxicity of overexpressed Acc for 
cell growth is the bottleneck to constructing an efficient 
microbial cell factory. Here, for the first time, we demonstrated 
that cell growth can be  accelerated through the adjustment 
of the expression of two subunits (DtsR1 and AccBC) of 
C. glutamicum –derived Acc, which can be  used to increase 
3-HP production. Finally, Q-3434 was constructed through 
balancing Acc and MCR expression levels. In comparison with 
current reports, Q-3434 achieved a highest titer of 6.8 g/L and 
productivity of 1.03 g/L/h of 3-HP during shake-flask and 
fed-batch fermentation, respectively, with cheap glucose as the 
sole carbon source. Moreover, since Acc is the rate-limiting 
step for accumulating intracellular malonyl-CoA concentrations, 
this strategy might can be  used to increase the chemical 
compound production of other malonyl-CoA-derivatives.
