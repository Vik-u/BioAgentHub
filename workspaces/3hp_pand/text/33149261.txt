novel transporter YohJK renders 
3‑hydroxypropionate tolerance 
in Escherichia coli

Previously, we have reported that 3‑hydroxypropionate (3‑HP) tolerance in Escherichia coli W is 
improved by deletion of yieP, a less‑studied transcription factor. Here, through systems analyses along 
with physiological and functional studies, we suggest that the yieP deletion improves 3‑HP tolerance 
by upregulation of yohJK, encoding putative 3‑HP transporter(s). The tolerance improvement by yieP 
deletion was highly specific to 3‑HP , among various C2–C4 organic acids. Mapping of YieP binding sites 
(ChIP‑exo) coupled with transcriptomic profiling (RNA‑seq) advocated seven potential genes/operons 
for further functional analysis. Among them, the yohJK operon, encoding for novel transmembrane 
proteins, was the most responsible for the improved 3‑HP tolerance; deletion of yohJK reduced 
3‑HP tolerance regardless of yieP deletion, and their subsequent complementation fully restored 
the tolerance in both the wild‑type and yieP deletion mutant. When determined by 3‑HP‑responsive 
biosensor, a drastic reduction of intracellular 3‑HP was observed upon yieP deletion or yohJK 
overexpression, suggesting that yohJK encodes for novel 3‑HP exporter(s).
3-Hydroxypropionic acid (3-HP), a three-carbon carboxylic acid, is an industrially relevant platform chemical. 
It can be converted to numerous value-added compounds such as acrylate, acrylamide, 1,3-propanediol, and 
malonic  acid
1. Chemical synthesis methods of 3-HP have been established, but they are costly and involve toxic 
 intermediates2. Recently, environmentally-friendly biological methods have been developed, which use various 
microorganisms as recombinant host, including Escherichia coli, Synechococcus elongatus, Pseudomonas denitrifi-
cans, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Corynebacterium glutamicum3–9. Among them, E. coli 
has been extensively studied due to its rich genomic, physiological, and phenotypic information and availability 
of well-established genetic tool  box
10,11. However, the growth of E. coli strains, even the most tolerant E. coli W,  
is severely inhibited by 3-HP at > 300 mM, a level far lower than the industrially desirable 1.0  M12,13.
Toxic effect of short-chain aliphatic acids like 3-HP appears mostly upon their entry into the cytoplasm 
and/or intracellular production (Supplementary Fig. S1). Once entering or being produced inside the cell, acid 
molecules dissociate into protons  (H
+) and anions owing to the near-neutral pH of cytoplasm and its high salt 
 concentration14. Complicated toxic effects caused by  H+, anions and/or reaction intermediates of the acid do 
appear inside cell (Supplementary Fig. S1). Cellular responses to acids and/or low medium pH have been exten-
sively studied in enterobacteria, particularly E. coli. These responses can be divided into ‘general’ and ‘specific’ 
acid-resistance, respectively. Altering of cell-membrane components or its structure, removing  H
+, restoring 
anion imbalance, etc. can be considered as ‘general’ responses, whereas anions-specific counteractions such as 
acceleration of cellular metabolisms to remove specific anions and their metabolites into non-toxic products 
can be classified as ‘specific’  responses
8,15–17. In the general responses, up-regulation of the proton-consuming 
mechanism, such as glutamic-, arginine-, lysine-, and/or ornithine-dependent acid resistance, has been well 
 documented
15,18–20. Up-regulation of SOS responses and chaperons expression have also been well  studied21,22. 
However, the ‘anion-specific’ acid-resistant mechanisms have been much less studied. In the case of 3-HP , muta-
tion of SFA1, which encodes S -(hydroxymethyl)glutathione dehydrogenase in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevi -
siae, is known to reduce the toxic effect of 3-HP , because the mutation improves removal of the highly reactive

intermediate 3-hydroxypropionaldehyde (3-HPA) 8. In the same context, the up-regulation of frmB, the SFA1  
ortholog, has also been noted when E. coli is growing in the presence of 3-HP23.
There have been several attempts to improve tolerance against organic acids. For example, for improved 
3-HP tolerance in E. coli, a complex nitrogen source like yeast extract, mixture of several amino acids including 
methionine, threonine, and aromatic amino acids, and/or their biosynthetic intermediates, was added into the 
culture  medium24. Up-regulation of biosynthetic pathways for several amino acids has also known to improve 
tolerance against 3-HP24. The so-called ‘adaptive laboratory evolution’ (ALE), repeated exposure of a microorgan-
ism to a target acid with an increasing concentration and selecting the fast-growing cell(s), is also a routine and 
popular  practice
8,25,26. In a recent study, by ALE, we isolated a highly 3-HP-tolerant E. coli W  strain27. The strain 
contained 13 point-mutations, including alterations in glpK and yieP, and could grow in the presence of 800 mM 
3-HP when yeast extract was supplemented to the culture medium. Furthermore, the strain could produce more 
3-HP than its parent counterpart when the mutated glpK gene was reverted to the native form. Interestingly, the 
mutation in one specific gene named yieP, encoding a less-characterized transcriptional  regulator
28, was entirely 
responsible for the improved 3-HP tolerance. When the yieP gene was deleted, both the wild-type and the evolved 
strains exhibited the same tolerance to 3-HP; and when the native yieP  was re-expressed, both the strains lost 
their tolerance. Although the transcriptional binding-sites of YieP was  reported28, the cellular mechanism how 
the yieP deletion confers 3-HP tolerance has not been elucidated.
This study aims to investigate the 3-HP tolerance mechanism acquired by deletion of the global regulator 
encoded by yieP. Specificity of 3-HP tolerance by ΔyieP, genome-wide transcription profiles in response to the 
yieP deletion, and systems-level YieP binding landscape were investigated to select and identify genes/operons 
responsible for the improved 3-HP tolerance. Deletion and subsequent complementation of the selected targets 
were also conducted to confirm their physiological roles. This study suggests the presence of putative 3-HP 
exporter(s) encoded by yohJK, the upregulation of which is resulted by ΔyieP and renders 3-HP tolerance in E. 
coli.
Results
Tolerance improvement by yieP deletion is highly specific to 3‑HP . To determine the specificity 
of acid-tolerance improvement by yieP  knock-out (i.e., whether the improvement is limited to 3-HP only or 
extended to other organic acids), wild-type E. coli W and its ΔyieP mutant were grown in the presence of C2–C4 
weak organic acids (Fig. 1). Because the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) at which cell growth stops is 
different for each  acid29,30, the range of acid concentration tested was varied as follows: 1–500 mM for 3-HP , 
0–250 mM for acetate, 0–750 mM for lactate, 0–150 mM for propionate, and 0–200 mM for isobutyrate. For 
3-HP , it has been confirmed that yieP deletion effectively improves  tolerance
27; the yieP deletion mutant could

grow up to 500 mM, while the wild-type counterpart stopped its growth at < 400 mM. On the other hand, for 
the rest of the C2–C4 acids, the yieP deletion showed only a marginal or negligible improvement of tolerance. In 
another experiment, we added yeast extract (YE) at 0.5 g/L to the culture medium to examine whether 3-HP tol-
erance conferred by yieP deletion is masked by YE (Supplementary Fig. S2). Y east extract significantly improved 
the tolerance in both the wild-type and ΔyieP  mutant strains. However, the ΔyieP mutant still grew better than 
the wild-type in the presence of 3-HP , and the difference became more significant as the 3-HP concentration 
increased. In summary, the deletion of yieP  increased the tolerance specifically against 3-HP , regardless of the 
presence of yeast extract in the culture medium.
Transcriptome analysis reveals possible 3‑HP tolerance mechanisms. To identify the genes and 
operons affected by the yieP  deletion and to obtain insight into the possible molecular mechanisms behind 
the improved 3-HP tolerance, genome-wide transcriptomic analyses were performed for both the wild-type 
and ΔyieP mutant of E. coli W during the growth in M9 minimal medium (Supplementary Fig. S3). The effect 
of yieP deletion and 3-HP addition was elucidated by comparing the gene expression profiles among WΔ( +), 
W( +), WΔ(−) and W(−) (note that WΔ and W represent the mutant E. coli W ΔyieP  and wild-type E. coli W,  
respectively; ‘ + ’ and ‘−’ in the parentheses indicate the presence and absence of 100 mM of 3-HP in the culture 
medium, respectively). When cells were cultured in the absence of 3-HP , expression of 279 genes (5.3% of total 
genes) was significantly altered by the yieP  deletion  (log
2(fold change) > 1 and p value < 0.05). The number of 
alterations was 1.5-times higher when 3-HP was present in the culture medium (411 genes, 7.8% of total genes). 
Comparison between W( +) and W(−), showed differential expression in a total of 676 genes (13.0%), out of 
5195 genes; among which, 274 genes (5.3%) were up-regulated while 402 genes (7.1%) were down-regulated 
(Supplementary Fig. S3). On the other hand, the comparison between WΔ( +) and WΔ(−) showed differential 
expression in a total of 442 genes (8.4%); 215 genes (4.1%) were up-regulated, while 227 genes (4.4%) were 
down-regulated (Supplementary Fig.  S3). Hierarchical clustering of differentially expressed genes from the 
RNA-seq revealed that the transcriptomic variation by removal of yieP was more significant than that by 3-HP 
supplementation (Supplementary Fig. S3).
Although the yieP deletion is highly specific to 3-HP , the ‘general’ acid-resistance mechanisms should appear 
because 3-HP is an acid. Additionally, the general acid-resistance mechanisms should contribute to 3-HP toler-
ance to a certain extent in the yieP deletion mutant. Therefore, genes known to be related with the general acid-
resistance responses were analyzed in the following four categories: (1) acid transport (reduction of influx and 
activation of efflux); (2) proton removal; (3) maintenance of integrity/activity of proteins, and nucleic acids; and, 
(4) electron transport chain (Fig. 2 and Supplementary Fig. S4). In the yieP deletion strain, the expression levels 
of cfa (cyclopropane fatty acyl phospholipid synthase) and ompF (outer-membrane porin F) were up-regulated 
upon 3-HP addition. On the other hand and contrary to our expectation, the primary glutamate-dependent 
acid-resistant (GDAR) system, including transcription regulator gadE and its regulon genes gadA  and gadBC, 
showed reduced RNA levels in the yieP deletion strain. However, the transcription factor adiY for the arginine-
dependent response system (ADAR) was significantly up-regulated (12.3-fold). The hchA  gene encoding the

Hsp31 molecular chaperone for protein stabilization was also significantly up-regulated in ΔyieP  mutant. A 
similar up-regulation was also observed for cydX which encodes for cytochrome bd-I ubiquinol oxidase subunit, 
a gene involved in the electron transport chain. In summary, many genes responsible for ‘general’ acid-resistant 
mechanism were up-regulated by yieP deletion, except GDAR genes which were down-regulated.
For the ‘3-HP-specific’ or ‘anion-specific’ resistance  mechanisms31, expression of aldehyde dehydrogenases 
and glutathione (GSH)-dependent dehydrogenases was examined (Fig. 2). In the ΔyieP mutant, among a total of 
18 genes encoding (putative) aldehyde dehydrogenases, 7 genes were up-regulated whereas 11 other genes were 
down-regulated. It is noted that the frmRAB operon, known to be associated with a glutathione (GSH)-dependent 
detoxification mechanism and reported to be up-regulated by 3-HP in a previous  study
23, was up-regulated by 
2.90-fold by ΔyieP. To identify other possible ‘3-HP-specific’ resistance mechanisms, the genes with unknown 
functions but showing highly differential expression were further screened and scrutinized. Two operons, ykgEFG 
and yohJK, drew our attention because of a significant up-regulation (~  tenfold) by the yieP deletion. The yieP 
gene is a less-characterized transcription factor; thus, functionally-unknown genes can be highly relevant.
ChIP‑exo enables systems‑level reconstruction of YieP regulatory network. RNA-seq analysis 
identified the genes and operons that were affected by 3-HP and yieP deletion, but they were too many for func-
tional studies. Another useful genome-wide tool for identification of genes/operons regulated by a transcription 
factor such as YieP , is the ChIP-exo  analysis
32,33. According to a recent ChIP-exo study on E. coli K-12 MG1655, 
there exist ~ 23 binding sites for  YieP28. Here, we attempted to analyze YieP regulon in E. coli W by comparing 
ChIP-exo data and RNA-seq data. Note that the ChIP-exo data for E. coli MG1655 was used instead of that for E. 
coli W . The reason for that is because E. coli K-12 MG1655 has the most comprehensive knowledge on the tran-
scriptional regulatory network, and ChIP-exo experimental protocol, ready to be used, was set up for that par -
ticular strain. On the other hand, genomic comparison showed that these two strains shared over 84.1% of the 
genes (Supplementary Fig. S5) and, more importantly, they had the same sequences for all the YieP target sites.
The ChIP-exo analysis for E. coli K-12 MG1655 with the addition of 3-HP revealed 33 YieP binding sites on 
the genome-scale (Fig. 3A). Among them, 12 binding sites were located in the intragenic regions, and 21 were in 
the intergenic regions. Integration of the identified binding sites by ChIP-exo, transcriptomic profiling by RNA-
seq and operon structures known thus  far
34,35 revealed the presence of 33 transcriptional units (TUs) regulated 
by YieP , which contain a total of 59 genes. A sequence-motif analysis of the YieP binding sites showed the pres-
ence of a palindromic sequence: atTTGTaTGAcaAAT (capital characters indicating information content > 1 bit) 
(Fig. 3B). This palindromic sequence motif suggests that YieP might work as a dimeric conformation. Among 
the 59 genes belonging to the 33 YieP regulons, a total of 33 target genes were up-regulated, and the remaining 
26 were down-regulated (Fig. 3D). Notably, six genes (ykgEFG, yohJK, and adiY) in 3 TUs were down-regulated 
by YieP with high-log 2(fold change) as: < 4.8, 5.4, and 2.2-fold, respectively. This regulatory mode of YieP is 
consistent with the previous  study28.

To minimize and finalize the list of genes for detailed functional studies, the 676 target genes suggested by the 
RNA-seq and 59 target genes indicated by the ChIP-exo analysis, respectively, were further curated. Five catego-
ries, individually or in combinations, were looked into for this purpose, as follows (Supplementary Fig. S6): (1) 
difference between E. coli W and E. coli BL21(DE3) (notice that, according to our previous  study
27, BL21(DE3) 
did not show tolerance improvement by the yieP  deletion), (2) high-fold change in gene expression caused by 
the yieP deletion, (3) general acid-resistance mechanisms, (4) genes for membrane synthesis, and (5) genes with 
unknown functions. For the first category, the DNA sequences of TUs which are presumably under the control 
of YieP in E. coli BL21(DE3) and E. coli W or E. coli K-12 MG1655 were compared, and the 2 operons, ykgEFG, 
and sdaCB, were chosen due to the difference in their promoter sequences (Supplementary Fig. S7). In the sec-
ond category, for the highly up-regulated (~ tenfold) genes resulted by the yieP deletion, three operons, ykgEFG, 
yohJK and adiY, were chosen. In the third category, for the general acid-resistant genes, gadX and adiY , which 
are known to be complicated acid-resistant regulatory proteins, were  selected
15,18. In the fourth category, the 
rydC gene, encoding a small RNA and known to be related to the biosynthesis of putative transporters and curli, 
was  chosen36. Finally, in the fifth category, the ydcA gene, the function of which is unknown, was selected. The 
ykgEFG and yohJK can also be classified as the fifth category, although chosen in the second category. Altogether, 
a total of 11 genes in 7 operons were selected as prospective candidates for further investigation.
Transcription of YieP target genes varies in multiple E. coli strains. Knock-out of yieP improved 
3-HP tolerance in several E. coli strains, including E. coli W,  E. coli K-12 MG1655, E. coli K-12 W3110, and E. coli 
B, but not in E. coli BL21(DE3)27. It was postulated that the phenotypic difference of E. coli BL21(DE3) might be 
originated from differential gene expression of the YieP regulons. For clarification of this hypothesis, functional 
analyses of the 11 target genes with their deletion and over-expression are needed, which is time-consuming 
and laborious. Therefore, before the functional analyses, the selected target genes were examined by RT-qPCR 
experiments in the three E. coli strains, W , K-12 MG1655, and BL21(DE3), and their three corresponding ΔyieP 
mutants, respectively. Ten genes among the 11, except for rydC the length of which is too short (64 bp), were ana-
lyzed (Fig. 4). For E. coli W , RT-PCR analysis showed a good correlation with FPKM values from the RNA-seq 
analysis (correlation coefficient was 0.71) (Supplementary Fig. S8). Among the 10 target genes, the two operons 
ykgEFG and yohJK exhibited a highly enhanced transcription by yieP deletion, regardless of 3-HP . However, in E. 
coli BL21(DE3), the fold change of these two operons was much lower (~ 2.5-fold) than in the other E. coli strains 
(~ 6 to 10-fold). The adiY  gene, a transcription regulator for the arginine-dependent acid-resistant (ADAR) 
system, was up-regulated by ~ twofold in all of the ΔyieP  mutants, unlike the corresponding wild-type strains. 
Expression of the regulator related to the glutamate-dependent acid-resistant system, gadX, was not affected by 
the yieP deletion, but the addition of 3-HP to the culture medium up-regulated its transcription level as high

as sixfold in E. coli W and E. coli K-12 MG1655. Transcription of the remaining genes (ydcA  and sdaCB) was 
not affected by the yieP deletion. These results expand our knowledge on the regulatory role of yieP from E. coli 
W to other E. coli strains, especially by demonstrating that YieP down-regulates expression of multiple genes, 
including ykgEFG, yohJK, and adiY. These genes are expected to play important roles in linking ΔyieP genotype 
to 3-HP tolerant phenotype.
yohJK operon, a member of the YieP regulon, is essential for ‘3‑HP‑specific’ tolerance. In 
order to evaluate functional importance, six operons (rydC , ydcA, gadX, adiY, ykgEFG, and yohJK, except 
sdaCB) were subjected to deletion experiments. Two series of deletion mutants were developed: the first from the 
wild-type E. coli W , and the second from its ΔyieP mutant, respectively (Supplementary Table S1). The growth of 
these mutants (12 strains in total) was examined in the modified M9 minimal medium (Fig. 5A,B). When 3-HP 
was absent, the mutations did not disturb cell growth for either the wild-type (for yieP ) strains or their ΔyieP  
mutants. However, when 3-HP (300 mM) was added, the growth of the three mutants in the first series (ydcA , 
adiY, and yohJK), developed from the wild-type E. coli W , was severely reduced (Fig.  5A). On the other hand, 
in the second series of mutants, those developed from the ΔyieP  mutant, 3-HP toxic effect was much reduced: 
entirely in the case of the ydcA and adiY mutants, and partially in the case of the yohJK mutant (Fig. 5B).
Because the yohJK deletion overrides the yieP  deletion in showing 3-HP tolerance, overexpression of yohJK 
on 3-HP tolerance was also investigated (Fig. 6). The yohJK genes were cloned into the low-copy pACYC plasmid 
under the tetracycline-inducible promoter (P
tet). The expression of yohJK was induced (by adding 200 ng/mL 
of anhydrotetracycline) for one hour before adding 300 mM 3-HP . With overexpression of yohJK (designated 
yohJK
++), the wild-type E. coli  W exhibited an improved tolerance to 3-HP (Fig.  6). This indicates that the 
overexpression of yohJK alone, without the yieP deletion, can confer 3-HP tolerance to E. coli  W . However, the 
tolerance level in the yieP  deletion mutant was not further enhanced by overexpression of yohJK (Supplemen -
tary Fig. S10). The role of yohJK was also confirmed by complementary expression of yohJK in both E. coli W 
ΔyohJK and E. coli W ΔyiePΔyohJK: both the strains exhibited similar tolerance to 3-HP as E. coli W yohJK
++. 
Interestingly enough, over-expression of yohJK improved the 3-HP tolerance in E. coli BL21(DE3), which did 
not show improvement at all by the deletion of yieP . It is likely that the lower up-regulation of yohJK in E. coli 
BL21(DE3) (~ 2.5 fold) than in other E. coli strains (~ 6 to 10-fold) is responsible for not acquiring 3-HP toler-
ance by the yieP  deletion in the former strain. It will be interesting to overexpress yohJK  in other microbes in 
order to improve their tolerance to 3-HP .
yohJK operon encodes for 3‑HP transporter in E. coli W. The results of this study thus far strongly 
suggest that the improvement of 3-HP tolerance caused by the yieP deletion is mostly mediated by the up-regu-
lation of yohJK. However, the exact mechanism behind the tolerance improvement remains elusive. According to 
EcoCyc, yohJ and yohK are predicted to be inner-membrane proteins with four and six transmembrane domains, 
 respectively
37,38, suggesting that the protein(s) are transporter(s) for 3-HP . To study their physiological roles, 
we measured intracellular 3-HP concentration by 3-HP responsive biosensor. The biosensor module employs 
a LysR-type transcription factor (MmsR) which is specifically activated by 3-HP and induces the expression 
of green fluorescence protein (GFP) under the control of  P
mmsA  promoter39 (Supplementary Fig. S11 and S12). 
Because the one (BS-P) previously reported was not sensitive in E. coli, a new biosensor module (BS-E) having 
a higher expression of MmsR was constructed (see Materials and Method). When tested in the modified M9 
minimal medium, the strain with the new BS-E module gave ~ threefold higher GFP signal than the one with its 
predecessor BS-P . Both BS-P and BS-E showed increased GFP intensity up to 25 mM 3-HP in a dose-dependent 
manner.
The new biosensor module (BS-E) was introduced into five E. coli W strains such as wild type, two sin-
gle deletion mutants for each of yieP  and yohJK, a double deletion mutant for both yieP  and yohJK, and an 
yohJK-overexpressed strain ( yohJK++), and the GFP signals were compared among the five strains in varying 
3-HP concentrations (from 0 to 25 mM). The GFP intensity was determined 6 h after inoculation (Fig.  7). The 
intensity increased in the following order (notably, up to 10 mM 3-HP): yohJK ++  ≤ ΔyieP < W (wild-type) <  
ΔyiePΔyohJK ≤ ΔyohJK. It is noticed that the yieP deletion mutant (where yohJK is upregulated according to 
RT-PCR shown in Fig.  4) and the yohJK-overexpressed strain (yohJK ++), showed a dramatically reduced GFP 
intensity compared to that of the wild type. On the other hand, the yohJK deletion in both wild-type and ΔyieP 
mutant substantially increased the GFP signal. These results indicate that the intracellular 3-HP concentra-
tion is significantly reduced when yieP  is deleted or yohJK is overexpressed, and support our hypothesis that 
the physiological function of the yohJK  genes is involved with the excretion or removal of 3-HP from the cell. 
Because yohJK encode for integral transmembrane proteins and their overexpression reduces intracellular 3-HP 
concentration greatly, the protein(s) is likely a novel 3-HP exporter.
Discussion
We wanted to study the mechanism how the yieP deletion improves 3-HP tolerance and use the information to 
develop better 3-HP tolerant strains. Without knowing the physiological functions of YieP , the first thing that 
should be done was screening the candidate genes and operons affected by YieP or its deletion. Although YieP 
was suggested as a transcription  factor
28, the possibility to conduct other physiological functions was not fully 
eliminated a priori. The specificity experiment with different organic acids was conducted as the first step to 
search the uncovered mechanism(s), and it was found that the effect of the yieP  deletion was highly specific to 
3-HP . Consequently, the ‘3-HP specific’ mechanism was targeted for further investigations (Fig. 1).
The combination of transcriptomics, mapping of transcriptional binding sites, genomics, and physiological 
study was an efficient approach for elucidation the role of yieP deletion. Genome-wide transcriptomic profiling

and ChIP-exo analyses are useful when a global regulator is studied for its  function28. In this study, these two, 
genome-wide approaches significantly narrowed down the number of candidates from the initial 411 genes to 
59 genes (Fig. 3). Comparison of genomic sequences (Supplementary Fig. S7) and/or transcription levels (Fig. 4) 
between E. coli BL21(DE3), that was insensitive to the yieP  deletion, and other E. coli strains also helped the 
selection of target genes. Through all these sequential efforts (Supplementary Fig. S6), the number of operons to 
be studied could be minimized to six (rydC , ydcA, gadX, adiY, ykgEFG, and yohJK) for the functional analyses, 
i.e., knockout and/or overexpression experiments.
According to functional analyses, the deletion of ydcA or adiY made cells sensitive to 3-HP , but the sensitiv-
ity was overridden by the yieP  deletion completely (Fig.  5). The positive transcriptional factor, adiY , has been

suggested to regulate both the arginine- and glutamate-dependent acid-resistant  systems40. Similarly, the ydcA 
protein has also known to be related with acid-resistance. It was reported that the expression of ydcA , under 
the control of Y dcI, was up-regulated in acidic condition (pH 5.0) (Supplementary Fig. S9) 28,41. However, the 
involvement of AdiY and Y dcA in 3-HP tolerance is not clear. The deletion of yohJK also made cells sensitive 
to 3-HP and, furthermore, the sensitivity was not overridden by the yieP  deletion, differently from the ydcA or 
adiY deletion (Fig. 5). In addition, the overexpression of yohJK without yieP  deletion could improve the 3-HP 
tolerance as much as the yieP deletion (Supplementary Figs. S6 and S10). This indicates the effect of yieP deletion 
on 3-HP tolerance, in a large extent, is mediated by the yohJK overexpression. The function of yohJ  and yohK 
in E. coli has not been revealed previously, but according to EcoCyc, yohJ and yohK, both are inner-membrane 
proteins with four and six transmembrane domains,  respectively37. Further study using biosensor revealed that 
the up-regulation of yohJK significantly reduces intracellular 3-HP concentration while their deletion increases 
its level, strongly suggesting they encodes for 3-HP-specific exporter(s) (Fig.  7). If Y ohJK is a 3-HP-specific 
transporter, it is understandable why the yohJK overexpression, either indirectly by yieP deletion or directly by its 
episomal expression, has specifically improved 3-HP tolerance. Thus far, no 3-HP-specific transporter has been 
reported, and further, no functional study on Y ohJK has been conducted. More studies to understand how Y ohJK 
work, i.e., whether both Y ohJ and K function together or individually, they are associated with other membrane 
proteins, they utilize energy for 3-HP transport, they can improve 3-HP tolerance in other microorganisms, etc. 
should be followed.
In conclusion, by combined studies of microbial growth, RNA-seq, ChIP-exo and functional analyses of 
genes and operons, we could identify novel membrane proteins Y ohJK which improve 3-HP tolerance in E. coli 
W . Y ohJK efficiently reduced intracellular 3-HP concentration and should be useful in strain development for 
achieving high 3-HP titer. In addition, the procedures described in this manuscript should be useful in identi -
fying genes and operons which are affected by a global regulator, the physiological functions of which has not 
known. Biochemical and physiological aspects of the new putative exporter(s) Y ohJK and their application to 
other microbes are under study.
Methods
Strains, culture conditions, and materials. Escherichia coli W (ATCC 9637) and E. coli K-12 MG1655 
were obtained from Korean Collection for Type Cultures (KCTC, South Korea). E. coli BL21 (DE3) was pur -
chased from Novagen (Darmstadt, Germany). All of the bacterial strains used in this study are listed in Supple-
mentary Table S1. Highly-pure 3-HP sodium salt (> 99%) was provided by Noroo Holdings Ltd, Seoul, Korea. 
Glycerol, lactic acid and propionic acid were acquired from Sigma-Aldrich (MO, USA). All of the other chemi-
cals were purchased from Junsei, Japan.
Bacterial cells were cultured in modified M9 minimal medium with glycerol as the carbon source, unless 
indicated otherwise. The modified M9 minimal medium contains:  MgSO
4·7H2O, 0.25 g/L; NaCl, 1.0 g/L;  NH4Cl, 
0.5 g/L; yeast extract, 0.5 g/L (optional); potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0), 100 mM; and glycerol, 100 mM. 
Cells were cultured aerobically in a 125 mL flask (working medium, 10 mL) at 37 °C at an agitation speed of 
200  rpm
27. Organic acids were prepared as 10 M stock solutions, neutralized by NaOH and added to the culture 
medium as needed. To monitor growth, the bacterial cell density (cell  OD600) was determined at 600 nm by UV/
Vis spectrophotometry (Lambda 265, PerkinElmer, CT, USA). All experiments were conducted in duplicate, the 
results were expressed by means value.
Genome‑wide transcriptome analysis with RNA‑seq. For RNA-seq expression profiling, total RNA, 
including small RNAs, was isolated using the NucleoSpin RNA XS (Macherey–Nagel, Germany). The sequenc-
ing library was prepared by random fragmentation of cDNA samples, followed by 5′ and 3′ adapter ligation using 
TrueSeq stranded mRNA kits (Microbe). Sequencing was performed on a Hiseq 4000 sequencer obtained from 
Marcrogen Inc. (Korea). RNA-seq experiments were performed in biological duplicate.
For the processing of RNA-seq output, sequence reads generated from RNA-seq were mapped onto the refer-
ence genome (NC_017635.1) using Bowtie with the maximum insert size of 1000 bp along with two maximum 
mismatches after trimming 3 bp at 3′   ends
42. SAM files generated from Bowtie were then used for Cufflinks 
(https ://cuffl inks.cbcb.umd.edu) and Cuffdiff to calculate fragments per kilobase of exon per million fragments 
(FPKM) and differential expression, respectively. Cufflinks and Cuffdiff were run using default options with the 
library type of dUTP RNA-seq by the default normalization method (classic-fpkm). From the Cuffdiff output, 
genes showing differential expression with log2-fold change > 1.0 and a p  value < 0.05 were considered as dif-
ferentially expressed genes. Genome-scale data were visualized using MetaScope (https ://sites .googl e.com/view/
syste mskim lab/softw are).
Chromatin immunoprecipitation with exonuclease (ChIP‑exo) to identify YieP binding 
sites. In order to execute ChIP-exo experiments, a multi-Myc-tag peptide sequence was added to the C-ter-
minal of yieP using the λ red-mediated site-specific recombination  system43. The resultant recombinant strain, 
E. coli K-12 MG1655 yieP-8myc, was cultured in fresh M9 minimal medium (100 mM phosphate buffer pH 7.0, 
1 g/L NaCl, 1 g/L  NH4Cl, 2 mM  MgSO4) with 100 mM glycerol as the sole carbon source; 1 mL of trace element 
solution (100X) containing 1 g/L EDTA, 29 mg/L  ZnSO4·7H2O, 198 mg/L  MnCl2·4H2O, 254 mg/L  CoCl2·6H2O, 
13.4 mg/L  CuCl2 and 147 mg/L  CaCl2 was also supplemented to the culture medium. When the effect of 3-HP 
was tested, 100 mM 3-HP was added to the culture medium. The cells were cultured at 37 °C and 200 rpm and 
harvested in the mid-log phase (~ 0.3  OD
600) for further experimentation.
A ChIP-exo experiment was performed following the procedures previously  described33. In brief, to identify 
the in vivo YieP binding map, DNA bound to YieP from formaldehyde-cross-linked E. coli cells was isolated by

chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) with the specific antibodies that specifically recognize Myc-tag (9E10, 
Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Texas, USA) and Dynabeads Pan Mouse IgG magnetic beads (Invitrogen, CA, USA), 
followed by stringent washing as described  previously
34. ChIP materials (chromatin-beads) were used to perform 
on-bead enzymatic reactions of the ChIP-exo  method33,44. Briefly, the sheared DNA of the chromatin-beads was 
repaired by the NEBNext End Repair Module (New England Biolabs, MA, USA) followed by the addition of 
a single dA overhang and ligation of the first adaptor (5′ -phosphorylated) using the dA-Tailing Module (New 
England Biolabs) and the NEBNext Quick Ligation Module (New England Biolabs), respectively. Nick repair 
was performed by using PreCR Repair Mix (New England Biolabs). Lambda exonuclease- and RecJf nuclease-
treated chromatin were eluted from the beads, and overnight incubation at 65 °C reversed the protein-DNA 
cross-link. RNAs- and Proteins-removed DNA samples were used to perform primer extension and second 
adaptor ligation, respectively, with the following modifications. The DNA samples incubated for primer exten-
sion, as described previously, were treated with dA-Tailing Module (New England Biolabs) and NEBNext Quick 
Ligation Module (New England Biolabs) for second adaptor  ligation
33. The DNA sample purified using the 
GeneRead Size Selection Kit (Qiagen) was enriched by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using Phusion High-
Fidelity DNA Polymerase (New England Biolabs). The amplified DNA samples were purified again with the 
GeneRead Size Selection Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) and quantified using the Qubit dsDNA HS Assay Kit 
(Life Technologies). The quality of the DNA sample was checked by running the Agilent High Sensitivity DNA 
Kit using Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent, CA, USA). Sequencing was performed on a Hiseq 4000 sequencer 
at Marcrogen Inc. (Korea). Each modified step was also performed as per the manufacturer’s instructions. The 
ChIP-exo experiments were performed in biological duplicate.
In order to process the ChIP-exo output, ChIP-exo analysis was performed according to the method reported 
 previously
28. The sequence reads of ChIP-exo were mapped onto the reference genome (NC_000913.2) using the 
Bowtie with default options to generate SAM output files. To reduce false-positive peaks, peaks with a signal-
to-noise (S/N) ratio < 1.5 were removed. The noise level was set to the top 5% of signals at genomic positions, 
because the top 5% makes a background level in a plateau, and the top 5% intensities from each of the ChIP-exo 
replicates across conditions correlate well with the total number of reads. Then, each peak was assigned to the 
nearest gene. Genome-scale data were visualized using MetaScope.
A YieP-binding motif analysis was performed using the MEME tool from the MEME software  suite
45. YieP-
binding DNA sequences were extracted from the reference sequence (NC_000913.2). The sequence of each 
binding site was extended by 20 bp at each end to allow for adjacent sequences to be included in the analysis. 
The default setting was used, except for the width parameter, which was fixed to 20 bp.
Homologous recombination for gene disruption. Mutants with multiple knock-outs were well devel-
oped using a method of scarless homologous recombination reported  elsewhere11. In brief, the upstream and 
downstream fragments of a target gene were amplified using PCR, and overlapping PCR was performed to com-
bine the two fragments. The combined fragment was digested with two restriction enzymes XbaI and XhoI, and 
ligated into the pKOV vector. Afterwards, the resulting plasmid was introduced to the E. coli strains and used to 
delete a target gene by homologous  recombination
11. The plasmids for gene deletion and resultant mutants are 
listed in Supplementary Table S1.
Real‑time PCR for quantification of mRNA expression levels. The procedure for measuring mRNA 
level was described  before46. Briefly, E. coli was grown in modified M9 minimal medium until reaching the 
exponential phase. Cells were harvested in RNase-free vials and centrifuged for 10,000 rpm for 10 min to obtain 
the cell pellet. Total RNA was extracted using an RNA isolation kit (Macherey–Nagel, Germany). First-strand 
cDNA was synthesized using a SuperScript III first-strand cDNA synthesis system (Invitrogen, USA). RT-PCR 
was performed by the StepOne real-time PCR system (Applied Biosystems, USA). The thermal cycling condi-
tions were as follows: denaturation, 1 cycle of 95 °C for 30 s; and amplification, 40 cycles of 95 °C for 15 s, 60 °C 
for 30 s, and 72 °C for 30 s. The relative mRNA level was calculated using the ΔC
t method. The housekeeping 
gene rpoD encoding sigma factor 70 was used as a reference.
Overexpression of yohJK operon. The yohJK operon of E. coli W (GenBank: yohJ , ADT75777.1, and 
yohK, ADT75778.1) was cloned into a low-copy-number plasmid pACYC under the tetracycline-inducible pro-
moter. The sequences of the tetracycline promoter and yohJK operon were amplified using PCR, and overlapping 
PCR for combination of the two fragments followed. Afterwards, the overlapped fragment was digested using 
EcoRI and BamHI restriction enzymes and ligated with linearized pACYC to obtain the plasmid pACYC-Ptet-
yohJK. The resultant plasmid was then introduced into E. coli host strains for further experimentation. Kanamy-
cin (Km) at 50 mg/L was added to the culture medium for plasmid maintenance, and 200 ng/mL of anhydrotet-
racycline was used for induction of yohJK.
Development of GFP‑based 3‑HP biosensor for comparison of intracellular 3‑HP in E. coli W 
strains. Briefly, we modified the 3-HP biosensor previously developed for P . denitrificans ATCC 13867 (des-
ignated as BS-P) and applied it for E. coli  W39. The 3-HP inducible promoter (PmmsA) and 10 amino acids of its 
downstream gene (mmsA) from P . denitrificans ATCC 13867 was fused with gfp reporter gene. The mmsR gene, 
encoding for positive transcription factor for P
mmsA promoter, was expressed under the control of IPTG inducible 
promoter T5. All the DNA fragments were assembled using overlapping PCR to make a T5-mmsR_P mmsA-gfp 
cassette. The obtained cassette was digested using BamHI and HindIII restriction enzymes and ligated with lin-
earized pQE80L plasmid (Supplementary Fig. S11). The resulted biosensor module was named as BS-E. Under

the control of 3-HP inducible promoter PmmsA, the expression of GFP is dependent on the levels of intracellular 
3-HP .
Whole‑cell fluorescence assay. In order to compare the level of intracellular 3-HP between E. coli W 
strains, the recombinant strains harboring the plasmid pQE80L_T5-mmsR_P mmsA-gfp were inoculated in the 
modified M9 minimal medium. The inducers such as IPTG and 3-HP were added into the culture medium. 
Samples were taken at 6-h after inoculation for fluorescence and  OD600 measurement. The protocol for GFP 
measurement was described somewhere  else47. Synergy H1 microplate reader (BioTek instruments, USA) using 
486-nm excitation and 535-nm emission filters was used to measure both fluorescence and  OD600. The measured 
fluorescence values were normalized to  OD600 to obtain specific fluorescence (AU/  OD600).
