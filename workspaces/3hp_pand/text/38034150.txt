Abstract
Methylmalonyl coenzyme A (CoA) epimerase (MCE) converts D-methylmalonyl-CoA into L-methylmalonyl
CoA in the final common degradation pathway of valine, isoleucine, methionine, threonine, odd-chain fatty
acids, and cholesterol side chains. Methylmalonyl-CoA epimerase deficiency is an ultra-rare autosomal
recessive disorder where methylmalonic acid, methylcitrate, 3-hydroxypropionate, and propionylcarnitine
are accumulated. We describe two novel pediatric patients and review the previously reported cases of MCE
deficiency.
Including our two novel patients, at least 24 cases of MCE deficiency have been described, with a broad
clinical spectrum ranging from asymptomatic to severely neurologically impaired patients. Our patients are
siblings of Arabic origin who presented with metabolic decompensation with coma and epilepsy during
infancy. Methylmalonic aciduria was disclosed, L-methylmalonyl-CoA mutase deficiency was assumed, and
they were treated accordingly. When first seen in our country, aged 10 and four years, respectively, both
presented severe intellectual disability and spasticity. The younger had an ataxic gait, and the older was
wheelchair-ridden. The study of the 
MMUT
, 
MMAA
, 
MMAB
, and 
MMADHC 
genes was normal. Subsequently,
the pathogenic variant c.139C>T (p.Arg47*) in the
 MCEE
 gene was identified in homozygosity in both
patients, leading to the diagnosis of MCE deficiency (Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM
®
)
251120, McKusick-Nathans Institute of Genetic Medicine, Johns Hopkins University, MD, USA). Most
patients were homozygous for that variant (83% of the alleles). Correct diagnosis allowed treatment
adequacy and genetic counseling.
Methylmalonyl-CoA epimerase deficiency shares a similar biochemical profile with other rare genetic
disorders. Patients present with overlapping clinical features with predominant neurological manifestations;
genetic testing is indispensable for diagnosis. We found no association between genotype and biochemical
and clinical phenotypes.

Introduction
Isolated methylmalonic aciduria (MMAuria) encompasses a group of autosomal recessive propionate
degradation disorders resulting in methylmalonic acid (MMA) accumulation in body fluids. Propionate is
derived from the catabolism of four amino acids (valine, isoleucine, methionine, and threonine), the odd-
chain fatty acids, the side chain of cholesterol, and the metabolism of some species of gut bacteria 
[1]
.
Through the action of propionyl coenzyme A (CoA) carboxylase (PPCA), propionate’s derivative propionyl-
CoA is converted into D-methylmalonyl-CoA, which is then isomerized into L-methylmalonyl-CoA by
methylmalonyl-CoA epimerase (MCE). The L-methylmalonyl-CoA is converted into succinyl-CoA by
methylmalonyl-CoA mutase (MMUT), requiring adenosylcobalamin (AdoCbl), one of the active forms of
vitamin B12, as a co-factor. Subsequently, succinyl-CoA enters the Krebs cycle to generate energy. Isolated
MMAuria is usually caused by MMUT deficiency (Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM®) 251120;
McKusick-Nathans Institute of Genetic Medicine, Johns Hopkins University, MD, USA). Less frequent
disorders of AdoCbl metabolism (complementation groups cobalmin (cbl)A, cblB, and cbl-D variant 2; OMIM
251100, 251000, and 277410, respectively) and MCE deficiency (OMIM 251120) should be considered in the
differential diagnosis

The gene coding for MCE is 
MCEE
 and is located on chromosome 2p13.3 
[3]
. Biallelic mutations in this gene
responsible for MCE deficiency have been reported in at least 22 patients 
[4-14]
. The most common
pathogenic variant, c.139C>T (p.Arg47*), is a nonsense variant, which has been identified in homozygosity
in at least 17 patients 
[4-8,10,11,14]
 and compound heterozygosity with another 
MCEE
 variant in at least
two patients 
[9,12]
. The remaining three MCE cases have three different 
MCEE
 variants in homozygosity
[6,11,13]
.
Common biochemical findings in MCE deficiency are raised urinary excretion of MMA, methylcitrate (MCA),
3-hydroxypropionate (3-HP), and elevation of blood propionylcarnitine (C3), with normal vitamin B12 and
homocysteine levels 
[15]
. Methylmalonyl-CoA epimerase deficiency has a broad clinical spectrum. While
some cases are asymptomatic, others have a neurodevelopmental delay or intellectual disability,
neurodegeneration, acute metabolic decompensations with metabolic acidosis, hyperammonaemia, and
encephalopathy 
[1]
. Here, we describe two new pediatric cases of MCE deficiency with severe intellectual
disability, presenting with acute metabolic decompensation and neurological impairment. We reviewed the
cases published in the English literature for a better characterization of this ultra-rare condition.
Case Presentation
Case report of patient 1
Patient 1 is a male born at term from consanguineous parents of Arabic origin. At one month of age, he
presented with seizures and a coma during a febrile infection. Since then, he has been taking antiseizure
medications. Two more coma episodes with seizures associated with febrile infections occurred in the first
year of life. Subsequently, he developed severe failure to thrive and developmental delays. At five years of
age, high blood levels of C3 and C3:C0 and organic aciduria with increased MMA, MCA, and 3-HP prompted
the diagnosis of MMAuria, so he was treated based on the diagnosis of MMUT deficiency.
His family moved to Portugal when he was 10 years old. At this age, he presented severe intellectual
disability, no verbal language, and very poor social interaction, with Vineland’s adaptative behavior of six
months old. He was wheelchair-ridden, with axial hypotonia and limb spasticity. His gross motor function
classification system (GMFS) was level 5 (transport in a manual wheelchair). He had feeding difficulties and
was malnourished. He was on a protein-restricted diet (~0.7 g/kg/day), with a total energy value (TEV) of ~42
kcal/kg/day, medicated with oral cobalamin, carnitine, metronidazole, and valproic acid. Protein intake and
TEV were increased to ~1.5 g/kg/day and ~80 kcal/kg/day, respectively, which allowed 25% weight gain in
two months. The investigation was consistent with isolated MMAuria (Table 
1
) with an elevation of urinary
MMA, serum MMA, blood C3, and plasma alanine, normal serum levels of vitamin B12, homocysteine, and
prolactin, and low creatinine (43 
μ
mol/L, r.v. 50-70).

; see Appendix A), performed by Next Generation Sequencing (NGS), using MiSeqTM (Illumina
Inc., San Diego, CA, USA) and capture method SureSelectXT HS (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA,
USA), was inconclusive. Subsequently, clinical exome sequencing was performed by NGS, and the variant
c.139C>T (p.Arg47*) was identified in homozygosity, which confirmed the diagnosis of MMAuria due to MCE
deficiency (OMIM 251120).
The patient's urine organic acid profile showed intermittent mild excretion of MMA and MCA, and blood
samples showed persistent elevation of serum MMA (1.08-3.01 
μ
mol/L). The supplementation with vitamin
B12 was stopped. At the age of 11, the EEG showed an encephalopathic background with multifocal
paroxysmal activity. Brain MRI at age 13 showed diffuse cortical and subcortical atrophy, with
frontotemporal predominance (Figure 
1
) and normal spectroscopy. Currently, at 13 years of age, under a

and his head circumference is -2.2 SD. Epilepsy is controlled with valproic acid. He maintains axial
hypotonia, limb spasticity, and severe intellectual disability with complete dependency on activities of daily
living.

Case report of patient 2
Patient 2 is patient 1’s younger brother. Their parents and three older sisters are healthy. Apart from the
brother, there are no other MMAuria or neurodegenerative diseases in the family. Patient 2 was born at term
and presented with a coma and seizures during a febrile infection in the neonatal period. Investigation of
this first episode led to the diagnosis of MMAuria at one month of age. He has been medicated for epilepsy
ever since. Two metabolic decompensation episodes with a coma during febrile infections occurred in the
first year of life. Hyperammonemia was reported in one of those episodes. At 13 months of age, the blood
acylcarnitine profile disclosed an elevation of C3, and the urinary organic acid profile showed increased
values of MMA, MCA, 3-HP, 3-hydroxyisovalerate, and 3-hydroxybutyrate. Epilepsy was controlled with
phenobarbital, and severe neurodevelopmental delays arose. He was submitted to surgery for bilateral
strabismus at four years of age.
He was five years old when his family moved to Portugal. At this age, significant neurodevelopmental delay
with no verbal language and psychomotor agitation was evidenced by Vineland’s adaptative behavior at 9
months old. He presented with moderately generalized spasticity and a spastic gait. His GMFS was level 2
(walks with limitations). He had low weight (-2.3 SD), short stature (-2.7 SD), and microcephaly (-3.2 SD) on
a protein-restricted diet (~0.9 g/kg/day) and a total TEV of ~51 kcal/kg/day. He was medicated with oral
vitamin B12, carnitine, metronidazole, and phenobarbital. Protein intake and TEV were increased to ~1.5
g/kg/day and ~80 kcal/kg/day, respectively. Investigation revealed elevated urine MMA, serum MMA, and
plasma C3 (Table 
2
) and normal plasma amino acid, homocysteine, vitamin B12, prolactin, and creatinine
levels.

the EEG showed an encephalopathic background with paroxysmal occipital activity with left predominance.
Brain MRI at age seven showed a subtle frontal atrophy with left predominance (Figure 
2
). Brain
spectroscopy was normal. Currently, at the age of seven, he has a severe intellectual disability and
significant psychomotor agitation without seizures. He is treated with oral levetiracetam, metronidazole,
carnitine, and a protein-restricted diet (~1 g/kg/day). In the last evaluation, after anorexia and weight loss,
without clinical decompensation or metabolic acidosis, high excretion of MMA in urine and elevated serum
MMA levels persisted.

Patients Homozygous for the c.139C>T (p.Arg47*) Variant (17 Cases From 14 Families)
The first patient with MCE deficiency (patient 3) was described in 2006. He harbored the c.139C>T
(p.Arg47*) variant in homozygosity 
[4]
. Sixteen more patients homozygous for that variant were recognized
[4-8,10,11,14]
. All presented in infancy or childhood with a moderate to high excretion of MMA in urine.
At least two patients (3 and 8) from unrelated families had sepiapterin reductase (SPR) deficiency with
pathogenic variants in the 
SPR
 gene 
[4,8]
. Both presented with predominant motor delay and progressive
dystonia. Two more patients (18 and 19) presented with significant neurological impairment 
[11]
, one with
hypotonia and spasticity and the other with seizures and global psychomotor delay. No information about
the 
SPR
 gene was available.
Metabolic acidosis was disclosed in eight patients in this group. Patient 12 presented with an isolated
cardiomyopathy 
[11]
. Patients 5 and 7 were asymptomatic 
[5,6]
. No clinical information was available for
patients 16 and 17 
[11]
. A single patient had a clinical response to vitamin B12 
[5]
. The other patients were
either unresponsive to vitamin B12 or had no information regarding vitamin B12 supplementation. Protein
restriction in the diet was recorded in patients 3, 5, 9, and 11.
Patients With a c.139C>T (p.Arg47*) Variant in Compound Heterozygosity
At least two patients (10 and 22), compound heterozygous for the most common c.139C>T (p.Arg47*) variant
with a different 
MCEE
 variant, have been described so far 
[9,12]
. Patient 10, reported in 2016, was
heterozygous for the common variant and the intronic variant c.379-644A>G 
[9]
. He presented at five years
of age with metabolic acidosis, transient confusion, and hallucinations during the episode. He had high
MMA, MCA, and 3-HP levels in urine, plasma, and cerebrospinal fluid and elevated serum C3. During follow-
up, a moderate elevation of urinary MMA, MCA, and serum MMA persisted. His fibroblasts were
unresponsive to hydroxocobalamin. Protein restriction was prescribed only during intercurrent illnesses. At
11 years old, he had normal intellectual abilities 
[9]
.
Patient 22, reported in 2019, was 78 years old at diagnosis. He had a medical history of Parkinson’s disease,
two strokes, basal ganglia infarctions in brain MRI, and cognitive deterioration with confusion and
hallucinations. Elevation of serum MMA, a moderate excretion of MMA in urine, and increased plasma
levels of C3 were disclosed. A 'clinical whole genome sequencing' revealed the 
MCEE
 variant c.419delA

Patients Homozygous for Other MCEE Variants
Patient 6, harboring the c.178A>C (p.Lys60Gln) homozygous variant in 
MCEE
, presented at the age of three
years old with spasticity, ataxia, dysarthria, and motor delay, without metabolic acidosis 
[6]
. Patient 20,
homozygous for the 
MCEE 
variant c.158T>G (p.Ile53Arg), presented with seizures following a viral infection
at six months. His psychomotor development was normal. Urinary MMA, MCA, and C3 in the blood were
elevated 
[11]
. Patient 23, homozygous for the 
MCEE
 variant c.296T>C (p.Leu99Pro), presented at seven
months with global psychomotor delay and elevation of MMA and C3. Intramuscular methylcobalamin
decreased C3 and C3/C2 levels; a reduction in urinary MMA was not mentioned 
[13]
.
Discussion
MCE deficiency is an ultra-rare disorder that should be considered in the differential diagnosis of isolated
MMAuria. Raised MMA, MCA, and C3 levels due to MCE deficiency, which impairs the propionate catabolic
pathway in mitochondria, are the biochemical hallmark of the disease. They also occur in MMUT and AdoCbl
deficiencies, which disturb the same metabolic pathway downstream (Figure 
3
). Thus, genetic testing is
indispensable for correct diagnosis in patients with overlapping clinical features and predominant
neurological manifestations. Like MCE, AdoCbl deficiencies (cblA, cblB, and cbl-D-MMA) are rare disorders,
with MMUT deficiency being the less rare and most well-studied disorder. Transient-isolated MMAuria has
also been reported in a few cases with pathogenic variants in
 TCblR/CD320 
[16]
, the gene for cellular uptake
of transcobalamin-bound vitamin B12, detected in neonatal screening in some countries. We did not
investigate this gene.

Biotin and AdoCbl are the co-factors of PPCA and MMUT carboxylase, respectively. There is no known co-factor
for MCE.
AdoCbl: Adenosylcobalamin; PPCA: Propionyl-CoA carboxylase; MMUT: Methylmalonyl-CoA mutase; MCE:
Methylmalonyl-CoA epimerase; CoA: Coenzyme A
We performed a MEDLINE and EMBASE search on July 5, 2023, with the following search terms:
("methylmalonyl-CoA epimerase" OR "methylmalonyl-CoA racemase" OR "MCE deficiency" OR "
MCEE
 gene")
AND (English [Language]). Eleven of the 53 articles found included case reports of patients with MCE
deficiency, for a total of 22 patients with variants in the two alleles of the 
MCEE
 gene 
[4-14]
. Including the
two novel patients presented here, 24 cases of MCE deficiency from 20 unrelated families have been
described (in English). Methylmalonic aciduria was reported in all cases, with highly variable levels
unrelated to clinical severity or genetic diagnosis. Patient 2 had less severe clinical manifestations and
higher urinary and serum AMM than his elder brother (patient 1). Spot MMAuria is highly variable, and 24-
hour urine collection is not accessible in young children or the neurologically impaired 
[17]
. Urine MCA and
blood/plasma C3 levels were also elevated in all the patients reported (10 patients and 13 patients,
2023 Diogo et al. Cureus 15(10): e48017. DOI 10.7759/cureus.48017
7
 of 
11
respectively), including patients 1 and 2.
Like MMUT or AdoCbl deficiencies, metabolic acidosis attacks due to the accumulation of MMA, MCA, and
other organic acids, including lactate and ketone bodies, can occur in MCE-deficient patients. Excessive
protein intake or catabolic periods, such as underlying infection or prolonged fasting, predispose to these
events. Metabolic acidosis was reported in 10 out of 22 patients. The patients we report had several
metabolic crises during febrile infections, mainly in infancy. Although we have no information on patient
1’s laboratory investigation before five years of age, we can assume he also had metabolic acidosis attacks.
Hyperammonaemia, reported in patient 2 (although ammonium levels were unavailable) due to secondary
impairment of the urea cycle, is a common complication in metabolic decompensation episodes of organic
acidurias due to mitochondrial enzyme deficiencies, namely in MMUT deficiency. Interestingly, ammonium
levels were reported only in patient 10 (107 
μ
mol/L) and patient 23 (normal).
Renal involvement is a significant concern in MMUT deficiency due to the toxic effects of MMA and other
accumulated metabolites. Plasma creatinine was documented only in two of the 22 patients previously
reported (Table 
3
). Creatinine may not be the best parameter to evaluate renal function in cases with low
muscle bulk, as we could see in patient 1. Cystatin C might help estimate the glomerular filtration rate in
these patients.
Patients homozygous for the c.139C > T (p.Arg47*) mutation account for 19 of the 24 total known cases
(79%), including 17 patients previously reported and the two siblings here presented. This nonsense variant
creates a truncated protein and is classified as pathogenic in ClinVar. It was first described by Bikker et al. 
[4]
in 2006 as causing mild MMAuria and was soon considered the most frequent cause of "atypical" MMAuria
[6]
. These classifications, i.e., "mild" and "atypical," were probably assigned by comparison with the better-
known MMAuria due to MMUT deficiency. However, MMA (as other metabolites) levels are highly variable
among disorders, patients, and over time in the same patient and are not related to clinical severity, as we
observed in patients 1 and 2. Presentations were highly variable among patients homozygous for this
nonsense mutation, ranging from asymptomatic to significant neurological impairment, acute metabolic
acidosis, or cardiomyopathy, so we found no genotype-phenotype association.
The c.139C > T (p.Arg47*) variant was found in heterozygosity in two patients (10 and 22). In patient 10, the
presence of this variant segregating with the (deep) intronic variant c.379-644A>G might explain the
phenotype. The second variant was shown to create a new consensus donor splice site, GTAA, resulting in a
premature stop codon, which suggests an impact on protein function 
[9]
. Also, the likely pathogenic variant
c.419delA (p.Lys140Argfs*6), found in patient 22, is a frameshift, introducing a premature stop codon,
leading to a truncated protein 
[12]
.
Patient 6, reported in 2007, was the first reported individual with a variant in homozygosity different from
c.139C > T (p.Arg47*): c.178A>C (p.Lys60Gln). This missense variant was predicted not to be deleterious by
bioinformatic predictors (sorting intolerant from tolerant (SIFT) and polymorphism phenotyping
(POLYPHEN)), and the structural, biophysical, and enzymatic assessments indicate that this variant does not
modify protein structure and function 
[11]
. Only two other patients with different 
MCEE
 variants in
homozygosity have been described: patient 20 
[11]
 and patient 23 
[13]
, with c.158T>G (p.Ile53Arg) and
c.296T>C (p.Leu99Pro) variants, respectively. The former is a missense variant predicted to be deleterious by
SIFT and POLYPHEN. Moreover, the Ile-to-Arg change causes reduced thermostability and the inability to
fold the protein correctly. The latter, concerning patient 23, is a missense, likely-pathogenic variant whose
protein consequence is unknown.
Most patients presented with neurological impairment (12 patients) or psychomotor delay or intellectual
disability (10 patients). Epilepsy and motor tone abnormalities were the most commonly pointed-out
abnormalities. In five cases, there was no neurological impairment (patients 4, 5, 9, 21, and 23), and in
seven, neurodevelopment was referred to as normal or near normal, although the length of follow-up was
not reported. Our patients had a severe clinical presentation at an early age and were under suboptimal
medical care, which probably determined the current neurological sequelae.
Clinical presentation occurred most often in infancy, namely in the first months of life, as in patients 1 and
2. Patient 22, reported in 2019, seems to be an exception, with a presentation apparently in adulthood and a
diagnosis at 78 years old 
[12]
. He had a medical history of chronic renal failure, cardiomyopathy, Parkinson’s
disease, two stroke episodes, basal ganglia infarctions, and cognitive deterioration. Elevation of MMA and
C3 led to the diagnosis. A single patient with MCE deficiency (patient 12) presented with an isolated
cardiomyopathy 
[11]
. Interestingly, basal ganglia stroke, chronic renal failure, and cardiomyopathy are well-
known complications of MMUT and Cbl metabolism deficiencies 
[3]
. Methylmalonic acid accumulation,
although moderate, may play a role in the pathophysiology of these complications in MCE deficiency.
Patients 3 and 8, from unrelated families, had SPR deficiency with mutations in the 
SPR
 gene 
[4,8]
. Most of
their symptoms could be attributed to this concomitant disorder since both presented with predominant
motor delay and progressive dystonia. Patient 8 had a normal brain MRI, as frequently happens in
neurotransmitter disorders. Since both the 
MCEE
 and 
SPR
 genes are located on chromosome 2, a contiguous

 of

gene syndrome was ruled out in these patients 
[8]
. Patient 8’s brother, patient 7, was asymptomatic despite
sharing the homozygous 
MCEE
 variant and having MMAuria, reinforcing the role of SPR deficiency in
patient 8's clinical phenotype. Patient 5, who, like patient 7, performed genetic testing because of his
affected sibling, was also asymptomatic 
[5]
.
The brothers described here (patients 1 and 2) also have significant neurological impairment, spasticity,
epilepsy, and psychomotor delay or intellectual disability. Although clinical information before their arrival
in our country is scarce, we can assume that repeated metabolic crises may have caused cerebral damage,
mainly in the older sibling. He was only diagnosed with MMAuria and treated as an MMUT deficiency at age
five when his brother presented with a coma. Consequently, his motor function (wheelchair-dependent),
cognitive performance, and brain MRI lesions grew worse than his brother’s. SPR deficiency still needs to be
investigated in our patients since it was not included in the gene panel that was performed. The normal
prolactin levels, although reassuring, do not exclude a tetrahydrobiopterin metabolism disorder causing a
dopamine deficit. Sepiapterin reductase deficiency, which could contribute to the severity of the neurologic
manifestations, should be investigated in our patients by genetic testing, and a therapeutic trial with
dopamine should be considered.
Adenosylcobalamin is the cofactor of MMUT, which converts L-MMA, resulting from the epimerase action
upon D-MMA, into succinyl-CoA. We stopped vitamin B12 supplementation because we did not expect it to
be helpful in this disorder. Nonetheless, according to protocol, we did not evaluate the biochemical
responsiveness to vitamin B12 
[18]
. Patient 4 was thought to have a clinical response to intramuscular
hydroxocobalamin, but urinary MMA levels remained high, and her fibroblasts were unresponsive 
[5]
.
Patient 23 is the only MCE deficiency patient with a biochemical response to vitamin B12, as intramuscular
methylcobalamin decreased C3 and C3/C2 levels; a reduction in MMA was not mentioned. 
[13]
. She was
homozygous for the 
MCEE
 variant 296T>C (p.Leu99Pro), reported as likely pathogenic by the authors, but its
consequences regarding protein functionality are unknown. The apparent response to methylcobalamin
would point to a cobalamin metabolism disorder. Nevertheless, no mutations were found in
the 
MMAA
, 
MMAB
, and 
MMADHC
 genes. All the other patients were either unresponsive to vitamin B12 (15
patients) or had no information regarding vitamin B12 supplementation (Table 
3
).
Since approximately 50% of MMA originates from four amino acids, protein restriction is a therapeutic
option in isolated MMAurias, mostly in vitamin B12-non-responsive MMUT deficiency 
[1]
. Protein
restriction was usual in the revised patients’ cohort (Table 
3
). Although its efficacy is unknown in MCE
deficiency, at least during underlying illnesses, it might prevent metabolic decompensation and
neurological sequelae, as stated in the current therapeutic guidelines for MMUT deficiency 
[15]
. Non-toxic
amino acid mixture supplementation in MMUT deficiency is controversial, and recent guidelines do not
recommend it. Our patients do not have amino acid mixture supplementation following those guidelines.
They are medicated with oral metronidazole to reduce the propionate from gut bacteria metabolism. Neither
amino acid mixtures nor metronidazole were reported in other patients. Due to its consistent biochemical
profile and potential for dietary and medical treatment, MCE deficiency could be included in neonatal
screening programs if C3 levels are high enough in the first few days of life.
Conclusions
Methylmalonyl CoA epimerase deficiency clinical features are primarily neurological: acute metabolic
acidosis with coma, seizures, stroke, or chronic evolution with motor abnormalities and intellectual
disability. Clinical severity varies, with few asymptomatic cases with genetic and biochemically confirmed
disease. We found no association between genotype and biochemical and clinical phenotypes. Since MCE
shares a similar biochemical profile and overlapping clinical features with other disorders of propionate
catabolism, genetic testing is indispensable for diagnosis. In our patients, the correct diagnosis allowed
discontinuation of vitamin B12 and adequate genetic counseling for the family.
