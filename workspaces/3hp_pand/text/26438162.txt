Enhancement of 3-hydroxypropionic 
acid production from glycerol by using  
a metabolic toggle switch
Keigo Tsuruno, Hiroshi Honjo and Taizo Hanai*
Abstract 
Background: 3-hydroxypropionic acid (3-HP) is an important platform for the production of C3 chemicals, including 
acrylic acid, methyl acrylate, and acrylamide. Microbial production of 3-HP is mainly due to glycerol metabolism. In 
this study, in order to improve microbial 3-HP production, we applied a metabolic toggle switch for controlling the 
glycerol metabolism to redirect the excess metabolic flux of central metabolic pathway toward an exogenous 3-HP 
producing pathway in Escherichia coli.
Results: The metabolic toggle switch enables conditional repression of the expression of a target gene during the 
fermentation. We individually performed conditional repression of glpK, tpiA, and gapA, which are involved in glycerol 
metabolism. The conditional repression of glpK and tpiA was not effective for 3-HP production under our experimental 
conditions. However, gapA conditional repression contributed to improve 3-HP production (titer, 54.2 ± 1.5 mM; yield, 
32.1 ± 1.3 %) compared with that for the wild type strain. Additional deletion of endogenous yqhD, which is respon-
sible for the production of a major byproduct, 1,3-propandiol, further increased 3-HP production (titer, 67.3 ± 2.1 mM; 
yield, 51.5 ± 3.2 %). The titer and yield were 80 and 94 % higher than those of the wild type strain, respectively. The 
obtained 3-HP yield from glycerol is comparable with the highest yield ever reported for microbial 3-HP production 
using glycerol as a sole carbon source. The measurement of intracellular metabolites showed the metabolic toggle 
switch successfully controlled the metabolic flux.
Conclusion: The conditional repression of gapA by using the metabolic toggle switch combined with deletion of 
endogeneous yqhD increased 3-HP production approximately twofold from glycerol. This result indicates the meta-
bolic toggle switch can be applied in various bio-production using diverse substrates.

Background
Growing concerns regarding the depletion of fossil 
resources and environmental sustainability have led to 
an increased demand for the development of bio-based 
chemicals and fuel production using renewable feed -
stock by microorganisms. Recently, in several cases, an 
exogenous synthetic pathway introduced in non-native 
hosts sufficiently produced various alcohols, acids, and 
chemicals [1–6]. Escherichia coli, in particular, has mainly 
been used as the host organism for bio-production using 
this synthetic pathway, due to its well-understood metab-
olism and potential for easy genetic manipulation [ 7]. 
In many studies, conventional metabolic engineering, 
such as gene deletion which defects genes on chromo -
some responsible for competing pathway by homologous 
recombination, was applied to increase metabolic flux 
toward the synthetic pathway for improving the titer and 
yield of the final products [1, 8]. In many cases, the intro-
duced synthetic pathway for carbon-based products such 
as alcohols or fatty acids competes with central carbon

metabolism processes, including glycolysis and the tricar-
boxylic acid (TCA) cycle, for carbon sources. However, the 
deletion approach is unsuitable for enzymes that catalyze 
central carbon metabolism, as the deletion leads to growth 
defects or severely decreased growth of the host strain 
under certain conditions [9 ]. Therefore, conventional 
metabolic engineering strategies may not be feasible in the 
case of the deletion of such genes for improvement of bio-
production. There is therefore a need for other strategies 
that increase the metabolic flux to the objective products 
rather than that to a central carbon metabolite, thus avoid
-
ing the growth defect during production.
To overcome this issue, there have recently been sev -
eral attempts to control metabolic flux by modulating 
the expression levels of enzymes involved in the central 
metabolic pathway [10–13]. We previously developed a 
metabolic toggle switch (MTS) to control the metabolic 
flux by using a genetic toggle switch that functions as a 
genetic circuit composed of two repressor proteins and 
two repressible promoters in E. coli [14, 15]. For isopro
-
panol production, we performed conditional repression 
of citrate synthase (EC 2.3.3.1) encoded by gltA, which 
catalyzes the condensation reaction of one molecule of 
acetyl-CoA and one molecule of oxaloacetate to one mol
-
ecule of citrate, in the middle of fermentation by addi -
tion of isopropyl β-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG). 
The conditional repression of gltA inhibited the meta
-
bolic flux from glycolysis to the TCA cycle and resulted 
in accumulation of acetyl-CoA. This acetyl-CoA accu
-
mulation resulted in increased titer and yield of isopro -
panol (derived from acetyl-CoA) and avoided the severe 
growth defect observed using the conventional gene 
deletion [15]. This encouraged the use of MTS for other 
bio-production processes employing a synthetic pathway 
to improve productivity. So far, studies controlling meta
-
bolic flux have been mainly focused on glucose metabo -
lism. However, there has been no report of controlling 
the metabolic flux using substrates other than glucose, 
such as xylose or glycerol.
3-Hydroxypropionic acid (3-HP) is a three carbon non-
chiral carboxylic acid that is often used as a platform for 
the production of several kinds of commercially impor
-
tant compounds, such as acrylic acid, methyl acrylate, 
acrylamide, ethyl 3-HP , malonic acid, propiolactone, and 
acrylonitrile [16]. Because of its usefulness, 3-HP was 
selected by the US Department of Energy as one of the 
top value-added chemicals produced with biomass [17]. 
3-HP is produced through a two-step reaction from glyc
-
erol as follows: the first step is the conversion of glycerol 
to 3-hydroxypropionaldehyde (3-HPA), catalyzed by vita
-
min B12–dependent glycerol dehydratase, and the second 
step is the conversion of 3-HPA to 3-HP , catalyzed by 
aldehyde dehydrogenase. Recently, the growing demand 
for the production of biodiesel has led to a reduction 
in the price of crude glycerol, since glycerol is a major 
byproduct of biodiesel production [18, 19]. Therefore, 
glycerol has been regarded as an attractive carbon feed
-
stock for 3-HP production.
To date, efforts to increase microbial 3-HP production 
have been made using engineered E. coli with an intro -
duced synthetic pathway as a host organism. Mohan 
et al. optimized the fermentation conditions such as the 
pH, working volume, and initial glycerol concentration 
[20]. Rathnasingh et  al. adjusted the expression level of 
enzymes in the synthetic pathway and demonstrated that 
the alternative enzyme exhibited higher activity [21]. 
Several recent studies focused on increasing the meta
-
bolic flux from glycerol toward 3-HP by the deletion of 
enzymes involved in glycerol metabolism [22, 23]. How
-
ever, the deletion of several genes resulted in poor cell 
growth [ 22] and some of the deleted strains required 
glucose coupled with glycerol as an additional substrate 
for cell growth [23]. Thus, an alternative approach to 
improve 3-HP production that avoids severe growth 
defect without using an additional substrate other than 
glycerol is required.
Under aerobic conditions, glycerol is converted to 
glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate, one of the intermediates 
of glycolysis, through glycerol-3-phosphate and dihy
-
droxyacetone phosphate. Each reaction in the pathway 
is catalyzed by four enzymes: glycerol kinase, glycerol-
3-phosphate dehydrogenase, triosephosphate isomerase, 
and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase encoded 
by glpK (EC 2.7.1.30), glpD (EC 1.1.5.3), tpiA (EC 5.3.1.1), 
and gapA (EC 1.2.1.12), respectively. Thus, we speculated 
that the conditional repression of these enzymes engaged 
in glycerol metabolism could direct the excess metabolic 
flux of the central metabolic pathway toward the intro
-
duced synthetic pathway for 3-HP production.
Here, we applied a MTS that involved conditional 
repression of glpK, tpiA or gapA  and a synthetic meta -
bolic pathway for 3-HP production in order to increase 
the titer and yield of 3-HP by redirecting metabolic flux 
from the central metabolic pathway toward 3-HP produc
-
tion. Conditional repression of gapA effectively increased 
3-HP productivity, and prevented severe growth inhibi -
tion. Moreover, additional deletion of yqhD, which cata -
lyzes the reaction for producing a major byproduct of 
1,3-propanediol (1,3-PDO), further increased the titer 
and yield of 3-HP .

and glycerol dehydratase reactivase (gdrAB) derived from 
Klebsiella pneumoniae, catalyze the conversion of glyc -
erol to 3-HPA. α-ketoglutaric semialdehyde dehydroge -
nase (araE) derived from Azospirillum brasilense is also 
encoded on the plasmid that catalyzes the conversion of 
3-HPA to 3-HP (Figs.  1, 2; Table  1). The expression of 
these enzymes for 3-HP production was induced by the 
addition of 0.1 mM IPTG at 0 h.
TA2463 produced 37.7 ± 1.6 mM 3-HP and the OD
600 
and glycerol consumption at 48  h were 4.58  ±  0.18, 
163.9 ± 1.8 mM, respectively (Fig. 3a–c). The growth rate 
and 3-HP production decreased after 24 h, although glyc
-
erol remained in the medium. This was also observed in 
a previous study, in which 200 mM glycerol was used as a 
substrate for 3-HP production in batch culture [20]. The 
3-HP yield from glycerol was 26.5 ± 1.1 % (mol/mol). The 
3-HP production and yield observed was slightly lower 
than that previously reported in a batch culture study 
using the same enzymes for 3-HP production and simi
-
lar culture conditions, including the use of a shake flask 
[21]. This could be due to the different protein expression 
systems used, which resulted in different protein expres
-
sion levels. A significant amount of 1,3-propanediol (1,3-
PDO) (12.8 ± 1.8 mM) (Fig. 3d), which is converted from 
3-HPA in a reaction catalyzed by endogenous NADPH-
dependent aldehyde reductase encoded by yqhD, was 
produced as the main byproduct, which is in agreement 
with previous studies [32–34]. Acetate has been shown to 
be a major byproduct of 3-HP production from glycerol 
in other studies [20–23]. In contrast, only small amounts 
of acetate (maximum of 2.18  ±  0.86  mM) accumulated 
at 24  h. Acetate was eventually removed, perhaps as a 
result of reassimilation in our experimental conditions. 
This observation corresponds to several reports per
-
forming fermentation of E. coli under aerobic conditions 
using minimal medium with glycerol as the sole carbon 
source [35–37]. Other metabolites such as lactate were 
not detected during fermentation. IPTG addition at vari
-
ous time points (3, 6, and 9 h) did not significantly affect 
growth, glycerol consumption, or 3-HP and 1,3-PDO 
production (data not shown).

Effect of the conditional repression of glpK on 3‑HP 
production
Glycerol kinase (glpK) catalyzes the conversion of glyc -
erol to glycerol-3-phosphate, which enters glycolysis via 
dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP) (Fig. 1). Deletion of 
glpk should result in increased yield of 3-HP from glyc -
erol, but the deletion caused growth defects in E. coli 
cultured in M9 medium containing glycerol as the sole 
carbon source [23]. We therefore speculated that condi
-
tional repression of glpK using MTS was an appropriate 
strategy for achieving a high titer and yield of 3-HP , and 
would reduce the metabolic flux towards the central met
-
abolic pathway.
TA2660, a glpK conditional repression strain with the 
synthetic pathway for 3-HP , was constructed and sub -
jected to 3-HP production (Fig.  2; Table  1). The con -
ditional repression and expression of the introduced 
synthetic pathway were simultaneously induced by addi
-
tion of IPTG [15]. To assess the effect of the timing of 
the conditional repression at various growth phases, 
IPTG was added to cultures at 0, 3, 6, and 9  h (from 
here on referred to as strain name_0, 3, 6, or 9 h). Unin
-
duced TA2660 demonstrated reduced growth rate and 
decreased glycerol consumption compared to the wild 
type strain (TA2463) (Figs.  3a, b, 4a, b). Induction with 
IPTG at every time point tested resulted in severe growth 
defects and low glycerol consumption (Fig.  4a, b). Less 
than 10 mM of 3-HP and 1,3-PDO was produced (Fig. 4c, 
d). TA2660_0 h scarcely consumed glycerol through fer
-
mentation, while TA2660_9 h assimilated about 25 mM 
of glycerol within 12  h. However, glycerol assimilation 
stopped and 3-HP was produced at low levels after 12 h. 
Previously, Jung et  al. showed that a glpK-deleted strain 
heterologously expressing glpK, controlled by the l-ara
-
binose-inducible promoter, increased the 3-HP titer and 
yield from glycerol, whereas even in the absence of l-ara
-
binose, the strain grew and produced 3-HP [23]. This 
suggests that our conditional repression strategy resulted 
in lower glpK activity than the l-arabinose dependent 
regulation method and significantly reduced intracellular 
metabolism. It was reported that the glpK deletion strain 
was able to efficiently grow and produce 3-HP using both

glycerol and glucose substrates. In this strain, energy and 
cellular components were supplied from central carbon 
metabolism of glucose [33]. These results indicate that 
some amount of metabolic flux towards a central meta
-
bolic pathway such as glycolysis and the TCA cycle is 
required during 3-HP production to supply energy and 
cellular components.
Effect of tpiA conditional repression on 3‑HP production
In order to distribute a considerable amount of metabolic 
flux toward the central metabolic pathway, 3-HP pro
-
duction was initiated using TA2945, a 3-HP producing 
synthetic pathway and MTS strain with tpiA conditional 
repression (Figs.  1, 2; Table  1). Glycerol-3-phosphate 
dehydrogenase (GlpD) encoded by glpD is responsible for 
the conversion of glycerol-3-phosohate to DHAP (Fig.  1). 
Although this reaction is the immediate downstream of 
the reaction catalyzed by glycerol kinase (glpK), there is 
no metabolic pathway that catalyzes the glycerol-3-phos
-
phate toward central metabolic pathway except for the 
reaction responsible for GlpD. We speculated that the 
conditional repression of glpD could not be expected a 
remarkable improvement of 3-HP production compared 
with the case of glpK. On the other hand, triosephosphate 
isomerase encoded by tpiA catalyzes the conversion 
of DHAP to glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate (GAP), such 
that the flux dispensed from DHAP can be converted to 
pyruvate by the methylglyoxal pathway via methylgly
-
oxal, lactaldehyde, and lactate (Fig. 1). This methylglyoxal 
pathway is normally inactive [38]; however, high concen -
trations of DHAP can induce its activity [39].
The growth profile of TA2945 without IPTG induc -
tion was similar to that of wild type strain (TA2463) 
(Figs.  3a, 5a). TA2945 strains induced with IPTG, espe
-
cially TA2945_0  h, demonstrated lower growth rates 
than uninduced TA2945 strains until 24  h; however,

the addition of IPTG did not affect the final OD 600. 
In contrast to TA2660, TA2945 with IPTG, including 
TA2945_0  h, continued to assimilate glycerol after the 
addition of IPTG. Specifically, their glycerol consump
-
tion rate after 24 h was higher than that of TA2463 and 
consumed almost all of the glycerol in the medium at 
48  h (Fig.  5b). In our previous report, the glucose con
-
sumption rate of the gltA conditional repression strain 
also surpassed that of the wild type strain, which did 
not have any particular genetic modifications [15]. It 
has been considered that the faster substrate consump
-
tion is attributed to the energy shortage of the cell [40]. 
TA2945 produced lactate (a maximum of 6.2  ± 0.23 mM 
produced by TA2945_3  h at 36  h), an intermediate of 
the methylglyoxal pathway. These results suggest that 
tpiA conditional repression led to the accumulation of 
DHAP , and that activation of the methylglyoxal pathway 
resulted in some amount of metabolic flux directed to 
the central metabolic pathway. Taking into account the 
decreased growth rate of TA2945 with IPTG induction, 
the metabolic flux toward the central metabolic path
-
way should be reduced compared to TA2463. However, 
IPTG-induced TA2945 produced the lowest titer and 
yield of 3-HP (Fig.  5c). TA2945_9 h produced the high

est 3-HP titer and yield among the TA2945 induced at 
different time points, which were only 25.0  ±  0.75  mM 
and 14.2  ± 0.44 %, respectively. The titer and yield were 
34 and 47 % lower than, respectively, in TA2463, indicat

ing that conditional repression of tpiA is not effective for 
3-HP production. Tokuyama et  al. demonstrated 3-HP 
production from glycerol using an E. coli tpiA-deficient 
strain [22]. The deletion of tpiA improved 3-HP titer and 
yield compared to the parental stain. However, the dele

glycerol consumption, where it took about 100 h to reach 
the stationary phase [22]. This distinction demonstrates 
the difference in the effects between conditional repres
-
sion and deletion of tpiA on metabolism.
Interestingly, TA2945 produced higher concentrations 
of 1,3-PDO (Fig.  5d). Particularly, 3-HP and 1,3-PDO 
concentration achieved by TA2945_0  h were 15.4  ±  1.4 
and 40.9  ±  6.4  mM, respectively, showing that a large 
proportion of 3-HPA was not converted to 3-HP but was 
instead converted to 1,3-PDO (Fig.  1). This is similar to 
the results of a previous report on 3-HP production using 
a tpiA deletion strain [22]. NAD
+ is required for both 
the conversion of 3-HPA to 3-HP and of lactate to pyru -
vate in the methylglyoxal pathway (Fig.  1). In addition, 
the reduced metabolic flux toward the central metabolic 
pathway would prevent NAD
+ generation. Accordingly, 
the intracellular level of NAD + would be insufficient for 
3-HP production resulting in increased metabolic flux 
from 3-HPA to 1,3-PDO.
Effect of gapA conditional repression on 3‑HP production
To further evaluate the benefit of conditional repression 
for higher 3-HP production with distribution of some 
amount of metabolic flux to the central metabolic path

way, TA2821, a strain with gapA  conditional repression

The conditional repression of gapA  initiated at 0 and

absence of IPTG, TA2821_6 and 9  h showed similar 
growth profiles that were comparable to the growth of 
wild type strain TA2463 (Figs.  3a, 6a). These results indi
-
cate that expression of gapA from a medium copy plasmid 
for 6  h was enough to induce energy and the necessary 
cell components for adequate cell growth. The glycerol 
consumption of TA2821_3 and 6  h were similar to the 
uninduced IPTG strain, but TA2821_9  h, demonstrated 
increased glycerol consumption (Fig.  6b). Importantly, 
TA2821_6 and 9  h produced higher concentrations of 
3-HP , 46.4 ± 1.9 and 54.2  ± 1.5 mM, respectively. These 
concentrations represented a 23.0 and 43.9  % increase, 
respectively, compared to the 3-HP titer produced by 
TA2463. Furthermore, the yields of these conditions were 
44.6 ± 4.2 and 32.1  ± 1.3 %, respectively. They were also 
higher than that of TA2463. These results indicate that 
conditional repression of gapA at 6 h and 9 h contributed 
to an increase in both 3-HP titer and yield from glyc
-
erol without impairing cell growth. This might be due 
to excess metabolic flux resulting from gapA  repression, 
which provided improved 3-HP production.
In contrast to the results observed with the TA2945 
tpiA conditional repression strain, detectable amounts 
of lactate were not observed during the fermentation of 
TA2821. In addition, the profiles of growth and glycerol 
consumption between TA2945 and TA2821 were rela
-
tively different (Figs.  5a, b, 6a, b). These results suggest 
that glycerol metabolism toward the central metabolic 
pathway in the gapA conditional repression strain did not 
depend on the methylglyoxal pathway. It was reported 
that E. coli strains deficient in GAPDH activity did not 
grow on minimal media containing glucose or glycerol 
as a sole carbon source. However, the strains were able 
to grow on media only when containing glycerol together

with other substrate such as malate or succinate [41, 
42]. These findings imply that the E. coli GAPDH defi -
cient strain uses a distinct route for glycerol metabolism. 
Extensive metabolic flux analyses of the GAPDH defi

details of the pathway are still unclear.
Improvement of 3‑HP production by yqhD deletion
TA2821_9  h (gapA  conditional repression strain) pro -
duced higher concentrations of 1,3-PDO (18.9 ± 3.1 mM) 
as a major byproduct (Fig. 6d), indicating that endogenous 
yqhD decreased the metabolic flux from 3-HPA to 3-HP 
in the TA2821. To elevate the 3-HP production and pre
-
vent 1,3-PDO production, TA3130, an endogenous yqhD 
deletion strain from TA2821, was constructed (Figs.  1, 2; 
Table 1). The growth and glycerol consumption of TA3130 
were comparable those of wild type strain (TA2463) 
(Fig.  7a, b). As shown in Fig.  7c, TA3130_9  h produced 
67.3 ±  2.1  mM of 3-HP with a yield of 51.5  ±  3.2  % at 
48 h, which were about 80 and 94 % higher, respectively, 
than those of TA2463. The maximum theoretical yield 
of 3-HP from glycerol under aerobic condition was esti
-
mated as 97  % [23]. Thus, the 3-HP yield from glycerol 
obtained with TA3130 was 53.1 % of the theoretical yield 
and was comparable to that of our previous report in 
which the highest 3-HP yield from glycerol (54.1 %) ever 
reported was achieved using a dual synthetic pathway in 
flask scale batch fermentation [24].
The titer of 1,3-PDO produced by TA3130_9  h 
(4.51 ± 1.2 mM) was significantly lower compared to that 
for TA2821_9 h (18.9 ± 3.1 mM) (Figs.  6d, 7d). The dele
-
tion of yqhD in the E. coli strain producing 3-HP led to 
reduced 1,3-PDO production. However small amounts 
of 1,3-PDO was still produced, suggesting that there are

other enzymes that can convert 3-HPA to 1,3-PDO in E. 
coli [22, 33]. Additionally, the sum of the concentrations 
of 3-HP and 1,3-PDO produced by TA3130 (approxi -
mately 71.8  mM) was similar to that of TA2821_9  h 
(approximately 73.1 mM). These results reveal that dele
-
tion of yqhD did not affect the metabolic flux from glyc -
erol to 3-HPA but decreased the metabolic flux from 
3-HPA to 1,3-PDO.
Measurement of gapA activity and intracellular 
metabolites during fermentation
Previously, we examined whether MTS effectively work 
as an off switch or not by measuring the enzyme activ
-
ity that was conditionally repressed and the concen -
trations of intracellular metabolites [15]. The GAPDH 
activity in TA2463 (wild type strain), TA3130 (gapA  
conditional repression strain with yqhD deletion) with
-
out IPTG, and TA3130_9 h were measured at 9 and 24 h. 
The activities of GAPDH activity in TA3130 without 
IPTG induction and TA3130_9  h were more than two
-
fold higher (0.655  ±  0.013 and 0.676  ±  0.018 U/mg) 
than the activity achieved with TA2463 (0.249  ± 0.0037 
U/mg) at 9  h, which is likely due to the expression of 
gapA from the medium copy number plasmid in TA3130 
and from chromosome in TA2463 (Table  2). The activ
-
ity of TA2463 at 24  h decreased to half the activity 
observed at 9 h (0.117  ± 0.012 U/mg), while uninduced 
TA3130 maintained its activity during the 24  h period 
(0.576  ±  0.029 U/mg) (Table  2). The difference could

be caused by using a native promoter in TA2463 chro -
mosome or the artificial inducible promoter, Pl tetO1 
on the plasmid for gapA  expression even though it has 
degradation tag at C-terminus. The gapA  activity of 
TA3130_9 h at 24 h was 0.0483  ± 0.0031 U/mg, which 
was 92 and 59 % lower than that for uninduced TA3130 
and TA2463, respectively, at 24 h (Table  2). The condi -
tional repression of gapA  did not significantly reduce 
the activity as observed in our previous reports of gltA  
conditional repression where the activity decreased by 
7 % of the wild type strain [15]. When GAPDH activity is 
strictly repressed after addition of IPTG, 3-HP titer and 
yield could be further elevated.
LC–MS analysis was performed to investigate the effect 
of gapA conditional repression on intracellular metabo
-
lites using cells from TA2463, TA3130 without IPTG, and 
TA3130_9 h at 9 and 24 h. As shown in Fig.  8, the levels 
of most of the intracellular metabolites that relate to gly -
colysis and the TCA cycle were comparable among the 
three strains at 9 h. However, higher levels of DHAP and 
GAP were accumulated in TA3130_9 h at 24 h. The level 
of DHAP in TA3130_9 h was approximately threefold and 
1.5-fold higher and of GAP was approximately 1.4-fold 
and 1.5-fold higher, respectively, than that of TA2463 and 
TA3130 without IPTG. This probably resulted from the 
conditional repression of gapA. Furthermore, TA3130_9 h 
had lower levels of several glycolysis and TCA cycle 
metabolites, such as G6P , F6P , α-ketoglutarate, succinate, 
fumarate, and malate. These low levels of metabolites 
indicate the reducing metabolic flux toward central car
-
bon metabolism, and this reduction was most likely to 
allow for a higher 3-HP titer and yield from TA3110_9 h.

Taking into account the results of measurement of 
GAPDH activity and the concentrations of intracellular 
metabolites, MTS sufficiently functioned as the off switch 
of gapA. Thus, we demonstrate the state of intracellular 
metabolites before and after conditional repression of 
gapA in the E. coli yqhD deletion mutant. However, details 
regarding metabolic flux during fermentation are poorly 
understood. 
13C-metabolic flux analysis that estimates the 
intracellular metabolic flux can provide useful informa -
tion of additional genetic modifications required for fur -
ther increases in 3-HP production [43].
Recently, Jung et al. demonstrated that deletion of glpR 
encoding a regulation factor repressing the genes for 
glycerol utilization increased the glycerol utilization rate 
as well as the 3-HP titer [23]. Chu et al. and Honjo et al. 
improved the conversion rate of 3-HPA to 3-HP using an 
aldehyde dehydrogenase mutant or via the introduction 
of an additional metabolic pathway [24, 44]. The condi
-
tional repression of gapA  combined with these findings 
provides further improvement of 3-HP productivity. 
Such resultant strains will be applied to various cultiva
-
tion conditions including fed-batch culture that could 
gave knowledge for the eventual commercialization of 
3-HP production by E. coli with MTS from glycerol.
Conclusion
Here, we performed conditional repression of genes 
related to glycerol metabolism (glpK, tipA and gapA ) for 
increasing 3-HP production from glycerol by E. coli. The 
conditional repression of glpK and tpiA did not improve 
3-HP production, indicating that the conditional repres
-
sion of every node on the routes of carbon utilization 
does not completely contribute to enhanced produc
-
tivity of the final products. In contrast, the conditional 
repression of gapA with MTS, accompanied by deletion 
of yqhD, significantly increased 3-HP production from 
glycerol. The 3-HP titer and yield achieved by the result
-
ant strain TA3130 were 67.3 ± 2.1 mM and 51.5 ± 3.2 %, 
respectively, which were 80 and 94  % greater, respec -
tively, than those for TA2463, the wild type strain. To 
our knowledge, this is the first report demonstrating the 
effectiveness of conditional repression by using the MTS 
on 3-HP production from glycerol. Taking into account 
our previous report, which showed increased isopro
-
panol production from glucose by conditional repression 
of gltA, this strategy can be applied to various kinds of 
bio-production from various substrates.

Chemicals were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. 
Louis, MO, USA), Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Ltd. 
(Osaka, Japan), and MP Biomedicals (Solon, OH, USA), 
and all restriction enzymes were purchased from New 
England Biolabs (Ipswich, MA, USA), unless otherwise 
noted.
Media and growth conditions
For plasmid preparation, E. coli strains were cultured 
in 3 mL Luria–Bertani (LB) medium in test tubes incu
-
bated at 37  °C in a rotary shaker (250  rpm). The media 
and growth conditions for flask cultures were adopted 
from a previous study, with slight modifications [24]. E. 
coli strains were grown in M9 minimal media containing 
200 mM glycerol, 0.05 % (w/v) yeast extract, and 10 ppm 
thiamin hydrochloride. Preculture was performed at 
37 °C in a rotary shaker (250 rpm), and the main culture 
was incubated at 37 °C in a rotary shaker (150 rpm) in the 
dark. Overnight precultures were diluted to 300 mL in a 
baffled flask containing 25 mL fresh M9 media with ini
-
tial optical density at 600 nm (OD 600) of 0.05 as the main 
culture. IPTG (0.1  mM) and cyanocobalamin (2  μM) 
were added at the indicated time points (0, 3, 6, or 9 h). 
All media were supplemented with appropriate antibiot -
ics [kanamycin (50  μg/mL), spectinomycin (100  μg/mL), 
or chloramphenicol (40 μg/mL)].
Plasmid and strain construction
The plasmids and strains used in this study are listed in 
Table 1. All plasmids were prepared in E. coli XL1-blue 
(Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA). PCR anal
-
yses were performed using KOD plus NEO (Toyobo Co., 
Ltd., Osaka, Japan). To insert a DNA fragment contain

ing the tryptophan terminator Ttrp flanked by an IPTG 
inducible promoter PllacO1 into the pTA867 vector [24] 
at the BamHI site, a fragment was generated by primer 
extension using the following primers: T1856 (5′ GCCAT 
CGGAT CCAGC CCGCC TAATG AGCGG GCTTT

digested with BamHI and cloned into the pTA867 vector, 
resulting in a plasmid designated as pTA1196. The kan

amycin-resistance gene of the pTA695 plasmid [15] was 
replaced with spectinomycin. A fragment encoding the 
spectinomycin-resistance gene was digested with AvrII 
and SacI from PZS4Int-laci/tetR [25] and was ligated 
into the pTA695 vector, which did not contain an anti
-
microbial-resistance gene, resulting in a plasmid that was 
designated as pTA1065. glpK was amplified from the E.

ers T2083 (5′ CATGG TACGC GTGCT AGAGG CATC

BamHI and MluI, and cloned into pTA695, resulting in 
a plasmid designated as pTA958. The kanamycin-resist
-
ance gene of pTA958 was replaced with spectinomycin, 
similar to the pTA1065 plasmid, resulting in a plas

mid designated as pTA1335. To exchange the origin of 
pTA1065, the plasmid was digested with AvrII and SpeI, 
and a pTA1065 fragment without origin was gel purified. 
The resultant fragment was ligated with a pSC101* origin 
generated from pZS*24MCS [25] by digestion with AvrII 
and SpeI, resulting in a plasmid designated as pTA1296. 
tpiA was amplified from the BW25113 genome by PCR 
using the primers T2302 (5′ AAAAA GGATC CATGC

and introduced into the BamHI site of pTA1296, creat

ing a plasmid designated as pTA1383. PllacO1-tpiA.
LAA was amplified by PCR performed using the primers 
T2404 (5′ AAAAA AGCTT AGCCC GCCTA ATGAG

-
ment was cloned into pTA1065 at the AvrII-HindIII site, 
resulting in a plasmid designated as pTA1393.
All E. coli strains used for 3-HP production were based 
on BW25113. The gapA  gene was deleted by Wanner 
method ([29], Nakahigashi unpublished data). The genes 
glpK, tpiA, and yqhD were inactivated by P1 transduction 
based on TA1015 or TA2814. TA2793 was constructed 
by P1 transduction using JW0336 based on TA2732 in 
which gapA was supplemented with pTA1335 [28]. After 
P1 transduction, the residual kanamycin marker was 
removed using pCP20 in all strains [29].
Analytical methods
All analytical methods such as measurement of cell density, 
extracellular metabolites, glycerol, and intracellular metab
-
olites were performed as previously described [15, 24].
Glyceraldehyde‑3‑phosphate dehydrogenase activity
Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) 
activity was measured as previously reported, with 
slight modifications [30, 31]. E. coli strains, TA2463 and 
TA3130 were cultured in M9 medium as described in 
section media and growth. Cells were harvested by cen
-
trifugation, washed, and resuspended in wash buffer. 
Crude extracts were prepared by sonication on ice, and 
supernatants were collected after centrifugation for 
experiments. The protein concentration of the crude 
extracts was determined by measuring the absorbance 
at 280  nm using a NanoDrop 2000 spectrophotometer 
(Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, USA). The activity 
was measured by monitoring the increase in absorbance 
at 340 nm at 25 °C. Crude extracts were added to a reac
-
tion mixture containing 200 mM tricine buffer (pH 8.5), 
30  mM 2-mercaptoethanol, 10  mM NAD, and 10  mM 
glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate. Measurement began when 
100  mM inorganic phosphate was added. The unit of 
enzyme activity is defined as the formation of 1  μmol of 
NADPH per minute.
Measurement of intracellular metabolites
TA2463 and TA3130 were cultured in M9 medium as 
described in section media and growth conditions. IPTG 
(0.1  mM) was added after 9  h of culture for TA3130. 
Intracellular metabolite extraction and subsequent LC–
MS/MS analysis were performed as previously described 
[15].
