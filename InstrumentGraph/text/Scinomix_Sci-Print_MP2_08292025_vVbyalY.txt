Sci-Print MP2 
Semi-Automated  
Microplate Labeler 
The Sci-Print MP2 is a benchtop semi-
automated labeler that prints and applies 
onto a variety of microplates for sample 
tracking. It can be used in a manual 
standalone environment or integrated 
into a fully automated system.
• Optional barcode reader
• Easily integrated into third party 
systems 
• Small footprint saves valuable space  
in the lab
• Label consistency
• Labels can be applied to all sides of  
the plate
• Prints a range of standard barcodes 
(1D & 2D)
• Improves productivity & efficiency
• Eliminates human error
• User-defined fields
• Reduces repetitive injuries Scinomix Sci-Print MP2
