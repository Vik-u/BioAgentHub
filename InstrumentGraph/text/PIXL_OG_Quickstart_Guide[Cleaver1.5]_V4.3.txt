READ BEFORE YOU START!
 · The blade is sharp! Be careful when handling the PIXL blade. Always 
follow the instructions on page 45 when changing blades.  
 · Hand feed the PickupLine™ carefully. When feeding a PickupLine™ 
into the machine, if you feel resistance, pull back slightly and re-feed. 
Forcing the PickupLine™ through will cause damage to the machine.  
 · Remove lids when placing plates into the PIXL. Lids need to be 
manually removed. Failure to do so will cause damage to the picking 
arm. 
 · The nozzle is hot! Be careful when removing the nozzle as it can get 
quite hot. 
 · The feed button is disabled. The feed button is disabled on all PIXL 
machines. The retract button is fully functional during the change 
PickupLine maintenance routine.  
 · UV Safety. PIXL uses UV to sterilise the machine and various lighting 
wavelengths for detection purposes (See Page 40 for the full list). 
This includes Violet 1 (380-390nm), which is within the harmful UV 
light spectrum. These lighting wavelengths are safe to use within 
PIXL, however exposure to UV can lead to eye damage, skin damage 
and cancer. Do not operate PIXL outside the operations described in 
this user guide.

We are starting to perform in-person installations again! But for those we cant make 
it to, never fear! To get you up and running as quickly as possible we have instead 
included detailed instruction on how to self-install the PIXL (see page 11). We ask that 
you contact our Tech Support Team to let them know when you’re planning to perform 
the self-installation so they can be on hand should you require any assistance: 
technicalsupport@singerinstruments.com
Once the installation is complete, please fill-in the online Self-Installation Form: 
http://bit.ly/Selfinstallation 
You will be asked to create an account before you start. You can also use this form to 
report any issues encountered during installation.
NOTE: Completion of this form will activate the start of your warranty period. Failure 
to complete the form may affect the support we are able to offer during the warranty 
period.

TROUBLESHOOTING
PROBLEM 
Plate guides could not be detected 
 
The PickupLine™ hits the top plate as the picking 
arm moves between positions 
 
 
 
The PIXL is missing colonies. 
 
 
 
Blades wear down quickly. Please correctly follow instructions for changing the blade in the 
PIXL software.

bit.ly/PIXLhelp
SOLUTION 
Ensure that a source plate holder is installed into the PIXL. 
 
Ensure that the plate dimensions in the software match that 
of the plate being used. If the plate type is unsupported please 
contact technicalsupport@singerinstruments.com and we’ll 
make a new dimensions file for the plate. 
 
Ensure that the nozzle has been calibrated by running the 
‘Calibrate Nozzle’ routine in the software. Ensure that the Detect 
automatically’ option is selected for ‘Agar Depth’.
