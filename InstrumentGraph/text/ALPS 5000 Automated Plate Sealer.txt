ALPS 5000 Microplate Heat Sealer
 -Fast, reliable and quiet automated plate sealing solution for any lab
The Thermo Scientific ™ ALPS 5000™ is the next generation 
in plate sealing equipment offering fast sealing times, 
increased process customization and all electric operation 
improving reliability and reducing noise. The Thermo 
Scientific ALPS 5000 heat sealer has a compact footprint 
to conserve precious bench space and top-loaded seals 
are easily accessible and can be loaded  without the aid 
of a tool. With automated, electircally controlled microplate 
sealing, seal up to 3 plates per minute in a variety of  
hand-fed, benchtop or high throughput robotic 
applications.
Features Benefits 
Fast Sealing of Multiple Plate Heights
• Increase productivity and throughput sealing up to 3 plates per minute
• Seal plates from 8 mm to 46 mm in height with no height adapters required
• Compatible with high throughput automated applications
• No expensive vacuum cups to maintain or replace
Touchscreen Control and Parameter Customization
• Precise control over sealing parameters to ensure repeatability 
• Easily integrated into automation or robotics workflow
• 15 saved protocols to customize and recall for efficient flexibility
• Customize, sealing time and temperature, force or distance of the seal and length 
of foil applied
Electrically Driven with Tool Free Loading
• No internal or external air source, vacuum source, or peristaltic pump required
• Reduced risk of contamination inherent in pneumatically driven sealers
• Quieter operation when compared to pneumatically controlled systems
• Tool free loading makes reloading foil simple and repeatable
Designed with the ability to program sealing time, 
temperature, pressure, foil length and sealing distance 
the ALPS 5000 allows for ability to offer complete 
customization of the sealing process for a wide range of 
applications. The ALPS 5000 semi-automated sealer is 
equipped with both on-board touch screen operation, 
savable protocols for bench top use and an RS232 
port and included programming parameters for robotic 
integration.
