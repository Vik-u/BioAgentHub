CHAPTER 3
Introduction
Introduction
The Echo Plate Reformat application provides a variety of plate transfer functions to the Echo 
Liquid Handler and works with all Echo Liquid Handlers. These transfer functions are listed below:
 • Plate Replication — Transfers samples to the same well locations on one or more destination 
plates. A user can transfer 384- to 384-well or 1536- to 1536-well plates. 
 • Compress — Transfers samples to a higher density plate. For example, compress mode transfers 
a full 384-well plate to a quadrant (top) or to interleaved wells (bottom) of a 1536-well plate. 

C68408AA     3-2
Introduction
Introduction  
 • Decompress — Transfers samples to a lower densit y plate. For example, decompress mode 
transfers a partial 1536-well plate to a 384-well plate. 
 • Custom Mapping — Transfers samples in selected sour ce plate regions to destination plate 
regions. For example, mapping the transfer of 20 nL from a sub-group of source plate wells to 
an entire destination plate followed by a transfer of 10 nL from a separate sub-group to half of 
the destination plate. 
The steps to creating a typical transfer protocol for Echo Plate Reformat Application are 
shown below.

C68408AA    4-3
Software Operations
Selecting Source and Destination Plate Types  4
Selecting Source and Destination Plate Types
The Echo Liquid Handler dynamically adjusts to different changes in fluid characteristics within a 
broad fluid class (Dynamic Fluid Analysis). Choosing the plate format determines the physical plate 
parameters that the Echo Plate Reformat application uses. Choosing the plate type determines the 
transfer method that the Echo Liquid Handler uses; taking the plate format and fluid properties into 
account. These settings enable the Echo system to transfer multiple fluid types from the same 
source plate. For example, using the plate format 384PP and plate type MyBuffer_AQ_GP instructs 
the Liquid Handler to transfer samples from a 384PP format plate with a transfer method suited for 
the Glycerol fluid class.
These steps are critical when creating the application protocol.
1 In the Protocol Setup window, select the Plate Format to be 384PP, 384LDV, or 1536LDV. Based 
on the plate format chosen, the compatible plate types appear for Default Plate Type.
2 Select the Default Plate Type to set the fluid type for the Source Plate.
3 Select the Plate Type to set the transfer properties for the Destination Plate.
 • If a 384-well source plate and 384-well destination plate are selected, the Echo Plate 
Reformat application automatically selects Replication.
 • If a 384-well source plate and a 1536-well destination plate are selected, the Echo Plate 
Reformat application automatically selects Compress.
 • If a 1536-well source plate and a 384-well destination plate are selected, the Echo Plate 
Reformat application automatically selects Decompress.
NOTE  Not all plate formats and plate types are available on all instruments. The specific plate 
requirements per user environment are specified in the purchase agreement and programmed 
into the instrument prior to shipping.
C68408AA     4-4
Software Operations
Understanding the Mapping Mode  
Understanding the Mapping Mode
There are two mapping modes available: Regional or Custom.
 • Regional Mapping Mode
 • Custom Mapping Mode
Regional Mapping Mode
When using the Regional Mapping Mode, the mapping mode is automatically selected based on the 
plate types chosen by the user. The samples in the source plate are transferred to the same well 
locations in the destination plate. Since the plate maps are predefined (replication, compress, 
decompress), the Echo Plate Reformat application automatically selects the plate map, and displays 
the parameters associated with the plate map.
NOTE  In previous versions of the Echo Plate Reformat application, compress and decompress were referred 
to as upstack and down-stack.
The three predefined mapping modes are described below.
 • Replication — The user can choose to replicate a partial or full plate.
 • Compress — The user can choose to compress partial or full 384-well plates into 1536-well 
formats.
 • Decompress — The user can choose to decompress part ial or full 1536-well plates into 384-well 
or to 96-well destination plates.
Custom Mapping Mode
When using the Custom Mapping Mode, the samples in the source plate are transferred to any well 
location on the destination plate based upon user selection. The user must select Custom, and define 
the plate map in the main Protocol window.
The most commonly created custom mapping methods are listed below:
 • Transfer region — Transfer any region in the source pl ate to any wells on the destination plate 
at any volume. The number of wells transferred must match the number of destination wells 
selected. If fewer destination wells are selected, the transfer region is truncated.
 • Replicate — Replicate a region of the source plate to  multiple regions in the destination plate.
 • Interleave — Transfer samples from a single region in the source plate to interleaved regions in 
the destination plate.
 • Pool — Transfer samples from different source plat es or different regions of the same source 
plate to the same region in the destination plate.
 • Transpose — Transpose the transferred region. For example, from horizontal region to a 
vertical region. The number of wells transferred must match or the destination region will be 
truncated.

Using Dest Offset
The Dest Offset option allows an operator to designate transfer of fluids to a different location 
within the well.
The default is to the center of the destination well. Assuming well A1 is in the upper left corner 
when looking down at a plate, a positive y value moves the location for the transfer fluids toward 
the top of the plate. A positive x value moves the location for the transfer fluids toward the right 
side of the plate.
The Dest Offset x/y values should be set before adding a region.

Importing Region Definitions
As an alternative to graphically creating the source to destination well mappings, the Echo Plate 
Reformat application allows users to import a file to explicitly map transfers from a source to a 
destination plate. After importing the file, these transfers are graphically represented in a new Echo 
Plate Reformat protocol. This provides flexibility in destination plate mapping, such as combining 
pick lists from several source plates to fewer destination plates. Once the new protocol with 
combined pick lists is created, the user can save the new protocol.
When a pick list is imported via the Import Region Definitions menu option, it can be modified or 
used as is. The user has the option to save the pick list changes back to the original file or as a new 
file.
To import region definitions:
1 Create a new protocol or open an existing protocol.
2 Select Import Region Definitions from the File menu.
Figure 4.22  Import Region Definitions dialog box
3 Choose a .csv file that contains pick list data.
4 When the Import Pick List dialog box is shown, click Import. See Importing a Pick List for more 
information on importing a pick list.
NOTE  For this example, a full plate replication protocol was created before importing a 
384_controls.csv file.

After the pick list file is imported, the full plate replication protocol is merged with the 
384_Controls.csv. The new protocol is shown below.
Figure 4.24  Full Plate Replication Protocol with 384_Controls.csv
NOTE  The 384_Controls.csv file contents matches the regional information imported. The "yellow" 
wells indicate the wells that were imported from 384_Controls.csv.
NOTE  When importing a pick list with a custom source plate name, the mapping mode impacts how the 
pick lists are merged.
For a protocol with a regional mapping mode, the source plate name in the protocol and the source 
plate name in the pick list must match. If they don't match, the following occurs:
 • In the Import Pick List dialog box, if the user selects Source Plate Name for Column and 
checks the checkbox in the Import column, nothing is imported.
 • In the Import Pick List dialog box, if the user does not select Source Plate Name for Column 
and does not check the checkbox in the Import column, each of the source plates in the pick 
list are merged into one source plate in the protocol.
For a protocol with a custom mapping mode, if the user selects Source Plate Name for Column 
and checks the checkbox in the Import column in the Import Pick List dialog box, an additional 
source plate with the imported region will be added to the protocol.

Advanced Features  
Importing a Pick List
Importing a pick list from the Run Options dialog box is a quick way to run existing Echo Plate 
Reformat protocols with partial source plates as defined by an input file. This is commonly used to 
compress a sample library into 1536 well plates where one or more of the 384-well stock plates is 
unavailable. Using a pick list eliminates the need to create a unique protocol.
When importing a pick list via the Run Options dialog box, the pick list parameters override any 
plate parameters in the protocol for the run, with the exception of fixed plates. This is typically used 
for creating exact copies of a pick list plate.
NOTE  The pick list cannot be saved in the protocol. To save a pick list into an existing protocol, the Import 
Region Definitions feature must be used from the main Protocol window. See Importing Region 
Definitions for more information.
The pick list is a table of specific wells that have been selected from a group of wells for analysis. 
The pick list is typically created in a text or spreadsheet file.
Guidelines for defining pick list:
 • Pick lists using row and column location must use the one-based coordinate system, which 
means that the first well in the upper left corner of the microplate is labeled row 1, column 1, 
or (1,1).
 • Pick list must be saved in .csv file format to be used by the Echo Plate Reformat application.
NOTE  If an error is encountered when importing a pick list, the error message will show the column data that 
is needed.
To import a pick list:
1 Open the File menu and select Import Region Definitions or click on the Import Region Definitions 
icon in the Toolbar. This opens the Import Pick List dialog box.
2 Click Import to import the pick list.

Protocol Options Tab
The Protocol/Options window is accessible by clicking the Options tab behind the Protocol tab. This 
window enables the user to customize the survey, output, and reporting options for the Echo Plate 
Reformat application. These settings are automatically used for the protocol created.
Each of the sections in the Protocol Options Tab is explained in the following topics.
 • Understanding Protocol Options
 • Understanding Output Options
Understanding Protocol Options
The Protocol/Options window displays the following protocol and output options.
Figure 5.25  Options tab
NOTE  The options settings are similar to the Preferences/Options window, but apply only to the protocol 
displayed.
Surveys
There are two ways to manage survey history:
 • Re-Survey every source plate — Default setting that automatically surveys the source plate 
every time the protocol is run. Survey history is saved, but not referenced each time.
 • Maintain survey history — Used to store survey data for source plates.

C68408AA    5-25
Software Reference
Protocol Options Tab  5
With Maintain survey history chosen, information from the initial survey is referenced for 
subsequent transfers — eliminating the requirement to resurvey.
This feature can reduce processing time during a protocol run — particularly if the source plate 
is swapped several times during a protocol run. The user can specify the length of time that the 
survey data is retained, from a few minutes to never resurvey.
The software stores the survey data by plate barcode; therefore, the data is independent of the 
protocol and can be used across different protocols until the expiration time.
NOTE  Various factors can affect the content of the source wells, such as DMSO concentration, humidity, 
and exposure time during the transfer run; therefore, consider these factors when selecting an 
expiration time. For additional information, read the user note “How Long Will A Survey Last When 
Performing Acoustic Droplet Ejections?” or contact us).
The Maintain survey history function is located in the Options tab.

If the user selects Maintain survey history, an Expiration button appears.
Click Expiration to open the Survey Data Expiration dialog box and set the expiration values.
Figure 5.27  Survey Data Expiration dialog box

C68408AA     5-26
Software Reference
Protocol Options Tab  
The following parameters can be set in the Survey Data Expiration dialog box:
 • Never expires — Existing survey data is always re-used.
 • User-specified expiration time — Existing survey data is re-used for the time that is specified in 
minutes or Days:Hours:Minutes.
NOTE  If a stored survey does not cover the plate area that is required by the protocol (for example, some of 
the wells were empty when the plate was originally surveyed, but then filled later on), the software will 
survey the new wells and add this data to the stored survey data.
The stored survey data is instrument-specific. For example, if a source plate is surveyed in instrument A, 
the stored survey data cannot be used in instrument B.
Although survey history can be used indefinitely, it is not recommended.
Understanding Output Options
The output options are explained in the following topics:
 • Output Files
 • Transfer and Survey Reports
Output Files
The Output Files box in the Options window organizes the survey and transfer results according to 
the following criteria:
Figure 5.28  Output Files options
The following parameters can be set for output files:
 • Run-specific — All protocol data is stored in one file, in the order that the results are generated.
 • Plate-specific — Protocol data is stored in separate fi les, based on source or destination plates, 
depending on the process order specified in the main Protocol window.

and tested at Beckman Coulter (Echo-qualified). For this reason, source plates cannot be defined by 
the user. For existing source plates, only the barcode location can be edited. Contact Beckman 
Coulter to add more source plates.
Destination plate definitions — The Echo Liquid Handler is pr ogrammed with several compatible 
destination plates; however, the user can add destination plates through the Echo Plate Reformat 
Application or the Echo Liquid Handler software.

0; default is 15 ms. Higher speeds are useful to slow down the 
animation when transfers jump around the plate. For example, 
during backfills.
 • Plate Prompt (seconds)  — Controls the time interval that the 
plate prompt box is displayed, from 30 s to 0. Zero setting is 
useful to bypass the prompt box entirely and view the 
animation only.
 • Skip Animation  — Bypasses the animation step and shows 
only the transfer results for that step. This control enables the 
user to quickly review the plate mapping after each transfer 
step.
NOTE  This control does not bypass plate prompts or bulk fill 
displays.
 • Play  — Begins the simula ted fluid transfer.
 •C l o s e — Closes the simulation wind ow. If a simulation is in 
progress, it will need to be canceled before the window can 
be closed.

Focus Calibration
The Focus Calibration dialog box is automatically displayed when the user selects Run in the Run 
Options dialog box if the Echo Liquid Handler requires acoustic transducer calibration. This is also 
indicated by the yellow warning status indicator for Focus Calibration in the System Status section.
Figure 5.49  Focus Calibration Dialog Box
The Focus calibration procedure measures the focal length of the acoustic transducer and compares 
it to the previous measurement. If the difference between these measurements is minimal, then the 
system updates its calibration database with the new focal length and the procedure is finished. If 
the difference is larger than a preset threshold, users should call Beckman Coulter Service and 
Support to ensure the system is running properly before accepting the focal length new value.
It is recommended to select Yes and follow the focus calibration steps. If you choose to delay the 
focus calibration, you can click the Calibrate button next to the Focus Calibration status indicator in 
the System Status section in the Run Status window to start the focus calibration steps.
To run the Focus Calibration procedure:

C68408AA    Glossary-1
Glossary
There are many terms used throughout this guide that refer to parts of the Echo Plate Reformat 
application. It is useful to know and understand these terms before using the application.
Across — Indicates the ordering of transfers to occur in a row-wise manner.
Compression — Mapping of transfers from multiple source plates with a lower density format 
into destination plates of a higher density format. For example, 384-well to 1536-well compres-
sion.
Custom Mapping —  User defined mapping of transfers from source wells to destination wells in 
true any-well to any-well fashion.
Decompression — Mapping of transfers from source plates with a higher density format into 
multiple destination plates of a lower density format. For example, 1536-well to 384-well de-
compression.
Destination plate — Microplate receiving the transfer contents from one or more source plates.
Dest Offset — Designates transfer of fluids to a different location within the well. The default is 
to the center of the destination well. A positive Y value moves it toward the top of the plate. A 
positive X value moves it toward the right side of the plate.
Dest Region — Designates the plate mapping of the final location of the samples being trans-
ferred. The user can create more than one destination region.
Down  —  Indicates the ordering of transfers to occur in a column-wise manner.
Full plate replication — Transfer of contents from the wells of a source plate to a destination 
plate of an identical format. For example, 384-well to 384-well replication. 
Interleave pattern — A pattern consisting of source or destination wells separated by one or 
more wells in a column-wise or row-wise direction. 
Plate Format — Defines the physical plate based on the number of wells, plate material (for ex-
ample, PP, PS), and fluid capacity (for example, LDV).
Plate Type — Defines the transfer methodology appropriate for the contents transferred. 
Pre-Transfer Delay — Sets the time delay before starting the transfer line. It is used in cases 
where there may be a requirement to incubate shortly between transfers.
Quadrant — One quarter of the total wells available in a microplate. 
Regional Mapping — Mapping of transfers from source wells to destination wells according to 
pre-defined mapping modes. The pre-defined modes include full plate replication, compression, 
and decompression. 
Source plate — Echo qualified microplates containing samples or reagents for transfer to anoth-
er microplate serving as a destination plate.
C68408AA     Glossary-2
Glossary
  
Source Plate Regions — Sub-groups of wells within a microplate.
Transpose — Transfers contents from the column of one plate to the row of another plate, or 
from the row of one plate to the column of another plate. This option is available when adding 
a region.
Treat as Identical —  Indicates that the contents of wells in a selected source plate are identical. 
These wells can be used interchangeably to fill wells of a destination plate. Wells containing the 
largest volume in the group will be depleted until all wells have an equal volume. Once all wells 
are equal, contents will be transferred in a round-robin fashion. This option is commonly used 
for transfers from a group of wells to many wells across an entire plate or several plates. This 
option is available when adding a region.
