Why choose a 
KingFisher instrument?
Your samples, consistently
KingFisher instruments reduce user processing errors while 
increasing the reproducibility of your results. Our data show 
that samples processed with KingFisher instruments have 
consistent results across runs and diff  erent users, which is 
important for more sensitive downstream applications such 
as qPCR, NGS, digital PCR, and mass spectrometry.
Your samples, more easily
KingFisher instruments off  er optimized, easy-to-follow 
protocols for nearly every downstream application or 
sample type.

The KingFisher instrument experience
How KingFisher instruments work
KingFisher instruments automate extraction of DNA, RNA, protein, and cells by 
moving magnetic beads (not liquids), leading to clean extractions and enabling 
consistent results. Using a simple process (bind, wash, elute), KingFisher 
instruments can automate the extraction of any analyte of interest with a 
bead on it.

Magnetic beads mix with  
sample, binding to target
Magnetic rod is lowered 
into the solution; magnetic 
beads and target collect at 
the bottom of the tip comb
Magnetic rod retracts, 
bringing beads and target; 
can be positioned in 
another well
Beads are then released 
by moving the magnetic 
rods out of the tip comb; 
tip comb also facilitates the 
mixing of reagents with the 
beads as the magnetic head 
moves up and down
