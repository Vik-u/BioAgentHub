HiG™ AUTOMATED CENTRIFUGE 
 
 
• High centrifugal force 
• Imbalance tolerant 
• Better pelletizing 
• Cleaner supernatants 
• Faster filtration 
 
 
The BioNex HiG centrifuge line (U.S. Patent 9,446,417) 
delivers the highest speed of any robot accessible 
centrifuge on the market today. Capable of rapid 
acceleration, the HiG line provides better pelletizing, 
cleaner supernatants, and faster filtration. In addition, 
the HiG 4 incorporates Peltier cooling to keep samples 
at or close to ambient temperature operating at 
maximum RCF and duty cycle. 
The dual position rotor design accepts payloads up to 
350 grams per bucket, allowing most microplate 
configurations to be processed easily, including deep 
well blocks and filter plate assemblies. The balance 
intolerance is more forgiving of payload weight 
differences, promoting continual, uninterrupted 
operation, and provides vibrational stability for other 
instruments operating on the same platform. The 
large door opening allows buckets to be accessed 
directly by a wide range of laboratory robots without 
an intermediate plate loader, reducing the number of 
steps required and overall cycle time. 
The small footprint of the HiG centrifuges easily 
integrates with laboratory automation, and two units 
can be stacked to increase throughput. The HiG is 
completely powered by standard electrical service, 
eliminating the need for compressed air or other 
utilities.
