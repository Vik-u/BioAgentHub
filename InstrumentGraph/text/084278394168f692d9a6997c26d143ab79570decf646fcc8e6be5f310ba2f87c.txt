Hardware Overview  
The Scinomix MP2 hardware has been designed for ease of use.  The hardware consists of a label printer 
and a plate stage, with a label applicator arm that moves between them: 
 
 
 
       
Assembly 
The Scinomix Sci-Print MP2 is shipped in two separate units: a base unit, and a printer unit.  To assemble 
the MP2, remove the base unit from the packaging and place on a sturdy tabletop or lab bench.  Next, 
remove the printer unit from the packaging and place on top of the base unit, ensuring that the dowel 
pins on the base unit are aligned with the dowel holes on the printer unit:

The following image shows the various sensors and restrictors that may need to be adjusted occasionally 
(See Chapter 5: Maintenance  for more information about setup and adjustment of these sensors): 
 
 
 Vacuum detection threshold sensor Indicator: When this red indicator is illuminated this signifies 
that a label present on the tamp head when the vacuum valve is turned on. It should turn off after the 
label has been affixed to a microplate and is no longer present on the tamp head.  
Vacuum Sensor Adjust: This adjustor changes the tamp pad vacuum detection threshold.   
Air Pressure Threshold Sensor Indicator:  when this red indicator is on, the air pressure is sufficient 
for normal operation of the instrument. When this indicator is off the software will not allow instrument 
operation and an error will be shown in the software when trying to label a plate. 
Pressure Sensor Adjust: This adjustor changes the air pressure detection threshold.

Using the MP2 when integrated with another system 
The Scinomix Sci-Print MP2 is a single process microplate labeler that may be used as part of an 
integration system. Typically it is integrated with an automated sample handling instrument.  The 
adjustable platform on the MP2 plate labeler allows for printing on microtiter plates or deep well blocks, 
and labels can be applied on any side of a plate. 
Once the label stocks and label text layouts are defined, the printing and applying of labels is carried out 
under the control of the master instrument’s control application.  Plates are moved in and out of the Sci-
Print MP2 automatically using the controlling instrument’s arm.  In an integrated system, label data is 
sent to the MP2 through communication with the controlling instrument.

Connecting the Sci-Print MP2  
 
Air 
Connect the air on the back side of the instrument by pushing the blue air line into the air input.  
Test the connection by pulling on the air line; if you feel resistance, the air line is properly connected.  
(To remove the air line, gently push on the white outer ring of the air input and pull on the air line).  The 
other end of the air line should be connected to the air source.  Ensure that the air is turned on by 
moving the blue air switch to the horizontal “ON” position (the air switch is located on the right side of 
the machine, near the bottom of the label applicator arm).  Check that the air pressure is sufficient by 
noting the pressure on the pressure gauge on the right side of the MP2.  Adjust the pressure as needed 
using the regulator on the back panel of the MP2 controller . Note: The air pressure gauge measures 
pressure in Megapascals (MPa), see Appendix for conversion to Pounds per Square Inch. 
Power  There is one 24V power cord for the printer and an external AC/DC 24V converter for the base 
unit that plugs into the jack on the base. 
RS232  Connect the RS232 cable to the port on the back of the MP2, and then connect the other end to 
the computer.  If the computer you are using does not have a serial port, you will need to use a serial-
USB adaptor. 
 
Starting the Sci-Print MP2 
 
First check the following items 
- Your computer  is connected to the MP2 using RS232  
- The MP2 has an air supply attached  
- The MP2 power button is on 
 
When the MP2 is powered on and ready, make sure that all other integrated instrumentation is on.

Using the Sci-Print MP2 User Interface for Setup and Diagnostics 
 
As previously mentioned, when the Sci-Print MP2 is used within an integrated laboratory automation 
system, it operates under the control of that third-party system.  However, the MP2 user interface must 
be used to configure plate type, define the label stock and text, and can also be accessed for 
troubleshooting purposes.   
 
When the MP2 is integrated with a third-party instrument, the controlling instrument’s user interface 
will include a link to the MP2 interface.  The Driver Utilities screen is then brought up. From this screen, 
the user selects the configuration menu at the top of the screen to create new label stocks and label 
layouts (Described in Chapter 3).  The diagnostics menu is accessed to view logs and see the status of 
various inputs and outputs of the instrument.  
 
Plate Configuration Screen 
From the configuration menu at the top of the screen, select “Plate configuration” to open the menu:

optional).   
Set Pickup Angle : This is the angle of the plate when it is placed or picked from a robotic arm.  Begin by 
clicking on the “Home” button, then use the jog buttons to move the stage clockwise or 
counterclockwise as needed. 
Print Height: This is the height of the plate where the label is applied.  It can be adjusted up and down as 
needed for different plate types 
Pickup Height: This is the height of the plate when it is placed or picked by a robotic arm. Begin by 
clicking on the “Home” button, then use the jog buttons to move the stage up or down as needed. 
When a plate has been created or edited to the desired specifications, click “OK” to save the plate data.

 and then clicking the “Update” button will display the label 
preview.  More information about this is found in Chapter 3: Label Design. 
 
Device Configuration Screen 
Click on the Configuration menu to access the Device Configuration screen: 
 
 
Set  Safe Move Position- In some instances, a safe height position must be set so that the stage 
movement of the MP2 does not interfere with other integrated instruments. Begin by homing the stage, 
then jog the stage as needed.  
Set North Position Offset - This is the angle at which the stage is set to optimize the application of the 
label on the plate by the tamper.  This angle will be close to zero.  Begin by homing the stage (enable the 
“Home with no offset” checkbox), then jog the stage clockwise or counterclockwise until the tamp head 
16  Chapter 2.   Startup for MP2 Operating with an Integration System

Chapter 3.   Label Design 
 
Overview 
The MP2 can be set up to run print jobs on a variety of user-named label stocks.  Each is set up to 
support best print quality based on size, material, stiffness, and adhesion.   A label editor is provided to 
enter the properties of a label stock.   
 
Defining Label Stock 
  
To use the label editor, go to the configuration menu on the Main Screen, then select “Label Stock” 
 
 
 
18  Chapter 3.   Label Design  
 
Scinomix Sci-Print MP2 Version 1.2 
The Label Stock Editor Screen will be displayed: 
 
 
 
 
This screen allows the user to define the physical characteristics of the label being used, including the 
length of the label, the width of the label, and the span of the label (i.e. the distance from the leading 
edge of one label to the leading edge of the next label).  For most microplates, the label size is set at ¼” 
length and 2” width.  The margins, peel off speed and distance, and heat settings can also be adjusted.   
Once any desired changes are made, Click OK to save or Cancel to cancel without saving.  You can also 
create a new label, copy an existing label, and delete an existing label from the Label Stock Editor 
screen.  See the image below for label measurement definitions:

Defining Label Text and Print Layout 
To use the Label Document editor, go to the configuration menu on the Main Screen and Select “Label 
Documents” 
 
The Label Document Configuration screen will open and display the label used most recently .  Use 
the drop down menu to select another document, or use the New, Copy, or Delete buttons to create, 
copy, or delete label documents, respectively. 
 
21  Chapter 3.   Label Design  
 
Scinomix Sci-Print MP2 Version 1.2 
 
   Choose the type of label stock to be used using the drop down menu of the Stock Definition Field 
  To add text fields, click on the “add” button. The maximum number of print fields is 10. Text can be 
printed in a variety of ways. For Fixed Text , click the Fixed Text radio button and enter the desired text.  
This data will always be printed on the label and does not change (an example of fixed text might be a 
company name to be printed on every label). Click on the Current Date  button to print the date, 
selecting a month/day/year format from the dropdown menu. Print data that is sent through commands 
from the controlling instrumentation to the MP2 is simulated by clicking the  Prompt  button and adding 
a representation of the text to be printed in the corresponding box. 
  Select the positioning of the text on the label by entering numeric values in the Left and Top Margin 
fields of the Position field. Note that once the text has been displayed on the label preview screen, the 
user can click on the text and drag and drop to the desired location, which will automatically set the left 
and top margin values.  (For the standard MP2, the text cannot be angled; this value is always zero). 
Click the “Refresh” button at any time to update the layout of the label. 
   Select the size and format of the barcode if the data is to be displayed as a barcode as shown in the 
example screen above.  When the option to display a field as text is enabled, the “Barcode Style” field is 
replaced with a “Text Style” field as shown below. 
 
Make any changes to the font as necessary. 
 
When the label document is complete, click “OK” to save or “Cancel” to cancel the label document.   
 
 
 
Checking Label Text and Layout for integrated instruments 
A good way to test the suitability of your label text and layout is to use the label editing capabilities 
displayed on the Printing Utilities screen: 
22  Chapter 4.   Sci-Print MP2 Integration Interface  
 
Scinomix Sci-Print MP2 Version 1.2 
 
 
Because the actual label text is coming from the controlling instrument, text from prompted fields 
shown on the Label Preview is merely sample text coming from the “Prompt” fields set up in the label 
designer.  The sample text is listed in the Default Text Fields.  To check the suitability of your text you 
should input data that is representative of the data that will ultimately be printed on your labels, then 
click “Update”.  You may find that longer strings of data will run off the label, requiring you to make the 
font smaller or change the orientation.  This is especially important when printing barcodes because a 
barcode reader will not be able to read any labels in which the barcode has run off the end. 
Chapter 4.   Sci-Print MP2 Integration Interface  
 
The driver provided by Scinomix for the Sci-Print MP2 is a Microsoft .dot net assembly using the version

Chapter 5. Maintenance 
Overview 
The MP2 has been designed for high-throughput usage and requires minimal maintenance.  However, 
proper periodic maintenance is important to ensure optimal performance.  Powering down the 
instrument is recommended daily.  
Printer 
 This section will cover general maintenance tasks. (For detailed information about the printer, refer to 
the CAB manual that was provided with your instrument) 
Loading Labels from a Roll 
 Refer to the picture below and the corresponding instructions.  The white arrows indicate the direction 
of the barcode labels 
 
1.  Unlock the label holder on the label source spool and pull up to remove.   
2.  Turn the green lever on the print head counterclockwise to open the print head .  Pull back 
the clamp at the bottom of the print roller . 
3.  Load the labels on the label source spool with the label side facing up so that the labels will 
make contact with the print head.   
4.  Thread the labels under the axis pin  and up through the label sensor .  The labels should 
be between the print head and the print roller 
38  Chapter 5. Maintenance  
 
Scinomix Sci-Print MP2 Version 1.2 
5.  Continue to thread the labels around the peel plate , behind the label blowing mechanism, 
and around the bottom of the roller.  Place the end of the label strips in one of the slots on the 
label rewind spool  and turn counterclockwise until the labels are loaded.  While holding the 
label rewind spool, turn the green screw on the top counterclockwise until it is tight. 
6.  Turn the green lever on the print head clockwise to close the print head, close the clamp on the 
bottom of the print roller, and replace the label holder on the label source spool. 
 
Loading Ribbon 
Refer to the picture below and the corresponding instructions.  The arrows indicate the direction of the 
barcode ribbon. 
 
1.  Place a ribbon roll on the ribbon source spool  so that the ink side of the ribbon will make 
contact with the labels.  Note that with some ribbon materials it may be difficult to tell which 
side contains ink.  Pressing something sticky on each side of the ribbon to see which side yields 
ink can be helpful. 
2.  While holding the ribbon source spool, turn the green screw on the top of the spool 
counterclockwise until it is tight. 
3.  Turn the green lever on the print head  counterclockwise to open the print head 
4.  Thread the ribbon down from the ribbon source spool and around the print head so that the 
ribbon will make contact the labels.   
39  Chapter 5. Maintenance  
 
Scinomix Sci-Print MP2 Version 1.2 
5.  Attach the end of the ribbon to the cardboard insert (a barcode label works well) and press on 
to the ribbon rewind spool  as seen in the picture.  While holding the ribbon rewind spool, 
turn the green screw on the top counterclockwise until tight.   Then turn the entire spool 
counterclockwise until the ribbon is fully threaded. 
6.  Turn the green lever on the print head clockwise to close the print head. 
 
 
Cleaning the Print Head 
Every time the printer ribbon is changed, the print head should be cleaned.  While the print head is 
open, wipe down the inner surfaces with an alcohol wipe.  This will minimize smudging from excess 
ribbon ink. 
Cleaning the Peel Plate 
Over time, the peel plate and surrounding areas may build up label adhesive residue, causing labels to 
stick to the peel plate.  To access the peel plate, turn off air to the instrument by turning the blue air 
switch clockwise to the vertical position.  Use the hexagonal key provided to unscrew the peel plate.  
Remove any labels that might be stuck to the peel plate and thoroughly clean the plate with an 
appropriate solvent. 
 
Sensor Adjustments 
 
Refer to the picture below : 
40  Chapter 5. Maintenance  
 
Scinomix Sci-Print MP2 Version 1.2 
 
Vacuum Sensor Adjustment   To correctly adjust this setting, swing the tamp arm to the labeling 
position using the hardware diagnostics screen and ensure the holes in the tamp pad are all clear with 
no obstructions blocking them (label etc).  Turn on the vacuum valve and place a label or small piece of 
paper on the tamp pad to block all of the vacuum holes (it should remain on the tamp head with the 
vacuum turned on). If the vacuum detection threshold sensor indicator is illuminated turn the adjuster 
screw counterclockwise until the indicator turns off. Slowly turn the adjuster screw clockwise until the 
indicator turns on and then stop turning immediately. Check operation by removing the label and 
turning off the vacuum valve. Turn the vacuum valve on. With no label on the tamp pad the vacuum 
detection threshold sensor indicator should remain off. Place a label on the tamp head to fully cover the 
vacuum holes and it should turn.  Note: because of hysteresis in the sensor the indicator will not always 
turn off when the label is removed with the vacuum valve still turned on. Repeat this procedure if 
necessary.  
Pressure Sensor Adjustment   To set this adjustment, set the air pressure coming into the 
machine to 80PSI by use of an external regulator. Turn the built in regulator all the way in so that it is 
41  Chapter 5. Maintenance  
 
Scinomix Sci-Print MP2 Version 1.2 
not regulating the air pressure in any way. Turn this adjuster screw clockwise until the air pressure 
threshold sensor indicator illuminates. Now turn the adjuster screw counterclockwise until the indicator 
goes off and stop turning immediately. When the external regulator is turned up the air pressure 
threshold sensor indicator should illuminate somewhere in the range of 80 - 85 PSI. Repeat this 
adjustment procedure if necessary. Once complete, readjust the internal regulator set point to 90 PSI.  
Blow Adjust    As labels are printed, air is blown onto the underside of the label to blow it toward 
the tamp pad.  The blow adjust regulates the amount of air that is blown.  If too much air is blown, the 
labels may rotate slightly, resulting in uneven application of the labels onto plates.  If too little air is 
applied, labels may not always be picked up by the tamp head. Turn the knob clockwise to decrease the 
air, and turn the knob counterclockwise to increase the air.   
CCW Speed Adjust  This knob regulates the speed of the tamp arm as it travels from the printer to 
the stage (counterclockwise as you face the knob).  Turn the knob clockwise to decrease the speed; turn 
the knob counterclockwise to increase the speed. 
CW Speed Adjust   This knob regulates the speed of the tamp arm as it travels from the stage to the 
printer (clockwise as you face the knob).  Turn the knob clockwise to decrease the speed; turn the knob 
counterclockwise to increase the speed. 
Extend Speed Adjust   This knob regulates the speed of the tamper as it extends to affix a label to a 
plate on the stage. Turn the knob clockwise to decrease the speed; turn the knob counterclockwise to 
increase the speed. 
Retract Speed Adjust  This knob regulates the speed of the tamper as it retracts after placing a 
label on a plate on the stage. Turn the knob clockwise to decrease the speed; turn the knob 
counterclockwise to increase the speed. 
Label Alignment 
The MP2 plate stage may be adjusted to apply offset labels, or to center labels that are not a standard 
size.  Use an Allen wrench to loosen the screws on either side of the stage, then move the stage as 
needed (this picture shows the back screw; both screws need to be loosened before the stage will 
move):

Tamp Pad Alignment 
The picture below shows the proper positioning of the tamp head in relation to the peel plate of the 
label printer.  They should be very close but not touching:
