ZenoTOF 7600+ System
21/82
Theory of Operation
Mass spectrometry measures the mass-to-charge ratio of ions to identify and quantify
compounds.
The ZenoTOF 7600+ system has a series of quadrupole filters that select or transmit ions
according to their mass-to-charge ratio (m/z). The first quadrupole in this series is the QJet ion
guide, which is located between the orifice plate and the Q0 region. The QJet ion guide does not
filter ions, but focuses them before they enter the Q0 region. By prefocusing the larger ion flux
created by the wider orifice, the QJet ion guide increases instrument sensitivity and improves the
signal-to-noise ratio. In the Q0 region, the ions are further focused before passing into the Q1
quadrupole.
The Q1 quadrupole works in two operational modes: TOF MS and TOF MS/MS.
• For TOF MS experiments, all ions across the experimental m/z range are passed through to
the electron-activated dissociation (EAD) cell/Q2 collision cell.
• For TOF MS/MS experiments, only ions with specified mass-to-charge ratios are transmitted
to the EAD cell/Q2 collision cell. All others are eliminated by defocusing away from the ion
path axis.
After transmission through the Q1 quadrupole, ions are fragmented by either EAD or collisionally
activated dissociation (CAD). In EAD mode, the precursor ions in the EAD cell are stored briefly
and then exposed to electrons to promote electron-activated dissociation of the precursor ion
to fragment ions. In CAD mode, fragment ions are created through vibrational excitation of the
precursor ion resulting from collisions with gas molecules in the Q2 collision cell.
In both fragmentation modes, after passing through the Q2 collision cell, the ions enter the
time-of-flight (TOF) analyzer for accurate mass measurement. After acceleration and focusing,
ions fly through the flight chamber and reach the detector at different times depending on their
mass-to-charge ratio. At the detector, impinging ions create an electrical pulse, the amplitude of
which is directly proportional to the quantity of ions impacting the detector. The analog-to-digital
convertor (ADC) measures both the time and amplitude of the signal from the detector, which
translate, respectively, to a mass-to-charge ratio and signal intensity. The software converts this
data to mass spectra that can be observed by the user.
The Zeno trap is a patented technology that permits total recovery of duty cycle losses for all
ions in TOF mass spectrometry. At this time, it is applied in MSMS mode only. When the Zeno
trap is active, ions that are usually lost between TOF pulses are stored in the Q2 collision cell. At
the appropriate time, they are released in a mass-dependent fashion (high-m/z ions first). As a
result, all masses arrive almost simultaneously at the accelerator, to be pulsed into the TOF. This
process eliminates the duty cycle losses that occur during normal operation without the Zeno
trap because ions are not sampled between TOF pulses. With CAD fragmentation, the Zeno trap
pulsing is applied on a data-dependent, on-demand basis. With EAD fragmentation, pulsing is
applied full time.
