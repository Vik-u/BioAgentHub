Maintenance guide for cell dispensing with 
Thermo Scientific Multidrop Combi 
The peristaltic pump technology of the Thermo 
Scientific Multidrop Combi and Multidrop 
dispensing cassettes assure a fast and gentle way 
of dispensing cells on any plate and well size. 
Cells remain intact and viable, and the plate 
can be used for any cell-based assay needed. 
This technical note describes practical guidelines 
for cell dispensing with Multidrop Combi and 
dispensing cassette maintenance.
Selection of the dispensing cassette
Selection of the optimal dispensing cassette for cell 
suspension depends on the volume of the dispensing 
and the plate type (i.e. the size of the well).
Volume
•	 Small tube dispensing cassette: Dispensing 
volume < 50 µl (plastic tips recommended 
rather than metal tips)
•	 Standard tube dispensing cassette: Dispensing 
volume > 50 µl
Plate type
•	 Small tube dispensing cassette: 96-, 384- and 
1536-well plate 
•	 Standard tube dispensing cassette: 6-, 24-, 48-,  
96- and 384-well plate 
It is highly recommended to use a separate 
dispensing cassette for different cell lines in order to 
avoid any contamination or mixing of the cell lines.
Priming the dispensing cassette
Before dispensing the cell suspension, prime the 
instrument with PBS to wet the tubing and tips. 
The volume of the PBS for priming depends on the 
dispensing cassette.
•	 Small tube dispensing cassette: ~2 ml (including 
dead volume for filling the tubing)
•	 Standard tube dispensing cassette: ~10 ml 
(including dead volume for filling the tubing)
Prime the dispensing cassette with the cell 
suspension before dosing to reach an equal 
distribution of the cells on the plate. The volume of 
the cell suspension needed for priming depends on 
the dispensing cassette.
•	 Small tube dispensing cassette: dead volume + 
500 µl
•	 Standard tube dispensing cassette:  dead volume 
+ 1 ml 
Dispensing
The maximum cell concentration for the dispensing 
depends on the cell line. It is possible to spread the 
cells evenly in the well by dispensing cells with the 
Multidrop
® Combi. Figure 1 shows the distribution 
of the cells on the 96-well plate with two cell 
concentrations.

and b) after priming with 10 ml of PBS.
Practical tips on cell dispensing
•	 When dispensing several plates, use for 
example, the orbital shaker for gentle mixing 
while dispensing to keep the cells suspended.
•	 A stir plate with magnetic stir bar in the cell 
suspension is effective for maintaining the cells 
in suspension. The cells should be stirred at a 
fairly slow speed, just enough to keep them in 
suspension, but not enough to create a vortex 
or frothing, which will adversely affect cell 
viability. Ensure that the tubing stays to one 
side, out of the way of the stir bar.
•	 When dispensing the same cell line later in the 
same day, prime with PBS to rinse the tubing 
after the dispensing and before starting a new 
dispensing later. It is possible to leave the tubing 
filled with PBS for 1 hour. If the time between 
dispenses is longer, rinse the tubing with ddH
2O 
to avoid any precipitation on the tips.
Cleaning the dispensing cassette
Clean the dispensing cassette shortly after dispensing to 
avoid any clogging!
After dispensing cells, rinse the tubing by priming 
with 10-15 ml PBS to remove cells remaining 
on the tubing. To fully clean the tubing and the 
tips, complete the following washing instructions. 
Separate dispensing cassettes for different cell lines 
recommended to ensure that the cell lines do not 
contaminate.
To clean the dispensing cassette, prime with a mild 
detergent (e.g. TWEEN
®-20 or TritonTM X-100) or 
a cleaning solution (e.g. 1% Micro-90® Cleaning 
Solution by Cole-Parmer) and to disinfect tubing, 
rinse with 10% bleach.
•	 Small tube dispensing cassette: 5-10 ml
•	 Standard tube dispensing cassette: 15-20 ml 
After cleaning the tubing, prime twice with ddH
2O 
to rinse the tubing. Use two separate tubes of water. 
There are remains of the detergent on the outer 
surface of the tubing that mixes with the first rinsing 
water.
•	 Standard tube dispensing cassette : min. 20 ml 
•	 Small tube dispensing cassette: min. 10 ml

Uneven amount of cells per well
Insufficient priming with the cell suspension:
•	 Follow the instructions for priming the 
dispensing cassette
The cell tube/bottle has been standing without 
gentle mixing before dispensing:
•	 Create the dispensing protocol beforehand
•	 Have the right amount of plates in hand (next 
to the instrument)
•	 Gently mix when dispensing several plates
A clumpy cell suspension:
•	 Check the cell suspension for clumps
Unexpected amount of dead cells after dispensing
Check your cell batch viability before dispensing.
Insufficient rinsing can affect the cell viability:
•	 Rinse tubing thoroughly after cleaning with 
bleach or mild detergents
Water can affect the cell viability:
•	 If the tubing has been wet with water, prime 
with PBS before dispensing

Troubleshooting
Clogging
Reasons for clogging:
•	 Cell clumps in the suspension
•	 Leaving the cell culture to stand in the tubing
•	 No priming with PBS done to wet the tubing
•	 Ethanol used for washing the tubing after cell 
dispensing (precipitates proteins)
To clean the blockage:
•	 Use a mild detergent or cleaning solution (it 
is possible to let the detergent remain in the 
tubing for 5 to 10 minutes to break down the 
cells and dissolve the clog)
•	 Prime and empty the tubing several times with a 
mild detergent and rinse properly with ddH
2O
•	 Using the enclosed syringe and tubing to 
backflush clogged tips individually is usually 
effective. Always remember to rinse with 
ddH2O.
To prevent clogging: 
•	 Use an even suspension of single cells
•	 Prime with PBS before and after dispensing
•	 Clean the dispensing cassette immediately after 
dispensing
Frothing
The cell culture media includes serum, that may 
cause frothing, especially on the metal tip cassette. 
Tips on how to minimize frothing:
•	 Do not empty the tubing between dispensing 
different liquids, and use prime to replace the 
solution with the new liquid
•	 Use a lower dispensing speed, medium speed 
usually works best
•	 Use a lower mixing speed
•	 Use less serum, if possible, or switch to a low 
concentration of BSA (0.1% or 0.05%) if cells 
do not need to be attached
