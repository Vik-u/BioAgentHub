High-precision Colony Picker

      : Join the 
dawn of precision 
colony picking

PIXL is changing the game 
for colony picking precision, 
sterility, and ease-of-use.
WHAT IS PIXL?
PIXL is an ultra-reliable and super-easy-to-use microbial 
colony picker. It automates imaging, colony recognition, 
colony selection, and picking; from Petri dishes to multi-
well plates.

HOW DOES IT WORK?
 ·
PIXL uses new, patent pending Pinpoint™ picking technology, 
meticulously developed for a step-change in reliability and sterility. 
Using the freshly-cut end of a sterile PickupLine™ to transfer 
microbial colonies, it eliminates the requirement for washing cycles 
and the associated chance of contamination, at a fraction of the cost 
of traditional tips. 
Pinpoint™ can cope with any variation in agar height, automatically. 
It detects the surface and regulates the contact pressure for every 
pick. Which is a big deal! This ensures that every single colony on 
your plate is picked, without damaging, missing or splashing cells 
all over the place. The motors are accurate to 50 microns, to enable 
selection of even the smallest hits, and the picking profiles are 
adjustable to optimise for the most tenacious colonies. 
PIXL contains a scientific grade, colour camera and 6-channel, 
flat-field SpectraStar™ incident illumination to capture high-
resolution colony images from Petri dishes and rectangular 
PlusPlates. PIXL will automatically detect colonies, quantify 
phenotypes and allow target selection based on size, circularity, 
colour intensity, proximity, and fluorescence marker.

WHY DO I NEED PIXL?
PIXL was developed in collaboration with leading synthetic 
biology incubators, SynCTI and SynbiCITE, and industrial partners 
SynthACE and Ginkgo Bioworks. All of whom were unhappy with 
existing colony picking options. We listened. We collaborated. We 
welcome: PIXL.

“THIS IS A BIG DEAL FOR 
SYNTHETIC BIOLOGISTS”

WHAT FORMAT SOURCE PLATES DOES 
IT TAKE?
 
PIXL accepts 90mm and 150mm Petri dishes, as well as 
rectangular plates such as Singer PlusPlates.
 
 
WHAT FORMAT TARGET PLATES DOES 
IT TAKE?
 
PIXL pins onto agar or into liquid, on SBS-format rectangular 
plates, including 96 and 384 PCR and multiwell plates — both 
shallow and deep.

PICKUPLINE™
 
Singer Instruments have over thirty years of precision microbial 
cell and colony picking experience. Whether colony picking from 
high-density E. coli arrays, or tetrad dissection with single yeast 
spores, Singer Instruments are trusted by thousands of labs 
worldwide. We have learnt a lot about colony picking over the 
years, and have used this experience to develop PickupLine™.
PickupLine™ is a 1mmø bespoke polymer extrusion, available 
in sterile 200m reels. Load a single reel into PIXL to form up to 
33,000 sterile, disposable tips. Its cutting-characteristics allow 
PIXL ’s precision blade to produce a tip perfect for picking bacteria 
and fungal colonies.
 · Select up to 33,000 colonies with each PickupLine™
 · Sterile
 · Tips optimised for microbial colony picking

SOFTWARE
 
PIXL is incredibly easy to use. 90% of the functionality can 
be learnt by anybody in as little as 10 minutes, without 
instruction. The touch-screen interface will guide you through 
your workflow setup to get you picking the right colonies in 
minutes, and with ease.
Our software engineers understand your biology! We spend a 
lot of time with our collaborators to make sure that our user 
interface thinks like you do.
 
You told us that PIXL needed to:
 · Be easy to use by anybody in the lab
 · Adapt to your protocol
 · Trace and export every plate, colony and parameter
 
 
We took this and implemented a user-first approach to PIXL ’s 
development, implementing a simple, 7 stage process: 
 
Login - Each user has their own passworded profile. PIXL 
remembers last used settings; stores templates; and logs 
user actions and parameters.
Select Source Plate - Petri or PlusPlate. Pick from the whole 
plate or define sectors of interest.
Select Lighting Channel - Use white, or one of 5 other 
fluorescent channels.
Detect Colonies - Filter based on: size, intensity, colour or 
circularity. Pick them all, or choose a sorted, or randomised 
subset.
Select Target Plate - Select number of replicates; on any 
density, in any pattern, agar or liquid.
Pick Colonies - Review your routine, estimated time and 
number of plates required, then press go and walk away.
Export Data - Export your routine, colony information and 
parameters as a CSV file.

SPECTRASTAR™ LIGHTING
 
6 SpectraStar™ lighting channels enable simultaneous colony 
detection across multiple fluorescent wavelengths, making 
experiments quicker and more cost-effective. PIXL will quantify 
and allow selection for wtGFP, sfGFP, mCherry, tagBFP and Venus 
as standard. This is not a microscope! It is a colony picker. As such 
it will not detect sub-cellular or low levels of expression. 
 
PIXL ’s LEDs are configured as standard to emit: Blue, Cyan, Green, 
2 intensities of UV and white light. The Normalised Power vs. 
Wavelength of the LEDs is shown below.  
 
PIXL accepts standard 50mm filters. The filters can be manually 
inserted in front of the CMOS camera on a manual sliding 
mechanism. You can easily switch between all of your favourite 
lighting conditions to filter for the markers that interest you. To 
see if your favourite fluorescent marker is supported, please get in
