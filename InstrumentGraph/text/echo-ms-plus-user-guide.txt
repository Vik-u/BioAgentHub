Theory of Operation
The Echo® MS+ module is a high-speed, high-throughput liquid sampling device. The Echo®
MS+ module uses the ADE and OPI technology to introduce the sample from the wellplate to
the mass spectrometer. This contactless transfer of samples from the microplates into the mass
spectrometer reduces cross contamination of samples and mass spectrometer signals.
The Echo® MS+ module interfaces with the SCIEX OS software. Sample management, data
acquisition, and data processing are monitored and analyzed with the acquisition computer. The
sample plate is placed on the plate gripper either manually or by a robotic handler. The user then
optimizes and sets the parameters for an acquisition method in the SCIEX OS software. The
plate gripper inserts the sample wellplate to the Echo® MS+ module. The Echo® MS+ module
makes use of the ADE and OPI technology to introduce the sample from the microplate to the
mass spectrometer.

Note:
• A 6 inch long-arm centrifuge is recommended for the best performance.
• The sample plates must be spun in a centrifuge to remove any bubbles that were created
when the samples were dispensed to the plate.
• The centrifuge speed (rpm) is calculated in inches as follows:
rpm = sqrt (G-Force / (0.0000284 ✕ Rotor Radius))
• The specifications for the sample volume for the the 384 and 1536 plates are as follows:
• Echo ® MS+ qualified 384 plate: 20 uL to 65 uL
• Echo ® MS+ qualified 1536 plate: 3 uL to 6 uL
• DMSO sample: 3 uL to 5.5 uL
Note: DMSO samples are hygroscopic and can absorb moisture from the air, which can
cause them to contain more than the specified volume range.
• 1536 plate: It is recommended to avoid volumes close to the top and bottom limits of the
specifications. DMSO samples are hygroscopic and can absorb moisture from the air and
can cause well plate to overflow.
4. Remove each sample plate and then put it on the orbital shaker.
5. Shake the plate with the recommended shaker settings that follows:
• For AQ, SP, and DMSO fluids: 1,350 rpm for 1 minute
6. Put the sample plate on the Echo ® MS+ module.
Note: We recommend that the sample plate be prepared with the previously specified
settings. Make sure that the centrifuge and shaker settings are correct for the centrifuge,
shaker, and fluid combination used.

Note: The Extended Port Wash option lets the user do a one-time extended flush with
the OPI wash solvent without changes to the saved OPI port wash protocol. The OPI
carrier solvent recovery purges any liquid that stays in the OPI. This keeps the mixing of
different solvents in the OPI to a minimum. The software then automatically primes and
equilibrates the OPI port with the carrier solvent and makes sure that the Echo® MS+
system is ready for the next analysis.

Troubleshooting 7
Examine the Fluidics Module
1. Examine the fluidics module for evidence of biological growth or dirt.
If either is present, then contact an FSE to clean the fluidics module.
2. Visually examine the system tubing and fittings.
Look for broken fittings and dried deposits that might show a slow leak.
a. Tighten any loose connections.
b. If a fluid tubing connection is broken, then replace the tubing, and then clean the fluidics
module. Contact an FSE to replace and then clean the fluidics module.
3. Visually examine the system for pinched tubing and for bubbles in the flow path.
If required, straighten the tubing. If the issue, is not resolved, then replace the tubing.
OPI Leak or Overflow
An OPI overflow shows that the carrier or wash solvent is delivered to the OPI port faster than
the ion source can aspirate it. The overflow might be caused by wear on the electrode assembly
or collected deposits of matrix material at the OPI port. SCIEX recommends to do the required
maintenance of the OPI port more frequently. Refer to the section: OPI Port Wash.
To troubleshoot an OPI leak or overflow, refer to the flow-diagram as follows:
