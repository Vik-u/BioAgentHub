Acquisition with an Echo® MS+
System 1
This section supplies information about the use of the SCIEX OS software to acquire acoustic
ejection-mass spectrometry (AEMS) data. The section gives descriptions of the MS method and
AE method parameters, batches, batch calibration, and system preparation.
MS Method
Source and Gas Parameters
The Echo® MS probe on the OptiFlow Turbo V ion source operates with the open port interface
(OPI) on the Echo® MS+ system to aspirate, nebulize, and ionize samples and then supply
the samples to the ZenoTOF 7600 mass spectrometer. A narrow range of source and gas
parameters is recommended for this workflow.
Figure 1-1 Source and Gas Parameters
Table 1-1 Source and Gas Parameters
Parameter Comments
Ion source gas 1
(psi)
Set the pressure for ion source gas 1. Ion source gas 1 pulls the carrier
solvent from the OPI port to the ion source. Set to 90. Lower values might
cause leaks in the OPI.
Ion source gas 2
(psi)
Set the pressure for ion source gas 2. This gas dissolves the carrier solvent
in the ion source. Optimize the Ion source gas 2 (psi) value for the
composition and flow rate of the carrier solvent. A starting value of 50 is
recommended.

RUO-IDV-05-15796-B
Table 1-1 Source and Gas Parameters (continued)
Parameter Comments
Curtain gas (psi) Set the pressure for the gas for the Curtain Gas interface. This gas helps
prevent contamination of the ion optics. Use the highest possible value that
does not decrease sensitivity. Higher values decrease contamination with a
small decrease in signal intensity.
CAD gas Set the pressure in the collision cell. For TOF MS experiments, set to 7 for
collisional cooling of the ions. For TOF MS/MS experiments, optimize the
CAD gas value for fragmentation of the analyte ions.
Temperature
(°C)
Optimize the temperature for the composition and flow rate of the carrier
solvent. A starting value of 300 is recommended. Temperature settings
more than 400 are not recommended. High temperatures can decrease the
life of the electrode and can also cause lower sensitivity for thermally labile
compounds.
Parameters for TOF MS Experiments
Figure 1-2 TOF MS Parameters
Table 1-2 TOF MS Parameters
Parameter Comments
Polarity Identify the ionization mode. Select Positive or Negative. Polarity switching
is not available.
TOF start mass
(Da)
Identify the mass at the start of the target mass range. The TOF start mass
(Da) must be less than the TOF stop mass (Da).
TOF stop mass
(Da)
Identify the mass at the end of the target mass range. The TOF stop mass
(Da) must be more than the TOF start mass (Da).
Accumulation
time (s)
Identify the time that is required for the mass spectrometer to acquire one
TOF MS spectrum. A starting value of 0.08 is recommended.

Table 1-2 TOF MS Parameters (continued)
Parameter Comments
Spray voltage
(V)
Identify the voltage to be applied to the probe electrode. Optimize the spray
voltage for the composition and flow rate of the carrier solvent. To maximize
the life of the electrode, do not use a value more than 4500.
Declustering
potential (V)
Identify the voltage to be applied at the orifice to minimize the formation
of ion clusters. Different compounds might have different optimum
declustering potentional (DP) values. The DP value is used for the full mass
range.
DP spread (V) Type a value for the DP spread (DPS). Together with the Declustering
potential (V), this parameter controls the DP that is applied to the ions. The
DP is increased gradually from a low value of DP – DPS to a high value of
DP + DPS.
ITC mode Select Dynamic or Fixed. In dynamic mode, the ion flow is continuously
monitored and automatically adjusted to prevent damage to the detector.
In fixed mode, the user sets a value in the ITC field. Dynamic mode adds
27 ms to the cycle time, to monitor the ion flow before the start of the
experiment.
Note: Dynamic mode is only available for TOF MS experiments.
Collision energy
(V)
Identify the voltage to be applied in the collision cell. In TOF MS
experiments, a low value is used to move ions through the collision cell
without fragmentation.
CE spread (V) This parameter is not usually used in TOF MS experiments.
ITC Identify the percentage of ions that will go into the mass spectrometer.
When fixed mode is in use, monitor the ion intensity. Start with a low value
and increase the value in small increments until the signal strength gets to
the required minimum. If the expected ion intensity is not known, then use
dynamic mode. Consistent high ion intensity or short periods of very high
ion intensity can cause permanent damage to the detector.
Note: This parameter is applicable when ITC mode is set to Fixed.

ZenoTOF 7600/7600+ mass spectrometer. When activated, this feature
makes the duty cycle better and increases signal strength.
Apply TOF start/
stop mass
Select to set the TOF mass range manually. If this option is not selected,
then a default mass range of 20 Da centered on the specified fragment ion
is used.
TOF Start Mass
(Da)
Identify the mass at the start of the target mass range. The TOF Start Mass
(Da) must be less than the TOF Stop Mass (Da).
TOF Stop Mass
(Da)
Identify the mass at the end of the target mass range. The TOF Stop Mass
(Da) must be more than the TOF Start Mass (Da).
Accumulation
Time (sec)
Identify the time that is required for the mass spectrometer to acquire one
TOF MS/MS spectrum. A starting value of 0.01 is recommended.
Declustering
potential (V)
Identify the voltage to be applied at the orifice to minimize the formation
of ion clusters. In MRMHR algorithm experiments, declustering potential is
identified for each row in the transition table.

(V)
Identify the voltage to be applied in the collision cell. In TOF MS/MS and
MRMHR experiments, this voltage breaks the precursor ions into fragments.
Optimize collision energy (CE) to maximize the intensity of a fragment.
CE Spread (V) Identify the CE spread (CES). Together with the Collision energy (V)
parameter, this parameter controls the CE that is applied to the precursor
ion in a Product Ion scan. The CE is increased gradually from a low value
(CE – CES in positive polarity) to a high value (CE + CES in positive
polarity).

Table 1-4 AE Method Parameters (continued)
Parameter Description
Fluid Class Select the sample matrix that is in the sample well. Different options are
available for different plate types. Options include the following:
• AQ (Aqueous): Used for aqueous solutions.
• SP (Surfactant Phase): Used for solutions with a low surface tension,
such as aqueous solutions with surfactants, for example Triton X-100,
or organic-aqueous mixtures. This option is only available for 384-well
plates. This option cannot be used with 1536-well plates because of the
sample evaporation that occurs during analysis.
• DMSO (Dimethyl sulfoxide): Used for solvents that contain between 70%
and 100% DMSO.
Peak Type Select Standard or Wide mode.
• Standard: The AE system ejects droplets very quickly to make a narrow
peak.
• Wide: The user can identify the rate of droplet ejection to make peaks
that are wider than in standard mode. Wider peaks supply more data
points across the peak and support longer cycle times in the MS method.
Wide peak mode is applicable to multidroplet ejections only.
Ejection Vol (nL) Identify the total volume of the sample to be dispensed by the Echo® MS+
system, in increments of 2.5 nL.
Note: The system ejects droplets of 2.5 nL.
When the Peak Type is Wide, the minimum value for Ejection Vol (nL) is
5.
Interval (ms) Identify the time between sample ejections. The software uses the Rep
Rate (Hz) and Ejection Vol (nL) to calculate a minimum Interval (ms).
Rep Rate (Hz) Identify the droplet ejection repeat (rep) rate, in Hz. Ejection Vol (nL) and
Rep Rate (Hz) control the widths of the peaks.

System Preparation
For MRMHR algorithm and information-dependent acquisition (IDA) experiments where different
ions are monitored for different wells, to make sure that the correct ions are monitored for each
well, the software requires the time between droplet ejection and detection (transfer time). The
transfer time is calculated and saved every time data splitting occurs.
If the system has not operated recently, or if the electrode or carrier solvent has been changed,
then the system runs a short batch to calculate the transfer time. Before the batch to calibrate
the transfer time is run, make sure that the time for system equilibration has been a minimum of
30 minutes.

Target Lists 2
Usually, a batch used with the Echo® MS+ system acquires one analyte or set of analytes for
all of the samples. If a different target analyte must be specified for each row, column, or well
position, in MRMHR algorithm workflows, for example, then a target list must be used. For TOF
MS data, the target list identifies the analytes of interest for each well, and this information is
used during processing of the data. A target list can also be used to identify the analytes of
interest in MRMHR algorithm and IDA experiments during acquisition. The analyte information in
the target list is used to update the MS method during acquisition.
The target list is a csv file. The file contains analyte information that can be used in the following
areas:
• For the analyte information for mass reconstruction of intact proteins and large biomolecules
• In the inclusion list for IDA experiments
To use a target list, do these procedures:
• Create a Target List
• Configure Project Default Settings
• Create an MS Method to Use As a Template
• Create a Processing Method to Be Used as a Template
Create a Target List
Each row of a target list file contains mass information for a single well and compound. Multiple
rows can contain the same compound. Multiple rows can contain the same well position.
Note: Example target lists for different workflows are available in the SCIEX OS
Data\common-project-area\Echo MS\Example Target List folder.
• Create a target list file in csv format, and then save it in the Batch subfolder of the folder for
the project where it will be used.
Note: The target list file can use commas or periods as the decimal separators. The Results
file created during automatic processing uses periods as the decimal separators.
Note: Make sure that the text, capitalization, and spacing in the field names are the same as
in the following table.

For example, in positive polarity, the CE is increased gradually from
CE – CES to CE + CES.
The applicable range is from 0 to 150.
Fragmentation
Mode
Identify one of the following fragmentation modes:
• CID: In collisional-induced dissociation (CID) mode, fragment ions
are made by vibrational excitation of the precursor ion caused by
collisions with gas molecules in the Q2 collision cell.
• EAD: In electron-activated dissociation (EAD) mode, the precursor
ions in the EAD cell are exposed to electrons to cause dissociation of
the precursor ion to fragment ions.
• EAD (conventional trapping): Conventional trapping is an EAD
mode that is most applicable for academic studies of reaction
kinetics. EAD mode supplies more control of the load time and
reaction time (electron irradiation duration) steps. In EAD mode,
these steps are optimized to occur at the same time, which increases
the sensitivity approximately two times. In EAD (conventional
trapping) mode, these steps are done consecutively. Selected
precursors are introduced in the EAD cell for a specified load time,
the electron beam is applied for a specified reaction time, and then
products are ejected from the EAD cell.
Tip! If accurate and predictable control of the reaction time is
required, then use EAD (conventional trapping) mode.
Electron KE
(eV)
Identify the electron kinetic energy (KE) of the irradiating electron beam.
The electron KE is the same as the DC bias between the electron
source and the electron-activated (EA) rod electrodes in the electron-
activated dissociation (EAD) cell. This parameter is applicable when
Fragmentation Mode is set to EAD or EAD (conventional trapping).

Field Description
ETC (%) Identify the electron transfer coefficient (ETC). This parameter controls
the fraction of electrons let into the EAD cell. The range is from 0% to
100%. The parameter is applicable when Fragmentation Mode is set to
EAD or EAD (conventional trapping).
Tip! To use the type of precursor species that is analyzed and the
product ions that are acquired to control the type of EAD reaction, use
this parameter.
EAD RF (Da) Identify a value between 0 Da and 300 Da. This parameter controls the
RF level to keep precursor and fragment ions in the EAD cell.
Note: To detect product ions with a higher m/z, increase EAD RF (Da).
The detection of product ions with a lower m/z might decrease.
Reaction time
(ms)
Identify the reaction time for electron irradiation. In EAD mode, this
parameter also controls the load time.
Tip! If precursor consumption is not sufficient after optimization of the
electron beam current, then increase the reaction time.
Time Bins to
Sum
Identify the number of data points to be added together. The range for
small molecules or peptides is 4 to 6. The start value for intact protein
analysis (> 20 kDa) is 40.
Channel 1 to
Channel 4
Identify the analog-to-digital converter (ADC) channels. Each channel
counts ions. If all four of the channels are selected, which is the default
value, then all four of the channels are added together for the total ion
count.

Configure Project Default Settings
During automatic processing, the software gets the processing method parameters, for example,
XIC width (Da), Gaussian Smooth Width (points), and Noise % for Baseline (%), from the
default settings for the project. If a processing method will be used as a template for automatic
processing, then configure the project default settings to optimize peak integration over the full
analysis. Different ejection volumes and peak widths in the AE method require different values
for the processing parameters.
The information in the project default settings is saved in the processing method to be used as a
template.
Note: When the project default settings are changed in the Analytics workspace, the changes
are not used for saved processing methods. To apply the changes, update the project default
settings, and then create a new processing method. The new processing method will use the
updated project default settings. Use this new processing method for automatic processing.
1. In the Analytics workspace, click Projects > Project default settings.
