 · The blade is sharp! Be careful when handling the PIXL blade. Always 
follow the instructions on page 45 when changing blades.  
 · Hand feed the PickupLine™ carefully. When feeding a PickupLine™ 
into the machine, if you feel resistance, pull back slightly and re-feed. 
Forcing the PickupLine™ through will cause damage to the machine.  
 · Remove lids when placing plates into the PIXL. Lids need to be 
manually removed. Failure to do so will cause damage to the picking 
arm. 
 · The nozzle is hot! Be careful when removing the nozzle as it can get 
quite hot. 
 · The feed button is disabled. The feed button is disabled on all PIXL 
machines. The retract button is fully functional during the change 
PickupLine maintenance routine.  
 · Light curtain. The light curtain PIXL is sold without a door to allow 
access for robotic arms and 3rd party integrations. The light curtain 
is a safety feature that will stop any potentially dangerous moving 
components if the beam is broken. UV sterilisation is disabled on 
Light curtain PIXLs as there is no physical barrier between the UV 
bulbs and the user. Do not attempt to tamper with or override the 
light curtain sensors. Please report any faults with the light curtain, 
or any of the safety mechanisms immediately to your technical 
support team. 
 · Do not use >2% agar when using agar piercing. Agar piercing allows 
the PickupLine tip to pierce the surface of the agar. Using >2% will 
reduce effectiveness of this feature.

PIXL LIGHT CURTAIN 
FEATURES 
  
There are several things to note when using the Light Curtain PIXL. Let’s 
take a look!
18
OBSTRUCTION WARNING
A REMOVE OBSTRUCTIONS warning will 
appear in certain situations:
• On initialise, if the PIXL detects there is 
something breaking the light curtain beam.
• When loading plates and the PIXL detects 
there is something breaking the light 
curtain beam.
If this warning appears, the user will be unable 
to continue until the obstruction is removed.
LIGHT CURTAIN PIXL FEATURES
UV STERILISATION
With the door removed, UV light can easily 
escape therefore for safety, UV Sterilisation 
has been disabled.

PICKING TO 
MALDI-TOF SLIDES
To pick to a MALDI-TOF target in the PIXL, click Run Workflows then select 
Random Colony Picking. Setup the project and follow Steps 1 - 11 as per 
the Random Colony Picking workflow instructions on page 17.
From PIXL 107 (Serial No: 000001058) onwards the PIXL baseplate has 
been upgraded to support Bruker MALDI-TOF targets. The blue target bay 
(Position 2) can be swapped out for an adapter, which will allow you to pin 
to Bruker MBT 96 and Bruker MTP 384 targets. Which can then be used 
as part of a downstream MALDI-TOF workflow.
To check if your PIXL is compatible, look at the blue target bay (Position 2). 
There will be 4 ball ball bearings in the place of the fixed target bay. This 
allows us to mount the removable adapters.

TROUBLESHOOTING
PROBLEM 
Plate guides could not be detected 
 
The PickupLine™ hits the top plate as the picking 
arm moves between positions 
 
 
 
The PIXL is missing colonies. 
 
 
 
Blades wear down quickly.
SOLUTION 
Ensure that a source plate holder is installed into the PIXL. 
 
Ensure that the plate dimensions in the software match that 
of the plate being used. If the plate type is unsupported please 
contact technicalsupport@singerinstruments.com and we’ll 
make a new dimensions file for the plate. 
 
Ensure that the nozzle has been calibrated by running the 
‘Calibrate Nozzle’ routine in the software. Ensure that the Detect 
automatically’ option is selected for ‘Agar Depth’. 
Please correctly follow instructions for changing the blade on 
page 45.

CREATING A RE-ARRAY FILE
THE BASICS 
So, you’re looking to get stuck into re-arraying - awesome. 
 
Re-Array mode allows you to pick colonies from a source plate and place (or pin) them onto a target plate, in a 
completely customisable pattern. You can use several different plate types and either traditional well loccations or 
exact coordinates.  
 
What this really means is, you can pick from anywhere to anywhere, in almost any plate type - how cool! 
 
So, what do we need to get started?
 · A program that can export .tsv (or .csv) files; Excel and Google Sheets both work. (This is where we’ll create the file)
 · Which plates you want to pick from, and to. (The Source and Target)
 · An idea of the locations we’re pinning from and to
Got all this? Awesome.
A FULL BREAKDOWN
Step 1: Define The Plates 
Let’s start with a basic example. You have colonies in a 96 Multi Well Plate and you’d like to pin them to a SBS Plate. 
To begin, we need to define the plates. In a blank spreadsheet, starting in cell A1 lay out the plate name, type, density 
and role as in the diagram below.
We have used arbitrary  plate names above. If you place a ‘$’ prior to the name the plate will be given a unique 
ID. This name is only used within the exported data logs, so you can use anything. For simplicity, consider using 
‘$SourcePlate1’ and ‘$TargetPlate1’ for ease of file creation, and PIXL will assign unique names for the export logs. 
PIXL will decide which plates should go where, typically the ‘Source’ plate will go to the source bay, and the first 
target plate will go into bay 1. This is necessary as some plates are required to be in specific bays, and user defined 
plate locations will limit the flexibility of re-arraying. PIXL will produce instructions on where to load plates, based on 
the Plate Name. 
Note: if you’re using ‘$TargetPlate1’ or similar, the plate names will already be automatically generated and will not match the original 
input. 
 
PLATE DIMENSIONS (OPTIONAL)  
You can specify dimensions after the plate role, however, this is not needed - PIXL will run based on the standard 
stored dimensions for each plate type. If you have a custom dimension file or need to use one of the preset options 
then you can specify this in the file.

CREATING A RE-ARRAY FILE
Step 2: Define The Pinning Locations 
Now we’ve completely defined our plates, the second step is to define the pinning locations, this can be done in two 
ways: 
Method 1. Using grid (well) references, e.g. A1, B3, H7 etc.
For this method it’s important to note that the locations are written Y,X as is normal on a 96 well plate, and not a 
standard graph. The letters of the Y location can also be replaced with numbers, e.g. 1,1 / 2,3 / 8,7, etc.

H,1 H,2 H,3 H,4 H,5 H,6 H,7 H,8 H,9 H,12H,11H,10
Y
X
Method 2. Using Cartesian co-ordinates, e.g. -34.0,22.5 etc. 
This is a more complex, but precise method of telling PIXL exactly where to pick. When using cartesian co-ordinates 
the centre of the plate is 0.0,0.0 as shown below. This is measured in mm. You’ll need to generate coordinates for 
your colonies, which you can get from PIXL outputs, or potentially other plate analysis software. You can also see the 
aproximate location coordinates of the four corner wells on a 96 well plate.
Available plate types will appear on a drop-down menu in the Target selection screen during Random Colony Picking, 
in this example we are using the Corning Costar Assay Plate.
Make sure the plate name is noted exactly as it is written, add this to the empty cell to the right of the plate you want 
to define.

A,1 A,12
H,1 H,12
-41.5,-59.0 -41.5,59.0
41.5,-59.0 41.5,59.0
When using coordinates, you must have the plate density set to ‘None’ and in each coordinate you must use a decimal 
point; ‘0.0,0.0’ is valid, however ‘0,0’ is not and PIXL will interpret this as a plate location as seen in Method 1. This will 
lead to an error in the file.
WRITING A PINNING COMMAND
We’re now ready to combine everything above into a command, continuing from the earlier example (where we set our 
source plate as a 96 MWP, and our target as an SBS agar plate with a density 96). We’re going to pin from well A1 to 
the first 4 positions A1-A4.
SourcePlate1 A 1 TargetPlate1 A 1
SourcePlate1 A 1 TargetPlate1 A 2
SourcePlate1 A 1 TargetPlate1 A 3
SourcePlate1 A 1 TargetPlate1 A 4
Source Plate Target Plate
Plate Name XY Plate Name XY
*
*Line Break
LINE BREAKS 
Finally, a line break will define when the PickupLine is cleaved. This is the point where a line finishes and the next one 
starts. This allows you to control the exact function before cleaving, offering multiple picks. In the example above The 
PickUpLine is cleaved after the target plate is pinned at location A,1.
Step 3: Combining The File & Export 
We’ve now defined our plate types and desired picking locations, let’s combine Step 1 & 2 into the final file. Your 
spreadsheet should look like the example below.
SourcePlate1 MWP 96 Source
TargetPlate1 SBS 96 Target
SourcePlate1 A 1 TargetPlate1 A 1
SourcePlate1 A 1 TargetPlate1 A 2
SourcePlate1 A 1 TargetPlate1 A 3
SourcePlate1 A 1 TargetPlate1 A 4

CREATING A RE-ARRAY FILE
Step 4: Loading onto PIXL 
Now the file is finished and exported as either a CSV or TSV file, save that to a USB stick and upload this onto PIXL. 
Run the Re-array program and select your file - PIXL will quickly scan the file to make sure there are no errors, it 
will either show a green tick or a red cross and explain where the errors are. Depending on the file type you’ve used, 
you may need to alter the settings, click on ‘Edit’ and ‘File’, make sure the drop down boxes are correct for your file 
delimiter, terminator and decimal.
Any errors in the file will appear here.
The Delimiter, Terminator 
and Decimal can be 
adjusted here.
Note: A Re-Array Template is exported for all random colony picking projects.  
This can be found in the PIXL tracking directory: 
C:\Users\(user name)\AppData\Roaming\Singer Instrument Company Limited\PIXL\Tracking 
Simply open the required project folder for the rearray template. 
Put in the plates, and... done; PIXL Master 2.0!  
Please contact us if you’re having any issues or need help. For more examples of PIXL re-array files, check out our
