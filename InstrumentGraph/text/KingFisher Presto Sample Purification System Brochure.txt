KingFisher Presto   
Sample Purification System
Automating the extraction of DNA, RNA and proteins 

KingFisher technology  
Rather than moving the liquids, the 
magnetic particles are moved from 
plate to plate containing specific 
reagents. Magnetic particles are 
transferred with the aid of magnetic 
rods covered with a disposable, 
specially designed plastic tip comb.
Enhanced with specially designed 
consumables  
The KingFisher Presto may be used  
with 24- or 96-head magnets, 
depending on the volume and 
throughput requirements. It works best 
with specially designed polypropylene 
KingFisher plates and tip combs, 
which are suitable for many biological 
applications due their low binding 
characteristics. The plates are stackable 
and are designed so that a robotic 
arm can easily pick up and move 
one plate and tip comb set at a time. 
Sterile versions are available for those 
applications requiring absolute purity. 
When used together, these proprietary 
magnetic heads and consumables 
help to optimize the performance of 
KingFisher systems.

How KingFisher Technology Works
Thermo Scientific
™
 BindIt
™
 
software for protocol development 
All KingFisher systems come with  
the flexible, dedicated BindIt software, 
which allows users to create and 
modify their protocols. Protocols for 
Invitrogen
™
 and Applied Biosystems
™
 
nucleic acid and protein purification 
kits can be easily downloaded from 
thermofisher.com. The flexibility of 
BindIt software allows users to optimize 
their protocols before transferring them 
into the instrument’s memory to run in 
an automated environment.
On-board user interface for 
convenient maintenance  
The small interface screen built  
into the instrument allows users  
to perform maintenance actions,  
like changing the magnetic head  
or releasing the tip comb, making  
it fast and easy to set up a run.
Optimized for Automation
The Thermo Scientific
™
 KingFisher
™
 Presto sample purification instrument is 
optimized to be part of an automated system using a liquid handler with a 
gripper or robot arm to load plates, or to integrate with other instruments, 
such as plate sealers or PCR instrumentation. The instrument utilizes proven 
KingFisher magnetic particle-based technology to provide high-quality 
yields of target nucleic acids and proteins for biopharma, biotech and 
research projects in high throughput laboratories. Its small footprint is ideal 
for automation and helps you save space in the lab, while still offering high 
purification capacity and proven performance. The KingFisher Presto system  
is a reliable and robust tool for nucleic acid or protein purification .
Fit for an automated system  
The KingFisher Presto is designed exclusively for an automated system. 
Due to its small size, the KingFisher Presto can be placed either on the  
deck of an automated liquid handling instrument or on the side. The design  
also allows users to configure several KingFisher Presto units side by side, 
next to a liquid handler, minimizing the space required. The instrument can be 
hooked into the automated system using USB, RS232 or LAN connection, and 
will run the desired purification protocols from its internal software.

Key features  
•  Easy connection to several liquid 
handling instruments
•  Minimized size of turntable for easy  
fitting into the automation systems
•  Purify 96 or 24 samples at a time, 
depending on sample volume  
Increased efficiency  
The KingFisher Presto has a turntable with two plate positions—one processing position under a magnetic head and 
another position where new plates are loaded in intervals. Two interchangeable magnetic heads are available—one for  
24 deep-well plates, and one for 96 deep-well (DW) and standard KF 96 plates.
•  Volume range of 50–5000 µl  
(depending on the magnetic head) 
for up/down scaling of the application
•  Two magnetic head options  
offering flexibility in sample and  
reagent volumes
•  Flexible system for wide variety  
of applications, throughput and 
reagent needs

New plate is automatically moved into 
loading position for further processing, 
which ensures seamless purification 
without any delay between steps and 
use any number of plates.
