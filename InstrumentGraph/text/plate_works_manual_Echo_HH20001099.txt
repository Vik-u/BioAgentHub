3 Cherry Picking 
For cherry picking plate::works™ accepts csv-files containing all hits of all source plates 
for one assay run. 
 
The picking list has the following format: 
SourceBC, SourceWell, DestBC, Vol1, DestWell1, Vol2, DestWell2, … 
SourceBC  Barcode of the source plate. 
SourceWell  Well to pick on the source plate. 
DestBC  Barcode of the destination plate. If this column i s empty, plate::works™  
will dispense into the destination plate currently on the deck without 
checking the barcode. 
Vol1  First dispense volume. 
DestWell1  Well to dispense on the destination plate. If this  column is empty, 
plate::works™ will fill the destination plate accor ding to the properties 
Dispensing_area of the Pick function. 
Volx  Additional volume for multiple dispense from one p ick (optional). 
DestWellx  Well on destination plate for multiple dispense (o ptional).

If there are values for the destination wells in th e picking list, the settings for the dispens- 
ing area, the dispensing direction and the fill direction will be ignored. 
After every Pick function the plate::works™ driver for Echo™ gives a feedback if the 
source plate, the destination plate or both plates must be exchanged. To interprete this 
feedback there must be the programming element Repe at in the method after the Pick 
function.
