Efficient and reliable plate sealing with the ALPS5000 
Automated Plate Heat Sealer
Technical note | ALPS5000 Automated Plate Heat Sealer
Introduction
Sealing microplates with removable seals is a common practice 
in laboratory workflows for genomics, proteomics, molecular 
diagnostics, drugs of abuse testing, drug discovery, and 
biobanking. Even though plate sealing is routine in so many 
laboratories, it does not receive much attention, because of its 
simplicity and the minimal skill required to perform the process. 
However, improper sealing can lead to sample loss, inaccurate 
results, and other problems that are time-consuming and 
expensive to fix.
The Thermo Scientific ™   ALPS5000 Automated Plate Heat 
Sealer (Cat. No. AB-5000) enables rapid sealing and process 
customization with saved protocols, and it can have immense 
value for your research. The user-friendly touchscreen makes it 
easy to adjust and optimize sealing temperature, force, distance, 
and time. Users can store up to 16 settings to seal plates ranging 
from 8 mm to 46 mm in height without adapters, making the 
plate sealing process fast and straightforward. The ALPS5000 
Automated Plate Heat Sealer is easy to set up and maintain, 
and it has a compact footprint that can help you conserve 
valuable laboratory bench space. The ALPS5000 plate sealer 
does not require an external vacuum, air source, or peristaltic 
pump, making it quieter to operate than a pneumatically 
driven sealing system.
The ALPS5000 Automated Plate Heat Sealer is compatible 
with polystyrene, polypropylene, and polyethylene microplates, 
and it can be used to seal the same plate up to five times. The 
ALPS5000 plate sealer is also compatible with Thermo Scientific ™ 
heat seals for various applications, including:
• Diamond Clear Seal polymer roll  for fluorescence and 
colorimetric applications, qPCR, and ELISAs
• ThermoSeal foil laminate  for sample transport and 
high-temperature applications like PCR
• Easy Pierce foil for compound management, 
high-throughput screening applications, and RT-qPCR
• Easy-Peel foil laminate for long-term storage at 
temperatures ranging from –120°C to +90°C
We conducted a series of experiments to optimize the sealing 
process and then evaluate the reliability of the ALPS5000 
Automated Plate Sealer using Thermo Scientific ™ KingFisher ™ 
96 Deep-Well Plates.
Materials and methods
Sealing optimization
The purpose of optimization is to identify the minimal force 
required to ensure successful sealing. We optimized sealing force 
by applying seals to KingFisher 96 Deep-Well Plates starting with 
24 kg. Then, based on the sealing performance, we increased 
the force to 35 kg, and finally to 45 kg of force at 170°C (±2°C) for 
3 sec. After each force adjustment, the sealed plates were placed 
upside down in a vacuum chamber under reduced pressure 
(15 in. Hg, 0.5 atm) for 30 s and inspected for leaks. Although 
seals applied with 24 kg of force passed the vacuum test, slight 
dimpling was observed near the top left corners of the seals 
(Table 1). To confirm the dimpling was the result of the sealing 
process and not the plate, the plate was rotated 180 degrees and 
resealed. When the dimpling occurred again in the same upper 
left corner, it confirmed the dimpling was the result of needing 
to further optimize the sealing parameter by increasing the force 
used. No wrinkles or dimples were observed after sealing with 
45 kg of force, so we proceeded by sealing plates with 45 kg of 
force at 170°C for 3 s each.
Preparation of KingFisher 96 Deep-Well Plates 
for shipment
A total of 2,280 KingFisher 96 Deep-Well Plates from different 
lots that had been molded with 17 different injection molds 
were sealed using the ALPS5000 Automated Plate Heat 
Sealer for subsequent testing. Wells in alternating rows of 
the plates were filled with 1 mL each of an aqueous dye 
solution using the Thermo Scientific ™   Multidrop ™   Combi 
Reagent Dispenser (Cat. No. 5840300) . The plates were 
sealed with Thermo Scientifi c™   Easy-Peel foil laminate 
(Cat. No. AB-3739) , inverted on absorbent paper, and inspected 
for leaks (Figure 1). After passing the leak inspection, the sealed 
plates were stacked in two layers per box. The layers were 
separated with packaging material to prevent damage to the 
plates and seals during shipment. The boxes were then shipped 
via ground from Tempe, AZ to the Westpak package testing 
facility in San Diego, CA. As many as 120 plates per day were 
filled, sealed, and shipped to the Westpak facility for testing.

Low-pressure testing
Westpak is an independent, ISO/IEC 17025–certified testing facility 
with International Safe Transit Association (ISTA) accreditation. 
After an initial inspection, Westpak conducted low-pressure hazard 
testing by subjecting the plates to simulated high-altitude shipping 
conditions according to ASTM D6653-13. The test was performed 
to determine whether the seals would remain intact throughout 
shipment under standard air freight conditions. Each of the 2,280 
sealed plates was placed upside down in a vacuum chamber 
(Figure 2), then subjected to the conditions outlined in Table 2. The 
temperature of the chamber was not controlled during the test. 
After the test, the seals and plates were visually inspected for any 
signs of leakage between wells or external leakage.

Results
A visual inspection after testing found that seals on only six of 
the plates, or less than 0.3%, leaked. Three of the leaks were 
attributed to wrinkling observed on the seals prior to optimizing 
the sealing parameters. This was rectified by increasing the 
sealing force from 24 kg to 45 kg.
The other leaks were attributed to slight variations in plate wall 
thickness. Thinner walls may not have provided enough surface 
area to form tight seals, resulting in leakage. We encountered 
very few mechanical errors over the five-month period in which 
the 2,280 KingFisher plates were sealed using the ALPS5000 
plate sealer. The issues were easily rectified and did not 
significantly delay the sealing process.
Conclusions
In this study, the ALPS5000 Automated Plate Heat Sealer 
consistently applied tight seals to KingFisher 96 Deep-Well 
Plates. Optimizing the sealing parameters is a critical and 
required initial step that enables consistent results, as evidenced 
by the sealed plates having less than a 0.3% chance of seal 
failure when subjected to the ISTA high-altitude testing conditions 
post-optimization. With the ALPS5000 Automated Plate Heat 
Sealer, a laboratory can:
• Minimize sample loss due to evaporation
• Prevent sample contamination
• Confidently store samples for long- or short-term use
• Safely ship liquid-filled plates
• Reduce variation between experimental replicates
The ALPS5000 Automated Plate Heat Sealer is compatible with 
a wide range of microplates, including Thermo Scientific ™ Nunc™ 
DeepWell™ plates, Nunc™ MicroWell™ plates, KingFisher plates, 
Abgene™ deep-well plates, Abgene ™ microplates, and many 
more, making it a must-have for routine laboratory protocols that 
require increased productivity and reliability.
