IMPORTANT COVID-19 
INSTALLATION NOTICE
Due to current travel restrictions we’re unable to perform on-site 
installation. But never fear! To get you up and running as quickly as 
possible we have instead included detailed instruction on how to self-
install the PIXL (see page 14). We ask that you contact our Tech Support 
Team to let them know when you’re planning to perform the self-
installation so they can be on hand should you require any assistance:  
technicalsupport@singerinstruments.com
Once the installation is complete, please fill-in the online Self-
Installation Form: http://bit.ly/Selfinstallation 
You will be asked to create an account before you start. You can also use 
this form to report any issues encountered during installation.
NOTE: Completion of this form will activate the start of your warranty 
period. Failure to complete the form may affect the support we are able 
to offer during the warranty period.
Thanks for being awesome!

 · The blade is sharp! Be careful when handling the PIXL blade. Always 
follow the instructions on page 41 when changing blades.  
 · Hand feed the PickupLine™ carefully. When feeding a PickupLine™ 
into the machine, if you feel resistance, pull back slightly and re-feed. 
Forcing the PickupLine™ through will cause damage to the machine.  
 · Remove lids when placing plates into the PIXL. Lids need to be 
manually removed. Failure to do so will cause damage to the picking 
arm. 
 · The nozzle is hot! Be careful when removing the nozzle as it can get 
quite hot. 
 · The feed button is disabled. The feed button is disabled on all PIXL 
machines. The retract button is fully functional during the change 
PickupLine maintenance routine.  
 · Door interlock. For safety reasons PIXL is sold with an interlocking 
door guard, which acts as: a physical barrier to potentially dangerous 
moving components; UV protection when the product is running 
its sterilisation protocol; and contains a sensor ensuring that the 
motors and UV bulb are disabled when the door is open. Do not 
attempt to tamper with or override this sensor. If the door is removed 
then a Risk Assessment is recommended to mitigate the above 
factors within any third party integrations or enclosures. Singer 
Instruments will not be liable for any accidents or damage caused by 
the removal of the door, or other user negligence. Please report any 
faults with this sensor, or any of the safety mechanisms immediately 
to your technical support team.

BEST PRACTICE 
  
We want you to have a trouble-free time with your PIXL so we’ve 
assembled some handy hints, tips and troubleshooting answers to keep 
you on the straight and narrow.
48
PLATES
SOURCE PLATES  
The PIXL accepts the following source plate formats: 
 · 90 mm Petri Dishes 
 · 150 mm Petri Dishes
 · 120 mm Square Petri Dishes
 · Rectangular PlusPlates™ 
 
TARGET PLATES  
The PIXL accepts the following target plate formats: 
 · 96 Multiwell
 · 384 Multiwell
 · 96 Deep Well
 · 384 Deep Well 
 
LOADING PLATES  
When loading your source plate, ensure that you have 
the correct source bay installed. 
 
Source bays fit magnetically, simply lift the current 
source bay out and replace it with the correct source 
bay for your plate type, as shown in Figure 1.  
 
Each target bay is colour-coded and numbered. The 
software will show you which bays to load your plates 
into. A1 is in the top left corner of each bay, Figure 2. 
 
NOTE: Remove lids before loading plates into PIXL.
 
 
PLATE DIMENSIONS
All source and target plate types have default 
dimensions in the PIXL software. You can view these 
when on the Source and Target Stages, in the Edit Menu, 
under the Dimensions Tab, as shown in Figure 3. 
 
If the plates you plan to use are drastically different 
from the default dimensions, please contact technical 
support and we’ll add your specific plate type to the 
drop down list:
technicalsupport@singerinstruments.com
 · 96 Well PCR
 · 384 Well PCR
 · Rectangular PlusPlates™

FILTERS & BLACKOUT SCREEN
USING FILTERS 
PIXL accepts standard 50mm filters. You can easily 
switch between all of your favourite lighting conditions 
to filter for the markers that interest you. 
 
Insert your filters at the locate stage while you have 
the live preview image on screen, Figure 4.  
 
The filters are manually inserted in front of the CMOS 
camera, into the Filter Tray, as shown in Figure 5. 
 
 
USING THE BLACKOUT SCREEN  
Natural light passing through the PIXL door can 
interfere with some florescence imaging, when using 
certain LED wavelengths. In those circumstances 
the blackout screen can be inserted to prevent light 
interference.  
 
To install the blackout screen, simply slide it into the 
grooves on the inside of the main door. Make sure the 
handle slot aligns with the door handle, as shown in 
Figure 6.  
 
Remember to remove the screen when you load the 
target plates to be able to see the pinning routine in 
action. 
Figure 4

50
CLEANING
WASTE CHUTE 
The waste chute comes into contact with used 
PickupLine™. Use a bottle cleaner, with ethanol or 
an appropriate cleaning agent, to clean the chute, as 
shown in Figure 7. 
To gain access to the waste chute, you will need to 
remove the cleaver assembly. For full instructions 
see page 43. 
 
 
DUMP DRAWER 
The dump drawer collects all of the used tips at the 
bottom of the waste chute Figure 8. 
 
The dump drawer can also be autoclaved. 
 
 
KINEMATIC NOZZLE 
To help ensure sterility, the kinematic nozzle is 
autoclavable. Spare nozzles are also available to 
reduce downtime during autoclaving.  
 
 
UV 
The UV lamp program is located on the home screen 
Figure 9. The UV lamp can be set to run for up to 60 
minutes to sterilise the main cabinet Figure 10. For 
complete sterility, we recommend each day giving the 
inside of the machine a wipe down with ethanol and 
running a small UV routine.

TROUBLESHOOTING
PROBLEM 
Plate guides could not be detected 
 
The PickupLine™ hits the top plate as the picking 
arm moves between positions 
 
 
 
The PIXL is missing colonies. 
 
 
 
Blades wear quickly.
SOLUTION 
Ensure that a source plate holder is installed into the PIXL. 
 
Ensure that the plate dimensions in the software match that 
of the plate being used. If the plate type is unsupported please 
contact technicalsupport@singerinstruments.com and we’ll 
make a new dimensions file for the plate. 
 
Ensure that the nozzle has been calibrated by running the 
‘Calibrate Nozzle’ routine in the software. Ensure that the Detect 
automatically’ option is selected for ‘Agar Depth’. 
 
Please correctly follow instructions for changing the blade on 
page 39.

CREATING A RE-ARRAY FILE
INTRODUCTION 
So, you’re looking to get stuck into re-arraying - awesome. If you’re unsure, re-arraying for this
purpose, is picking colonies from user defined locations and placing them at user defined positions.
This is completely customisable, and can use several plate types and either exact coordinates, or
traditional well locations.
What this really means is, you can pick from anywhere to anywhere, in almost any plate type - how cool!
So, what do we need to get started? 
 · A program that can export .tsv (or .csv) files; Excel and Google Sheets both work.
 · Which plates you want to pick from, and to.
 · An idea of where we’re pinning from, and to.
Got all this? Awesome.
CREATING YOUR FILES
Using a program like Excel, or Google Sheets, we firstly need to define the plates to pick from and
to. This should be similar to the example below: 
 
Plate_Name Plate_Type Density Role
SourcePlate1 MWP 96 Source
TargetPlate1 SBS 96 Target
 
NOTE: A re-array template is exported for all Random Colony Picking Projects.
PLATE NAMES 
This is an arbitrary name that you can give to each plate, or by placing a ‘$’ prior to the name the plate will be given  
a unique ID. This name is only used within the exported data logs, so you can use anything.  
For simplicity, consider using ‘$SourcePlate1’ and ‘$TargetPlate1’ for ease of file creation, and PIXL will assign unique 
names for the export logs.  
PIXL will decide which plates should go where, typically the ‘Source’ plate will go to the source bay, and the first 
target plate will go into bay 1. This is necessary as some plates are required to be in specific bays, and user defined 
plate locations will limit the flexibility of re-arraying. PIXL will produce instructions on where to load plates, based on 
the Plate Name.  
Note: if you’re using ‘$TargetPlate1’ or similar, the plate names will already be automatically generated and will not match 
the original input. 
 
PLATE TYPES 
There are a few options for plate types, you must state which type each plate is at the start of the file. Choose from the 
following: 
 · SBS - SBS plate filled with agar
 · MWP - Multi well plate
 · DWP - Deep well plate
 · PCR - PCR plate
 · P90 - 90mm petri dish
 · P150 - 150mm petri dish
In the example above, we’re picking from a Multi Well Plate (MWP) to an SBS agar plate.
 
PLATE DENSITY
Now we need to define the density of our plates, you can choose from the following options:
 · 96
 · 384
 · 1536
 · None - This is only used for coordinate picking, and must be the density for any 
petri dish.
59
singerinstruments.com
CREATING A RE-ARRAY FILE
PLATE ROLE
Lastly, we need to define the role of each plate, in the example above, we have ‘SourcePlate1’ set to 
‘Source’, and ‘TargetPlate1’ set to ‘Target’. 
PLATE DIMENSIONS (OPTIONAL)
You can specify dimensions after the plate role, however this is not needed - PIXL will run based 
off the standard stored dimensions for each plate type. If you need to add custom dimensions you 
should contact us for further help. 
 
Now we’ve completely defined our plates, all that’s left is the pinning locations, these can be defined
in two ways: 
 
1. Using grid (well) references, e.g. A1, B3, H7 etc. 
It’s important to highlight that the locations are Y,X as is normal on a 96 well plate, and not a standard graph. 
You can use either letters or numbers, PIXL will recognise either. Personally, I prefer to use letters as you’d find  
on a standard MWP. Check out the two tables below to understand this further:
 
Plate Locations for a 96 MWP
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12
A A,1 A,2 A,3 A,4 A,5 A,6 A,7 A,8 A,9 A,10 A,11 A,12
B B,1 B,2 B,3 B,4 B,5 B,6 B,7 B,8 B,9 B,10 B,11 B,12
C C,1 C,2 C,3 C,4 C,5 C,6 C,7 C,8 C,9 C,10 C,11 C,12
D D,1 D,2 D,3 D,4 D,5 D,6 D,7 D,8 D,9 D,10 D,11 D,12
E E,1 E,2 E,3 E,4 E,5 E,6 E,7 E,8 E,9 E,10 E,11 E,12
F F,1 F,2 F,3 F,4 F,5 F,6 F,7 F,8 F,9 F,10 F,11 F,12
G G,1 G,2 G,3 G,4 G,5 G,6 G,7 G,8 G,9 G,10 G,11 G,12
H H,1 H,2 H,3 H,4 H,5 H,6 H,7 H,8 H,9 H,10 H,11 H,12
Or using numbers only 
 
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12
1 1,1 1,2 1,3 1,4 1,5 1,6 1,7 1,8 1,9 1,10 1,11 1,12
2 2,1 2,2 2,3 2,4 2,5 2,6 2,7 2,8 2,9 2,10 2,11 2,12
3 3,1 3,2 3,3 3,4 3,5 3,6 3,7 3,8 3,9 3,10 3,11 3,12
4 4,1 4,2 4,3 4,4 4,5 4,6 4,7 4,8 4,9 4,10 4,11 4,12
5 5,1 5,2 5,3 5,4 5,5 5,6 5,7 5,8 5,9 5,10 5,11 5,12
6 6,1 6,2 6,3 6,4 6,5 6,6 6,7 6,8 6,9 6,10 6,11 6,12
7 7,1 7,2 7,3 7,4 7,5 7,6 7,7 7,8 7,9 7,10 7,11 7,12
8 8,1 8,2 8,3 8,4 8,5 8,6 8,7 8,8 8,9 8,10 8,11 8,12
 
The following work through and examples all use the alpha numeric layout rather than the numeric only 
layout. They are interchangeable and either can be used.
60
CREATING A RE-ARRAY FILE
2. Using exact coordinates, e.g. -34.0,22.5 etc.
This is more a more complex, but precise method of telling PIXL exactly where to pick.  
You’ll need to generate coordinates for your colonies, which you can get from PIXL outputs,  
or potentially other plate analysis software.
It’s really important to highlight that PIXL uses cardinal coordinates; where the center of the
plate is ‘0.0,0.0’. Check out the overview of an SBS format plate below to understand this
further:
-59.0 0.0 59.0
-41.5
A1 A12
0.0 0.0,0.0
H1 H12
41.5
This plate contains the outer limits of an SBS format plate, with approximate locations of the four corner wells 
found on a 96 MWP. A density of ‘None’ is also required if using a Petri dish, which will require coordinate 
locations for all picks.
When using coordinates, you must have the plate density set to ‘None’ and in each coordinate you must use  
a decimal point; ‘0.0,0.0’ is valid, however ‘0,0’ is not and PIXL will interpret this as a plate location from the  
96 MWP maps above - this will lead to an error in the file.
Finally, a line break will define when the PickupLine is cleaved. This allows you to control the exact function 
before cleaving, offering multiple picks.
 
PRODUCING A COMMAND
We’re now ready to combine everything above into a command, continuing from the earlier example
(where we set our source plate as a 96 MWP, and our target as an SBS agar plate with density 96).
We’re going to pin from well A1 to the first 4 positions A1-A4. 
The headings are shown for instruction only, and should not be included in the final files.

CREATING A RE-ARRAY FILE
COMBING THE FILE
We’ve now defined all of the required parameters, and input our desired picking locations, let’s combine these 
into the final file:
 
SourcePlate1 MWP 96 Source
TargetPlate1 SBS 96 Target
SourcePlate1 A 1 TargetPlate1 A 1
SourcePlate1 A 1 TargetPlate1 A 2
SourcePlate1 A 1 TargetPlate1 A 3
SourcePlate1 A 1 TargetPlate1 A 4
Export this as tab-separated values (.tsv) or comma-separated values (.csv), a .tsv file will look like this:
LOADING ONTO PIXL
Now the file is finished and exported as either a CSV or TSV file, save that to a USB stick and upload
this onto PIXL. Run the Re-array program and select your file - PIXL will quickly scan the file to make
sure there are no errors, it will either show a green tick, or a red cross and explain where the errors are. 
Depending on the file type you’ve used, you may need to alter the settings, click on ‘Edit’ and
‘File’, make sure the drop down boxes are correct for your file delimiter, terminator and decimal.
Change these as required. Check out the picture below to see where this is!
Put in the plates, and… done; PIXL Master 2.0!
There’s some more sample files below and some FAQs. Please contact us if you’re having any issues
or need help.
